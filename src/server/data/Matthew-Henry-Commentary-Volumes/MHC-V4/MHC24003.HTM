 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The foregoing chapter was wholly taken up with reproofs and 
 threatenings against the people of God, for their apostasies from him; 
 but in this chapter gracious invitations and encouragements are given 
 them to return and repent, notwithstanding the multitude and greatness 
 of their provocations, which are here specified, to magnify the mercy 
 of God, and to show that as sin abounded grace did much more abound. 
 Here, 

 I. It is further shown how bad they had been and how well they deserved
 to be quite abandoned, and yet how ready God was to receive them into 
 his favour upon their repentance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. The impenitence of Judah, and their persisting in sin, are
 aggravated from the judgments of God upon Israel, which they should
 have taken warning by, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:6-11">ver. 6-11</A>.

 III. Great encouragements are given to these backsliders to return and
 repent, and promises made of great mercy which God had in store for
 them, and which he would prepare them for by bringing them home to 
 himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:12-19">ver. 12-19</A>.

 IV. The charge renewed against them for their apostasy from God, and
 the invitation repeated to return and repent, to which are here added 
 the words that are put in their mouth, which they should make use of in 
 their return to God,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him,
 and become another man's, shall he return unto her again? shall
 not that land be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the
 harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 2  Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and see where thou
 hast not been lien with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as
 the Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land
 with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.
 &nbsp; 3  Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath
 been no latter rain; and thou hadst a whore's forehead, thou
 refusedst to be ashamed.
 &nbsp; 4  Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou
 <I>art</I> the guide of my youth?
 &nbsp; 5  Will he reserve <I>his anger</I> for ever? will he keep <I>it</I> to
 the end? Behold, thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou
 couldest.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These verses some make to belong to the sermon in the foregoing 
 chapter, and they open a door of hope to those who receive the 
 conviction of the reproofs we had there; God wounds that he may heal. 
 Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How basely this people had forsaken God and gone a whoring from him. 
 The charge runs very high here. 

 1. They had multiplied their idols and their idolatries. To have
 admitted one strange God among them would have been bad enough, but 
 they were insatiable in their lustings after false worships: <I>Thou 
 hast played the harlot with many lovers,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 She had become a common prostitute to idols; not a foolish deity was
 set up in all the neighbourhood but the Jews would have it quickly.
 Where was a high place in the country but they had had an idol in it?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Note, In repentance it is good to make sorrowful reflections upon the
 particular acts of sin we have been guilty of, and the several places 
 and companies where it has been committed, that we may give glory to 
 God and take shame to ourselves by a particular confession of it. 

 2. They had sought opportunity for their idolatries, and had sent
 about to enquire for new gods: <I>In the</I> high--<I>ways hast thou 
 sat for them,</I> as Tamar when she put on the disguise of <I>a 
 harlot</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+38:14">Gen. xxxviii. 14</A>),

 and as the <I>foolish woman,</I> that sits to <I>call passengers, who
 go right on their way,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+9:14,15">Prov. ix. 14, 15</A>.

 <I>As the Arabian in the wilderness</I>--the <I>Arabian huckster</I>
 (so some), that courts customers, or waits for the merchants to get a 
 good bargain and forestal the market--or the <I>Arabian thief</I> (so 
 others), that watches for his prey; so had they waited either to court 
 new gods to come among them (the newer the better, and the more fond 
 they were of them) or to court others to join with them in their 
 idolatries. They were not only sinners, but Satans, not only traitors 
 themselves, but tempters to others.

 3. They had grown very impudent in sin. They not only polluted
 themselves, but <I>their land, with their whoredoms and with their 
 wickedness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 for it was universal and unpunished, and so became a national sin. And 
 yet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 "<I>Thou hadst a whore's forehead,</I> a brazen face of thy own. 
 <I>Thou refusedst to be ashamed;</I> thou didst enough to shame thee 
 for ever, and yet wouldst not take shame to thyself." Blushing is the 
 colour of virtue, or at least a relic of it; but those that are past 
 shame (we say) are past hope. Those that have an adulterer's heart, if 
 they indulge that, will come at length to have a whore's forehead, void 
 of all shame and modesty. 

 4. They abounded in all manner of sin. They polluted the land not only 
 with <I>their whoredoms</I> (that is, their idolatries), but with 
 <I>their wickedness,</I> or malice

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 sins against the second table: for how can we think that those will be 
 true to their neighbour that are false to their God? "Nay 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),
 
 <I>thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou couldst,</I> and 
 wouldst have spoken and done worse if thou hadst known how; thy will 
 was to do it, but thou lackedst opportunity." Note, Those are wicked 
 indeed that sin to the utmost of their power, that never refuse to 
 comply with a temptation because they should not, but because they 
 cannot.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How gently God had corrected them for their sins. Instead of 
 raining fire and brimstone upon them, because, like Sodom, they had 
 <I>avowed their sin</I> and had gone after strange gods as Sodom after
 strange flesh, he only <I>withheld the showers from them,</I> and that 
 only one part of the year: <I>There has been no latter rain,</I> which 
 might serve as an intimation to them of their continual dependence upon 
 God; when they had the former rain, that was no security to them for 
 the latter, but they must still look up to God. But it had not this 
 effect.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. How justly God might have abandoned them utterly, and refused ever 
 to receive them again, though they should return; this would have been 
 but according to the known rule of divorces, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 <I>They say</I> (it is an adjudged case, nay, it is a case in which the
 law is very express, and it is what every body knows and speaks of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:4">Deut. xxiv. 4</A>),

 that if a woman be once put away for whoredom, and be joined to
 <I>another man,</I> her first husband shall never, upon any pretence 
 whatsoever, take her again to be his wife; such playing fast and loose 
 with the marriage-bond would be a horrid profanation of that ordinance 
 and would <I>greatly pollute that land.</I> Observe, What the law says 
 in this case--<I>They say,</I> that is, every one will say, and 
 subscribe to the equity of the law in it; for every man finds something 
 in himself that forbids him to entertain one that is <I>another 
 man's.</I> And in like manner they had reason to expect that God would 
 refuse ever to take them to be his people again, who had not only been 
 joined to one strange god, but had <I>played the harlot with many 
 lovers.</I> If we had to do with a man like ourselves, after such 
 provocations as we have been guilty of, he would be implacable, and we 
 might have despaired of his being reconciled to us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. How graciously he not only invites them, but directs them, to
 return to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He encourages them to hope that they shall find favour with him, 
 upon their repentance: "Thou thou hast been bad, <I>yet return again to 
 me,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 This implies a promise that he will receive them: "Return, and thou
 shalt be welcome." God has not tied himself by the laws which he made 
 for us, nor has he the peevish resentment that men have; he will be 
 more kind to Israel, for the sake of his covenant with them, than ever 
 any injured husband was to an adulterous wife; for in receiving 
 penitents, as much as in any thing, he is <I>God and not man.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He therefore kindly expects that they will repent and return to him, 
 and he directs them what to say to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me?</I> Wilt not <I>thou,</I> 
 who hast been in such relation to me, and on whom I have laid such 
 obligations, <I>wilt not thou cry to me?</I> Though thou hast gone a 
 whoring from me, yet, when thou findest the folly of it, surely thou 
 wilt think of returning to me, now at least, now at last, in this thy 
 day. Wilt thou not <I>at this time,</I> nay, wilt thou not <I>from this 
 time</I> and forward, <I>cry unto me?</I> Whatever thou hast said or 
 done hitherto, wilt thou not <I>from this time</I> apply to me? <I>From 
 this time</I> of conviction and correction, now that thou hast been 
 made to see thy sins 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)

 and to smart for them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 wilt thou not now forsake them and return to me, saying, <I>I will go 
 and return to my first husband, for then it was better with me than 
 now?</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:7">Hos. ii. 7</A>.

 Or "<I>from this time</I> that thou hast had so kind an invitation to
 return, and assurance that thou shalt be well received: will not this 
 grace of God overcome thee? Now that pardon is proclaimed wilt thou
 not come in and take the benefit of it? Surely thou wilt."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He expects that they will claim relation to God, as theirs: 
 <I>Wilt thou not cry unto me, My Father, thou art the guide of my 
 youth?</I> 

 [1.] They will surely come towards him as a father, to beg his pardon 
 for their undutiful behaviour to him (<I>Father, I have sinned</I>) and 
 will hope to find in him the tender compassions of a father towards a 
 returning prodigal. They will come to him as a father, to whom they 
 will make their complaints, and in whom they will put their confidence 
 for relief and succour. They will now own him as their father, and 
 themselves fatherless without him; and therefore, hoping to find mercy 
 with him (as those penitents, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:3">Hos. xiv. 3</A>),

 [2.] They will come to him as <I>the guide of their youth,</I> that is, 
 as their husband, for so that relation is described, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:14">Mal. ii. 14</A>.

 "Though thou hast gone after many lovers, surely thou wilt at length
 remember the love of thy espousals, and return to the <I>husband of thy 
 youth.</I>" Or it may be taken more generally: "As <I>my Father,</I> 
 thou <I>art the guide of my youth.</I>" Youth needs a guide. In our 
 return to God we must thankfully remember that he <I>was the guide of 
 our youth</I> in the way of comfort; and we must faithfully covenant 
 that he shall be our guide henceforward in the way of duty, and that we 
 will follow his guidance, and give up ourselves entirely to it, that in 
 all doubtful cases we will be determined by our religion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He expects that they will appeal to the mercy of God and crave the 
 benefit of that mercy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 that they will reason thus with themselves for their encouragement to 
 return to him: "<I>Will he reserve his anger for ever?</I> Surely he 
 will not, for he has proclaimed his name <I>gracious and merciful.</I>" 
 Repenting sinners may encourage themselves with this, that, though God 
 chide, he will not always chide, though he be angry, he will not keep 
 his anger to the end, but, <I>though he cause grief, he will have 
 compassion,</I> and may thus plead for reconciliation. Some understand 
 this as describing their hypocrisy, and the impudence of it: "Though 
 thou hast <I>a whore's forehead</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 and art still <I>doing evil as thou canst</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 yet art thou not ever and anon <I>crying to me, My Father?</I>" Even 
 when they were most addicted to idols they pretended a regard to God 
 and his service and kept up the forms of godliness and devotion. It is 
 a shameful thing for men thus to call God father, and yet to do the 
 <I>works of the devil</I> (as the Jews, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:44">John viii. 44</A>),

 to call him the <I>guide of their youth,</I> and yet give up themselves
 to <I>walk after the flesh,</I> and to flatter themselves with the 
 expectation that <I>his anger shall have an end,</I> while they are 
 continually <I>treasuring up to themselves wrath against the day of 
 wrath.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king,
 Hast thou seen <I>that</I> which backsliding Israel hath done? she is
 gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and
 there hath played the harlot.
 &nbsp; 7  And I said after she had done all these <I>things,</I> Turn thou
 unto me. But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah
 saw <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 8  And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel
 committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of
 divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went
 and played the harlot also.
 &nbsp; 9  And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom,
 that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and
 with stocks.
 &nbsp; 10  And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not
 turned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 11  And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto me, The backsliding Israel hath
 justified herself more than treacherous Judah.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The date of this sermon must be observed, in order to the right 
 understanding of it; it was <I>in the days of Josiah,</I> who set on 
 foot a blessed work of reformation, in which he was hearty, but the 
 people were not sincere in their compliance with it; to reprove them 
 for that, and warn them of the consequences of their hypocrisy, is the 
 scope of that which God here said to the prophet, and which he 
 <I>delivered to them.</I> The case of the two kingdoms of Israel and 
 Judah is here compared, the <I>ten tribes</I> that revolted from the 
 throne of David and the temple of Jerusalem and the <I>two tribes</I> 
 that adhered to both. The distinct history of those two kingdoms we 
 have in the two books of the Kings, and here we have an abstract of 
 both, as far as relates to this matter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is a short account of Israel, the ten tribes. Perhaps the 
 prophet had been just reading the history of that kingdom when God came 
 to him, and said, <I>Hast thou seen what backsliding Israel has 
 done?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 For he could not see it otherwise than in history, they having been
 carried into captivity long before he was born. But what we read in the 
 histories of scripture should instruct us and affect us, as if we 
 ourselves had been eye-witnesses of it. She is called <I>backsliding 
 Israel</I> because that kingdom was first founded in an apostasy from 
 the divine institutions, both in church and state. Now he had seen 
 concerning them, 

 1. That they were wretchedly addicted to idolatry. They had <I>played
 the harlot upon every high mountain and under every green tree</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 that is, they had worshipped other gods in their high places and 
 groves; and no marvel, when from the first they had worshipped God by 
 the images of the <I>golden calves</I> at Dan and Bethel. The way of 
 idolatry is down-hill: those that are in love with images, and will 
 have them, soon become in love with other gods, and will have them too; 
 for how should those stick at the breach of the first commandment who 
 make no conscience of the second? 

 2. That God by his prophets had invited and encouraged them to repent 
 and reform

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "<I>After she had done all these things,</I> for which she might justly 
 have been abandoned, yet <I>I said</I> unto her, <I>Turn thou unto 
 me</I> and I will receive thee." Though they had forsaken both the 
 house of David and the house of Aaron, who both had their authority 
 <I>jure divino--from God,</I> without dispute, yet God sent his 
 prophets among them, to call them to <I>return to him,</I> to the 
 worship of him only, not insisting so much as one would have expected 
 upon their return to the house of David, but pressing their return to 
 the house of Aaron. We read not that Elijah, that great reformer, ever 
 mentioned their return to the house of David, while he was anxious for 
 their return to the faithful service of the true God according as they 
 had it among them. It is serious piety that God stands upon more than
 even his own rituals. 

 3. That, notwithstanding this, they had persisted in their idolatries:
 <I>But she returned not,</I> and God <I>saw it;</I> he took notice of 
 it, and was much displeased with it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.
 
 Note, God keeps account, whether we do or no, how often he has called
 to us to turn to him and we have refused.

 4. That he had therefore cast them off, and given them up into the 
 hands of their enemies

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>When I saw</I> (so it may be read) <I>that for all the actions 
 wherein she had committed adultery I must dismiss her, I gave her a 
 bill of divorce.</I> God divorced them when he threw them out of his 
 protection and left them an easy prey to any that would lay hands on 
 them, when he scattered all their synagogues and the schools of the 
 prophets and excluded them from laying any further claim to the 
 covenant made with their fathers. Note, Those will justly be divorced 
 from God that join themselves to such as are rivals with him. For proof 
 of this go and see what God did to Israel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Let us now see what was the case of Judah, the kingdom of the two 
 tribes. She is called <I>treacherous sister Judah,</I> a sister because 
 descended from the same common stock, Abraham and Jacob; but, as Israel 
 had the character of a <I>backslider,</I> So Judah is called 
 <I>treacherous,</I> because, though she professed to keep close to God 
 when Israel had backslidden (she adhered to the kings and priests that 
 were of God's own appointing, and did not withdraw from her allegiance, 
 so that it was expected she should deal faithfully), yet she proved 
 treacherous, and false, and unfaithful to her professions and promises. 
 Note, The treachery of those who pretend to cleave to God will be 
 reckoned for, as well as the apostasy of those who openly revolt from 
 him. Judah saw what Israel did, and what came of it, and should have 
 taken warning. Israel's captivity was intended for Judah's admonition; 
 but it had not the designed effect. Judah feared not, but thought 
 herself safe because she had Levites to be her priests and sons of 
 David to be her kings. Note, It is an evidence of great stupidity and 
 security when we are not awakened to a holy fear by the judgments of 
 God upon others. It is here charged on Judah, 

 1. That when they had a wicked king that debauched them they heartily
 concurred with him in his debaucheries. Judah was forward enough to 
 <I>play the harlot,</I> to worship any idol that was introduced among 
 them and to join in any idolatrous usage; so that <I>through the 
 lightness</I> (or, as some read it, the <I>vileness</I> and 
 <I>baseness) of her whoredom,</I> or (as the margin reads it) by the
 fame and <I>report</I> of her whoredom, her <I>notorious</I> whoredom, 
 for which she had become infamous, she <I>defiled the land,</I> and 
 made it an abomination to God; for she <I>committed adultery with 
 stones and stocks,</I> with the basest idols, those made of <I>wood and 
 stone.</I> In the reigns of Manasseh and Amon, when they were disposed 
 to idolatry, the people were so too, and all the country was corrupted 
 with it, and none feared the ruin which Israel by this means had 
 brought upon themselves. 

 2. That when they had a good king, that reformed them, they did not 
 heartily concur with him in the reformation. This was the present case. 
 God tried whether they would be good in a good reign, but the evil 
 disposition was still the same: <I>They returned not to me with their 
 whole heart, but feignedly,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Josiah went further in destroying idolatry than the best of his
 predecessors had done, and for his own part he <I>turned to the Lord 
 with all his heart and with all his soul;</I> so it is said of him, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:25">2 Kings xxiii. 25</A>.

 The people were forced to an external compliance with him, and joined
 with him in keeping a very solemn passover and in renewing their 
 covenants with God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+34:32,35:17">2 Chron. xxxiv. 32, xxxv. 17</A>);

 but they were not sincere in it, nor were their <I>hearts right with
 God.</I> For this reason God at that very time said, <I>I will remove 
 Judah out of my sight, as I removed Israel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:27">2 Kings xxiii. 27</A>),

 because Judah was not removed from their sin by the sight of Israel's
 removal from their land. Hypocritical and ineffectual reformations bode 
 ill to a people. We deceive ourselves if we think to deceive God by a
 feigned return to him. I know no religion without sincerity.</P>

 III. The case of these sister kingdoms is compared, and judgment given 
 upon the comparison, that of the two Judah was the worse 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):
 
 <I>Israel has justified herself more than Judah,</I> that is, she is 
 not so bad as Judah is. This comparative justification will stand 
 Israel in little stead; what will it avail us to say, <I>We are not so 
 bad as others,</I> when yet we are not really good ourselves? But it 
 will serve as an aggravation of the sin of Judah, which was in two 
 respects worse than that of Israel:--

 1. More was expected from Judah than from Israel; so that Judah dealt
 treacherously, they vilified a more sacred profession, and falsified a 
 more solemn promise, than Israel did.

 2. Judah might have taken warning by the ruin of Israel for their 
 idolatry, and would not. God's judgments upon others, if they be not 
 means of our reformation, will help to aggravate our destruction. The
 prophet Ezekiel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:11"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 11</A>)

 makes the same comparison between Jerusalem and Samaria that this
 prophet here makes between Judah and Israel, nay, and 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:48">Ezek. xvi. 48</A>)
 
 between Jerusalem and Sodom, and Jerusalem is made the worst of the
 three.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say,
 Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; <I>and</I> I will not
 cause mine anger to fall upon you: for I <I>am</I> merciful, saith the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>and</I> I will not keep <I>anger</I> for ever.
 &nbsp; 13  Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed
 against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the

 voice, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 14  Turn, O backsliding children, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; for I am
 married unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a
 family, and I will bring you to Zion:
 &nbsp; 15  And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which
 shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.
 &nbsp; 16  And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and
 increased in the land, in those days, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, they shall
 say no more, The ark of the covenant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: neither shall
 it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall
 they visit <I>it;</I> neither shall <I>that</I> be done any more.

 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after
 the imagination of their evil heart.
 &nbsp; 18  In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house
 of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the
 north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your
 fathers.
 &nbsp; 19  But I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and
 give thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of
 nations? and I said, Thou shalt call me, My father; and shalt not
 turn away from me.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is a great deal of gospel in these verses, both that which was 
 always gospel, God's readiness to pardon sin and to receive and 
 entertain returning repenting sinners, and those blessings which were 
 in a special manner reserved for gospel times, the forming and founding 
 of the gospel church by bringing into it the <I>children of God that 
 were scattered abroad,</I> the superseding of the ceremonial law, and 
 the uniting of Jews and Gentiles, typified by the uniting of Israel and 
 Judah in their return out of captivity. The prophet is directed to 
 <I>proclaim these words towards the north,</I> for they are a call to 
 backsliding Israel, the ten tribes that were carried captive into 
 Assyria, which lay north from Jerusalem. That way he must look, to show 
 that God had not forgotten them, though their brethren had, and to 
 upbraid the men of Judah with their obstinacy in refusing to answer the 
 calls given them. One might as well call to those who lay many hundred 
 miles off in the land of the north; they would as soon hear as these 
 unbelieving and disobedient people; <I>backsliding Israel</I> will 
 sooner accept of mercy, and have the benefit of it, than <I>treacherous 
 Judah.</I> And perhaps the proclaiming of these words towards the north 
 looks as far forward as the <I>preaching of repentance and remission of 
 sins unto all nations, beginning at Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:47">Luke xxiv. 47</A>.

 A call to Israel in the land of the north is a call to others in that
 land, even as many as belong to the election of grace. When it was 
 suspected that Christ would <I>go to the dispersed</I> Jews among the 
 Gentiles, it was concluded that he would <I>teach the Gentiles,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:35">John vii. 35</A>.

 So here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is an invitation given to <I>backsliding Israel,</I> and in 
 them to the backsliding Gentiles, to <I>return unto God,</I> the God 
 from whom they had revolted 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>Return, thou backsliding Israel.</I> And again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 "<I>Turn, O backsliding children!</I> repent of your backslidings, 
 return to your allegiance, come back to that good way which you have 
 missed and out of which you have turned aside." Pursuant to this 
 invitation, 

 1. They are encouraged to return. "<I>Repent, and be converted, and
 your sins shall be blotted out,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:19">Acts iii. 19</A>.

 You have incurred God's displeasure, but return to me, and <I>I will
 not cause my anger to fall upon you.</I>" God's anger is ready to fall 
 upon sinners, as a lion falls on his prey, and there is none to 
 deliver, as a mountain of lead falling on them, to sink them past 
 recovery into the lowest hell. But if they repent it shall be turned 
 away,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+12:1">Isa. xii. 1</A>.

 <I>I will not keep my anger for ever,</I> but will be reconciled,
 <I>for I am merciful.</I> We that are sinful were for ever undone if 
 God were not merciful; but the goodness of his nature encourages us to 
 hope that, if we by repentance undo what we have done against him, he 
 will by a pardon unsay what he has said against us.

 2. They are directed how to return

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 "<I>Only acknowledge thy iniquity,</I> own thyself in a fault and 
 thereby take shame to thyself and give glory to God." <I>I will not 
 keep my anger for ever</I> (that is a previous promise); you shall be 
 delivered form that anger of God which is everlasting, from the wrath 
 to come; but upon what terms? Very easy and reasonable ones. <I>Only
 acknowledge thy sins. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just 
 to forgive them.</I> This will aggravate the condemnation of sinners, 
 that the terms of pardon and peace were brought so low, and yet they 
 would not come up to them. <I>If the prophet had told thee to do some 
 great thing wouldst thou not have done it? How much more when he says, 
 Only acknowledge thy iniquity?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:13">2 Kings v. 13</A>.
 
 In confessing sin,

 (1.) We must own the corruption of our nature: <I>Acknowledge thy 
 iniquity,</I> the perverseness and irregularity of thy nature. 

 (2.) We must own our actual sins: "<I>That thou hast transgressed 
 against the Lord thy God,</I> hast affronted him and offended him." 
 
 (3.) We must own the multitude of our transgressions: "That <I>thou 
 hast scattered thy ways to the strangers,</I> run hither and thither in 
 pursuit of thy idols, <I>under every green tree.</I> Wherever thou hast 
 rambled thou hast left behind thee the marks of thy folly." 

 (4.) We must aggravate our sin from the disobedience that there is in 
 it to the divine law. The sinfulness of sin is the worst thing in it:
 "<I>You have not obeyed my voice;</I> acknowledge that, and let that 
 humble you more than any thing else."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here are precious promises made to these backsliding children, if 
 they do return, which were in part fulfilled in the return of the Jews 
 out of their captivity, many that belonged to the ten tribes having 
 perhaps joined themselves to those of the two tribes, in the prospect 
 of their deliverance, and returning with them; but the prophecy is to 
 have its full accomplishment in the gospel church, and the gathering 
 together of <I>the children of God that were scattered abroad</I> to 
 that: "Return, for, though you are backsliders, yet you are children; 
 nay, though a treacherous wife, yet a wife, for <I>I am married to 
 you</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)

 and will not disown the relation." Thus God remembers his covenant with 
 their fathers, that marriage covenant, and in consideration of that he 
 <I>remembers their land,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:42">Lev. xxvi. 42</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He promises to gather them together from all places whither they are 
 dispersed and scattered abroad, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:52">John xi. 52</A>,

 <I>I will take you, one of a city, and two of a family,</I> or clan;
 <I>and I will bring you to Zion,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 All those that by repentance return to their duty shall return to their
 former comfort. Observe, 

 (1.) God will graciously receive those that return to him, nay, it is 
 he that by his distinguishing grace takes them out from among the rest 
 that persist in their backslidings; if he had left them, they would 
 have been undone.

 (2.) Of the many that have backslidden from God there are but few, very 
 few in comparison, that return to him, like the gleanings of the 
 vintage--<I>one of a city and two of a country;</I> Christ's flock is a 
 little flock, and <I>few there are that find the strait gate.</I> 

 (3.) Of those few, though dispersed, yet not one shall be lost. Though 
 there be but <I>one in a city,</I> God will find out that one; he shall 
 not be overlooked in a crowd, but shall be brought safely to Zion, 
 safely to heaven. The scattered Jews shall be brought to Jerusalem, and 
 those of the ten tribes shall be as welcome there as those of the two. 
 God's chosen, scattered all the world over, shall be brought to <I>the 
 gospel church,</I> that Mount Zion, the heavenly Jerusalem, that holy 
 hill on which Christ reigns.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He promises to set those over them that shall be every way blessings 
 to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>I will give you pastors after my heart,</I> alluding to the 
 character given of David when God pitched upon him to be king. 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:14">1 Sam. xiii. 14</A>,

 <I>The Lord hath sought him a man after his own heart.</I> Observe,

 (1.) When a church is gathered it must be governed. "<I>I will bring
 them to Zion,</I> not to live as they list, but to be under discipline, 
 not as wild beasts, that range at pleasure, but as sheep that are under 
 the direction of a shepherd." <I>I will give them pastors,</I> that is, 
 both magistrates and ministers; both are God's ordinance for the 
 support of his kingdom. 

 (2.) It is well with a people when their pastors are <I>after God's own 
 heart,</I> such as they should be, such as we would have them be, who 
 shall make his will their rule in all their administrations, and such 
 as endeavour in some measure to conform to his example, who rule for 
 him, and, as they are capable, rule like him. 

 (3.) Those are pastors after God's own heart who make it their business 
 to feed the flock, not to <I>feed themselves and fleece the flocks,</I> 
 but to do all they can for the good of those that are under their 
 charge, who <I>feed them with wisdom and understanding</I> (that is, 
 wisely and understandingly), as David fed them, in the <I>integrity of 
 his heart</I> and by the <I>skilfulness of his hand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:72">Ps. lxxviii. 72</A>.
 
 Those who are not only pastors, but teachers, must feed them with the
 word of God, which is wisdom and understanding, which is able to make 
 us wise to salvation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He promises that there shall be no more occasion for the <I>ark of 
 the covenant,</I> which had been so much the glory of the tabernacle 
 first and afterwards of the temple, and was the token of God's presence 
 with them; that shall be set aside, and there shall be no more enquiry 
 after, nor enquiring of, it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>When you shall be multiplied and increased in the land,</I> when the 
 kingdom of the Messiah shall be set up, which by the accession of the 
 Gentiles will bring in to the church a vast increase (and the days of 
 the Messiah the Jewish masters themselves acknowledge to be here 
 intended), then <I>they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of 
 the Lord,</I> they shall have it no more among them to value, or value 
 themselves upon, because they shall have a pure spiritual way of 
 worship set up, in which there shall be no occasion for any of those 
 external ordinances; with the <I>ark of the covenant</I> the whole 
 ceremonial law shall be set aside, and all the institutions of it, for 
 Christ, the truth of all those types, exhibited to us in the word and 
 sacraments of the New Testament, will be to us instead of all. It is 
 very likely (whatever the Jews suggest to the contrary) that <I>the ark 
 of the covenant</I> was in the second temple, being restored by Cyrus 
 with the other <I>vessels of the house of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:7">Ezra i. 7</A>.

 But in the gospel temple Christ <I>is the ark;</I> he is the
 propitiatory, or mercy-seat; and it is the spiritual presence of God in 
 his ordinances that we are now to expect. Many expressions are here 
 used concerning the setting aside of the ark, that it shall not <I>come 
 to mind,</I> that they <I>shall not remember it,</I> that they shall 
 <I>not visit it,</I> that none of these things shall be <I>any more 
 done;</I> for the <I>true worshippers shall worship the Father in 
 spirit and in truth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:24">John iv. 24</A>.

 But this variety of expressions is used to show that the ceremonies of
 the law of Moses should be totally and finally abolished, never to be 
 used any more, but that it would be with difficulty that those who had 
 been so long wedded to them should be weaned from them; and that they 
 would not quite let them go till their holy city and holy house should 
 both be levelled with the ground.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He promises that the gospel church, here called <I>Jerusalem,</I> 
 shall become eminent and conspicuous, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Two things shall make it famous:--

 (1.) God's special residence and dominion in it. It shall be called, 
 <I>The throne of the Lord</I>--the throne of <I>his glory,</I> for that 
 shines forth in the church--the throne of <I>his government,</I> for 
 that also is erected there; there he rules his willing people by his 
 word and Spirit, and brings every thought into obedience to himself. As 
 the gospel got ground this <I>throne of the Lord</I> was set up even 
 where <I>Satan's seat</I> had been. It is especially the throne of 
 <I>his grace;</I> for those that by faith come to this Jerusalem come 
 to <I>God the judge of all,</I> and to <I>Jesus the mediator of the new 
 covenant,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:22-24">Heb. xii. 22-24</A>.

 (2.) The accession of the Gentiles to it. <I>All the nations shall
 be</I> discipled, and so <I>gathered</I> to the church, and shall 
 become subjects to that <I>throne of the Lord</I> which is there set 
 up, and devoted to the honour of that <I>name of the Lord</I> which is 
 there both manifested and called upon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He promises that there shall be a wonderful reformation wrought in 
 those that are gathered to the church: <I>They shall not walk any more 
 after the imagination of their evil hearts.</I> They shall not live as 
 they list, but live by rules, not do according to their own corrupt 
 appetites, but according to the will of God. See what leads in 
 sin--<I>the imagination of our own evil hearts;</I> and what sin is--it
 is <I>walking after</I> that imagination, being governed by fancy and 
 humour; and what converting grace does--it takes us off from walking
 after <I>our own inventions</I> and brings us to be governed by 
 religion and right reason.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. That Judah and Israel shall be happily united in one body, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.
 
 They were so in their return out of captivity and their settlement
 again in Canaan: <I>The house of Judah shall walk with the house of 
 Israel,</I> as being perfectly agreed, and become <I>one stick in the 
 hand of the Lord,</I> as Ezekiel also foretold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+37:16,17"><I>ch.</I> xxxvii. 16, 17</A>.

 Both Assyria and Chaldea fell into the hands of Cyrus, and his
 proclamation extended to all the Jews in all his dominions. And 
 therefore we have reason to think that many of <I>the house of 
 Israel</I> came with those of Judah out of <I>the land of the 
 north;</I> though at first there returned but 42,000 (whom we have an 
 account of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:1-70">Ezra ii.</A>)

 yet Josephus says (<I>Antiq.</I> 11.68) that some few years after,
 under Darius, Zerubbabel went and fetched up above 4,000,000 of souls, 
 <I>to the land that was given for an inheritance to their fathers.</I> 
 And we never read of such animosities and enmities between Israel and 
 Judah as had been formerly. This happy coalescence between Israel and 
 Judah in Canaan was a type of the uniting of Jews and Gentiles in the 
 gospel church, when, all enmities being slain, they should become one 
 <I>sheepfold under one shepherd.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is some difficulty started, that lies in the way of all this 
 mercy; but an expedient is found to get over it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God asks, <I>How shall I</I> do this for thee? Not as if God showed 
 favour with reluctancy, as he punishes with a <I>How shall I give thee 
 up?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:8,9">Hos. xi. 8, 9</A>.

 No, though he is slow to anger, he is swift to show mercy. But it
 intimates that we are utterly unworthy of his favours, that we have no 
 reason to expect them, that there is nothing in us to deserve them, 
 that we can lay no claim to them, and that he contrives how to do it in 
 such a way as may save the honour of his justice and holiness in the 
 government of the world. <I>Means</I> must be <I>devised that his 
 banished be not for ever expelled from him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:14">2 Sam. xiv. 14</A>.
 
 How shall I do it?

 (1.) Even backsliders, if they return and repent, shall be <I>put among 
 the children;</I> and who could ever have expected that? <I>Behold what 
 manner of love is this!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:1">1 John iii. 1</A>.

 How should we who are so mean and weak, so worthless and unworthy, and
 so provoking, ever be <I>put among the children.</I>

 (2.) To those whom God puts among the children he will <I>give the 
 pleasant land,</I> the land of Canaan, that glory of all lands, <I>that 
 goodly heritage of the hosts of nations,</I> which nations and their 
 hosts wish for and prefer to their own country, or which the hosts of 
 the nations have now got possession of. It was a type of heaven, where 
 there are <I>pleasures for evermore.</I> Now who could expect a place 
 in that <I>pleasant land</I> that has so often <I>despised it</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:24">Ps. cvi. 24</A>)

 and is so unworthy of it and unfit for it? Is this the manner of
 men?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He does himself return answer to this question: <I>But I said, Thou 
 shalt call me, My Father.</I> God does himself answer all the 
 objections that are taken from our unworthiness, or they would never be 
 got over. 

 (1.) That he may put returning penitents <I>among the children,</I> he 
 will give them the <I>Spirit of adoption,</I> teaching them <I>to cry, 
 Abba, Father,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:6">Gal. iv. 6</A>.

 "<I>Thou shalt call me, My Father;</I> thou shalt return to me, and
 resign thyself to me as a father, and that shall recommend thee to my 
 favour,"

 (2.) That he may <I>give them the pleasant land,</I> he will <I>put his 
 fear in their hearts,</I> that they may never <I>turn from him,</I> but 
 may persevere to the end.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The charge God exhibits against Israel for their treacherous 
 departures from him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 As an adulterous wife elopes from her husband, so have they gone a
 whoring from God. They were joined to God by a marriage-covenant, but 
 they broke that covenant, they <I>dealt treacherously</I> with God, who 
 had always dealt kindly and faithfully with them. Treacherous dealing 
 with men like ourselves is bad enough, but to deal treacherously with 
 God is to deal treasonably.</P>

 II. Their conviction and confession of the truth of this charge, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 
 When God reproved them for their apostasy, there were some among them,
 even such as God would take and <I>bring to Zion,</I> whose <I>voice 
 was heard upon the high places weeping and praying,</I> humbling 
 themselves before the God of their fathers, lamenting their calamities, 
 and their sins, the procuring cause of them; for this is that which 
 they lament, for this they bemoan themselves, that <I>they have 
 perverted their way and forgotten the Lord their God.</I> Note, 

 1. Sin is the perverting of our way, it is turning aside to crooked
 ways and <I>perverting that which is right.</I> 

 2. Forgetting the Lord our God is at the bottom of all sin. If men 
 would remember God, his eye upon them and their obligation to him, they 
 would not transgress as they do.

 3. By sin we embarrass ourselves, and bring ourselves into trouble, for
 that also is the perverting of our way, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:9">Lam. iii. 9</A>.

 4. Prayers and tears well become those whose consciences tell them
 that they have <I>perverted their way and forgotten their God.</I> When 
 the <I>foolishness of man perverts his way his heart</I> is apt to 
 <I>fret against the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+19:3">Prov. xix. 3</A>),

 whereas it should be melted and poured out before him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The invitation God gives them to return to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>Return, you backsliding children.</I> He calls them <I>children</I> 
 in tenderness and compassion to them, foolish and froward as children, 
 yet <I>his sons,</I> whom though he corrects he will not disinherit; 
 for, though they are <I>refractory children</I> (so some render it), 
 yet they are <I>children.</I> God bears with such children, and so much 
 parents. When they are convinced of sin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 and humbled for that, then they are prepared and then they are 
 <I>invited</I> to <I>return,</I> as Christ invites those to him that 
 are <I>weary</I> and <I>heavy-laden.</I> The promise to those that 
 return is, "<I>I will heal your backslidings;</I> I will comfort you 
 under the grief you are in for your backslidings, deliver you out of 
 the troubles you have brought yourselves into by your backslidings, and 
 cure you of your refractoriness and tendency to backslide." God will 
 <I>heal our backslidings</I> by his pardoning mercy, his quieting 
 peace, and his renewing grace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The ready consent they give to this invitation, and their cheerful
 compliance with it: <I>Behold, we come unto thee.</I> This is an echo 
 to God's call; as a voice returned from broken walls, so this from 
 broken hearts. God says, <I>Return;</I> they answer, <I>Behold, we 
 come.</I> It is an immediate speedy answer, without delay, not, "We 
 will come hereafter," but, "We do come now; we need not take time to 
 consider of it;" not, "We come towards thee," but, "We come to thee, we 
 will make a thorough turn of it." Observe how unanimous they are: <I>We 
 come,</I> one and all. 

 1. They come devoting themselves to God as theirs: "<I>Thou art the
 Lord our God;</I> we take thee to be ours, we give up ourselves to thee 
 to be thine; whither shall we go but to thee? It is our sin and folly
 that we have gone from thee." It is very comfortable, in our returns to 
 God after our backslidings, to look up to him as ours in covenant. 

 2. They come disclaiming all expectations of relief and succour but
 from God only: <I>"In vain is salvation hoped for from the hills and 
 from the multitude of the mountains;</I> we now see our folly in 
 relying upon creature-confidences, and will never so deceive ourselves 
 any more." They worshipped their idols upon hills and mountains

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 and they had a multitude of idols upon their mountains, which they had 
 sought unto and put a confidence in; but now they will have no more to 
 do with them. In vain do we look for any thing that is good from them, 
 while from God we may look for every thing that is good, even salvation 
 itself. Therefore, 

 3. They come depending upon God only as their God: <I>In the Lord our
 God is the salvation of Israel.</I> He is <I>the Lord,</I> and he only 
 can save; he can save when all other succours and saviours fail; and he 
 is <I>our God,</I> and will in his own way and time work salvation for 
 us. It is very applicable to the great salvation from sin, which Jesus 
 Christ wrought out for us; that is the <I>salvation of the Lord,</I> 
 his <I>great salvation.</I> 

 4. They come justifying God in their troubles and judging themselves
 for their sins,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>.

 (1.) They impute all the calamities they had been under to their idols,
 which had not only done them no good, but had done them abundance of 
 mischief, all the mischief that had been done them: <I>Shame</I> (the 
 idol, that shameful thing) <I>has devoured the labour of our 
 fathers.</I> Note, 

 [1.] True penitents have learned to call sin <I>shame;</I> even the 
 beloved sin which has been as an idol to them, which they have been 
 most pleased with and proud of, even that they shall call a scandalous 
 thing, shall put contempt upon it and be ashamed of it. 

 [2.] True penitents have learned to call sin death and ruin, and to 
 charge upon it all the mischiefs they suffer: "It has <I>devoured</I> 
 all those good things which our fathers <I>laboured for</I> and left to 
 us; we have found <I>from our youth</I> that our idolatry has been the 
 destruction of our prosperity." Children often throw away upon their 
 lusts that which their fathers took a great deal of pains for; and it 
 is well if at length they are brought (as these here) to see the folly 
 of it, and to call those vices their shame which have wasted their 
 estates and <I>devoured the labour of their fathers.</I> Of the labour 
 of their fathers, which their idols had devoured, they mention 
 particularly <I>their flocks and their herds, their sons and their 
 daughters. First,</I> their idolatries had provoked God to bring these
 desolating judgments upon them, which had ruined their country and 
 families, and made their estates a prey and their children captives to 
 the conquering enemy. They had <I>procured these things to 
 themselves.</I> Or, rather, <I>Secondly,</I> These had been sacrificed 
 to their idols, had been <I>separated unto that shame</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:10">Hos. ix. 10</A>),
 
 and they had devoured them without mercy; they did <I>eat the fat of
 their sacrifices</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:38">Deut. xxxii. 38</A>),
 
 even their human sacrifices.

 (2.) They take to themselves the shame of their sin and folly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 "<I>We lie down in our shame,</I> being unable to bear up under it; 
 <I>our confusion covers us,</I> that is, both our penal and our 
 penitential shame. Sin has laid us under such rebukes of God's 
 providence, and such reproaches of our own consciences, as surround us 
 and fill us with shame. For <I>we have sinned,</I> and shame came in 
 with sin and still attends upon it. We are sinners by descent; guilt 
 and corruption are entailed upon us: <I>We and our fathers have 
 sinned.</I> We were sinners betimes; we began early in a course of sin: 
 We have sinned <I>from our youth;</I> we have continued in sin, have 
 sinned <I>even unto this day,</I> though often called to repent and 
 forsake our sins. That which is the malignity of sin, the worst thing 
 in it, is the affront we have put upon God by it: <I>We have not obeyed 
 the voice of the Lord our God,</I> forbidding us to sin and commanding 
 us, when we have sinned, to repent." Now all this seems to be the 
 language of the penitents of <I>the house of Israel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 of the ten tribes, either of those that were in captivity or those of 
 them that remained in their own land. And the prophet takes notice of 
 their repentance to provoke the men of Judah to a holy emulation.
 David used it as an argument with the elders of Judah that it would be 
 a shame for those that were <I>his bone and his flesh</I> to be <I>the 
 last in bringing the king back,</I> when the men of Israel appeared 
 forward in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:11,12">2 Sam. xix. 11, 12</A>.

 So the prophet excites Judah to repent because Israel did: and well it
 were if the zeal of others less likely would provoke us to strive to 
 get before them and go beyond them in that which is good.</P>
