 In this chapter, 

 I. God threatens to deprive this degenerate seed of Israel of all their
 worldly enjoyments, because by sin they had forfeited their title to 
 them; so that they should have no comfort either in receiving them 
 themselves or in offering them to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. He dooms them to utter ruin, for their own sins and the sins of
 their prophets, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:6-8">ver. 6-8</A>.

 III. He upbraids them with the wickedness of their fathers before them,
 whose steps they trod in, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:9,10">ver. 9, 10</A>.

 IV. He threatens them with the destruction of their children and the
 rooting out of their posterity,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. The people of Israel are charged with spiritual adultery: <I>O 
 Israel! thou hast gone a whoring from thy God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Their covenant with God was a marriage-covenant, by which they were 
 joined to him as their God, renouncing all others. But when they set up 
 idols and worshipped them, when they fled to creatures for succour and 
 put a confidence in them, they <I>went a whoring from God</I> as their 
 God, and honoured the pretenders and rivals with the affection, 
 adoration, and confidence, which were due to God only. Other people 
 were idolaters, but that sin was not, in them, going a whoring from 
 God, as it was in Israel that had been married to him. Note, The sins 
 of those who have made a profession of religion and relation to God are 
 more provoking to him than the sins of others. As a proof of their 
 going a whoring from God, it is charged upon them that <I>they loved a 
 reward upon every corn-floor.</I> 

 1. They loved to give rewards to their idols, in the offerings and
 first-fruits they presented to them out of every corn-floor. They took 
 a strange pleasure in serving their idols with that which they would 
 have grudged to consecrate to God and employ in his service. Note, It 
 is common for those that are niggardly in the expenses of their 
 religion to be very prodigal in spending upon their lusts. Or, 

 2. They loved to receive rewards from their idols; and such they
 reckoned the fruits of the earth to be: <I>These are my rewards, which 
 my lovers have given me,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:12"><I>ch.</I> ii. 12</A>.

 Note, Those are directly disposed to spiritual idolatry that love a
 reward in the corn-floor better than a reward in the favour of God and 
 eternal life.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They are forbidden to rejoice as other people do: "<I>Rejoice not, 
 O Israel! for joy.</I> Do not expect to rejoice. <I>What peace,</I> 
 what joy, what hast thou to do with either, while thy whoredoms and 
 witchcrafts are so many?" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:19-22">2 Kings ix. 19-22</A>.

 Be not disposed to rejoice, for it does not become thee, but rather to
 <I>be afflicted, and mourn, and weep,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:9">Jam. iv. 9</A>.

 Judah, that keeps close to the true God, nay, and other people that
 never knew him nor could ever be charged with revolting from him, may 
 be allowed to rejoice, as not having so much cause to be ashamed as 
 Israel has, that has gone a whoring from him. Some think that they had
 at this time particular occasions for joy, probably upon the account of 
 some losses recovered, or some advantages gained, or some league made 
 with a potent ally, for which they had public rejoicings, as other 
 people used to have upon such occasions; but God sends to them not to 
 rejoice. Note, Joy is forbidden fruit to wicked people. They must not 
 rejoice, because they have gone a whoring from their God; and 
 therefore,

 1. Whatever it was that they rejoiced in, it would be no security nor
 advantage to them, so long as they were at a distance from God and at 
 war with him. Note, We are likely to have small joy of any of our 
 creature-comforts if we make not God our chief joy. 

 2. The sense of sin and dread of wrath ought to be a damp upon their
 joy and a strong alloy to all their comforts. Note, Those who by 
 departing from God have made work for repentance have thereby marred 
 their own mirth, till they return and make their peace with God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They are threatened with destroying judgments for their spiritual 
 whoredoms, according to what was said long before. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:27">Ps. lxxii. 27</A>,

 <I>Thou hast destroyed all those that go a whoring from thee.</I> It is 
 here threatened,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That their land shall not yield its wonted increase. Canaan, that 
 <I>fruitful land,</I> shall be <I>turned into barrenness for the 
 wickedness of those that dwell therein.</I> They <I>love the reward in 
 the corn-floor,</I> and are so full of the <I>joy of harvest</I> that 
 they have no disposition at all to mourn for their sins; and therefore 
 God will, for their effectual humiliation, take away from them, not 
 only their delights and dainties, but even their necessary food 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):
 
 <I>The floor and the wine-press shall not feed them,</I> much less 
 feast them; they shall either be blasted by the hand of God or 
 plundered by the hand of man. The <I>new wine</I> with which they used 
 to make merry shall <I>fail in her.</I> Note, When we make the world, 
 and the things of it, our idol and portion, above what they were 
 designed for, it is just with God to deny us even support and 
 nourishment from them, according to that which they were designed for, 
 to show us our folly and correct us for it. Let those miss of their 
 food in the corn-floor that look for their reward in the corn-floor. We 
 forfeit the good things of this world if we love them as the best 
 things.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That their land shall not only cease to feed them, but cease to 
 lodge them and to be a habitation for them; it shall <I>spue them 
 out,</I> as it had done the Canaanites before them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>They shall not dwell any longer in the Lord's land.</I> The land of 
 Canaan was in a peculiar manner <I>the Lord's land, the land of the 
 Shechinah</I> (so the Chaldee), <I>the land of the Lord of the 
 world</I> (so the Arabic); he whose all the earth is 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:1">Ps. xxiv. 1</A>)

 took that for his demesne. <I>The land is mine,</I> says God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+25:23">Lev. xxv. 23</A>.
 
 They had used it, or abused it rather, as if it had been their own, had 
 not paid the rent, nor done the services, due to God as their landlord, 
 and therefore God justly <I>enters,</I> and takes possession of it, 
 they having forfeited their lease. "It is <I>my land</I>" (says God) 
 "and I will make it appear, for they shall be turned off, as bad 
 tenants, and be made to know that, though they thought themselves 
 freeholders, they were but tenants at will." Note, It is for the honour 
 of God's justice and holiness that those who go a whoring from God 
 should not be suffered to dwell upon his land; and therefore, sooner or 
 later, the wicked shall be <I>chased out of the world.</I> Or it is 
 called the Lord's land because it was the holy land, <I>Immanuel's 
 land,</I> the land that had peculiar tokens of God's favour to it, and 
 presence in it, where God was known and his name was great, where God's 
 prophets and oracles were; it was a kind of copy of the earthly 
 paradise, and a type of the heavenly one. It was a great privilege to 
 have a lot in such a land as this. It was a great sin and folly to 
 rebel against God, and go a whoring from him, in such a land as this, 
 to <I>deal unjustly in a land of uprightness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:10">Isa. xxvi. 10</A>.

 And it was a sad and sore judgment to be driven out from such a land as
 this; it was like driving our first parents out of the garden of Eden, 
 and almost amounted to an exclusion out of the heavenly Canaan. Note, 
 Those cannot expect to dwell in the Lord's land that will not be 
 subject to the Lord's laws, nor be influenced by his love. Those have 
 forfeited the privileges of the church that conform not to the rules of 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That, when they are turned out from the Lord's land, they shall have 
 no rest nor satisfaction in any other land. When Cain was <I>driven out 
 from the presence of the Lord</I> he was <I>a fugitive and a 
 vagabond</I> ever after, and dwelt in the land of <I>trembling.</I> So 
 Israel here. Some shall <I>return into Egypt,</I> the old house of 
 bondage; thither they shall flee from the Assyrian 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:13"><I>ch.</I> viii. 13</A>)

 and they shall lose and ruin themselves where they thought to hide and
 help themselves. Others shall be carried captives to Assyria and there 
 shall be forced to <I>eat unclean things,</I> either 

 (1.) Such things as were not fit for men to eat, that which is rotten 
 and putrefied, intimating that they shall be reduced to the utmost 
 poverty, as the prodigal that would fain have filled his belly <I>with 
 the husks.</I> Or, 

 (2.) Such things as were not fit for Jews to eat, being prohibited by 
 their law. It is probable that while they were in their own land,
 however disobedient in other things, they kept up the distinction of 
 meats, and prided themselves in that; but, since they would not keep 
 the law of God in other things, they should not be suffered to keep it 
 in that, and it was a just punishment of their sin in eating things 
 offered to idols. Note, When at any time we suffer in our food, and 
 either through want or for our health are forced to eat or drink that 
 which is unpleasing, we must acknowledge that God is righteous, because 
 we have sinned about our food, and have indulged ourselves too much in 
 that which is pleasing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That in the land of their enemies, to which they shall be driven, 
 they shall have no opportunity either of giving honour to God or 
 obtaining favour with God, by offering any acceptable sacrifice to him; 
 they should not be in a capacity of keeping up any face or show of 
 religion among them; "and so" (as Dr. Pocock expresses it) "should be 
 as it were quite cut off from any expression of relation to him, from 
 all signs of grace, and means of reconciliation with him, which would 
 be to them a token of their being rejected of God, estranged from him, 
 and no more owned by him as his people." 

 (1.) They shall have no sacrifices to offer, nor any altar to offer 
 them on, nor priests to offer them; they shall not so much as <I>offer 
 drink-offerings</I> to the Lord, much less any other sacrifices. 

 (2.) If they should offer them, neither they nor their sacrifices shall 
 be pleasing to him, for they cannot have any legal offerings, nor are 
 their hearts humbled.

 (3.) Instead of their sacrifices of joy and praise, they shall <I>eat 
 the bread of mourners;</I> they shall live desolate, and disconsolate, 
 mourning for the death of their relations and their own miseries, so 
 that if they had opportunity of sacrificing they should never be 
 themselves in a frame fit for it; for they were forbidden to eat of the 
 holy things in <I>their mourning,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+26:14">Deut. xxvi. 14</A>

 <I>All that eat</I> of the bread of mourners <I>are polluted,</I> and
 incapacitated to <I>partake of the altar.</I>

 (4.) Their <I>bread for their soul,</I> the bread which they must 
 either eat or starve, the bread which they shall have for the support 
 of their lives, <I>shall not come into the house of the Lord;</I> they 
 shall have no house of the Lord to bring it to, or, if they had, it is 
 such as is not fit to be brought, nor are they rightly disposed to 
 bring it.

 (5.) The return of the days of their sacred and solemn feasts would 
 therefore be very melancholy and uncomfortable to them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>What will you do in the solemn day,</I> in the sabbath, <I>the 
 solemn day</I> of every week, in the <I>new moons,</I> the solemn days 
 of every month, at the return of the times for keeping the passover, 
 pentecost, and feast of the tabernacles, the solemn days of every year, 
 the <I>days of the feasts of the Lord?</I> Note, The feasts of the Lord 
 are solemn days; and, when we are invited to those feasts, we ought to 
 consider seriously what we shall do. But the question is here put to 
 those who were to be deprived of the benefit and comfort of those 
 solemn feasts, "<I>What will you do then?</I> You will then spend those 
 days in sorrow and lamentation which, if it had not been your own 
 fault, you might have been spending in joy and praise. You will then be 
 made to know the worth of mercies by the want of them and to prize 
 spiritual bread by being made to feel a famine of it." Note, When we 
 enjoy the means of grace we ought to consider what we shall do if ever 
 we should know the want of them, if either they should be taken from us 
 or we be disabled to attend upon them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. That they should perish in the land of their dispersion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):
 
 <I>For, lo, they have gone</I> out of the Lord's land, where they might 
 have spent both their sabbath days and other days with comfort, <I>gone 
 because of destruction,</I> gone to Egypt because of the destruction of 
 their own country by the Assyrians, flattering themselves with hopes 
 that they shall return when the storm is over; but those hopes also 
 shall fail them; they shall find there are <I>graves in Egypt,</I> as 
 their murmuring ancestors said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:11">Exod. xiv. 11</A>),

 graves for them; for <I>Egypt shall gather them up,</I> as dead men are
 gathered up and carried forth to the grave, and Memphis (one of the 
 chief cities of Egypt) <I>shall bury them. Gathering</I> and 
 <I>burying</I> are put together, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:2,Job+27:19">Jer. viii. 2; Job xxvii. 19</A>.

 Note, Those that think presumptuously to flee from the judgments of God
 are likely enough to meet their death where they hoped to save their 
 lives.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. That their land, which they left behind and to which they hoped to 
 return, should become a desolation: As for <I>their tabernacles,</I> 
 where they formerly dwelt and where they kept their stores, <I>the 
 pleasant places for their silver,</I> they shall be demolished and laid 
 in ruins, to such a degree that they shall be overgrown with 
 <I>nettles;</I> so that if they should survive the trouble, and return 
 to their own land again, they would find it neither fruitful nor 
 habitable; it would afford them neither food nor lodging. Note, Those 
 that make their money their god reckon the <I>places of their 
 silver</I> their <I>pleasant places,</I> as those that make the Lord 
 their God reckon his tabernacles amiable and his ordinances their 
 pleasant things, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:11">Isa. lxiv. 11</A>.

 But, while the pleasures of communion with God are out of the reach of
 chance and change, the <I>pleasant places of men's silver,</I> which 
 were purchased with silver, or in which they deposited their silver, or 
 which were beautified and adorned with silver, are liable to be laid in 
 ruins, in nettles, and therewith all the pleasure men took in them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are
 come; Israel shall know <I>it:</I> the prophet <I>is</I> a fool, the
 spiritual man <I>is</I> mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and
 the great hatred.
 &nbsp; 8  The watchman of Ephraim <I>was</I> with my God: <I>but</I> the prophet
 <I>is</I> a snare of a fowler in all his ways, <I>and</I> hatred in the
 house of his God.
 &nbsp; 9  They have deeply corrupted <I>themselves,</I> as in the days of
 Gibeah: <I>therefore</I> he will remember their iniquity, he will
 visit their sins.
 &nbsp; 10  I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your
 fathers as the first ripe in the fig tree at her first time: <I>but</I>
 they went to Baal-peor, and separated themselves unto <I>that</I>
 shame; and <I>their</I> abominations were according as they loved.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 For their further awakening, it is here threatened,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That the destruction spoken of shall come speedily. They shall have 
 no reason to hope for a long reprieve, for the judgment slumbers not; 
 it is at the door 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>The days of visitation have come,</I> and there shall be no more 
 delay; <I>the days of recompence have come,</I> which they have been so 
 often warned to expect; their prophets have told them that destruction 
 <I>would come,</I> and now <I>it has come,</I> and the time of the 
 divine patience has expired. Note, 

 1. The day of God's judgments is both a <I>day of visitation,</I> in
 which men's sins are enquired into and brought to light, and a <I>day 
 of recompence,</I> in which men's doom will be passed, and a reward 
 given to every man according to his work; the strict visitation is in 
 order to a just retribution. 

 2. This day of visitation and recompence is hastening on apace. It is
 sure; it is near; as if it had already come.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That hereby they shall be made ashamed of their sentiments 
 concerning their prophets. When the day of visitation comes <I>Israel 
 shall know it,</I> shall be made to know that by sad experience which 
 they would not know by instruction. <I>Israel shall know</I> then what 
 an <I>evil and bitter thing it</I> is to <I>depart from God,</I> and 
 what a <I>fearful thing</I> it is to <I>fall into his hands. When thy 
 hand is lifted up they will not see, but they shall see.</I> Israel 
 shall know the difference between true prophets and false. 

 1. They shall know then that the pretenders to prophecy, who flattered
 them in their sins, and rocked them asleep in their security, and told 
 them that they should have peace though they went on, however they 
 pretended to be <I>spiritual men</I> (as Ahab's prophets did,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+22:24">1 Kings xxii. 24</A>)

 were <I>fools</I> and <I>madmen,</I> and not true prophets; they
 deceived themselves and those to whom they prophesied. But why would 
 God suffer his people Israel to be imposed upon by those false 
 prophets? He answers, "<I>It is for the multitude of thy iniquity</I> 
 which, in contempt of the divine law, thou hast persisted in, <I>and, 
 for the great hatred of</I> the true prophets, that reproved thee, in 
 God's name, for it." Note, Because men receive not the love of the 
 truth, but conceive a hatred of it, and by the multitude of their 
 iniquities bid defiance to it, therefore God shall <I>send them strong 
 delusions, to believe a lie,</I> so strong that they shall not be 
 undeceived till the day of visitation and recompence comes, which will 
 convince them of the folly and madness of those that seduced them and 
 of their own folly and madness in suffering themselves to be seduced by 
 them. 

 2. They shall know then whether the <I>true prophets,</I> that were
 really <I>spiritual men,</I> guided by the Spirit of God, were such as 
 they called and counted them, <I>fools and madmen;</I> and they shall 
 be convinced that they were so far from being so that they were the 
 wise men of their times, and God's faithful ambassadors to them. When
 Israel saw that none of Samuel's words <I>fell to the ground</I> they 
 knew he was <I>established to be a prophet</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:20">1 Sam. iii. 20</A>);

 and so here, when God fulfils the word of his messengers, by bringing
 the days of recompence they foretold, then those that despised and 
 ridiculed them, and thought Bedlam the fittest place for them, will be 
 ashamed of <I>the multitude of their iniquities</I> of that kind, and 
 of <I>their great hatred,</I> for which God brings upon them this swift 
 destruction. Mocking the messengers of the Lord was the sin they were 
 punished for, and so made ashamed of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That hereby the wickedness of the false prophets themselves shall 
 be manifested to their shame 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>The watchman of Ephraim was with my God;</I> he had been formerly. 
 They had a set of worthy good ministers, that kept close to God and 
 maintained communion with him; but now they have a race of corrupt, 
 malignant, persecuting prophets, that are the ring-leaders of all 
 mischief." Or, "The <I>watchman of Ephraim</I> now pretends to have 
 been <I>with my God,</I> and prefaces his lies with, <I>Thus saith the 
 Lord;</I> but he is <I>a snare of a fowler in all his ways,</I> and is 
 cunning to draw the simple into sin and the upright into trouble; and 
 he is so full of hatred and enmity to goodness and good men that he has 
 become <I>hatred</I> itself <I>in the house of his God,</I> or 
 <I>against the house of his God.</I>" Note, Wicked prophets are the 
 worst of men; their sins against God are most heinous, and their plots 
 against religion most dangerous. They may boast that they are 
 <I>watchmen, speculators,</I> and, as far as speculation goes, they may 
 be right, and <I>with my God,</I> may have their heads full of good 
 notions; but look into their lives, and they are the <I>snare of a 
 fowler in all their ways,</I> catching for themselves and making a prey 
 of others; look into <I>their hearts,</I> and they are <I>hatred in the 
 house of my God,</I> very malicious and spiteful against good ministers 
 and good people. Woe unto thee, O land! unto thee, O church! that hast
 such watchmen, such prophets, that are seers, but not doers! 
 <I>Corruptio optimi est pessima--The best things, when corrupted, 
 become the worst.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That God will now reckon with them for the sins of their fathers, 
 which they have trod in the steps of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 1. They were as bad as their fathers: <I>They have deeply corrupted 
 themselves;</I> they are rooted and riveted in sin; they are far gone 
 in the <I>depths of Satan</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+31:6">Isa. xxxi. 6</A>),

 so that it is next to impossible that they should be recovered; the
 stain of their corruption is deep, not to be got out; it is as scarlet 
 and crimson, or as the spots of the leopard: and it is their own fault; 
 they have <I>corrupted themselves,</I> have polluted and hardened their 
 own hearts, as <I>in the days of Gibeah,</I> when the Levite's 
 concubine was abused to death by the men of Gibeah and the whole tribe 
 of Benjamin patronised the villany; that was a time of deep corruption 
 indeed, and such were the present days. Lewdness and wickedness were
 as impudent and daring now as in the days of Gibeah; and therefore what 
 can be expected but such a vengeance as was then taken on Gibeah? Every 
 tribe is now as bad as the tribe of Benjamin then was, and therefore 
 may expect to be brought as low as that tribe then was. 

 2. They shall therefore be reckoned with for their fathers' sins: <I>He
 will remember their iniquity and visit their sins,</I> the iniquity 
 they have by kind and by entail, the sin that runs in the blood; the 
 <I>sin of the father</I> shall now be <I>visited upon the children.</I> 
 Hence God takes occasion to upbraid them with the degeneracy and 
 apostasy of their ancestors, their perfidiousness and base ingratitude,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 Here observe, 

 (1.) The great honour God put upon Israel when he first formed them 
 into a people: <I>I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness.</I> He 
 took as much delight and pleasure in them as a poor traveller would do 
 if he found grapes in a wilderness, where he most needed them and least 
 expected them. Or when they were <I>in the wilderness</I> he <I>found 
 them as grapes,</I> not precious in themselves, but precious to him, 
 and pleasant as the first-ripe grapes to the lord of the vineyard. They 
 were <I>precious in his sight, and honourable</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:4">Isa. xliii. 4</A>);

 he planted them a <I>choice vine,</I> a <I>right seed</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:21">Jer. ii. 21</A>),

 and found them no better than he himself made them, good grapes at
 first. <I>I saw them</I> with pleasure, <I>as the first-ripe in the
 fig-tree at the first time.</I> Good people are compared to the <I>good 
 things that are first ripe,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+24:2">Jer. xxiv. 2</A>.

 One then is worth more than many afterwards. This intimates the delight
 God took in them and in doing them good, not for their sakes, but 
 because he loved their fathers. He preserved them carefully, as a man 
 does the first and choicest fruits of his vineyard. Now when he put all 
 this honour upon them, and they stood so fair for preferment, one would 
 think they should have maintained their excellency; but,

 (2.) See the great disgrace they put upon themselves. God set them
 apart for himself as a peculiar people, but they went to Baal-peor, 
 joined with the Moabites in sacrificing to that dirty dunghill deity 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:2,3">Num. xxv. 2, 3</A>),

 and they <I>separated themselves unto that shame,</I> that shameful 
 idol, so Baal-peor was in a particular manner, if (as should seem) the 
 <I>whoredom</I> which the people <I>committed with the daughters of 
 Moab</I> was a part of the service done to Baal-peor. Note, Whatever
 those separate themselves to that forsake God it will certainly be a 
 shame to them, first or last. <I>Their abominations</I> are here said
 to be <I>as they loved;</I> their practices which were an abomination 
 to God were as the best-beloved of their souls. Or when they had once 
 forsaken God they multiplied <I>their abominations,</I> their idols and 
 abominable idolatries, at their pleasure. This was the way of their 
 fathers; God had done well for them, but they had acted ungratefully 
 towards him, and in the same manner had the present generation 
 <I>deeply corrupted themselves.</I></P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the foregoing verses we saw the sin of Israel derived from their 
 fathers; here we see the punishment of Israel derived to their 
 children; for, as death entered by sin at first, so it is still 
 entailed with it. We may observe, in these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The sin of Ephraim. Some expressions are here which describe that. 
 
 1. <I>They did not hearken to God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);

 they did not give attention to the voice either of his word or of his 
 rod; they did not believe what he said, nor would they be ruled by him. 
 He told them their duty, their interest, their danger, but they 
 regarded him not; all he said to them by his words and by his prophets 
 was to them as a tale that is told; and then no wonder that we hear, 

 2. Of the <I>wickedness of their doings</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 the downright malice that was in their sins; they were not infirmities, 
 but daring presumptions. How can those but do wickedly who will not
 hearken to the word of God, that would teach and persuade them to do 
 well? And no wonder that there were wicked doings among them when, 

 3. Their worship was corrupt

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>All their wickedness is in Gilgal,</I> which was a place infamous 
 for idolatry, as appears,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:15,12:11,Am+4:4,5:5"><I>ch.</I> iv. 15; xii. 11; Amos iv. 4; v. 5</A>.

 It is probable that the idolaters chose that place for their
 head-quarters because it had been famous in other ages for solemn 
 transactions between God and Israel, as 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+5:2,10,1Sa+10:8,11:15">Josh. v. 2, 10; 1 Sam. x. 8; xi. 15</A>.

 There, where the source of idolatry was, whence it spread through the
 kingdom, there it might be said that <I>all their wickedness</I> was, 
 for all other wickedness owed its origin to that. Corruptions in
 worship make way for corruptions in morals. The <I>mother of 
 harlots</I> is the <I>mother of</I> all other <I>abominations,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:5">Rev. xvii. 5</A>.

 The learned Grotius conjectures that there is a mystical sense here. 
 Golgotha in Syriac is the same with Gilgal in Hebrew, and therefore he 
 thinks this may have reference to the putting of Christ to death at 
 Golgotha, which was the greatest sin of the Jewish nation, and of which 
 it might truly be said, <I>All their wickedness</I> was summed up in 
 that. And no wonder that the people did wickedly, both in worship and 
 conversation, when 

 4. <I>All their princes were revolters;</I> the whole succession of the
 kings of the ten tribes did evil in the sight of the Lord, or all the 
 set of judges and magistrates at this time were wicked; they turned 
 aside to sinful ways and persisted in those ways.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The displeasure of God against Ephraim for sin. This is variously 
 expressed here, to show what a provocation sin is to the pure eyes of 
 his glory, and how odious it makes the sinner to him. 

 1. He <I>departs from them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 When they revolt from him, and withdraw from their allegiance to him, 
 how can they expect but that he should depart from them and withdraw 
 both his protection and his bounty? And well may his threatening be 
 enforced as it is, and made terrible: <I>Woe also unto them when I 
 depart from them!</I> Note, Those are in a woeful condition indeed whom 
 God has forsaken. Our weal or woe depends upon the gracious presence of 
 God with us; and, if he goes, all weal goes with him and all woes come 
 upon us. <I>God has forsaken him; persecute and take him.</I> Saul knew 
 this when he laid such an emphasis upon this part of his complaint, 
 <I>The Philistines make war against me, and God has departed from 
 me.</I> Nay, he does not only depart from them, but, 

 2. He hates them. <I>In Gilgal,</I> where <I>all their wickedness is,
 there I hated them.</I> There, where the abominations of sin are 
 committed, there God abominates the sinners. In Gilgal he had bestowed 
 many tokens of his favour upon their ancestors, but now that is the 
 place where he hates them for their base ingratitude. Nay, he not only 
 hates them, but, 

 3. He <I>will love them no more,</I> will never take them into his
 favour again; the breach between God and Israel is wide as the sea, 
 which cannot be healed. This agrees with what he had said,

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:6,7"><I>ch.</I> i. 6, 7</A>),

 <I>I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel,</I> the ten
 tribes. 

 4. He will discard them, and have no more to do with them: <I>For the
 wickedness of their doings, I will drive them out of my house.</I> He 
 will no longer own them as his, or as belonging to his family in the 
 world; he will turn them out of doors as unfaithful tenants that pay 
 him no rent, as unprofitable servants that do him neither credit nor 
 work. Note, Those that profane God's house can expect no other than to 
 be expelled his house, and no longer suffered to be either lodgers in 
 it or retainers to it. Nay, he will not only drive them out of his 
 house, but,

 5. He will drive them far enough

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>My God will cast them away,</I> not only out of his house, but out
 of his sight; he will quite abandon and reject them; they shall be 
 <I>cast-aways.</I> God said that he would <I>drive them out of his 
 house,</I> and here the prophet seconds it, as one that knew his 
 Master's mind very well: <I>My God will cast them away.</I> See with 
 what comfort and pleasure he calls God his God. Note, When others 
 disown God, and are disowned by him, it is a very great satisfaction to 
 good people that they can call God their God, can cheerfully own him 
 and see themselves owned by him--all revolters, all ruined, yet God is 
 <I>my God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The fruit of this displeasure, in the cutting off and abandoning 
 of their posterity, which is the judgment here threatened again and 
 again. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How numerous Ephraim seemed likely to be. The name <I>Ephraim</I> is 
 derived from <I>fruitfulness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:51">Gen. xli. 51</A>.

 Joseph is a <I>fruitful bough,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:22">Gen. xlix. 22</A>.

 And Moses's blessing foretold the <I>ten thousands of Ephraim,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:17">Deut. xxxiii. 17</A>.
 
 This was his glory,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 For this he seemed designed by him that appoints the bounds of men's 
 habitation; for <I>Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, is planted in a pleasant 
 place,</I> to encourage his increase, which one may expect as from a 
 tree planted by the river's side. Ephraim is as strong and rich as ever 
 Tyre was, and as proud and secure. The Chaldee paraphrase gives this 
 sense of it, <I>The congregation of Israel, while they observed the 
 law, was like to Tyrus in prosperity and security.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How few Ephraim should be 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>Their glory shall fly away like a bird;</I> their children shall be 
 taken away and the hopes of their families cut off. All their glory 
 shall fly <I>as an eagle towards heaven,</I> swiftly and irrecoverably.
 Note, Worldly glory is glory that will <I>fly away;</I> but those that 
 have their God their glory have in him an unfading everlasting glory. 
 Ephraim has been as a fruitful tree. But now <I>Ephraim is smitten,</I> 
 is blasted; <I>their root is dried up; they shall bear no fruit,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 If the root be dried, the branch must wither of course. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) God's threatening this judgment of the destroying of their
 children. 

 [1.] They shall perish of themselves by the immediate hand of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 They shall <I>fly away from the birth, and from the womb, and from the 
 conception.</I> Some of their children shall die as soon as they are 
 born; the cradle shall be presently turned into a coffin. Others of
 them shall be <I>still-born,</I> or the womb shall be their grave, and 
 their death there their mothers' death too. Of others their mothers 
 shall miscarry almost as soon as they have conceived, and they shall be 
 as untimely fruit. See how easily God can, and how justly we are sure 
 he might, root out the whole race of mankind, that degenerate, guilty, 
 obnoxious race, and blot out the name of it from under heaven; it is 
 but doing as he does by Ephraim here, writing them all childless, 
 making all their glory to <I>fly away from the birth, the womb, and the 
 conception,</I> drying up their root, that they bear no fruit, and 
 their business is done in a few years. 

 [2.] They shall perish by the hand of their enemies; they shall die 
 violent deaths

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):
 
 "<I>Though they bring up their children</I> to some maturity, though 
 they escape the diseases and deaths which the infant age is liable to, 
 and are thought to be reared past danger, <I>yet will I bereave 
 them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 by one judgment or other, so that <I>there shall not be a man left</I> 
 to build up their families and bear up their name." Again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),
 
 <I>Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer.</I> The 
 mothers shall travail with pain to bear their children, and a great 
 deal of care, and pains, and cost shall be bestowed upon the nursing of 
 them, and when a cruel enemy comes and puts all to the word, young and 
 old, without mercy, then they seem but as lambs that were all this 
 while fed for the slaughter. Note, It is a great alloy to the comfort 
 parents have in their children that they know not what they have 
 brought them forth and brought them up for, perhaps <I>for the 
 murderer,</I> or, which is worse, to be themselves the plagues of their 
 generation. It is threatened again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 <I>Though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of 
 their womb,</I> those children that they are most fond of. Note, The 
 parents' love is no security to the children's lives; nay, sometimes 
 death is commissioned to take the darlings of the family and leave the 
 burdens of it. When sentence was passed upon Israel in the wilderness, 
 that they should all perish there, this mercy was mixed with the wrath, 
 that their children should nevertheless enter into that rest which they 
 through unbelief could not enter into. But this is a total and final 
 rejection; even their children shall be cut off, and the land shall 
 escheat to the crown, <I>ob defectum sanguinis--shall be lost for want 
 of heirs.</I> The Chaldee-paraphrase, and many of the rabbin, by the 
 <I>murderers</I> to whom the children were brought forth, understand 
 those that sacrificed their children to Moloch, a sin which was its own 
 punishment, which showed the parents void of bowels and justly left 
 them void of blessings. 

 [3.] Those few that escape and remain shall be dispersed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 They shall be <I>wanderers among the nations;</I> so the remains of the 
 Jews are at this day, and there is no place in the world where they are 
 a distinct nation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The prophet's prayer relating to it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>Give them, O Lord! what wilt thou give?</I> What shall I ask for a
 people thus doomed to destruction? It is this; since the decree has 
 gone forth, that they must either die from the womb or be brought forth 
 for the murderer, of the two let them rather <I>die from the womb.</I> 
 Rather let them have no children than have them to be made miserable; 
 for the same reason, when a total ruin was coming on the Jewish nation, 
 Christ said, <I>Blessed is the womb that never bore and the paps that 
 never gave suck,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:29">Luke xxiii. 29</A>.

 "Give therefore <I>a miscarrying womb and dry breasts;</I> for it is
 better to fall into the hands of the Lord, whose mercies are great, 
 than into the hands of man." Note, Those that are childless may with 
 this reconcile themselves to the will of God herein, that the time may 
 come when, if they were not so, they would wish they had been so.</P>
