 In this chapter, 

 I. God, by the prophet, proceeds in a like controversy with Moab as
 before with other nations, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. He shows what quarrel he had with Judah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:4,5">ver. 4, 5</A>.

 III. He at length begins his charge against Israel, to which all that
 goes before is but an introduction. Observe, 

 1. The sins they are charged with--injustice, oppression, whoredom, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:6-8">ver. 6-8</A>.

 2. The aggravations of those sins--the temporal and spiritual mercies
 God had bestowed upon them, for which they had made him such ungrateful
 returns, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:9-12">ver. 9-12</A>.

 3. God's complaint of them for their sins
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:13">ver. 13</A>)

 and his threatenings of their ruin, and their utter inability to
 prevent it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:14-16">ver. 14-16</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; For three transgressions of Moab, and
 for four, I will not turn away <I>the punishment</I> thereof; because
 he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:
 &nbsp; 2 But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the
 palaces of Kerioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with
 shouting, <I>and</I> with the sound of the trumpet:
 &nbsp; 3 And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will
 slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 4 Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; For three transgressions of Judah, and
 for four, I will not turn away <I>the punishment</I> thereof; because
 they have despised the law of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and have not kept his
 commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the which
 their fathers have walked:
 &nbsp; 5 But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the
 palaces of Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 6 Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; For three transgressions of Israel, and
 for four, I will not turn away <I>the punishment</I> thereof; because
 they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of
 shoes;
 &nbsp; 7 That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the
 poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his
 father will go in unto the <I>same</I> maid, to profane my holy name:
 &nbsp; 8 And they lay <I>themselves</I> down upon clothes laid to pledge by
 every altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned <I>in</I> the
 house of their god.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The judgment of Moab, another of the nations that bordered upon 
 Israel. They are reckoned with and shall be punished <I>for three 
 transgressions and for four,</I> as those before. Now, 

 1. Moab's fourth transgression, as theirs who were before set to the
 bar, was cruelty. The instance given refers not to the people of God,
 but to a heathen like themselves: The king of Moab <I>burnt the bones
 of the king of Edom into lime.</I> We find there was war between the
 Edomites and the Moabites, in which the king of Moab, in distress and
 rage, offered his own son for a burnt-offering, to appease his deity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:26,27">2 Kings iii. 26, 27</A>.

 And it should seem that afterwards he, or some of his successors, in
 revenge upon the Edomites for bringing him to that extremity, having an 
 advantage against the <I>king of Edom,</I> seized him alive and burnt 
 him to ashes, or slew him and burnt his body, or dug up the bones of 
 their dead king, of that particularly who had so straitened him, and, 
 in token of his rage and fury, <I>burnt them to lime.</I> and perhaps 
 made use of the powder of his bones for the white-washing of the walls 
 and ceilings of his palace, that he might please himself with the sight 
 of that monument of his revenge. <I>Est vindicta bonum vita jucundius 
 ipsa--Revenge is sweeter than life itself.</I> It is barbarous to abuse 
 human bodies, for we ourselves also are <I>in the body;</I> it is 
 senseless to abuse dead bodies, nay, it is impious, for we believe and 
 look for their resurrection; and to abuse the dead bodies of kings 
 (whose persons and names ought to be in a particular manner respected 
 and had in veneration) is an affront to majesty; it is an argument of a 
 base spirit for those to trample upon a dead lion who, were he alive, 
 would tremble before him. 
 
 2. Moab's doom for this transgression is,

 (1.) A judgment of death. Those that deal cruelly shall be cruelly
 dealt with

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>Moab shall die;</I> the Moabites shall be cut off with the sword of 
 war, which kills <I>with tumult, with shouting, and with sound of 
 trumpet,</I> circumstances that make it so much the more terrible, as 
 the lion's roaring aggravates his tearing. <I>Every battle of the 
 warrior is with confused noise,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:5">Isa. ix. 5</A>.

 (2.) It is a judgment upon their judge, who had passed the sentence
 upon the bones of the king of Edom that they should be burnt to lime: 
 <I>I will cut him off,</I> says God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 he shall know there is a judge that is higher than he. The king, the 
 chief judge, and all the inferior judges and princes, shall be cut off 
 together. If the people sometimes suffer for the sin of their princes, 
 yet the princes themselves shall not escape, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:47">Jer. xlviii. 47</A>.

 <I>Thus far is the judgment of Moab.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Judah also is a near neighbour to Israel, and therefore, now that 
 justice is riding the circuit, that shall not be passed by; that nation 
 has made itself like the heathen and mingled with them, and therefore 
 the indictment here runs against them in the same form in which it had 
 run against all the rest: <I>For these transgressions of Judah, and for 
 four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof;</I> their sins are 
 as many as the sins of other nations, and we find them huddled up with 
 them in the same character, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:26">Jer. ix. 26</A>,

 "As for <I>Egypt, and Judah, and Edom,</I> jumble them together; they 
 are all alike;" the sentence here also is the same

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>I will send a fire upon Judah,</I> though it is the land where God 
 is known, and it shall <I>devour the palaces of Jerusalem,</I> though 
 it is the holy city, and God has formerly been <I>known in its palaces 
 for a refuge,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:3">Ps. xlviii. 3</A>.

 But the sin here charged upon Judah is different from all the rest. The
 other nations were reckoned with for injuries done to men, but Judah is 
 reckoned with for indignities done to God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 1. They put contempt upon his statutes and persisted in disobedience to 
 them: <I>They have despised the law of the Lord,</I> as if it were not 
 worth taking notice of, nor had any thing in it valuable; and herein 
 they despised the wisdom, justice, and goodness, as well as the 
 authority and sovereignty, of the Lawmaker; this they did, in effect, 
 when they <I>kept not his commandments,</I> made no conscience of them, 
 took no care about them.

 2. They put honour upon his rivals, their idols, here called <I>their
 lies</I> which caused <I>them to err;</I> for <I>an image is a teacher 
 of lies,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:18">Hab. ii. 18</A>.

 And those that are led away into the error of idolatry are by that led
 into a multitude of other errors, <I>Uno dato absurdo mille 
 sequuntur--One absurdity draws after it a thousand.</I> God is an 
 infinite eternal Spirit; but, when the <I>truth of God</I> is by 
 idolatry <I>changed into a lie,</I> all his other truths are in danger 
 of being so changed likewise; thus their idols caused them to err, and 
 God justly gave them up to strong delusions; nor was it any excuse for 
 their sin that they were lies <I>after which their father walked,</I> 
 for they should rather have taken warning than taken pattern by those 
 that perished with these <I>lies in their right hand.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We now at length come to <I>the words</I> which <I>Amos saw 
 concerning Israel.</I> The reproofs and threatenings having walked the 
 round, here they centre, here they settle. He begins with them as with 
 the rest: <I>For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will 
 not turn away the punishment thereof;</I> it all these nations must be 
 punished for their iniquities, shall Israel go unpunished? Observe here 
 what their sins were, for which God would reckon with them. 

 1. Perverting justice. This was the sin of those who were entrusted
 with the administration of justice, the judges and magistrates, and all 
 parties concerned. They made nothing of selling a righteous man, and 
 his righteous cause when it came to be tried before them, for a piece 
 of silver; sentence was passed, not according to the merits of the 
 cause, but the bribe always turned the scale, and judgment was set to 
 sale by auction to the highest bidder. They would sell the life and 
 livelihood of a <I>poor</I> man <I>for a pair of shoes,</I> for the 
 least advantage to themselves that could be proposed to them; give them 
 but a <I>pair of shoes,</I> and the cause of a poor man, who could not 
 give them as much as that, should be betrayed, and left at the mercy of 
 those that will have no mercy. They will rather play at small game that 
 sit out. <I>For a piece of bread such a man will transgress.</I> Note, 
 Those who will wrong their consciences for any thing will come at 
 length to do it for next to nothing; those who begin to sell justice 
 for silver will in time be so sordid as to see it <I>for a pair of 
 shoes,</I> for a pair of old shoes. 

 2. Oppressing the poor, and seeking to benefit themselves by doing them
 a mischief: <I>They pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the 
 poor;</I> they swallow up the poor with the utmost greediness, and make 
 a prey of those that are in sorrow with dust on their heads, poor 
 orphans that are in mourning for their parents; they catch at them to 
 get their estates into their hands; they never rest till they have got 
 the heads of the poor in the dust, to be trodden on. Or, <I>They pant 
 after the dust of the earth,</I> that is, silver and gold, white and 
 yellow dust; they covet it earnestly, and levy it <I>upon the head of 
 the poor</I> by their unjust exactions. Note, Men's seeking to enrich
 themselves by the impoverishing of others is a transgression which God 
 will not long <I>turn away the punishment of.</I> This is <I>turning 
 aside the way of the meek,</I> contriving to do injury to those who, 
 they know, are mild and patient and will bear injury. They invade their 
 rights, break their measures, and obstruct the course of justice in 
 favour of them, not suffering them to go on with their righteous cause; 
 this is <I>turning aside their way.</I> Note, The more patiently men 
 bear injuries that are done them the greater is the sin of those that 
 injure them, and the more occasion they have to expect that God will 
 give them redress, and take vengeance for them. I, <I>as a deaf man, 
 heard not,</I> and then <I>thou wilt hear.</I> 

 3. Abominable uncleanness, even incest itself, such as it not named
 among the Gentiles, that <I>a man should have his father's wife</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:1">1 Cor. v. 1</A>),

 his father's concubine: <I>A man and his father will go in unto the
 same young woman,</I> as black an instance as any other of an unbounded 
 promiscuous lust; and yet where the former iniquities of oppression and 
 extortion are this also is found; for laws of modesty seldom hold those 
 that have broken the bands of justice and <I>cast away its cords</I> 
 from them. This wickedness is such a scandal to religion, and the 
 profession of it, that those who are guilty of it are looked upon as 
 designing thereby to <I>profane God's holy name,</I> and to render it 
 odious among the heathen, as if he countenanced the villainies which 
 those who pretend relation to him allow themselves in, and were 
 altogether such a one as they. 

 4. Regaling themselves and yet pretending to honour their God with that
 which they had got by oppression and extortion,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 They add idolatry to their injustice, and then think to atone for their 
 injustice with their idolatry. 

 (1.) They make merry with that which they have unjustly squeezed from 
 the poor. They <I>lay themselves down</I> at ease, and in state, and 
 stretch themselves upon <I>clothes laid to pledge,</I> which they ought 
 to have restored the same night, according to the law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:12,13">Deut. xxiv. 12, 13</A>.
 
 And they <I>drink the wine of the condemned,</I> of such as they have
 fined and laid heavy mulcts upon, spending that in sensuality which 
 they have got by injustice.

 (2.) They think to make atonement for this by feasting on the gains of 
 oppression <I>before their altars,</I> and <I>drinking this wine in the 
 house of their God,</I> in the temples where they worshipped their 
 calves, as if they would make God a <I>partner in their crimes</I> by 
 making him a <I>partner of the profits</I> of them--service good enough 
 for false gods; but the true God will not thus be mocked; he has 
 declared that he <I>hates robbery for burnt-offerings,</I> and cannot 
 be served acceptably but with that which is got honestly.</P>

 &nbsp; 10 Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you
 forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the
 Amorite.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. God puts his people Israel in mind of the great things he has done 
 for them, in putting them into possession of the land of Canaan, the 
 greatest part of which these ten tribes now enjoyed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 Note, We need often to be reminded of the mercies we have received, 
 which are the heaviest aggravations of the sins we have committed. God 
 gives liberally, and upbraids us not with our meanness and 
 unworthiness, and the disproportion between his gifts and our merits; 
 but he justly upbraids us with our ingratitude, and ill requital of his 
 favours, and tells us what he has done for us, to shame us for not 
 rendering again according to the benefit done to us. "<I>Son, 
 remember;</I> Israel, remember, 

 1. That God brought thee out of a house of bondage, rescued thee out of
 the <I>land of Egypt,</I> where thou wouldst otherwise have perished in 
 slavery." 

 2. That he <I>led thee forty years</I> through a desert land, and fed
 thee in a <I>wilderness,</I> where thou wouldst otherwise have perished 
 with hunger. Mercies to our ancestors were mercies to us, for, if they 
 had been cut off, we should not have been.

 3. That he made room for them in Canaan, by extirpating the natives by
 a series of wonders little inferior to those by which they were 
 redeemed out of Egypt: <I>I destroyed the Amorite before them,</I> here 
 put for all the devoted nations. Observe the magnificence of the 
 enemies that stood in their way, which is taken notice of, that God may 
 be the more magnified in the subduing of them. They were of great 
 stature (<I>whose height was like the height of the cedars</I>) and the 
 people of Israel were as shrubs to them; and they were also of great 
 strength, not only tall, but well-set: <I>He was strong as the 
 oaks.</I> Their kingdom was eminent among the nations, and over-topped 
 all its neighbours. The supports and defences of it seemed impregnable; 
 it was as fine as the stately cedar; it was as firm as the sturdy oak; 
 yet, when God had a vine to plant there

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:8,9">Ps. lxxx. 8, 9</A>),

 this Amorite was not only cut down, but plucked up: <I>I destroyed his
 fruit from above and his roots from beneath,</I> so that the Amorites
 were no more a nation, nor ever read of any more. Thus highly did God
 value Israel. He gave men <I>for them and people for their life,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:4">Isa. xliii. 4</A>.

 How ungrateful then were those who put such contempt upon him!

 4. That he made them <I>possess the land of the Amorite,</I> not only
 put it into their hands, so that they became masters of it <I>jure 
 belli--by right of conquest,</I> but gave them a better title to it, so 
 that it became theirs by promise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He likewise upbraids them with the spiritual privileges and 
 advantages they enjoyed as a holy nation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 They had helps for their souls, which taught them how to make good use 
 of their temporal enjoyments and were therefore more valuable. It is 
 true the <I>ten tribes</I> had not God's temple, altar, and priesthood, 
 and it was their own fault that they deserted them, and for that they 
 might justly have been left in utter darkness; but God <I>left not 
 himself without witness,</I> nor them without guides to show them the 
 way. 

 1. They had prophets that were powerful instructors in piety, divinely
 inspired, and commissioned to make known the mind of God to them, to 
 show them what is pleasing to God and what displeasing, to reprove them 
 for their faults and warn them of their dangers, to direct them in 
 their difficulties and comfort them in their troubles. God raised them 
 up prophets, animated them for that work and employed them in it. He 
 <I>raised</I> them <I>up of their sons,</I> from among themselves, as 
 Moses and Christ were raised up <I>from among their brethren,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+18:15">Deut. xviii. 15</A>.

 It was an honour put upon their nation, and upon their families, that
 they had children of their own to be God's messengers to them, of their 
 own language, not strangers sent from another country, whom they might 
 suspect to be prejudiced against them and their land, but those who, 
 they knew, wished well to them. Note, Faithful ministers are great 
 blessings to any people, and it is God that raises them up to be so, 
 that they may justly be reckoned an honour to the families they are of.

 2. They had Nazarites that were bright examples of piety: <I>I raised
 up of your young men for Nazarites,</I> men that bound themselves by a 
 vow to God and his service, and, in pursuance of that, denied 
 themselves many of the lawful delights of sense, as drinking wine and 
 eating grapes. There were some of their young men that were in their 
 prime for the enjoyment of the pleasures of this life and yet 
 voluntarily abridged themselves of them; these God raised up by the 
 power of his grace, to be <I>monuments of his grace,</I> to his glory, 
 and to be his witnesses against the impieties of that degenerate age.
 Note, It is as great a blessing to any place to have eminent good 
 Christians in it as to have eminent good ministers in it; for so they 
 have examples to their rules. We must acknowledge that it bodes well
 to any people when God raises up numbers of hopeful young people among 
 them, when he makes their young men Nazarites, devout, and 
 conscientious, and mortified to the pleasures of sense; and those that 
 are such Nazarites are <I>purer than snow, whiter than milk;</I> they 
 are indeed the polite young men, for their <I>polishing is of 
 sapphires,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lam+4:7">Lam. iv. 7</A>.

 Those that have such men, such young men, among them, have therein such
 an advantage, both for direction and encouragement, to be religious, as 
 they will be called to an account for another day if they do not 
 improve. Israel is here reckoned with, not only for the prophets, but 
 for the Nazarites, raised up among them. Concerning the truth of this,
 he appeals to themselves: "<I>Is it not even thus, O you children of 
 Israel?</I> Can you deny it? Have not you yourselves been sensible of 
 the advantage you had by the prophets and Nazarites raised up among 
 you?" Note, Sinners' own consciences will be witnesses for God that he 
 has not been wanting to them in the means of grace, so that, if they 
 perish, it is because they have been wanting to themselves in not 
 improving those means. The men of Judah shall themselves <I>judge 
 between God and his vineyard,</I> whether he could have done more for 
 it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:3,4">Isa. v. 3, 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He charges them with the abuse of the means of grace they enjoyed, 
 and the opposition they gave to God's designs in affording them those 
 means, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 They were so far from walking in the light that they rebelled against 
 it, and did what they could to extinguish it, that it might not shine 
 in their faces, to their conviction. 

 1. They did what they could to debauch good people, to draw them off
 from their seriousness in devotion and their strictness in 
 conversation: <I>You gave the Nazarites wine to drink,</I> contrary to 
 their vow, that, having broken it in that instance, they might not 
 pretend to keep it in any other. Some they surprised, or allured into
 it, and <I>with their much fair speech caused them to yield;</I> others 
 they forced and frightened into it, reproached and threatened them if 
 they were more precise than their neighbours; and, by drawing them in 
 to drink wine, they spoiled them for Nazarites. Note, Satan and his 
 agents are very busy to corrupt the minds of young people that look 
 heavenward; and many that we thought would have been Nazarites they 
 have overcome by giving them wine to drink, by drawing them in to the 
 love of mirth and pleasure, and drinking company. Multitudes of young 
 men that bade fair for eminent professors of religion have <I>erred 
 through wine,</I> and been undone for ever. And how do the factors for 
 hell triumph in the debauching of a Nazarite! 

 2. They did what they could to silence good ministers, and to stop
 their mouths: "<I>You commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not,</I> 
 and threatened them if they did prophesy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:12"><I>ch.</I> vii. 12</A>),

 as if God's messengers were bound to observe your orders, and might not
 deliver their errand unless you gave them leave, and so you not only 
 <I>received the grace of God,</I> in raising up those prophets, <I>in 
 vain,</I> but put the highest affront imaginable upon that God in whose 
 name the prophets spoke." Note, Those have a great deal to answer for 
 that cannot bear faithful preaching, and those much more that suppress 
 it.</P>

 IV. He complains of the wrong they did him by their sins 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 "<I>I am pressed under you,</I> I am <I>straitened</I> by you, and can 
 no longer bear it, and therefore <I>I will ease myself of my 
 adversaries,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:24">Isa. i. 24</A>.

 <I>I am pressed under you</I> and the load of your sins <I>as a cart is
 pressed that is full of sheaves,</I> is loaded with corn, in the midst 
 of the <I>joy of harvest,</I> as long as any will lie on." Note, The 
 great God complains of sin, especially the sins of his professing 
 people, as a burden to him. He is <I>grieved with this generation</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:10">Ps. xcv. 10</A>),

 <I>is broken with their whorish heart</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+6:9">Ezek. vi. 9</A>),

 a consideration which, if it make not the sinner's repentance very
 deep, will make his ruin very great. The great God that upholds the 
 world, and never complains that his is pressed under the weight of it 
 (he <I>fainteth not, neither is weary</I>), yet complains of the sins 
 of Israel, yea, and of their hypocritical services too, that he is 
 <I>weary of bearing them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:14">Isa. i. 14</A>.

 No wonder the <I>creature groans being burdened</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:22">Rom. viii. 22</A>),

 when the Creator says, <I>I am pressed under them.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He threatens them with unavoidable ruin. And so some read, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>,

 "<I>Behold I will press,</I> or straiten, <I>your place, as a cart full 
 of sheaves presses;</I> they shall be loaded with judgments till they 
 shall sink under them, and shall make a noise, as a cart overloaded 
 does." Those that will not submit to the convictions of the word, that 
 will neither be won by that nor by the conversation of those about 
 them, shall be made to sink under the weight of God's judgments. If God 
 load us daily with his benefits, and we, notwithstanding that, load him 
 with our sins, how can we expect any other than that he should load us 
 with his judgments? And it is here threatened in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:14-16">last three verses</A>

 that, when God comes forth to contend with this provoking people, they
 shall not be able to stand before him, to flee from him, nor to make
 their part good with him; for when God judges he will overcome. Though 
 his patience be tired out, his power is not, and so the sinner shall 
 find, to his cost. When the Assyrian army comes to lay the country 
 waste by sword and captivity none shall escape, but every one shall 
 have his share in the common desolation. 

 1. It will be in vain to think of fleeing from the enemy that comes
 armed with a commission to make all desolate: <I>The flight shall 
 perish from the swift;</I> those that have been famed for happy escapes 
 and happy retreats shall now find their arts fail them; they shall have 
 no time to flee, or shall find no way to take, or they shall have no 
 strength or spirit to attempt it; they shall be at their wits' end, and 
 then they are soon at their flight's end. Are they, as Asahel, as 
 <I>swift of foot as a wild roe?</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+2:18">2 Sam. ii. 18</A>),

 yet, like him, they shall run the faster upon their own destruction:
 <I>He that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Or do they say (as those, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:16">Isa. xxx. 16</A>),

 <I>We will flee upon horses,</I> and <I>we will ride upon the
 swift?</I> Yet they shall be overtaken: <I>Neither shall he that rides 
 the horse deliver himself</I> from his pursuers. <I>A horse is a vain 
 thing for safety.</I> 

 2. It will be in vain to think of fighting it out. God is at war with
 them; and <I>are they stronger than he?</I> Is there any military force 
 that can pretend to be a match for Omnipotence? No: <I>The strong shall 
 not strengthen his force.</I> He that has a habit of strength shall not 
 be able to exert it when he has occasion for it. And <I>the
 mighty,</I> whose should protect and deliver others, shall not be able 
 to <I>deliver himself,</I> to deliver <I>his soul</I> (so the word is), 
 shall not save his life. Let not the <I>strong man</I> then <I>glory in 
 his strength,</I> nor trust in it, but <I>strengthen himself in the 
 Lord his God,</I> for in him is <I>everlasting strength.</I> And, as 
 the bodily strength shall fail, so shall the weapons of war. The armour 
 as well as the arm shall become insufficient: <I>Neither shall he stand 
 that handles the bow,</I> though he stand at a distance, but shall 
 betake himself to flight, and not trust to his own bow to save him.
 Though the arm be ever so strong, and the armour ever so well fixed, 
 neither will avail when the spirit fails

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>He that is courageous among the mighty,</I> that used to look danger 
 in the face, and not be dismayed at it, shall <I>flee away naked in 
 that day,</I> not only disarmed, having thrown away his weapons both 
 offensive and defensive, but plundered of his treasure, which he 
 thought to carry away with him, and he shall think it as much as he 
 could expect that he has <I>his life for a prey.</I> Thus when God 
 pleases <I>he takes away the heart of the chief of the people of the 
 earth,</I> and causes those who used to boast of their courage, and 
 their daring enterprises in the field, to <I>wander</I> and sneak <I>in 
 a wilderness where there is no way,</I>
