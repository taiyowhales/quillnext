 The prophet, having given us a view of the mystical temple, the 
 gospel-church, as he received it from the Lord, that it might appear 
 not to be erected in vain, comes to describe, in this and the next 
 chapter, the worship that should be performed in it, but under the type 
 of the Old-Testament services. In this chapter we have, 

 I. Possession taken of this temple, by the glory of God filling it, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. A promise given of the continuance of God's presence with his
 people upon condition of their return to, and continuance in, the 
 instituted way of worship, and their abandoning idols and idolatry, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:7-12">ver. 7-12</A>.

 III. A description of the altar of burnt-offerings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:13-17">ver. 13-17</A>.
 
 IV. Directions given for the consecration of that altar, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:18-27">ver. 18-27</A>.
 
 Ezekiel seems here to stand between God and Israel, as Moses the
 servant of the Lord did when the sanctuary was first set up.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Afterward he brought me to the gate, <I>even</I> the gate that
 looketh toward the east:
 &nbsp; 2  And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way
 of the east: and his voice <I>was</I> like a noise of many waters: and
 the earth shined with his glory.
 &nbsp; 3  And <I>it was</I> according to the appearance of the vision which
 I saw, <I>even</I> according to the vision that I saw when I came to
 destroy the city: and the visions <I>were</I> like the vision that I
 saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.
 &nbsp; 4  And the glory of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came into the house by the way of
 the gate whose prospect <I>is</I> toward the east.
 &nbsp; 5  So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner
 court; and, behold, the glory of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> filled the house.
 &nbsp; 6  And I heard <I>him</I> speaking unto me out of the house; and the
 man stood by me.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 After Ezekiel has patiently surveyed the temple of God, the greatest 
 glory of this earth, he is admitted to a higher form, and honoured with 
 a sight of the glories of the upper world; it is said to him, <I>Come 
 up hither.</I> He has seen the temple, and sees it to be very spacious 
 and splendid; but, till the glory of God comes into it, it is but like 
 the dead bodies he had seen in vision 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:1-28"><I>ch.</I> xxxvii.</A>),

 that had <I>no breath</I> till the Spirit of life entered into them.
 Here therefore he sees the house filled with God's glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He has a vision of <I>the glory of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 <I>the glory of the God of Israel,</I> that God who is in covenant with 
 Israel, and whom they serve and worship. The idols of the heathen have 
 no glory but what they owe to the goldsmith or the painter; but this is 
 the glory of the God of Israel. This glory <I>came from the way of the 
 east,</I> and therefore he was brought to the <I>gate that leads 
 towards the east,</I> to expect the appearance and approach of it. 
 Christ's <I>star was seen in the east,</I> and he is that <I>other 
 angel that ascends out of the east,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:2">Rev. vii. 2</A>.

 For he is the morning star, he is the sun of righteousness. Two things 
 he observed in this appearance of the glory of God:--

 1. The power of his word which he heard: <I>His voice was like a noise 
 of many waters,</I> which is heard very far, and makes impressions; the 
 noise of purling streams is grateful, of a roaring sea dreadful,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:15,14:2">Rev. i. 15; xiv. 2</A>.

 Christ's gospel, in the glory of which he shines, was to be proclaimed 
 aloud, the report of it to be heard far; to some it is a savour of 
 life, to others of death, according as they are. 

 2. The brightness of his appearance which he saw: <I>The earth shone 
 with his glory;</I> for God is light, and none can bear the lustre of 
 his light, none <I>has seen</I> nor <I>can see it.</I> Note, That glory 
 of God which shines in the church shines on the world. When God 
 appeared for David <I>the brightness that was before him</I> dispersed 
 the clouds, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:12">Ps. xviii. 12</A>.

 This appearance of the glory of God to Ezekiel he observed to be the
 same with the vision he saw when he first received his commission

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:4"><I>ch.</I> i. 4</A>),

 <I>according to that by the river Chebar</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 because God is the same, he was pleased to manifest himself in the same
 manner, for with him is <I>no variableness.</I> "It was the same" (says 
 he) "as that which I saw <I>when I came to destroy the city,</I> that 
 is, to foretel the city's destruction," which he did with such 
 authority and efficacy, and the event did so certainly answer the 
 prediction, that he might be said to destroy it. As a judge, in God's 
 name, he passed a sentence upon it, which was soon executed. God 
 appeared in the same manner when he sent him to speak words of terror 
 and when he sent him to speak words of comfort; for in both God is and 
 will be glorified. <I>He kills and he makes alive;</I> he <I>wounds and 
 he heals,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:39">Deut. xxxii. 39</A>.

 To the same hand that destroyed we must look for deliverance. <I>He has
 smitten, and he will bind up. Una eademque manus vulnus opemque 
 tulit--The same hand inflicted the wound and healed it.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He has a vision of the entrance of this glory into the temple. When 
 he saw this glory he <I>fell upon his face</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 as not <I>able</I> to bear the lustre of God's glory, or rather as one 
 willing to give him the glory of it by a humble and reverent adoration. 
 But the Spirit <I>took him up</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 when the <I>glory of the Lord</I> had <I>come into the house</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 that he might see how the house was filled with it. He saw how the 
 glory of the Lord in this same appearance departed from the temple, 
 because it was profaned, to his great grief; now he shall see it return 
 to the temple to his great satisfaction. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:18,19,11:23"><I>ch.</I> x. 18, 19; xi. 23</A>.

 Note, Though God may forsake his people for a small moment, he will
 return with everlasting loving-kindness. God's glory <I>filled the 
 house</I> as it had filled the tabernacle which Moses set up and the 
 temple of Solomon,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+40:34,1Ki+8:10">Exod. xl. 34; 1 Kings viii. 10</A>.

 Now we do not find that ever the Shechinah did in that manner take
 possession of the second temple, and therefore this was to have its 
 accomplishment in that glory of the divine grace which shines so 
 brightly in the gospel church, and fills it. Here is no mention of a 
 cloud filling the house as formerly, for we now <I>with open face 
 behold the glory of the Lord,</I> in the face of Christ, and not as of 
 old through the cloud of types.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He receives instructions more immediately from the glory of the 
 Lord, as Moses did when God had taken possession of the tabernacle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+1:1">Lev. i. 1</A>):

 <I>I heard him speaking to me out of the house,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 God's glory shining in the church, we must thence expect to receive 
 divine oracles. <I>The man stood by me;</I> we could not bear to hear
 the voice of God any more than to see the face of God if Jesus Christ 
 did not stand by us as Mediator. Or, if this was a created angel, it is 
 observable that when God began to speak to Ezekiel he stood by and gave 
 way, having no more to say. Nay, he stood by the prophet, as a learner 
 with him; for <I>to the principalities and powers,</I> to the angels 
 themselves, who <I>desire to look into</I> these things, <I>is known by 
 the church the manifold wisdom of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:10">Eph. iii. 10</A>.

 The man stood by him to conduct him thither where he might receive
 further discoveries,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and
 the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the
 midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall
 the house of Israel no more defile, <I>neither</I> they, nor their
 kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcases of their kings in
 their high places.
 &nbsp; 8  In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and
 their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they
 have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they
 have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger.
 &nbsp; 9  Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of
 their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them
 for ever.
 &nbsp; 10  Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that
 they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the
 pattern.
 &nbsp; 11  And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them
 the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings
 out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms
 thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms
 thereof, and all the laws thereof: and write <I>it</I> in their sight,
 that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances
 thereof, and do them.
 &nbsp; 12  This <I>is</I> the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain
 the whole limit thereof round about <I>shall be</I> most holy. Behold,
 this <I>is</I> the law of the house.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God does here, in effect, renew his covenant with his people Israel, 
 upon his retaking possession of the house, and Ezekiel negotiates the 
 matter, as Moses formerly. This would be of great use to the captives 
 at their return both for direction and encouragement; but it looks 
 further, to those that are blessed with the privileges of the 
 gospel-temple, that they may understand how they are before him on 
 their good behaviour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God, by the prophet, puts them in mind of their former provocations, 
 for which they had long lain under the tokens of his displeasure. This 
 conviction is spoken to them to make way for the comforts designed 
 them. Though God <I>gives and upbraids not,</I> it becomes us, when he 
 forgives, to upbraid ourselves with our unworthy conduct towards him. 
 Let them now remember therefore, 

 1. That they had formerly <I>defiled God's holy name,</I> had profaned
 and abused all those sacred things by which he had made himself known 
 among them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 <I>They and their kings</I> had brought contempt on the religion they 
 professed, and their relation to God, by their spiritual whoredom, 
 their idolatry, and by worshipping images, which they called <I>their 
 kings</I> (for so <I>Moloch</I> signifies) or lords (for so <I>Baal</I> 
 signifies), but which were really the <I>carcases of kings,</I> not 
 only lifeless and useless, but loathsome and abominable as dead 
 carcases, <I>in their high places,</I> set up in honour of them. They 
 had defiled God's name by their abominations. And what were they? It 
 was <I>in setting their threshold by my thresholds, and their post by 
 my posts,</I> that is, adding their own inventions to God's 
 institutions, and urging all to a compliance with them, as if they had 
 been of equal authority and efficacy, <I>teaching for doctrines the 
 commandments of men</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:13">Isa. xxix. 13</A>);

 or, rather, setting up altars to their idols even in the courts of the
 temple, than which a more impudent affront could not be put upon the 
 divine Majesty. Thus they set up a separation <I>wall between him and 
 them,</I> which stopped the current of his favours to them and spoiled 
 the acceptableness of their services to him. See what an indignity 
 sinners do to God, setting up their walls in opposition to his, and 
 thrusting him out from what is his right; and see what injury they do 
 to themselves, for the nearer any come to God with their sins the 
 further they set him at a distance from them. Some give this sense of 
 it: Though their houses joined close to God's house, their posts and 
 thresholds to hi, so that they were in a manner his next neighbours, 
 <I>there was but a wall between me and them</I> (so it is in the 
 margin), so that it might have been expected they would acquaint 
 themselves with him and be in care to please him, yet they were not so 
 much as neighbourly. Note, It often proves too true, <I>The nearer the 
 church the further from God.</I> They were, by profession, in covenant 
 with God, and yet they had <I>defiled the place of his throne</I> and 
 of <I>the soles of his feet,</I> his temple, where he did both reside 
 and reign. Jerusalem is called the <I>city of the great king</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:2">Ps. xlviii. 2</A>)

 and his <I>footstool,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+99:5,132:7">Ps. xcix. 5; cxxxii. 7</A>.

 Note, When God's ordinances are profaned his holy name is polluted.

 2. That for this God had had a controversy with them in their late 
 troubles. They could not condemn him, for he had but brought upon them 
 the desert of their sins: <I>Wherefore I have consumed them in my 
 anger.</I> Note, Those that pollute God's holy name fall under his just 
 displeasure.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He calls upon them to repent and reform, and, in order to that, to 
 be ashamed of their iniquities 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>Now let them put away their whoredom;</I> now that they have 
 smarted so severely for it, and now that God is returning in mercy to 
 them and setting up his sanctuary again in the midst of them, now let 
 them cast away their idols and have no more to do with them, that they 
 may not again forfeit the privileges which they have been taught to 
 know the worth of by the want of them. Let them put away their idols,
 those loathsome <I>carcases of their kings, far from me,</I> from being 
 a provocation to me." This was seasonable counsel now that the prophet 
 had the model or pattern of the temple to set before them; for, 

 1. If <I>they see that pattern,</I> they will surely be ashamed of
 their sins

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 when they see what mercy God has in store for them, notwithstanding 
 their utter unworthiness of it, they will be ashamed to think of their 
 disingenuous conduct towards him. Note, The goodness of God to us 
 should lead us to repentance, especially to a penitential shame. Let 
 <I>them measure the pattern</I> themselves, and see how much it exceeds 
 the former pattern, and guess by that what great things God has in 
 store for them; and surely it will put them out of countenance to think 
 what the desert of their sins was. And then, 

 2. If <I>they be ashamed</I> of their sins, they shall surely see more 
 of the pattern,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 If they <I>be ashamed of all that they have done,</I> upon a general 
 view of the goodness of God, let them have a more distinct particular 
 account of the temple. Note, Those that improve what they see and know
 of the goodness of God shall see and know more of it. And then, and not 
 till then, we are qualified for God's favours, when we are truly 
 humbled for our own follies. "<I>Show them the form of the house;</I> 
 let them see what a stately structure it will be; and withal show them 
 the ordinances and laws of it." Note, With the foresights of our 
 comforts it is fit that we should get the knowledge of our duty; with 
 the privileges of God's house we must acquaint ourselves with the rules 
 of it. <I>Show them</I> these ordinances, that they may <I>keep 
 them</I> and <I>do them.</I> Note, <I>Therefore</I> we are made to know 
 our duty, that we may do it, and be blessed in our deed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He promises that they shall be such as they should be, and then he 
 will be to them such as they would have him to be, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 1. The house of <I>Israel shall no more defile my holy name.</I> This 
 is pure gospel. The precept of the law says, You must not defile my 
 name: the grace of the gospel says, You shall not. Thus what is 
 required in the covenant is promised in the covenant, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:40">Jer. xxxii. 40</A>.

 2. Then <I>I will dwell in the midst of them for ever;</I> and the
 same again

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 God secures to us his good-will be confirming in us his good work. If 
 we do not defile his name, we may be sure that he will not depart from 
 us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The general law of God's house is laid down 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 That, whereas formerly only the chancel, or sanctuary, was <I>most 
 holy,</I> now the whole <I>mountain of the house</I> shall be so; the 
 <I>whole limit thereof,</I> including all the courts and all the 
 chambers, shall be as the most holy place, signifying that in 
 gospel-times, 

 1. The whole church shall have the privilege of the <I>holy of
 holies,</I> that of a near access to God. All believers have now, under 
 the gospel, <I>boldness to enter into the holiest</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:19">Heb. x. 19</A>),
 
 with this advantage, that whereas the high priest entered in the virtue
 of the blood of bulls and goats, we enter in the virtue of the blood of 
 Jesus, and, wherever we are, we have through him <I>access to the 
 Father.</I> 

 2. The whole church shall be under a mighty obligation to press
 towards the perfection of holiness, <I>as he who has called us is 
 holy.</I> All must now be most holy. <I>Holiness becomes God's 
 house</I> for ever, and in gospel-times more than ever. Behold this is
 the <I>law of the house;</I> let none expect the protection of it that 
 will not submit to this law.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  And these <I>are</I> the measures of the altar after the cubits:
 The cubit <I>is</I> a cubit and a hand breadth; even the bottom
 <I>shall be</I> a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border
 thereof by the edge thereof round about <I>shall be</I> a span: and
 this <I>shall be</I> the higher place of the altar.
 &nbsp; 14  And from the bottom <I>upon</I> the ground <I>even</I> to the lower
 settle <I>shall be</I> two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from
 the lesser settle <I>even</I> to the greater settle <I>shall be</I> four
 cubits, and the breadth <I>one</I> cubit.
 &nbsp; 15  So the altar <I>shall be</I> four cubits; and from the altar and
 upward <I>shall be</I> four horns.
 &nbsp; 16  And the altar <I>shall be</I> twelve <I>cubits</I> long, twelve broad,
 square in the four squares thereof.
 &nbsp; 17  And the settle <I>shall be</I> fourteen <I>cubits</I> long and
 fourteen broad in the four squares thereof; and the border about
 it <I>shall be</I> half a cubit; and the bottom thereof <I>shall be</I> a
 cubit about; and his stairs shall look toward the east.
 &nbsp; 18  And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>;
 These <I>are</I> the ordinances of the altar in the day when they
 shall make it, to offer burnt offerings thereon, and to sprinkle
 blood thereon.
 &nbsp; 19  And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of
 the seed of Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister unto me,
 saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, a young bullock for a sin offering.
 &nbsp; 20  And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put <I>it</I> on
 the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and
 upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge
 it.
 &nbsp; 21  Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he
 shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the
 sanctuary.
 &nbsp; 22  And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats
 without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the
 altar, as they did cleanse <I>it</I> with the bullock.
 &nbsp; 23  When thou hast made an end of cleansing <I>it,</I> thou shalt
 offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock
 without blemish.
 &nbsp; 24  And thou shalt offer them before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and the priests
 shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up <I>for</I> a
 burnt offering unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 25  Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat <I>for</I> a sin
 offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out
 of the flock, without blemish.
 &nbsp; 26  Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and
 they shall consecrate themselves.
 &nbsp; 27  And when these days are expired, it shall be, <I>that</I> upon
 the eighth day, and <I>so</I> forward, the priests shall make your
 burnt offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I
 will accept you, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.

 This relates to the altar in this mystical temple, and that is mystical 
 too; for Christ is our altar. The Jews, after their return out of 
 captivity, had an altar long before they had a temple, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:3">Ezra iii. 3</A>.

 But this was an altar in the temple. Now here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The measures of the altar, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 It was six yards square at the top and seven yards square at the 
 bottom; it was four yards and a half high; it had a lower bench or 
 shelf, here called a <I>settle,</I> a yard from the ground, on which 
 some of the priests stood to minister, and another two yards above 
 that, on which others of them stood, and these were each of them half a 
 yard broad, and had ledges on either side, that they might stand firmly 
 upon them. The sacrifices were killed at the table spoken of before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:39"><I>ch.</I> xl. 39</A>.

 What was to be burnt on the altar was given up to those on the lower
 bench, and handed by them to those on the higher, and they laid it on 
 the altar. Thus in the service of God we must be assistant to one 
 another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The ordinances of the altar. Directions are here given, 

 1. Concerning the dedication of the altar at first. <I>Seven days</I>
 were to be spent in the dedication of it, and every day sacrifices were 
 to be offered upon it, and particularly a goat for a 
 <I>sin-offering</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 besides a young bullock for a <I>sin-offering</I> on the first day

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 which teaches us in all our religious services to have an eye to Christ 
 the great sin-offering. Neither our persons nor our performances can be 
 acceptable to God unless sin be taken away, and that cannot be taken 
 away but by the blood of Christ, which both sanctifies the altar (for 
 Christ entered by his own blood, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:12">Heb. ix. 12</A>)

 and the gift upon the altar. There were also to be a <I>bullock</I> and
 a ram offered for a <I>burnt-offering</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 which was intended purely for the glory of God, to teach us to have an 
 eye to that in all our services; we present ourselves as living 
 sacrifices, and our devotions as spiritual sacrifices, that we and they 
 may be to him for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory. The 
 dedication of the altar is here called the <I>cleansing</I> and 
 <I>purging</I> of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:20,26"><I>v.</I> 20, 26</A>.

 Christ, our altar, though he had no pollution to be cleansed from, yet 
 sanctified himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:19">John xvii. 19</A>);

 and when we consecrate the altars of our hearts to God, to have the
 fire of holy love always burning upon them, we must see that they be
 purified and cleansed from the love of the world and the lusts of the
 flesh. It is observable that there are several differences between the
 rites of dedication here and those which were appointed 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:1-46">Exod. xxix.</A>,

 to intimate that the ceremonial institutions were mutable things, and
 the changes in them were earnests of their period in Christ. Only here, 
 according to the general law, that all the sacrifices must be seasoned 
 with salt

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+2:13">Lev. ii. 13</A>),
 
 particular orders are given 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>)

 that the priests shall <I>cast salt upon the sacrifices. Grace</I> is 
 the <I>salt</I> with which all our religious performances must be 
 seasoned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:6">Col. iv. 6</A>.

 An everlasting covenant is called a <I>covenant of salt,</I> because it
 is incorruptible. The <I>glory</I> reserved for us is incorruptible and 
 undefiled; and the <I>grace</I> wrought in us is the hidden man of the 
 heart in that <I>which is not corruptible.</I>

 2. Concerning the constant use that should be made of it, when it was
 dedicated: <I>Henceforward</I> the priests shall <I>make their 
 burnt-offerings and peace-offerings upon this altar</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 for <I>therefore</I> it was <I>sanctified,</I> that it might 
 <I>sanctify the gift</I> that was offered upon it. Observe further,
 
 (1.) Who were to serve at the altar: The <I>priests of the seed of
 Zadok,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 That family was substituted in the room of Abiathar by Solomon, and God 
 confirms it. His name signifies <I>righteous,</I> for they are the
 righteous seed that are priests to God, through Christ <I>the Lord our 
 righteousness.</I> 
 
 (2.) How they should prepare for this service 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>They shall consecrate themselves,</I> shall <I>fill their hand</I> 
 with the offerings, in token of the giving up of themselves with their 
 offerings to God and to his service. Note, Before we minister to the 
 Lord in holy things we must consecrate ourselves by getting our hands 
 and hearts filled with those things. 
 
 (3.) How they should speed in it
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>I will accept you.</I> And if God now accept our works, if our 
 services be pleasing to him, it is enough, we need no more. Those that 
 give themselves to God shall be accepted of God, their persons first 
 and then their performances, through the Mediator.</P>
