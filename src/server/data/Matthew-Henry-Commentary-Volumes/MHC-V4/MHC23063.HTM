 In this chapter we have,

 I. God coming towards his people in ways of mercy and deliverance, and
 this is to be joined to the close of the foregoing chapter, where it 
 was said to Zion, "Behold, thy salvation comes;" for here it is shown 
 how it comes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. God's people meeting him with their devotions, and addressing
 themselves to him with suitable affections; and this part of the
 chapter is carried on to the close of the next. In this we have, 

 1. A thankful acknowledgment of the great favours God had bestowed upon
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:7">ver. 7</A>.

 2. The magnifying of these favours, from the consideration of God's
 relation to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:8">ver. 8</A>),

 his compassionate concern for them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:9">ver.  9</A>),

 their unworthiness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:10">ver. 10</A>),

 and the occasion which it gave both him and them to call to mind former 
 mercies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:11-14">ver.  11-14</A>.

 3. A very humble and earnest prayer to God to appear for them in their 
 present distress, pleading God's mercy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:15">ver.  15</A>),

 their relation to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:16">ver. 16</A>),

 their desire towards him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:17">ver. 17</A>),

 and the insolence of their enemies,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:18,19">ver. 18, 19</A>.

 So that, upon the whole, we learn to embrace God's promises with an 
 active faith, and then to improve them, and make use of them, both in 
 prayers and praises.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Who <I>is</I> this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from
 Bozrah? this <I>that is</I> glorious in his apparel, travelling in the
 greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty
 to save.
 &nbsp; 2  Wherefore <I>art thou</I> red in thine apparel, and thy garments
 like him that treadeth in the wine-fat?
 &nbsp; 3  I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people <I>there
 was</I> none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and
 trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon
 my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.
 &nbsp; 4  For the day of vengeance <I>is</I> in mine heart, and the year of
 my redeemed is come.
 &nbsp; 5  And I looked, and <I>there was</I> none to help; and I wondered
 that <I>there was</I> none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought
 salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me.
 &nbsp; 6  And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them
 drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the
 earth.

 It is a glorious victory that is here enquired into first and then 
 accounted for. 

 1. It is a victory obtained by the providence of God over the enemies
 of Israel; over the Babylonians (say some), whom Cyrus conquered and 
 God by him, and they will have the prophet to make the first discovery 
 of him in his triumphant return when he is in the country of Edom: but 
 this can by no means be admitted, because the country of Babylon is 
 always spoken of as the land of the north, whereas Edom lay south from 
 Jerusalem, so that the conqueror would not return through that country; 
 the victory therefore is obtained over the Edomites themselves, who had 
 triumphed in the destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:7">Ps. cxxxvii. 7</A>)
 
 and cut off those who, making their way as far as they could from the
 enemy, escaped to the Edomites 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:12,13">Obad. 12, 13</A>),

 and were therefore reckoned with when Babylon was; for no doubt that
 prophecy was accomplished, though we do not meet in history with the 
 accomplishment of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:13">Jer. xlix. 13</A>),

 <I>Bozrah shall become a desolation.</I> Yet this victory over Edom is
 put as an instance or specimen of the like victories obtained over 
 other nations that had been enemies to Israel.  This over the Edomites 
 is named for the sake of the old enmity of Esau against Jacob

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:41">Gen. xxvii. 41</A>)

 and perhaps with an allusion to David's glorious triumphs over the
 Edomites, by which it should seem, more than by any other of his
 victories, he <I>got himself a name,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+60:1,2Sa+8:13,14">Ps. lx., <I>title,</I> 2 Sam. viii. 13, 14</A>.
 
 But this is not all:

 2.  It is a victory obtained by the grace of God in Christ over our 
 spiritual enemies. We find the garments dipped in blood adorning him 
 whose name is called <I>The Word of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:13">Rev. xix. 13</A>.

 And who that is we know very well; for it is through him that we are
 more than conquerors over those principalities and powers which on the 
 cross he spoiled and triumphed over.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this representation of the victory we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. An admiring question put to the conqueror, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 It is put by the church, or by the prophet in the name of the church.
 He sees a mighty hero returning in triumph from a bloody engagement, 
 and makes bold to ask him two questions:--

 1. Who he is. He observes him to come from the country of Edom, to come
 in such apparel as was glorious to a soldier, not embroidered or laced, 
 but besmeared with blood and dirt. He observes that he does not come as 
 one either frightened or fatigued, but that he <I>travels in the 
 greatness of his strength,</I> altogether unbroken.</P>

 <CENTER>
 <TABLE BORDER=0>
 <TR><TD>Triumphant and victorious he appears,
 <BR>And honour in his looks and habit wears.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; How strong he treads! how stately doth he go!
 <BR>Pompous and solemn is his pace,
 <BR>And full of majesty, as is his face;
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; Who is this mighty hero--who?--</TD></TR>

 The question, <I>Who is this?</I> perhaps means the same with that 
 which Joshua put to the same person when he appeared to him with his 
 sword drawn 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+5:13">Josh. v. 13</A>):

 <I>Art thou for us or for our adversaries?</I> Or, rather, the same
 with that which Israel put in a way of adoration

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:11">Exod. xv. 11</A>):
 
 <I>Who is a God like unto thee?</I>

 2. The other question it, "<I>Wherefore art thou red in thy 
 apparel?</I> What hard service hast thou been engaged in, that thou 
 carriest with thee these marks of toil and danger?" Is it possible that 
 one who has such majesty and terror in his countenance should be 
 employed in the mean and servile work of <I>treading the 
 wine-press?</I> Surely it is not. That which is really the glory of the 
 Redeemer seems, <I>prim&acirc; facie--at first,</I> a disparagement to 
 him, as it would be to a mighty prince to do the work of the 
 wine-dressers and husbandmen; for he <I>took upon him the form of a 
 servant,</I> and carried with him the marks of servitude.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. An admirable answer returned by him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He tells who he is: <I>I that speak in righteousness, mighty to 
 save.</I> He is the Saviour. God was Israel's Saviour out of the hand 
 of their oppressors; the Lord Jesus is ours; his name, <I>Jesus,</I> 
 signifies a <I>Saviour,</I> for he <I>saves his people from their 
 sins.</I> In the salvation wrought he will have us to take notice, 

 (1.) Of the truth of his promise, which is therein performed: He speaks 
 <I>in righteousness,</I> and will therefore make good every word that 
 he has spoken with which he will have us to compare what he does, that, 
 setting the word and the work the one over against the other, what he 
 does may ratify what he has said and what he has said may justify what 
 he does. 

 (2.) Of the efficacy of his power, which is therein exerted: He is 
 <I>mighty to save,</I> able to bring about the promised redemption, 
 whatever difficulties and oppositions may lie in the way of it.</P>

 2. He tells how he came to appear in this hue 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>I have trodden the wine-press alone.</I> Being compared to one that 
 treads in the wine-fat, such is his condescension, in the midst of his 
 triumphs, that he does not scorn the comparison, but admits it and 
 carries it on. He does indeed <I>tread the wine-press,</I> but it is 
 <I>the great wine-press of the wrath of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:19">Rev. xiv. 19</A>),

 in which we sinners deserved to be cast; but Christ was pleased to cast
 our enemies into it, and to <I>destroy him that had the power of 
 death,</I> that he might deliver us. And of this the bloody work which 
 God sometimes made among the enemies of the Jews, and which is here 
 foretold, was a type and figure. Observe the account the conqueror 
 gives of his victory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He gains the victory purely by his own strength: <I>I have trodden 
 the wine-press alone,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 When God delivered his people and destroyed their enemies, if he made
 use of instruments, he did not need them. But among his people, for 
 whom the salvation was to be wrought, no assistance offered itself; 
 they were weak and helpless, and had no ability to do any thing for 
 their own relief; they were desponding and listless, and had no heart 
 to do any thing; they were not disposed to give the least stroke or 
 struggle for liberty, neither the captives themselves nor any of their 
 friends for them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>I looked, and there was none to help,</I> as one would have 
 expected, nothing of a bold active spirit appeared among them; nay, 
 there was not only none to lead, but, which was more strange, <I>there 
 was none to uphold,</I> none that would come in as a second, that had 
 the courage to join with Cyrus against their oppressors; <I>therefore 
 my arm brought</I> about <I>the salvation; not by</I> created <I>might 
 or power,</I> but <I>by the Spirit of the Lord of hosts,</I> my own 
 arm." Note, God can help when all other helpers fail; nay, that is his 
 time to help, and therefore for that very reason he will put forth his 
 own power so much the more gloriously. But this is most fully 
 applicable to Christ's victories over our spiritual enemies, which he 
 obtained by a single combat. He trod the wine-press of his Father's 
 wrath alone, and triumphed over principalities and powers <I>in 
 himself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:15">Col. ii. 15</A>.

 <I>Of the people there was none with him;</I> for, when he entered the
 lists with the powers of darkness, <I>all his disciples forsook him and 
 fled.</I> There was <I>non to help,</I> none that could, none that 
 durst; and he might well wonder that among the children of men, whose 
 concern it was, there was not only <I>none to uphold,</I> but that 
 there were so many to oppose and hinder it if they could.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He undertakes the war purely out of his own zeal. It is <I>in his 
 anger,</I> it is <I>in his fury,</I> that he <I>treads down</I> his 
 enemies 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and that <I>fury upholds him</I> and carries him on in this enterprise,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 God wrought salvation for the oppressed Jews purely because he was very
 angry with the oppressing Babylonians, angry at their idolatries and 
 sorceries, their pride and cruelty, and the injuries they did to his 
 people, and, as they increased their abominations and grew more 
 insolent and outrageous, his anger increased to fury. Our Lord Jesus 
 wrought out our redemption in a holy zeal for the honour of his Father 
 and the happiness of mankind, and a holy indignation at the daring 
 attempts Satan had made upon both; this zeal and indignation upheld him 
 throughout his whole undertaking. Two branches there were of this zeal 
 that animated him:--

 [1.] He had a zeal against his and his people's enemies: <I>The day of 
 vengeance is in my heart</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 the day fixed in the eternal counsels for taking vengeance on them; 
 this was written in his heart, so that he could not forget it, could 
 not let it slip; his heart was full of it, and it lay as a charge, as a 
 weight, upon him, which made him push on this holy war with so much 
 vigour.  Note, There is a day fixed for divine vengeance, which may be 
 long deferred, but will come at last; and we may be content to wait for 
 it, for the Redeemer himself does so, though his heart is upon it.

 [2.] He had a zeal for his people, and for all that he designed to make 
 sharers in the intended salvation: "<I>The year of my redeemed has 
 come,</I> the year appointed for their redemption." There was a year 
 fixed for the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt, and God kept time to 
 a day 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:41">Exod. xii. 41</A>);
 
 so there was for their release out of Babylon
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:2">Dan. ix. 2</A>);

 so there was for Christ's coming to destroy the works of the devil; so
 there is for all the deliverances of the church, and the deliverer has 
 an eye to it.  Observe, <I>First,</I> With what pleasure he speaks of 
 his people; they are his <I>redeemed;</I> they are his own, dear to 
 him. Though their redemption is not yet wrought out, yet he calls them 
 <I>his redeemed,</I> because it shall as surely be done as if it were 
 done already. <I>Secondly,</I> With what pleasure he speaks of his 
 people's redemption; how glad he is that <I>the time has come,</I> 
 though he is likely to meet with a sharp encounter. "Now that the year 
 of my redeemed has come, <I>Lo, I come;</I> delay shall be no longer. 
 <I>Now will I arise,</I> saith the Lord. <I>Now thou shalt see what I 
 will do to Pharaoh.</I>" Note, The promised salvation must be patiently 
 waited for till the time appointed comes; yet we must attend the 
 promises with our prayers. Does Christ say, <I>Surely I come 
 quickly;</I> let our hearts reply, <I>Even so come;</I> let the <I>year 
 of the redeemed come.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He will obtain a complete victory over them all. 

 [1.] Much is already done; for he now appears <I>red in his 
 apparel;</I> such abundance of blood is shed that the conqueror's 
 garments are all stained with it. This was predicted, long before, by 
 dying Jacob, concerning <I>Shiloh</I> (that is, <I>Christ</I>), that he 
 should <I>wash his garments in wine and his clothes in the blood of 
 grapes,</I> which perhaps this alludes to, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:11">Gen.  xlix. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the destruction of the antichristian powers we meet with abundance 
 of blood shed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:20,19:13">Rev. xiv. 20, xix. 13</A>),

 which yet, according to the dialect of prophecy, may be understood
 spiritually, and doubtless so may this here.

 [2.] More shall yet be done 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:6"><I>v.</I>  6</A>):

 <I>I will tread down the people</I> that yet stand it out against me, 
 <I>in my anger;</I> for the victorious Redeemer, when the <I>year of 
 the redeemed shall have come,</I> will go on <I>conquering and to 
 conquer,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:2">Rev. vi. 2</A>.

 When he begins he will also make an end. Observe how he will complete
 his victories over the enemies of his church.  <I>First,</I> He will 
 infatuate them; he will make them drunk, so that there shall be neither 
 sense nor steadiness in their counsels; they shall drink of the cup of 
 his fury, and that shall intoxicate them: or he will make them <I>drunk 
 with their own blood,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:6">Rev. xvii. 6</A>.

 Let those that make themselves drunk with the cup of riot (and then
 they are in their fury) repent and reform, lest God make them drunk 
 with the <I>cup of trembling,</I> the cup of his fury. <I>Secondly,</I> 
 He will enfeeble them; he will <I>bring down their strength,</I> and so 
 bring them down <I>to the earth;</I> for what strength can hold out 
 against Omnipotence?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet is here, in the name of the church, taking a review, and 
 making a thankful recognition, of God's dealings with his church all 
 along, ever since he founded it, before he comes, in the latter end of 
 this chapter and in the next, as a watchman upon the walls, earnestly 
 to pray to God for his compassion towards her in her present deplorable 
 state; and it was usual for God's people, in their prayers, thus to 
 look back.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is a general acknowledgment of God's goodness to them all 
 along, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 It was said, in general, of God's prophets and people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:6"><I>ch.</I> lxii. 6</A>)

 that they <I>made mention of the Lord;</I> now here we are told what it
 is in God that they do especially delight to make mention of, and that 
 is his goodness, which the prophet here so makes mention of as if he 
 thought he could never say enough of it. He mentions the <I>kindness of 
 God</I> (which never appeared so evident, so eminent, as in his love to 
 mankind in <I>sending his Son</I> to save us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+3:4">Tit. iii. 4</A>),

 his loving-kindness, kindness that shows itself in every thing that is
 endearing; nay, so plenteous are the springs, and so various the 
 streams, of divine mercy, that he speaks of it in the plural 
 number--<I>his loving-kindnesses;</I> for, if we would count the fruits 
 of his loving-kindness, they are <I>more in number than the sand.</I> 
 With his loving-kindnesses he mentions his <I>praises,</I> that is, the 
 thankful acknowledgments which the saints make of his loving-kindness, 
 and the angels too. It must be mentioned, to God's honour, what a 
 tribute of praise is paid to him by all his creatures in consideration 
 of his loving-kindness. See how copiously he speaks,

 1. Of the goodness that is from God, the gifts of his
 loving-kindness--<I>all that the Lord has bestowed</I> on us in 
 particular, relating to life and godliness, in our personal and family 
 capacity. Let every man speak for himself, speak as he has found, and 
 he must own that he has had a great deal bestowed upon him by the 
 divine bounty. But we must also mention the favours bestowed upon his 
 church, his <I>great goodness towards the house of Israel, which he has 
 bestowed on them.</I> Note, We must bless God for the mercies enjoyed 
 by others as well as for those enjoyed by ourselves, and reckon that 
 bestowed on ourselves which is bestowed on <I>the house of Israel.</I> 

 2. Of the goodness that is in God. God does good because he is good; 
 what he bestowed upon us must be traced up to the original; it is 
 <I>according to his mercies</I> (not according to our merits) and 
 <I>according to the multitude of his loving-kindnesses,</I> which can 
 never be spent. Thus we should magnify God's goodness, and speak 
 honourably of it, not only when we plead it (as David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:1">Ps. li. 1</A>),

 but when we praise it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is particular notice taken of the steps of God's mercy to 
 Israel ever since it was formed into a nation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The expectations God had concerning them that they would conduct 
 themselves well, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 When he brought them out of Egypt and took them into covenant with
 himself he said, "<I>Surely they are my people,</I> I take them as 
 such, and am willing to hope they will approve themselves so, 
 <I>children that will not lie,</I>" that will not <I>dissemble with 
 God</I> in their covenantings with him, nor treacherously depart from 
 him by breaking their covenant and starting aside like a broken bow. 
 They said, more than once, <I>All that the Lord shall say unto us we 
 will do and will be obedient;</I> and thereupon he took them to be his 
 peculiar people, saying, <I>Surely they will not lie.</I> God deals 
 fairly and faithfully with them, and therefore expects they should deal 
 so with him. They are <I>children of the covenant</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:25">Acts iii. 25</A>),
 
 children of those that clave unto the Lord, and therefore it may be
 hoped that they will tread in the steps of their fathers' constancy. 
 Note, God's people are <I>children that will not lie;</I> for those 
 that will are not his children but the devil's.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The favour he showed them with an eye to these expectations: <I>So 
 he was their Saviour</I> out of the bondage of Egypt and all the 
 calamities of their wilderness-state, and many a time since he had been 
 their Saviour. See particularly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 what he did for them as their Saviour.

 (1.) The principle that moved him to work salvation for them; it was 
 <I>in his love and in his pity,</I> out of mere compassion to them and 
 a tender affection for them, not because he either needed them or could 
 be benefited by them. This is strangely expressed here: <I>In all their 
 affliction he was afflicted;</I> not that the Eternal Mind is capable 
 of grieving or God's infinite blessedness of suffering the least damage 
 or diminution (God cannot be afflicted); but thus he is pleased to show 
 forth the love and concern he has for his people in their affliction; 
 thus far he sympathizes with them, that he takes what injury is done to 
 them as done to himself and will reckon for it accordingly. Their cries 
 move him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:7">Exod. iii. 7</A>),

 and he appears for them as vigorously as if he were pained in their
 pain. <I>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</I> This is matter of 
 great comfort to God's people in their affliction that God is so far 
 from <I>afflicting willingly</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:33">Lam. iii. 33</A>)

 that, if they humble themselves under his hand, he is <I>afflicted in
 their affliction,</I> as the tender parents are in the severe 
 operations which the case of a sick child calls for.  There is another 
 reading of these words in the original: <I>In all their affliction 
 there was no affliction;</I> though they were in great affliction, yet 
 the property of it was so altered by the grace of God sanctifying it to 
 them for their good, the rigour of it was so mitigated and it was so 
 allayed and balanced with mercies, they were so wonderfully supported 
 and comforted under it, and it proved so short, and ended so well, that 
 it was in effect no affliction. The troubles of the saints are not that 
 to them which they are to others; they are not afflictions, but 
 medicines; saints are enabled to call them <I>light,</I> and <I>but for 
 a moment,</I> and, with an eye to heaven as all in all, to make nothing 
 of them.

 (2.) The person employed in their salvation--<I>the angel of his 
 face,</I> or presence. Some understand it of a created angel. The 
 highest angel in heaven, even the angel of his presence, that attends 
 next the throne of his glory, is not thought too great, too good, to be 
 sent on this errand. Thus the little ones' angels are said to be those 
 that <I>always behold the face of our Father,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:10">Matt. xviii. 10</A>.

 But this is rather to be understood of Jesus Christ, the eternal Word,
 that angel of whom God spoke to Moses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:20,21">Exod. xxiii. 20, 21</A>),

 whose <I>voice Israel was to obey.</I> He is called <I>Jehovah,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+13:21,14:21,24">Exod.  xiii. 21; xiv. 21, 24</A>.

 He is the angel of the covenant, God's messenger to the world,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:1">Mal. iii. 1</A>.

 He is the <I>angel of God's face,</I> for he is the <I>express image of
 his person;</I> and the glory of God shines in the face of Christ. He 
 that was to work out the eternal salvation, as an earnest of that, 
 wrought out the temporal salvations that were typical of it.

 (3.) The progress and perseverance of this favour. He not only redeemed 
 them out of their bondage, but <I>he bore them and carried them all the 
 days of old;</I> they were weak, but he supported them by his power, 
 sustained them by his bounty; when they were burdened, and ready to 
 sink, he bore them up; in the wars they made upon the nations he stood 
 by them and bore them out; though they were peevish, he bore with them 
 and suffered their manners, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:18">Acts xiii. 18</A>.

 He carried them as the nursing father does the child, though they would
 have tired any arms but his; he carried them as the eagle her young 
 upon her wings,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:11">Deut. xxxii. 11</A>.

 And it was a long time that he was <I>troubled with them</I> (if we may
 so speak): it was <I>all the days of old;</I> his care of them was not
 at an end even when they had grown up and were settled in Canaan. All
 this was <I>in his love and pity, ex mero motu--of his mere
 good-will;</I> he loved them because he would love them, as he says,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:7,8">Deut. vii. 7, 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Their disingenuous conduct towards him, and the trouble they thereby 
 brought upon themselves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>But they rebelled.</I> Things looked very hopeful and promising; one 
 would have thought that they should have continued dutiful children to 
 God, and then there was no doubt but he would have continued a gracious 
 Father to them; but here is a sad change on both sides, and <I>on them 
 be the breach.</I>

 (1.) They revolted from their allegiance to God and took up arms 
 against him: <I>They rebelled, and vexed his Holy Spirit</I> with their 
 unbelief and murmuring, besides the iniquity of the golden calf; and 
 this had been their way and manner ever since. Though he was ready to 
 say of them, <I>They will not lie,</I> though he had done so much for 
 them, <I>borne them and carried them,</I> yet they thus ill requited 
 him, like <I>foolish people and unwise,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:6">Deut. xxxii. 6</A>.

 This grieved him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:10">Ps. cxv. 10</A>.

 The ungrateful rebellions of God's children against him are a vexation
 to his Holy Spirit.

 (2.) Thereupon he justly withdrew his protection, and not only so, but 
 made war upon them, as a prince justly does upon the rebels. He who had 
 been so much their friend was <I>turned to be their enemy and fought 
 against them,</I> by one judgment after another, both in the wilderness 
 and after their settlement in Canaan. See the malignity and 
 mischievousness of sin; it makes God an enemy even to those for whom he 
 has done the part of a good friend, and makes him angry who was all 
 love and pity. See the folly of sinners; they wilfully lose him for a 
 friend who is the most desirable friend, and make him their enemy who 
 is the most formidable enemy. This refers especially to those 
 calamities that were of late brought upon them by their captivity in 
 Babylon for their idolatries and other sins. That which is both the 
 original and the great aggravation of their troubles was that God was 
 <I>turned to be their enemy.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. A particular reflection made, on this occasion, upon what God did 
 for them when he first formed them into a people: <I>Then he remembered 
 the days of old,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:11"><I>v.</I>  11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) This may be understood either of the people or of God. 

 [1.] We may understand it of the people. Israel then (spoken of as a 
 single person) <I>remembered the days of old,</I> looked into their 
 Bibles, read the story of God's bringing their fathers out of Egypt, 
 considered it more closely than ever they did before, and reasoned upon 
 it, as Gideon did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:13">Judg. vi. 13</A>),

 <I>Where are all the wonders that our fathers told us of?  "Where is he
 that brought them up</I> out of Egypt? Is he not as able to bring us up 
 out of Babylon? <I>Where is the Lord God of Elijah?  Where is the Lord 
 God of our fathers?</I>" This they consider as an inducement and an 
 encouragement to them to repent and return to him; their fathers were a 
 provoking people and yet found him a pardoning God; and why may not 
 they find him so if they return to him? They also use it as a plea with 
 God in prayer for the turning again of their captivity, like that

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:9,10"><I>ch.</I> li. 9, 10</A>.

 Note, When the present days are dark and cloudy it is good to
 <I>remember the days of old,</I> to recollect our own and others' 
 experiences of the divine power and goodness and make use of them, to 
 look back upon <I>the years of the right hand of the Most High</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+77:5,10">Ps.  lxxvii. 5, 10</A>),

 and remember that he is <I>God, and changes not.</I>

 [2.] We may understand it of God; he put himself in mind of the days of 
 old, of his covenant with Abraham 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:42">Lev. xxvi. 42</A>);

 he said, <I>Where is he that brought Israel up out of the sea?</I>
 stirring up himself to come and save them with this consideration, "Why 
 should not I appear for them now as I did for their fathers, who were 
 as undeserving, as ill-deserving, as they are?" See how far off divine 
 mercy will go, how far back it will look, to find out a reason for 
 doing good to his people, when ho present considerations appear but 
 what make against them. Nay, it makes that a reason for relieving them 
 which might have been used as a reason for abandoning them. He might 
 have said, "I have delivered them formerly, but they have again brought 
 trouble upon themselves

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+19:19">Prov. xix. 19</A>);
 
 there <I>I will deliver them no more,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:13">Judg. x. 13</A>.

 But no; mercy rejoices against judgment, and turns the argument the
 other way: "I have formerly delivered them and therefore will now."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Which way soever we take it, whether the people plead it with God 
 or God with himself, let us view the particulars, and they agree very 
 much with the confession and prayer which the children of the captivity 
 made upon a solemn fast-day 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:5">Neh. ix. 5</A>,

 &c.), which may serve as a comment on these verses which call to mind
 <I>Moses and his people,</I> that is, what God did by Moses for his 
 people, especially in bringing them through the Red Sea, for that is it 
 that is here most insisted on; for it was a work which he much gloried 
 in and which his people therefore may in a particular manner encourage 
 themselves with the remembrance of. 

 [1.] God <I>led them by the right hand of Moses</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:12"><I>v.</I>  12</A>)

 and the wonder-working rod in his hand. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+77:20">Ps.  lxxvii. 20</A>,

 <I>Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses.</I> It 
 was not Moses that led them, any more than it was Moses that fed them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:32">John vi. 32</A>),

 but God by Moses; for it was he that qualified Moses for, called him
 to, assisted and prospered him in that great undertaking.  Moses is 
 here called <I>the shepherd of his flock;</I> God was the owner of the 
 flock and the chief shepherd of Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:1">Ps. lxxx. 1</A>);

 but Moses was a shepherd under him, and he was inured to labour and
 patience, and so fitted for this pastoral care, by his being trained up 
 to <I>keep the flock of his father Jethro.</I> Herein he was a type of 
 Christ the good shepherd, that <I>lays down his life for the sheep,</I> 
 which was more than Moses did for Israel, though he did a great deal 
 for them.

 [2.] He <I>put his holy Spirit within him; the Spirit of God was among 
 them,</I> and not only his providence, but his grace, did work for 
 them. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:20">Neh. ix. 20</A>,

 <I>Thou gavest thy good Spirit to instruct them.</I> The spirit of
 wisdom and courage, as well as the Spirit of prophecy, was put into 
 Moses, to qualify him for that service among them to which he was 
 called; and some of his spirit was put upon the seventy elders,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:17">Num.  xi. 17</A>.

 This was a great blessing to Israel, that they had among them not only
 inspired writings, but inspired men.

 [3.] He carried them safely through the Red Sea, and thereby saved them 
 out of the hands of Pharaoh. <I>First, He divided the water before 
 them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 so that it gave them not only passage, but protection, not only opened 
 them a lane, but erected them a wall on either side. <I>Secondly, He 
 led them through the deep as a horse in the wilderness,</I> or <I>in 
 the plain</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 they and their wives and children, with all their baggage, went as 
 easily and readily through the bottom of the sea (though we may suppose 
 it muddy or stony, or both) as a horse goes along upon even ground; so 
 that they did not stumble, though it was an untrodden path, which 
 neither they nor any one else ever went before.  If God make us a way, 
 he will make it plain and level; the road he opens to his people he 
 will lead them in.  <I>Thirdly,</I> To complete the mercy, he 
 <I>brought them up out of the sea,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Though the ascent, it is likely, was very steep, dirty, slippery, and
 unconquerable (at least by the women and children, and the men, 
 considering how they were loaded, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:34">Exod. xii. 34</A>,

 and how fatigued), yet God by his power brought them up from the depths
 of the earth; and it was a kind of resurrection to them; it was as 
 <I>life from the dead.</I>

 [4.] He brought them safely to a place of rest: <I>As a beast goes down 
 into the valley,</I> carefully and gradually, so <I>the Spirit of the 
 Lord caused him to rest.</I> Many a time in their march through the 
 wilderness they had resting-places provided for them by the direction 
 of the Spirit of the Lord in Moses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 And at length they were made to rest finally in Canaan, and the Spirit
 of the Lord gave them that rest according to the promise. It is by the 
 Spirit of the Lord that God's Israel are caused to return to God and 
 repose in him as their rest.

 [5.] All this he did for them by his own power, for his own praise. 
 <I>First,</I> It was by his own power, as the God of nature, that has 
 all the powers of nature at his command; he did it with his glorious 
 arm, <I>the arm of his gallantry,</I> or <I>bravery;</I> so the word 
 signifies. It was not Moses's rod, but God's glorious arm, that did it. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> It was for his own praise, to <I>make himself an 
 everlasting name</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 <I>a glorious name</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:14"><I>v.</I>  14</A>),

 that he might be glorified, everlastingly glorified, upon this account. 
 This is that which God is doing in the world with his glorious arm, he 
 is making to himself a glorious name, and it shall last to endless 
 ages, when the most celebrated names of the great ones of the earth 
 shall be written in the dust.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The foregoing praises were intended as an introduction to this prayer, which is continued to the end of the next chapter, and it is an affectionate, importunate, pleading prayer. It is calculated for the time of the captivity. As they had promises, so

 they had prayers, prepared for them against that time of need, that 
 they might take with them words in turning to the Lord, and say unto 
 him what he himself taught them to say, in which they might the better 
 hope to prevail, the words being of God's own inditing. Some good 
 interpreters think this prayer looks further, and that it expresses the 
 complaints of the Jews under their last and final rejection from God 
 and destruction by the Romans; for there is one passage in it 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:4"><I>ch.</I> lxiv. 4</A>)

 which is applied to the grace of the gospel by the apostle 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:9">1 Cor.  ii. 9</A>),

 that grace for the rejecting of which they were rejected. In these
 verses we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The petitions they put up to God. 

 1. That he would take cognizance of their case and of the desires of
 their souls towards him: <I>Look down from heaven, and behold,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 They knew very well that God sees all, but they prayed that he would
 regard them, would condescend to favour them, would look upon them with 
 an eye of compassion and concern, as he looked upon the affliction of 
 his people in Egypt when he was about to appear for their deliverance. 
 In begging that he would only look down upon them and behold them they 
 did in effect appeal to his justice against their enemies, and pray for 
 judgment against them (as Jehoshaphat, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+20:11,12">2 Chron. xx. 11, 12</A>,

 <I>Behold, how they reward us. Wilt thou not judge them?</I>),
 implicitly confiding in his mercy and wisdom as to the way in which he 
 will relieve them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+25:18">Ps.  xxv. 18</A>,

 <I>Look upon my affliction and my pain): Look down from the habitation
 of thy holiness and of thy glory.</I> God's holiness is his glory. 
 Heaven is his habitation, the throne of his glory, where he most 
 manifests his glory, and whence he is said to look down upon the earth,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+33:14">Ps. xxxiii. 14</A>.

 His holiness is in a special manner celebrated there by the blessed
 angels

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:3,Re+4:8"><I>ch.</I> vi. 3; Rev. iv. 8</A>);

 there his holy ones attend him, and are continually about him; so that
 it is the <I>habitation of his holiness.</I> It is an encouragement to 
 all his praying people, who desire to be holy as he is holy, that he 
 <I>dwells in a holy place.</I> 

 2. That he would take a course for their relief

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 "<I>Return;</I> change thy way towards us, and proceed not in thy 
 controversy with us; return in mercy, and let us have not only a 
 gracious look towards us, but thy gracious presence with us." God's 
 people dread nothing more than his departures from them and desire 
 nothing more than his returns to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The complaints they made to God. Two things they complained of:--

 1.  That they were given up to themselves, and God's grace did not
 recover them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 It is a strange expostulation, "<I>Why hast thou made us to err from
 thy ways,</I> that is, many among us, the generality of us; and this 
 complaint we have all of us some cause to make that <I>thou hast 
 hardened our heart from thy fear.</I>" Some make it to be the language 
 of those among them that were impious and profane; when the prophets 
 reproved them for the <I>error of their ways,</I> their <I>hardness of 
 heart,</I> and <I>contempt of God's word and commandments,</I> they 
 with a daring impudence charged their sin upon God, made him the author 
 of it, and asked <I>why doth he then find fault?</I> Note, Those are 
 wicked indeed that lay the blame of their wickedness upon God. But I 
 rather take it to be the language of those among them that lamented the 
 unbelief and impenitence of their people, not accusing God of being the 
 author of their wickedness, but complaining of it to him. They owned 
 that they had <I>erred from God's ways,</I> that their <I>hearts</I> 
 had been <I>hardened from his fear,</I> that they had not received the 
 impressions which the fear of God ought to make upon them and this was 
 the cause of all their errors from his ways; or <I>from his fear</I> 
 may mean from the true worship of God, and that is a hard heart indeed 
 which is alienated from the service of a God so incontestably great and 
 good. Now this they complain of, as their great misery and burden, that 
 God had for their sins left them to this, had permitted them to <I>err 
 from his ways</I> and had justly withheld his grace, so that their 
 <I>hearts were hardened from his fear.</I> When they ask, <I>Why hast 
 thou done this?</I> it is not as charging him with wrong, but lamenting 
 it as a sore judgment. God had <I>caused them to err and hardened their 
 hearts,</I> not only by withdrawing his Spirit from them, because they 
 had grieved, and vexed, and quenched him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 but by a judicial sentence upon them (<I>Go, make the heart of this 
 people fat,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:9,10"><I>ch.</I> vi. 9, 10</A>)

 and by his providences concerning them, which had proved sad occasions
 for their departure from him. David complains of his banishment, 
 because in it he was in effect bidden to <I>go and serve other 
 gods,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+26:19">1 Sam. xxvi. 19</A>.

 Their troubles had alienated many of them from God, and prejudiced them
 against his service; and, because the <I>rod of the wicked had lain 
 long on their lot,</I> they were ready to <I>put forth their hand unto 
 iniquity</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+125:3">Ps. cxxv. 3</A>),

 and this was the thing they complained most of; their afflictions were
 their temptations, and to many of them invincible ones. Note, Convinced 
 consciences complain most of spiritual judgments and dread that most in 
 an affliction which draws them from God and duty.

 2. That they were given up to their enemies, and God's providence did 
 not rescue and relieve them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):
 
 <I>Our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.</I> As it was a 
 grief to them that in their captivity the generality of them had lost 
 their affection to God's worship, and had their hearts hardened from it 
 by their affliction, so it was a further grief that they were deprived 
 of their opportunities of worshipping God in solemn assemblies. They 
 complained not so much of the adversaries treading down their houses 
 and cities as of their treading down God's sanctuary, because thereby 
 God was immediately affronted, and they were robbed of the comforts 
 they valued most and took most pleasure in.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The pleas they urged with God for mercy and deliverance. 

 1. They pleaded the tender compassion God used to show to his people
 and his ability and readiness to appear for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 The most prevailing arguments in prayer are those that are taken
 <I>from God himself;</I> such these are. <I>Where is thy zeal and thy 
 strength?</I> God has a zeal for his own glory, and for the comfort of 
 his people; his name is <I>Jealous;</I> and he is a jealous God; and he 
 has strength proportionable to secure his own glory and the interest of 
 his people, in despite of all opposition. Now where are these? Have 
 they not formerly appeared? Why do they not appear now? It cannot be 
 that divine zeal, which is infinitely wise and just, should be cooled, 
 that divine strength, which is infinite, should be weakened. Nay, his 
 people had experienced not only <I>his zeal and his strength, but the 
 sounding of his bowels,</I> or rather the yearning of them, such a 
 degree of compassion to them as in men causes a commotion and agitation 
 within them, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:8">Hos. xi. 8</A>,

 <I>My heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled
 together;</I> and 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:20">Jer. xxxi. 20</A>,

 <I>My bowels are troubled</I> (or sound) <I>for him.</I> "Thus God used
 to be affected towards his people, and to express a <I>multitude of 
 mercies towards them;</I> but where are they now? <I>Are they 
 restrained?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+77:9">Ps. lxxvii. 9</A>.
 
 Has God, who so often remembered to be gracious, now forgotten to be
 so? <I>Has he in anger shut up his tender mercies?</I> It can never 
 be." Note, We may ground good expectations of further mercy upon our 
 experiences of former mercy. 

 2. They pleaded God's relation to them as their Father

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 "Thy tender mercies are not restrained, for they are the tender mercies 
 of a father, who, though he may be for a time displeased with his 
 child, will yet, through the force of natural affection, soon be 
 reconciled. <I>Doubtless thou art our Father,</I> and therefore thy 
 bowels will years towards us." Such good thoughts of God as these we 
 should always keep up in our hearts. <I>However it be, yet God is 
 good;</I> for he is our Father. They own themselves fatherless if he be 
 not their Father, and so cast themselves upon him with whom <I>the 
 fatherless findeth mercy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:3">Hos. xiv. 3</A>.

 It was the honour of their nation that <I>they had Abraham to their
 father</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:9">Matt. iii. 9</A>),

 who was the friend of God, and Israel, who was a prince with God; but
 what the better were they for that unless they had God himself for 
 their Father?  "Abraham and Israel cannot help us; they have not the 
 power that God has; they are dead long since, and are <I>ignorant of 
 us, and acknowledge us not;</I> they know not what our case is, nor 
 what our wants are, and therefore know not which way to do us a 
 kindness. If Abraham and Israel were alive with us, they would 
 intercede for us and advise us; but they have gone to the other world, 
 and we know not that they have any communication at all with this 
 world, and therefore they are not capable of doing us any kindness any 
 further than that we have the honour of being called their children." 
 When the father is dead <I>his sons come to honour and he knows it 
 not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+14:21">Job xiv. 21</A>.

 "But <I>thou, O Lord! art our Father still</I> (the fathers of our
 flesh may call themselves <I>ever-loving;</I> but they are not 
 <I>ever-living;</I> it is God only that is the immortal Father, that 
 always knows us, and is never at a distance from us), and therefore 
 <I>our Redeemer from everlasting is thy name,</I> the name by which we 
 will know and own thee. It is the name by which from of old thou hast 
 been known; thy people have always looked upon thee as the God to whom 
 they might appeal to redress their grievances and plead their cause.  
 Nay" (according to the sense some give of this place), "though Abraham 
 and Israel not only cannot, but would not, help us, thou wilt. They 
 have not the pity thou hast. We are so degenerate and corrupt that 
 Abraham and Israel would not own us for their children, yet we fly to 
 thee as our Father. Abraham cast out his son Ishmael; Jacob 
 disinherited his son Reuben and cursed Simeon and Levi; but our 
 heavenly Father, in pardoning sin, is <I>God, and not man,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:9">Hos.  xi. 9</A>.

 3. They pleaded God's interest in them, that he was their Lord, their
 owner and proprietor: "We are thy servants; what service we can do thou 
 art entitled to, and therefore we ought not to serve strange kings and 
 strange gods: <I>Return for thy servants' sake.</I>" As a father finds 
 himself obliged by natural affection to relieve and protect his child, 
 so a master thinks himself obliged in honour to rescue and protect his 
 servant: "<I>We are thine</I> by the strongest engagements, as well as 
 the highest endearments. Thou hast borne rule over us; therefore, Lord, 
 assert thy own interest, maintain thy own right; for <I>we are called 
 by thy name,</I> and therefore whither shall we go but to thee, to be 
 righted and protected? <I>We are thine, save us</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:94">Ps. cxix. 94</A>),

 thy own, acknowledge us. We are the <I>tribes of thy inheritance,</I>
 not only thy servants, but thy tenants; we are thine, not only to do 
 work for thee, but to pay rent to thee. The tribes of Israel are God's 
 inheritance, whence issue the little praise and worship that he 
 receives from this lower world; and wilt thou suffer thy own servants 
 and tenants to be thus abused?"

 4. They pleaded that they had had but a short enjoyment of the land of 
 promise and the privileges of the sanctuary

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>The people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while.</I> 
 From Abraham to David were but fourteen generations, and from David to 
 the captivity but fourteen more 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:17">Matt. i. 17</A>),

 and that was but a little while in comparison with what might have been
 expected from the promise of the <I>land of Canaan for an everlasting 
 possession</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:8">Gen. xvii. 8</A>)
 
 and from the power that was put forth to bring them into that land and
 settle them in it. "Though we are <I>the people of thy holiness,</I> 
 distinguished from other people and consecrated to thee, yet we are 
 soon dislodged." But this they might thank themselves for; they were, 
 in profession, the <I>people of God's holiness,</I> but it was their 
 wickedness that turned them out of the possession of that land. 

 5. They pleaded that those who had and kept possession of their land
 were such as were strangers to God, such as he had no service or honour 
 from: "<I>Thou never didst bear rule over them,</I> nor did they ever 
 yield thee any obedience; they <I>were not called by thy name,</I> but 
 professed relation to other gods and were the worshippers of them. Will 
 God suffer those that do not stand in any relation to him to trample 
 upon those that do?" Some give another reading of this: "<I>We have
 become as those over whom thou didst never bear rule and who were never
 called by thy name;</I> we are rejected and abandoned, despised and
 trampled upon, as if we never had been in thy service nor had thy name
 called upon us." Thus the shield of <I>Saul was vilely cast away, as
 though he had not been anointed with oil.</I> But the covenant that
 seems to be forgotten shall be remembered again.</P>
