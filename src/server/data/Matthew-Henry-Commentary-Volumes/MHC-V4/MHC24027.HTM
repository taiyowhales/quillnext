 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Jeremiah the prophet, since he cannot persuade people to submit to 
 God's precept, and so to prevent the destruction of their country by 
 the king of Babylon, is here persuading them to submit to God's 
 providence, by yielding tamely to the king of Babylon, and becoming 
 tributaries to him, which was the wisest course they could now take, 
 and would be a mitigation of the calamity, and prevent the laying of 
 their country waste by fire and sword; the sacrificing of their 
 liberties would be the saving of their lives. 

 I. He gives this counsel, in God's name, to the kings of the
 neighbouring nations, that they might make the best of bad, assuring 
 them that there was no remedy, but they must serve the king of Babylon; 
 and yet in time there should be relief, for his dominion should last 
 but 70 years, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:1-11">ver. 1-11</A>.

 II. He gives this counsel to Zedekiah king of Judah particularly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:12-15">ver. 12-15</A>)

 and to the priests and people, assuring them that the king of Babylon
 should still proceed against them till things were brought to the last
 extremity, and a patient submission would be the only way to mitigate
 the calamity and make it easy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:16-22">ver.  16-22</A>.

 Thus the prophet, if they would but have hearkened to him, would have 
 directed them in the paths of true policy as well as of true piety.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah
 king of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> to me; Make thee bonds and yokes, and put
 them upon thy neck,
 &nbsp; 3  And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab,
 and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and
 to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to
 Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah;
 &nbsp; 4  And command them to say unto their masters, Thus saith the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say unto your
 masters;
 &nbsp; 5  I have made the earth, the man and the beast that <I>are</I> upon
 the ground, by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and
 have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me.
 &nbsp; 6  And now have I given all these lands into the hand of
 Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of
 the field have I given him also to serve him.
 &nbsp; 7  And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's
 son, until the very time of his land come: and then many nations
 and great kings shall serve themselves of him.
 &nbsp; 8  And it shall come to pass, <I>that</I> the nation and kingdom
 which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon,
 and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of
 Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, with the
 sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have
 consumed them by his hand.
 &nbsp; 9  Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your
 diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to
 your sorcerers, which speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve
 the king of Babylon:
 &nbsp; 10  For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from
 your land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.
 &nbsp; 11  But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the
 king of Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in
 their own land, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and they shall till it, and dwell
 therein.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Some difficulty occurs in the date of this prophecy. This word is said 
 to come to Jeremiah <I>in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 and yet the messengers, to whom he is to deliver the badges of 
 servitude, are said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 to come to <I>Zedekiah king of Judah,</I> who reigned not till eleven 
 years after the beginning of Jehoiakim's reign. Some make it an error 
 of the copy, and think that it should be read 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 <I>In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah,</I> for which some 
 negligent scribe, having his eye on the title of the foregoing chapter, 
 wrote <I>Jehoiakim.</I> And, if one would admit a mistake any where, it 
 should be here, for Zedekiah is mentioned again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 and the next prophecy is dated the same year, and said to be in the 
 <I>beginning of the reign of Zedekiah,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+28:1"><I>ch.</I> xxviii. 1</A>.

 Dr.  Lightfoot solves it thus: In the beginning of Jehoiakim's reign
 Jeremiah is to make these bonds and yokes, and to put them upon his own 
 neck, in token of Judah's subjection to the king of Babylon, which 
 began at that time; but he is to send them to the neighbouring kings 
 afterwards in the reign of Zedekiah, of whose succession to Jehoiakim, 
 and the ambassadors sent to him, mention is made by way of 
 prediction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Jeremiah is to prepare a sign of the general reduction of all these 
 countries into subjection to the king of Babylon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>Make thee bonds and yokes,</I> yokes with bonds to fasten them, that 
 the beast may not slip his neck out of the yoke.  Into these the 
 prophet must put his own neck to make them taken notice of as a 
 prophetic representation; for every one would enquire, What is the 
 meaning of Jeremiah's yokes? We find him with one on,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+28:10"><I>ch.</I> xxviii. 10</A>.

 Hereby he intimated that he advised them to nothing but what he was
 resolved to do himself; for he was not one of those that <I>bind heavy 
 burdens</I> on others, which they themselves will not <I>touch with one 
 of their fingers.</I> Ministers must thus lay themselves under the 
 weight and obligation of what they preach to others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He is to send this, with a sermon annexed to it, to all the 
 neighbouring princes; those are mentioned 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 that lay next to the land of Canaan. It should seem, there was a treaty 
 of alliance on foot between the king of Judah and all those other 
 kings. Jerusalem was the place appointed for the treaty. Thither they 
 all sent their plenipotentiaries; and it was agreed that they should 
 bind themselves in a league offensive and defensive, to stand by one 
 another, in opposition to the growing threatening greatness of the king 
 of Babylon, and to reduce his exorbitant power. They had great 
 confidence in their strength thus united, and were ready to call 
 themselves the high allies; but, when the envoys were returning to 
 their respective masters with the ratification of this treaty, Jeremiah 
 gives each of them a yoke to carry to his master, to signify to him 
 that he must either by consent or by compulsion become a servant to the 
 king of Babylon, let him choose which he will. In the sermon upon this 
 sign, 

 1.  God asserts his own indisputable right to dispose of kingdoms as he
 pleases,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 He is the Creator of all things; he <I>made the earth</I> at first,
 established it, and it abides: it is still the same, though <I>one 
 generation passes away and another comes.</I> He still by a continued 
 creation produces <I>man and beast upon the ground,</I> and it is by 
 his <I>great power</I> and <I>outstretched arm.</I> His arm has 
 infinite strength, though it be stretched out.  Upon this account he 
 may give and convey a property and dominion to whomsoever he pleases. 
 As he hath graciously <I>given the earth to the children of men</I> in 
 general 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:16">Ps. cxv. 16</A>),

 so he give to each his share of it, be it more or less. Note, Whatever
 any have of the good things of this world, it is what God sees fit to 
 give them; we ourselves should therefore be content, though we have 
 ever so little, and not envy any their share, though they have ever so 
 much.

 2. He publishes a grant of all these countries to Nebuchadnezzar. Know
 all men by these presents. <I>Sciant pr&aelig;sentes et futuri--Let 
 those of the present and those of the future age know.</I> "This is to 
 certify to all whom it may concern that I have <I>given all these 
 lands,</I> with all the wealth of them, into <I>the hands of the king 
 of Babylon;</I> even the beasts <I>of the field,</I> whether tame or 
 wild, <I>have I given to him,</I> parks and pastures; they are all his 
 own." Nebuchadnezzar was a proud wicked man, an idolater; and yet God, 
 in his providence, gives him this large dominion, these vast 
 possessions. Note, The things of this world are not the best things, 
 for God often gives the largest share of them to bad men, that are 
 rivals with him and rebels against him. He was a wicked man, and yet 
 what he had he had by divine grant. Note, Dominion is not founded in 
 grace. Those that have not any colourable title to eternal happiness 
 may yet have a justifiable title to their temporal good things. 
 Nebuchadnezzar is a very bad man, and yet God calls him his servant, 
 because he employed him as an instrument of his providence for the 
 chastising of the nations, and particularly his own people; and for his 
 service therein he thus liberally repaid him. Those whom God makes use 
 of shall not lose by him; much more will he be found the bountiful 
 rewarder of all those that designedly and sincerely serve him. 

 3. He assures them that they should all be unavoidably brought under
 the dominion of the king of Babylon for a time

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>All nations,</I> all these nations and many others, shall serve 
 <I>him, and his son, and his son's son.</I> His son was Evil-merodach, 
 and his son's son Belshazzar, in whom his kingdom ceased: then the time 
 of reckoning with his land came, when the tables were turned, and 
 <I>many nations and great kings,</I> incorporated into the empire of 
 the Medes and Persians, <I>served themselves of him,</I> as before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:14"><I>ch.</I> xxv. 14</A>.

 Thus Adonibezek was trampled upon himself, as he had trampled on other 
 kings. 

 4. He threatens those with military execution that stood out and would 
 not submit to the king of Babylon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 That nation that will not <I>put their neck under his yoke</I> I will 
 <I>punish with sword and famine,</I> with one judgment after another, 
 till it is <I>consumed by his hand.</I> Nebuchadnezzar was very unjust 
 and barbarous in invading the rights and liberties of his neighbours 
 thus, and forcing them into a subjection to him; yet God had just and 
 holy ends in permitting him to do so, to punish these nations for their 
 idolatry and gross immoralities. Those that would not serve the God 
 that made them were justly made to serve their enemies that sought to 
 ruin them. 

 5. He shows them the vanity of all the hopes they fed themselves with,
 that they should preserve their liberties,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.
 
 These nations had their prophets too, that pretended to foretell future 
 events by the stars, or by dreams, or enchantments; and they, to please 
 their patrons, and because they would themselves have it so, flattered 
 them with assurances that they <I>should not serve the king of 
 Babylon.</I> Thus they designed to animate them to a vigorous 
 resistance; and, though they had no ground for it, they hoped hereby to 
 do them service. But he tells them that it would prove to their 
 destruction; for by resisting they would provoke the conqueror to deal 
 severely with them, to <I>remove them,</I> and <I>drive them out</I> 
 into a miserable captivity, in which they should all be lost and buried 
 in oblivion.  Particular prophecies against these nations that bordered 
 on Israel severally, the ruin of which is here foretold in the general, 
 we shall meet with,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:1-49:39,Eze+25:1-17"><I>ch.</I> xlviii. and xlix.,
 and Ezek. xxv.</A>,

 which had the same accomplishment with this here. Note, <I>When God
 judges he will overcome.</I> 

 6. He puts them in a fair way to prevent their destruction by a quiet 
 and easy submission,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 The nations that will be content to <I>serve the king of Babylon,</I> 
 and pay him tribute for seventy years (ten apprenticeships), <I>those 
 will I let remain still in their own land.</I> Those that will bend 
 shall not break.  Perhaps the dominion of the king of Babylon may bear 
 no harder upon them than that of their own kings had done. It is often 
 more a point of honour than true wisdom to prefer liberty before life. 
 It is not mentioned to the disgrace of Issachar that because he saw 
 <I>rest</I> was <I>good,</I> and the <I>land pleasant,</I> that he 
 might peaceably enjoy it, he bowed <I>his shoulder to bear,</I> and 
 <I>became a servant to tribute</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:14,15">Gen. xlix. 14, 15</A>),

 as these are here advised to do: <I>Serve the king of Babylon and you
 shall till the land</I> and <I>dwell therein.</I> Some would condemn 
 this as the evidence of a mean spirit, but the prophet recommends it as 
 that of a meek spirit, which yields to necessity, and by a quiet 
 submission to the hardest turns of Providence makes the best of bad: it 
 is better to do so than by struggling to make it worse.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all
 these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king
 of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.
 &nbsp; 13  Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the
 famine, and by the pestilence, as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath spoken against
 the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?
 &nbsp; 14  Therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that
 speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon:
 for they prophesy a lie unto you.
 &nbsp; 15  For I have not sent them, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, yet they prophesy
 a lie in my name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might
 perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.
 &nbsp; 16  Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying,
 Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Hearken not to the words of your prophets
 that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s
 house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon: for they
 prophesy a lie unto you.
 &nbsp; 17  Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live:
 wherefore should this city be laid waste?
 &nbsp; 18  But if they <I>be</I> prophets, and if the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> be
 with them, let them now make intercession to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts,
 that the vessels which are left in the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and
 <I>in</I> the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to
 Babylon.
 &nbsp; 19  For thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts concerning the pillars, and
 concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the
 residue of the vessels that remain in this city,
 &nbsp; 20  Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he
 carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah
 from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and
 Jerusalem;
 &nbsp; 21  Yea, thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, the God of Israel,
 concerning the vessels that remain <I>in</I> the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 and <I>in</I> the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem;
 &nbsp; 22  They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be
 until the day that I visit them, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; then will I
 bring them up, and restore them to this place.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 What was said to all the nations is here with a particular tenderness 
 applied to the nation of the Jews, for whom Jeremiah was sensibly 
 concerned. The case at present stood thus: Judah and Jerusalem had 
 often contested with the king of Babylon, and still were worsted; many 
 both of their valuable persons and their valuable goods were carried to 
 Babylon already, and some of the <I>vessels of the Lord's house</I> 
 particularly. Now how this struggle would issue was the question. They 
 had those among them at Jerusalem who pretended to be prophets, who 
 bade them hold out and they should, in a little time, be too hard for 
 the king of Babylon and recover all that they had lost. Now Jeremiah is 
 sent to bid them yield and knock under, for that, instead of recovering 
 what they had lost, they should otherwise lose all that remained; and 
 to press them to this is the scope of these verses.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Jeremiah humbly addresses the king of Judah, to persuade him to 
 surrender to the king of Babylon. His act would be the people's and 
 would determine them, and therefore he speaks to him as to them all 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:12"><I>v.</I>  12</A>):

 <I>Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and live.</I> 
 Is it their wisdom to submit to the heavy iron yoke of a cruel tyrant, 
 that they may secure the lives of their bodies? And is it not much more 
 our wisdom to submit to the sweet and easy yoke of our rightful Lord 
 and Master Jesus Christ, that we may secure the lives of our souls? 
 Bring down your spirits to repentance and faith, and that is the way to 
 bring up your spirits to heaven and glory. And with much more cogency 
 and compassion may we expostulate with perishing souls than Jeremiah 
 here expostulates with a perishing people: "<I>Why will you die by the 
 sword and the famine</I>--miserable deaths, which you inevitably run 
 yourselves upon, under pretence of avoiding miserable lives?" What God 
 had spoken, in general, of all those that would not submit to the king 
 of Babylon, he would have them to apply to themselves and be afraid of. 
 It were well if sinners would, in like manner, be afraid of the 
 destruction threatened against all those that will not have <I>Christ 
 to reign over them,</I> and reason thus with themselves, "<I>Why should 
 we die</I> the second death, which is a thousand times worse than that 
 by <I>sword and famine,</I> when we might submit and live?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He addresses himself likewise to the priests and the people 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:16"><I>v.</I>  16</A>),

 to persuade them to <I>serve the king of Babylon,</I> that they might 
 <I>live,</I> and might prevent the desolation of the city 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:17"><I>v.</I>  17</A>):
 
 "<I>Wherefore should it be laid waste,</I> as certainly it will be if 
 you stand it out?" The priests had been Jeremiah's enemies, and had 
 sought his life to destroy it, yet he approves himself their friend, 
 and seeks their lives, to preserve and secure them, which is an example 
 to us to render <I>good for evil.</I> When the <I>blood-thirsty hate 
 the upright,</I> yet <I>the just seek his soul,</I> and the welfare of 
 it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+29:10">Prov. xxix. 10</A>.

 The matter was far gone here; they were upon the brink of ruin, which 
 they would not have been brought to if they would have taken Jeremiah's 
 counsel; yet he continues his friendly admonitions to them, to save the 
 last stake and manage that wisely, and now at length in this their day 
 to understand the <I>things that belong to their peace,</I> when they 
 had but one day to turn them in.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. In both these addresses he warns them against giving credit to the 
 false prophets that rocked them asleep in their security, because they 
 saw that they loved to slumber: "<I>Hearken not to the words of the 
 prophets</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 <I>your prophets,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 They are not God's prophets; he never sent them; they do not serve him, 
 nor seek to please him; they are yours, for they say what you would 
 have them say, and aim at nothing but to please you." Two things their 
 prophets flattered them into the belief of:--

 1. That the power which the king of Babylon had gained over them should
 now shortly be broken.  They said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 "<I>You shall not serve the king of Babylon;</I> you need not submit 
 voluntarily, for you shall not be compelled to submit." This they 
 prophesied <I>in the name of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 as if God had sent them to the people on this errand, in kindness to 
 them, that they might not disparage themselves by an inglorious 
 surrender. But it was a lie.  They said that God sent them; but that 
 was false; he disowns it: <I>I have not sent them, saith the Lord.</I> 
 They said that they should never be brought into subjection to the king 
 of Babylon; but that was false too, the event proved it so. They said 
 that to hold out to the last would be the way to secure themselves and 
 their city; but that was false, for it would certainly end in their 
 being driven out and perishing. So that it was all a lie, from first to 
 last; and the prophets that deceived the people with these lies did, in 
 the issue, but deceive themselves; the blind leaders and the blind 
 followers fell together into the ditch: That <I>you might perish, you, 
 and the prophets that prophesy unto you,</I> who will be so far from 
 warranting your security that they cannot secure themselves. Note, 
 Those that encourage sinners to go on in their sinful ways will in the 
 end perish with them. 

 2. They prophesied that the vessels of the temple, which the king of
 Babylon had already carried away, should now shortly be brought back

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);

 this they fed the priests with the hopes of, knowing how acceptable it 
 would be to them, who loved the <I>gold of the temple</I> better than 
 the <I>temple that sanctified the gold.</I> These vessels were taken 
 away when Jeconiah was carried captive into Babylon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 We have the story, and it is a melancholy one, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:13,15,2Ch+36:10">2 Kings xxiv. 13, 15; 
 2 Chron.  xxxvi. 10</A>.

 All the <I>goodly vessels</I> (that is, all the <I>vessels of gold</I> 
 that were <I>in the house of the Lord</I>), with all the treasures, 
 were taken as prey, and brought to Babylon. This was grievous to them 
 above any thing; for the temple was their pride and confidence, and the 
 stripping of that was too plain an indication of that which the true 
 prophet told them, that their <I>God had departed from them.</I> Their 
 false prophets therefore had no other way to make them easy than by 
 telling them that the king of Babylon should be forced to restore them 
 in a little while. Now here, 

 (1.) Jeremiah bids them think of preserving the vessels that remained 
 by their prayers, rather than of bringing back those that were gone by 
 their prophecies

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>If they be prophets,</I> as they pretend, and if <I>the word of the 
 Lord be with them</I>--if they have any intercourse with heaven and any 
 interest there, let them improve it for the stopping of the progress of 
 the judgment; let them step into the gap, and stand with their censer 
 <I>between the living and the dead,</I> between that which is carried 
 away and that which remains, that <I>the plague may be stayed; let them 
 make intercession with the Lord of hosts,</I> that the vessels which 
 are left go not after the rest. 

 [1.] Instead of prophesying, let them pray. Note, Prophets must be 
 praying men; by being much in prayer they must make it to appear that 
 they keep up a correspondence with heaven.  We cannot think that those 
 do, as prophets, ever hear thence, who do not frequently by prayer send 
 thither. By praying for the safety and prosperity of the sanctuary they 
 must make it to appear that, as becomes prophets, they are of a public 
 spirit; and by the success of their prayers it will appear that God 
 favours them. 

 [2.] Instead of being concerned for the retrieving of what they had 
 lost, they must bestir themselves for the securing of what was left, 
 and take it as a great favour if they can gain that point. When God's 
 judgments are abroad we must not seek great things, but be thankful for 
 a little.  

 (2.) He assures them that even this point should not be gained, but the 
 brazen vessels should go after the golden ones,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:19,22"><I>v.</I> 19, 22</A>.
 
 Nebuchadnezzar had found so good a booty once that he would be sure to 
 come again and take all he could find, not only in <I>the house of the 
 Lord,</I> but in the <I>king's house.</I> They shall all be carried to 
 Babylon in triumph, and <I>there shall they be.</I> But he concludes 
 with a gracious promise that the time should come when they should all 
 be returned: <I>Until the day that I visit them in mercy,</I> according 
 to appointment, and <I>then I will bring</I> those vessels <I>up again, 
 and restore them to this place,</I> to their place. Surely they were 
 under the protection of a special Providence, else they would have been 
 melted down and put to some other use; but there was to be a second 
 temple, for which they were to be reserved. We read particularly of the 
 return of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:8">Ezra i. 8</A>.

 Note, Though the return of the church's prosperity do not come in our
 time, we must not therefore despair of it, for it will come in God's 
 time. Though those who said, <I>The vessels of the Lord's house</I> 
 shall <I>shortly</I> be brought again, prophesied a lie

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:16"><I>v.</I>  16</A>),

 yet he that said, They shall <I>at length</I> be brought again, 
 prophesied the truth. We are apt to set our clock before God's dial, 
 and then to quarrel because they do not agree; but the Lord is a God of 
 judgment, and it is fit that we should wait for him.</P>
