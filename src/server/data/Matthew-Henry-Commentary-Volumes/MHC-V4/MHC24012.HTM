 In this chapter we have, 

 I. The prophet's humble complaint to God of the success that wicked
 people had in their wicked practices 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>)

 and his appeal to God concerning his own integrity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:3">ver. 3</A>),

 with a prayer that God would, for the sake of the public, bring the
 wickedness of the wicked to an end, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>.

 II. God's rebuke to the prophet for his uneasiness at his present
 troubles, bidding him prepare for greater, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:5,6">ver. 5, 6</A>.

 III. A sad lamentation of the present deplorable state of the Israel of
 God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:7-13">ver. 7-13</A>.

 IV. An intimation of mercy to God's people, in a denunciation of wrath 
 against their neighbours that helped forward their affliction, that 
 they should be plucked out; but with a promise that if they would at 
 last join themselves with the people of God they should come in sharers 
 with them in their privileges,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Righteous <I>art</I> thou, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, when I plead with thee: yet let
 me talk with thee of <I>thy</I> judgments: Wherefore doth the way of
 the wicked prosper? <I>wherefore</I> are all they happy that deal very
 treacherously?
 &nbsp; 2  Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow,
 yea, they bring forth fruit: thou <I>art</I> near in their mouth, and
 far from their reins.
 &nbsp; 3  But thou, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried
 mine heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the
 slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.
 &nbsp; 4  How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field
 wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts
 are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see
 our last end.
 &nbsp; 5  If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied
 thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and <I>if</I> in the
 land of peace, <I>wherein</I> thou trustedst, <I>they wearied thee,</I>
 then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?
 &nbsp; 6  For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they
 have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they have called a
 multitude after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair
 words unto thee.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet doubts not but it would be of use to others to know what 
 had passed between God and his soul, what temptations he had been 
 assaulted with and how he had got over them; and therefore he here 
 tells us,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What liberty he humbly took, and was graciously allowed him, to 
 reason with God concerning his judgments, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 He is about to <I>plead</I> with God, not to quarrel with him, or find 
 fault with his proceedings, but to enquire into the meaning of them, 
 that he might more and more see reason to be satisfied in them, and 
 might have wherewith to answer both his own and others' objections 
 against them. The works of the Lord, and the reasons of them, are
 <I>sought out</I> even <I>of those that have pleasure therein.</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+111:2">Ps. cxi. 2</A>.

 We may not <I>strive with our Maker,</I> but we may reason with him.
 The prophet lays down a truth of unquestionable certainty, which he 
 resolves to abide by in managing this argument: <I>Righteous art thou, 
 O Lord! when I plead with thee.</I> Thus he arms himself against the 
 temptation wherewith he was assaulted, to envy the prosperity of the 
 wicked, before he entered into a parley with it. Note, When we are
 most in the dark concerning the meaning of God's dispensations we must 
 still resolve to keep up right thoughts of God, and must be confident 
 of this, that he never did, nor ever will do, the least wrong to any of 
 his creatures; even when his <I>judgments are</I> unsearchable as <I>a 
 great deep,</I> and altogether unaccountable, yet <I>his 
 righteousness</I> is as conspicuous and immovable as <I>the great 
 mountains,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+36:6">Ps. xxxvi. 6</A>.

 Though sometimes <I>clouds and darkness are round about him,</I> yet
 <I>justice and judgment are</I> always <I>the habitation of his 
 throne,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+97:2">Ps. xcvii. 2</A>.

 When we find it hard to understand particular providences we must have
 recourse to general truths as our first principles, and abide by them; 
 however dark the providence may be, <I>the Lord is righteous;</I> see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:1">Ps. lxxiii. 1</A>.

 And we must acknowledge it to him, as the prophet here, even when we
 <I>plead with him,</I> as those that have no thoughts of contending but 
 of learning, being fully assured that he will be <I>justified when he 
 speaks.</I> Note, However we may see cause for our own information to 
 plead with God, yet it becomes us to own that, whatever he says or 
 does, he is in the right.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What it was in the dispensations of divine Providence that he 
 stumbled at and that he thought would bear a debate. It was that which 
 has been a temptation to many wise and good men, and such a one as they 
 have with difficulty got over. They see the designs and projects of 
 wicked people successful: <I>The way of the wicked prospers;</I> they 
 compass their malicious designs and gain their point. They see their 
 affairs and concerns in a good posture: <I>They are happy,</I> happy as 
 the world can make them, though <I>they deal</I> treacherously, <I>very 
 treacherously,</I> both with God and man. Hypocrites are chiefly meant 
 (as appears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 who dissemble in their good professions, and depart from their good 
 beginnings and good promises, and in both they deal treacherously, very 
 treacherously. It has been said that men cannot expect to prosper who 
 are unjust and dishonest in their dealings; but these deal 
 treacherously, and yet <I>they are happy.</I> The prophet shows 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)
 
 both their prosperity and their abuse of their prosperity.

 1. God had been very indulgent to them and they were got beforehand in 
 the world: "They are planted in a good land, a land flowing with milk 
 and honey, and <I>thou hast planted them!</I> nay, thou didst cast out 
 the heathen to plant them," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:2,80:8">Ps. xliv. 2, lxxx. 8</A>.

 Many a tree is planted that yet never grows nor comes to any thing; but
 <I>they have taken root;</I> their prosperity seems to be confirmed and 
 settled. They take root in the earth, for there they fix themselves, 
 and thence they draw the sap of all their satisfaction. Many trees 
 however take root which yet never come on; but these <I>grow, yea they 
 bring forth fruit;</I> their families are built up, they live high, and 
 spend at a great rate; and all this was owing to the benignity of the 
 divine Providence, which smiled upon them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:7">Ps. lxxiii. 7</A>.

 2. Thus God had favoured them, though they had dealt treacherously with 
 him: <I>Thou art near in their mouth and far from their reins.</I> This 
 was no uncharitable censure, for he spoke by the Spirit of prophecy, 
 without which it is not safe to charge men with hypocrisy whose 
 appearances are plausible. Observe,

 (1.) Thought they cared not for thinking of God, nor had any sincere 
 affection to him, yet they could easily persuade themselves to speak of 
 him frequently and with an air of seriousness. Piety from the teeth 
 outward is no difficult thing. Many speak the language of Israel that 
 are not Israelites indeed. 

 (2.) Though they had on all occasions the name of God ready in their 
 mouth, and accustomed themselves to those forms of speech that savoured 
 of piety, yet they could not persuade themselves to keep up the fear of 
 God in their hearts. The form of godliness should engage us to keep up 
 the power of it; but with them it did not do so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What comfort he had in appealing to God concerning his own 
 integrity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>But thou, O Lord! knowest me.</I> Probably the wicked men he 
 complains of were forward to reproach and censure him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:18"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 18</A>),

 in reference to which this was his comfort, that God was a witness of
 his integrity. God knew he was not such a one as they were (who had God 
 <I>near in their mouths, but far from their reins</I>), nor such a one 
 as they took him to be, and represented him, a deceiver and a false 
 prophet; those that thus abused him did not know him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:8">1 Cor. ii. 8</A>.
 
 "<I>But thou, O Lord! knowest me,</I> though they think me not worth
 their notice." 

 1. Observe what the matter is concerning which he appeals to God: Thou
 knowest <I>my heart towards thee.</I> Note, We are as our hearts are, 
 and our hearts are good or bad according as they are, or are not, 
 towards God; and this is that therefore concerning which we should 
 examine ourselves, that we may approve ourselves to God. 

 2. The cognizance to which he appeals: <I>"Thou knowest me</I> better 
 than I know myself, not by hearsay or report, for <I>thou hast seen 
 me,</I> not with a transient glance, but thou hast <I>tried my 
 heart.</I>" God's knowledge of us is as clear and exact and certain as 
 if he had made the most strict scrutiny. Note, The God with whom we 
 have to do perfectly knows how our hearts are towards him. He knows 
 both the guile of the hypocrite and the sincerity of the upright.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He prays that God would turn his hand against these wicked people, 
 and not suffer them to prosper always, though they had prospered long: 
 "Let some judgment come to <I>pull them out</I> of this fat pasture 
 <I>as sheep for the slaughter,</I> that it may appear their long 
 prosperity was but like the feeding of lambs in a large place, to 
 <I>prepare them for the day of slaughter,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:16">Hos. iv. 16</A>.

 God suffered them to prosper that by their pride and luxury they might
 fill up the measure of their iniquity and so be ripened for 
 destruction; and therefore he thinks it a piece of necessary justice 
 that they should fall into mischief themselves, because they had done 
 so much mischief to others, that they should be pulled out of their 
 land, because they had brought ruin upon the land, and the longer they 
 continued in it the more hurt they did, as the plagues of their 
 generation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>How long shall the land mourn.</I> (as it does under the judgments 
 of God inflicted upon it) <I>for the wickedness of those that dwell 
 therein?</I> Lord, shall those prosper themselves that ruin all about 
 them?" 

 1. See here what the judgment was which the land was now groaning
 under: <I>The herbs of every field wither</I> (the grass is burnt up 
 and all the products of the earth fail), and then it follows of course, 
 the beasts are consumed, and the birds, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:5">1 Kings xviii. 5</A>.

 This was the effect of a long drought, or want of rain, which happened,
 as it should seem, at the latter end of Josiah's reign and the 
 beginning of Jehoiakim's; it is mentioned

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:3,8:13,9:10,12"><I>ch.</I> iii. 3, viii. 13, ix. 10, 12</A>,

 and more fully afterwards,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:1-22"><I>ch.</I> xiv.</A>

 If they would have been brought to repentance by this less judgment,
 the greater would have been prevented. Now why was it that this 
 <I>fruitful land</I> was <I>turned into barrenness,</I> but <I>for the 
 wickedness of those that dwelt therein?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:34">Ps. xvii. 34</A>.

 Therefore the prophet prays that these wicked people might <I>die for
 their own sin,</I> and that the whole nation might not suffer for it.

 2. See here what was the language of their wickedness: <I>They said, He 
 shall not see our last end,</I> either,

 (1.) God himself shall not. Atheism is the root of hypocrisy. God is
 <I>far from their reins,</I> though <I>near in their mouth,</I> because 
 they say, <I>How doth God know?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:11,Job+22:13">Ps. lxxiii. 11; Job xxii. 13</A>.

 He knows not what way we take nor what it will end in. Or,

 (2.) Jeremiah <I>shall not see our last end;</I> whatever he pretends, 
 when he asks us what shall be in the end hereof he cannot himself 
 foresee it. They look upon him as a false prophet. Or, "whatever it
 is, he shall not live to see it, for we will be the death of him,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:21"><I>ch.</I> xi. 21</A>.

 Note,

 [1.] Men's setting their latter end at a great distance, or looking
 upon it as uncertain, is at the bottom of all their wickedness, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+1:9">Lam. i. 9</A>.

 [2.] The whole creation groans under the burden of the sin of man, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:22">Rom. viii. 22</A>.

 It is for this that <I>the earth mourns</I> (so it may be read);
 <I>cursed is the ground for thy sake.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He acquaints us with the answer God gave to those complaints of his, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 We often find the prophets admonished, whose business it was to 
 admonish others, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:11">Isa. viii. 11</A>.

 Ministers have lessons to learn as well as lessons to teach, and must
 themselves hear God's voice and preach to themselves. Jeremiah 
 complained much of the wickedness of the men of Anathoth, and that, 
 notwithstanding that, they prospered. Now, this seems to be an answer 
 to that complaint.

 1. It is allowed that he had cause to complain

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>Thy brethren,</I> the priests of Anathoth, who are of <I>the house 
 of thy father,</I> who ought to have protected thee and pretended to do 
 so, <I>even they have dealt treacherously with thee,</I> have been 
 false to thee, and, under colour of friendship, have designedly done 
 thee all the mischief they could; they <I>have called a multitude after 
 thee,</I> raised the mob upon thee, to whom they have endeavoured, by 
 all arts possible, to render thee despicable or odious, while at the 
 same time they pretended that they had no design to persecute thee nor 
 to deprive thee of thy liberty. They are indeed such as thou canst 
 <I>not believe, though they speak fair words to thee.</I> They seem to 
 be thy friends, but are really thy enemies." Note, God's faithful 
 servants must not think it at all strange if their foes be <I>those of 
 their own house</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:36">Matt. x. 36</A>),

 and if those they expect kindness from prove such as they can put no
 confidence in,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:5">Mic. vii. 5</A>.

 2. Yet he is told that he carried the matter too far.

 (1.) He laid the unkindness of his countrymen too much to heart. 
 <I>They wearied</I> him, because it was <I>in a land of peace wherein 
 he trusted,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 It was very grievous to him to be thus hated and abused by his own 
 kindred. He was disturbed in his mind by it; his spirit was sunk and 
 overwhelmed with it, so that he was in great agitation and distress 
 about it. Nay, he was discouraged in his work by it, began to be weary 
 of prophesying, and to think of giving it up. 

 (2.) He did not consider that this was but the beginning of his sorrow, 
 and that he had sorer trials yet before him; and, whereas he should 
 endeavour by a patient bearing of this trouble to prepare himself for 
 greater, by his uneasiness under this he did but unfit himself for what 
 further lay before him: <I>If thou hast run with the footmen and they 
 have wearied thee,</I> and run thee quite out of breath,<I>then how 
 wilt thou contend with horses?</I> If the injuries done him by the men 
 of Anathoth made such an impression upon him, what would he do when the 
 princes and chief priests at Jerusalem should set upon him with their 
 power, as they did afterwards?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+20:2,32:2"><I>ch.</I> xx. 2; xxxii. 2</A>.

 If he was so soon tired <I>in a land of peace,</I> where there was
 little noise or peril, <I>what would he do in the swellings of 
 Jordan,</I> when that overflows all its banks and frightens even lions 
 out of their thickets?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:19"><I>ch.</I> xlix. 19</A>.

 Note,

 [1.] While we are in this world we must expect troubles, and
 difficulties. Our life is a race, a warfare; we are in danger of being 
 run down. 

 [2.] God's usual method being to begin with smaller trials, it is our 
 wisdom to expect greater than any we have yet met with. We may be 
 called out to <I>contend with horsemen,</I> and the sons of Anak may 
 perhaps be reserved for the last encounter.

 [3.] It highly concerns us to prepare for such trials and to consider 
 what we should do in them. How shall we preserve our integrity and 
 peace when we come to <I>the swellings of Jordan?</I>

 [4.] In order to our preparation for further and greater trials, we are 
 concerned to approve ourselves well in present smaller trials, to keep 
 up our spirits, keep hold of the promise, keep in our way, with our eye 
 upon the prize, so run that we may obtain it. Some good interpreters 
 understand this as spoken to the people, who were very secure and 
 fearless of the threatened judgments. If they have been so humbled and
 impoverished by smaller calamities, so wasted by the Assyrians,--if the 
 Ammonites and Moabites, who were their brethren, and with whom they 
 were in league, proved false to them (as undoubtedly they would),--then 
 how would they be able to deal with such a powerful adversary as the 
 Chaldeans would be? How would they bear up their head against that 
 invasion which should come like <I>the swelling of Jordan?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The people of the Jews are here marked for ruin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God is here brought in falling out with them and leaving them 
 desolate; and they could never have been undone if they had not 
 provoked God to desert them. It is a terrible word that God here says 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>I have forsaken my house</I>--the temple, which had been his palace; 
 they had polluted it, and so forced him out of it: <I>I have left my 
 heritage,</I> and will look after it no more. His people that he has 
 taken such delight in, and care of, are now thrown out of his 
 protection. They had been <I>the dearly beloved of his soul,</I> 
 precious in his sight and honorable above any people, which is 
 mentioned to aggravate their sin in returning him hatred for his love 
 and their misery in throwing themselves out of the favour of one that 
 had such a kindness for them, and to justify God in his dealings with 
 them. He sought not occasion against them, but, if they would have 
 conducted themselves with any tolerable propriety, he would have made 
 the best of them, for they were <I>the beloved of his soul;</I> but 
 they had conducted themselves so that they had provoked him to <I>give 
 them into the hand of their enemies,</I> to leave them unguarded, an 
 easy prey to those that bore them ill-will. But what was the quarrel 
 God had with a people that had been so long dear to him? Why, truly, 
 they had degenerated. 

 1. They had become like <I>beasts of prey,</I> which nobody loves, but
 every body avoids and gets as far off from as he can

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>My heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest.</I> Their sins cry 
 to heaven for vengeance as loud as a lion roars. Nay, they <I>cry out 
 against God</I> in the threatenings and slaughter which they breathe 
 against his prophets that speak to them in his name; and what is said 
 and done against them God takes as said and done against himself. They 
 blaspheme his name, oppose his authority, and bid defiance to his 
 justice, and so <I>cry out against him as a lion in the forest.</I> 
 Those that were the <I>sheep of God's pasture</I> had become barbarous 
 and ravenous, and as ungovernable as lions in the forest; <I>therefore 
 he hated them;</I> for what delight could the God of love take in a 
 people that had now become as roaring lions and raging beasts, fit to 
 be taken and shot at, as a vexation and torment to all about them? 

 2. They had become like <I>birds of prey,</I> and therefore also
 unworthy a place in God's house, where neither beasts nor birds of prey 
 were admitted to be offered in sacrifice

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>My heritage is unto me as a bird with talons</I> (so some read it, 
 and so the margin); they are continually pulling and pecking at one 
 another; they have by their unnatural contentions made their country a 
 cock-pit. Or <I>as a speckled bird,</I> dyed, or sprinkled, or bedewed 
 with the blood of her prey. The shedding of innocent blood was 
 Jerusalem's measure-filling sin, and hastened their ruin, not only as 
 it provoked their neighbours likewise; for those that have <I>their 
 hand against every man</I> shall have <I>every man's hand against 
 them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+16:12">Gen. xvi. 12</A>),

 and so it follows here: <I>The birds round about are against her.</I>
 Some make her a <I>speckled, pied,</I> or <I>motley bird,</I> upon the 
 account of their mixing the superstitious customs and usages of the 
 heathen with divine institutions in the worship of God; they were fond 
 of a party-coloured religion, and thought it made them fine, when 
 really it made them odious. God's turtle-dove is no speckled bird.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The enemies are here brought in falling upon them and laying them 
 desolate. And some think it is upon this account that they are compared 
 to a speckled bird, because fowls usually make a noise about a bird of 
 an odd unusual colour. God's people are, among the children of this 
 world, as <I>men wondered at,</I> as a <I>speckled bird;</I> but this 
 people had by their own folly made themselves so; and the beasts and 
 birds are called and commissioned to prey upon them. Let <I>all the 
 birds round</I> be <I>against her,</I> for God has forsaken her, and 
 with them let <I>all the beasts of the field come to devour.</I> Those 
 that have made a prey of others shall themselves be preyed upon. It did 
 not lessen the sin of the nations, but very much increased the misery 
 of Judah and Jerusalem, that the desolation brought upon them was by 
 order from heaven. The birds and beasts are perhaps called to feast 
 upon the bodies of the slain, as in St. John's vision,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:17,18">Rev. xix. 17, 18</A>.
 
 The utter desolation of the land by the Chaldean army is here spoken of 
 as a thing done, so sure, so near, was it. God speaks of it as a thing 
 which he had appointed to be done, and yet which he had no pleasure in, 
 any more than in the death of other sinners.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. See with what a tender affection he speaks of this land, 
 notwithstanding the sinfulness of it, in remembrance of his covenant, 
 and the tribute of honour and glory he had formerly had from it: It is 
 <I>my vineyard, my portion, my pleasant portion,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Note, God has a kindness and concern for his church, though there be 
 much amiss in it; and his correcting it will every way consist with his 
 complacency in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. See with what a tender compassion he speaks of the desolations of 
 this land: <I>Many pastors</I> (the Chaldean generals that made 
 themselves masters of the country and ate it up with their armies as 
 easily as the Arabian shepherds with their flocks eat up the fruits of 
 a piece of ground that lies common) <I>have destroyed my vineyard,</I> 
 without any consideration had either of the value of it or of my 
 interest in it; they have with the greatest insolence and indignation 
 <I>trodden it under foot,</I> and that which was a pleasant land they 
 have made <I>a desolate wilderness.</I> The destruction was universal: 
 <I>The whole land is made desolate,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 It is made so by the sword of war: <I>The spoilers,</I> the Chaldean 
 soldiers,<I>have come through the plain upon all high places;</I> they 
 have made themselves masters of all the natural fastnesses and 
 artificial fortresses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 <I>The sword devours from one end of the land to the other;</I> all 
 places lie exposed, and the numerous army of the invaders disperse 
 themselves into every corner of that fruitful country, so that <I>no 
 flesh shall have peace,</I> none shall be exempt from the calamity nor 
 be able to enjoy any tranquillity. When all flesh have corrupted their 
 way, no flesh shall have peace; those only have peace that walk after 
 the Spirit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. See whence all this misery comes. 

 (1.) It comes from the displeasure of God. It is <I>the sword of the
 Lord</I> that <I>devours,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 
 While God's people keep close to him the sword of their protectors and 
 deliverers is the sword of the Lord, witness that of Gideon; but when 
 they have forsaken him, so that he has become their enemy and fights 
 against them, then the sword of their invaders and destroyers becomes 
 the <I>sword of the Lord;</I> witness this of the Chaldeans. It is 
 <I>because of the fierce anger of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 it was this that kindled this fire among them and made their enemies so 
 furious. And <I>who may stand before him when he is angry?</I>

 (2.) It is their sin that has made God their enemy, particularly their 
 incorrigibleness under former rebukes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 The land <I>mourns unto me;</I> the country that lies desolate does, as 
 it were, pour out its complaint before God and humble itself under his 
 hand; but the inhabitants are so senseless and stupid that <I>none of 
 them lays it to heart;</I> they do not mourn to God, but are unaffected 
 with his displeasure, while the very ground they go upon shames them. 
 Note, When God's hand is lifted up, and men will not see, it shall be 
 laid on, and they shall be made to feel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:11">Isa. xxvi. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. See how unable they should be to guard against it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 "<I>They have sown wheat,</I> that is, they have taken a great deal of 
 pains for their own security and promised themselves great matters from 
 their endeavors, but it is all in vain; <I>they shall reap thorns,</I> 
 that is, that which shall prove very grievous and vexatious to them. 
 Instead of helping themselves, they shall but make themselves more 
 uneasy. <I>They have put themselves to pain,</I> both with their
 labour and with their expectations, <I>but it shall not profit;</I> 
 they shall not prevail to extricate themselves out of the difficulties 
 into which they have plunged themselves. <I>They shall be ashamed of 
 your revenues,</I> ashamed that they have depended so much upon their 
 preparations for war and particularly upon their ability to bear the 
 charges of it." Money constitutes the sinews of war; they thought they 
 had enough of that, but shall be ashamed of it; for their silver and 
 gold shall not profit them in the day of the Lord's anger.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> against all mine evil neighbours, that
 touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to
 inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck
 out the house of Judah from among them.
 &nbsp; 15  And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them
 out I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring
 them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.
 &nbsp; 16  And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the
 ways of my people, to swear by my name, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> liveth; as they
 taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built in
 the midst of my people.
 &nbsp; 17  But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and
 destroy that nation, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophets sometimes, in God's name, delivered messages both of 
 judgment and mercy to the nations that bordered on the land of Israel: 
 but here is a message to all those in general who had in their turns 
 been one way or other injurious to God's people, had either oppressed 
 them or triumphed in their being oppressed. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What the quarrel was that God had with them. They were <I>his evil 
 neighbours</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 evil neighbours to his church, and what they did against it he took as 
 done against himself, and therefore called them <I>his evil 
 neighbours,</I> that should have been neighbourly to Israel, but were 
 quite otherwise. Note, It is often the lot of good people to live among 
 bad neighbours, that are unkind and provoking to them; and it is bad 
 indeed when they are all so. These evil neighbours were the Moabites, 
 Ammonites Syrians, Edomites, Egyptians, that had been evil neighbours 
 to Israel in helping to debauch them and draw them from God (therefore 
 God calls them his evil neighbours), and now they helped to make them 
 desolate, and joined with the Chaldeans against them. It is just with 
 God to make those the instruments of trouble to us whom we have made 
 instruments of sin. That which God lays to their charge is: They have 
 <I>meddled with the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to 
 inherit;</I> they unjustly seized that which was none of their own: 
 nay, they sacrilegiously turned that to their own use which was given 
 to God's peculiar people. He that said, <I>Touch not my anointed,</I> 
 said also, "<I>Touch not their inheritance;</I> it is at your peril if 
 you do." Not only the persons but the estates of God's people are under 
 his protection.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What course he would take with them. 

 1. He would break the power they had got over his people, and force
 them to make restitution: <I>I will pluck out the house of Judah from 
 among them.</I> This would be a great favour to God's people, who had 
 either been taken captive by them, or, when they fled to them for 
 shelter, had been detained and made prisoners; but it would be a great 
 mortification to their enemies, who would be like a lion disappointed 
 of his prey. The house of Judah either cannot or will not make any bold 
 struggles towards their own liberty; but God will with a gracious 
 violence pluck them out, will by his Spirit compel them to come out and 
 by his power compel their task-masters to let them go, as he plucked 
 Israel out of Egypt. 

 2. He would bring upon them the same calamities that they had been 
 instrumental to bring upon his people: <I>I will pluck them out of 
 their land.</I> Judgment began at the house of God, but it did not end 
 there. Nebuchadnezzar, when he had wasted the land of Israel, turned 
 his hand against their evil neighbours and was a scourge to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What mercy God had in store for such of them as would join 
 themselves to him and become his people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 They had drawn in God's backsliding people to join with them in the 
 service of idols. If now they would be drawn by a returning people to 
 join with them in the service of the true and living God, they should 
 not only have their enmity to the people of God forgiven them, but the 
 distance which they had been kept at before should be removed, and they 
 should be received to stand upon the same level with the Israel of God. 
 This had its accomplishment in part when, after the return out of 
 captivity, many of the people of the lands that had been evil 
 neighbours to Israel became Jews; and it was to have its accomplishment 
 in the conversion of the Gentiles to the faith of Christ. Let not 
 Israel, though injured by them, be implacable towards them, for God is 
 not: <I>After that I have plucked them out,</I> in justice for their 
 sins and in jealousy for the honour of Israel, <I>I will return,</I> 
 will change my way, <I>and have compassion on them.</I> Though, being 
 heathen, they can lay no claim to the mercies of the covenant, yet they 
 shall have benefit by the compassions of the Creator, who will 
 notwithstanding look upon them as the work of his hands. Note, God's 
 controversies with his creatures, though they cannot be disputed, may 
 be accommodated. Those who (as these) have been not only strangers, but 
 <I>enemies in their minds by wicked works,</I> may be 
 <I>reconciled,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:21">Col. i. 21</A>.
 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What were the terms on which God would show favour to them. It is 
 always provided <I>that they will diligently learn the ways of my 
 people,</I> that is, in general, the ways that they walk in when they 
 conduct themselves as <I>my people</I> (not the crooked ways into which 
 they have turned aside), the ways which my people are directed to take. 
 Note, 

 (1.) There are good ways that are peculiarly <I>the ways of God's
 people,</I> which however they may differ in the choice of their paths,
 they are all agreed to walk in. The ways of holiness and
 heavenly-mindedness, of love and peaceableness, the ways of prayer and
 sabbath-sanctification, and diligent attendance on instituted
 ordinances--these, and the like, are <I>the ways of God's people.</I>
 
 (2.) Those that would have their lot with God's people, and their last
 end like theirs, must learn their ways and walk in them, must observe 
 the rule they walk by and conform to that rule they walk by and conform 
 to that rule and go forth by those footsteps. By an intimate 
 conversation with God's people they must learn to do as they do. 

 (3.) It is impossible to learn the ways of God's people as they should 
 be learnt, without a great deal of care and pains. We must diligently 
 observe these ways and diligently obliges ourselves to walk in them, 
 must look diligently 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:15">Heb. xii. 15</A>),
 
 and work diligently, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:24">Luke xiii. 24</A>.

 In particular, they must learn to give honour to God's name by making
 all their solemn appeals to him. They must learn to say, <I>The Lord 
 liveth</I> (to own him, to adore him, and to abide by his judgment), 
 <I>as they taught my people to swear by Baal.</I> It was bad enough 
 that they did themselves swear by Baal, worse that they taught God's 
 own people, who had been better taught; and yet, if they will at length 
 reform, they shall be accepted. Observe,

 [1.] We must not despair of the conversion of the worst; no, not of 
 those who have been instrumental to pervert and debauch others; even 
 they may be brought to repentance, and, if they be, shall find mercy.

 [2.] Those whom we have been industrious to draw to that which is evil, 
 when God opens their eyes and ours, we should be as industrious to 
 follow in that which is good. It will be a holy revenge upon ourselves 
 to become pupils to those in the way of duty to whom we have been 
 tutors in the was of sin.

 [3.] The conversion of the deceived may prove a happy occasion of the
 conversion even of the deceivers. Thus those who fall together into the 
 ditch are sometimes plucked together out of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What should be the tokens and fruits of this favour when they return 
 to God and God to them. 

 (1.) They shall be restored to and re-established in their own land

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>I will bring them again every man to his heritage.</I> The same hand 
 that plucked them up shall plant them again. 

 (2.) They shall become entitled to the spiritual privileges of God's 
 Israel: "If they will be towardly, and <I>learn the ways of my 
 people,</I> will conform to the rules and confine themselves to the 
 restraints of my family, <I>then shall they be built in the midst of my 
 people.</I> They shall not only be brought among them, to have a name 
 and a place in the house of the Lord, where there was a court for the 
 Gentiles, but they shall be built among them; they shall unite with 
 them; the former enmities shall be slain; they shall be both edified 
 and settled among them." See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:5-7">Isa. lvi. 5-7</A>.

 Note, Those that diligently learn the ways of God's people shall enjoy
 the privileges and comforts of his people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. What should become of those that were still wedded to their own 
 evil ways, yea, though many of those about them turned to the Lord 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>If there will not obey,</I> if any of them continue to stand it out, 
 <I>I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation,</I> that family, 
 that particular person, <I>saith the Lord.</I> Those that will not be 
 ruled by the grace of God shall be ruined by the justice of God. And,
 if disobedient nations shall be destroyed, much more disobedient 
 churches from whom better things are expected.</P>
