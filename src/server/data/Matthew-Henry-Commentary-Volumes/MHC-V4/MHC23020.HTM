 This chapter is a prediction of the carrying away of multitudes both of 
 the Egyptians and the Ethiopians into captivity by the king of Assyria. 
 Here is, 

 I. The sign by which this was foretold, which was the prophet's going
 for some time barefoot and almost naked, like a poor captive, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+20:1,2">ver. 1-2</A>.

 II. The explication of that sign, with application to Egypt and
 Ethiopia,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+20:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>.

 III. The good use which the people of God should make of this, which is
 never to trust in an arm of flesh, because thus it will deceive them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+20:6">ver. 6</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod, (when Sargon the
 king of Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took
 it;
 &nbsp; 2  At the same time spake the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> by Isaiah the son of Amoz,
 saying, Go and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put
 off thy shoe from thy foot. And he did so, walking naked and
 barefoot.
 &nbsp; 3  And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked
 naked and barefoot three years <I>for</I> a sign and wonder upon Egypt
 and upon Ethiopia;
 &nbsp; 4  So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians
 prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and
 barefoot, even with <I>their</I> buttocks uncovered, to the shame of
 Egypt.
 &nbsp; 5  And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their
 expectation, and of Egypt their glory.
 &nbsp; 6  And the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day,
 Behold, such <I>is</I> our expectation, whither we flee for help to be
 delivered from the king of Assyria: and how shall we escape?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God here, as King of nations, brings a sore calamity upon Egypt and 
 Ethiopia, but, as King of saints, brings good to his people out of it.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The date of this prophecy. It was in the year that Ashdod, a strong 
 city of the Philistines (but which some think was lately recovered from 
 them by Hezekiah, when he smote the Philistines even unto Gaza, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:8">2 Kings xviii. 8</A>),

 was besieged and taken by an army of the Assyrians. It is uncertain
 what year of Hezekiah that was, but the event was so remarkable that 
 those who lived then could by that token fix the time to a year. He 
 that was now king of Assyria is called <I>Sargon,</I> which some take 
 to be the same with Sennacherib; others think he was his immediate 
 predecessor, and succeeded Shalmaneser. Tartan, who was general, or 
 commander-in-chief, in this expedition, was one of Sennacherib's 
 officers, sent by him to bid defiance to Hezekiah, in concurrence with 
 Rabshakeh, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:17">2 Kings xviii. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The making of Isaiah a sign, by his unusual dress when he walked 
 abroad. He had been a sign to his own people of the melancholy times 
 that had come and were coming upon them, by the sackcloth which for 
 some time he had worn, of which he had a gown made, which he girt about 
 him. Some think he put himself into that habit of a mourner upon 
 occasion of the captivity of the ten tribes. Others think sackcloth was 
 what he commonly wore as a prophet, to show himself mortified to the 
 world, and that he might learn to endure hardness; soft clothing better 
 becomes those that attend in king's palaces 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:8">Matt. xi. 8</A>)

 than those that go on God's errands. Elijah wore hair-cloth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+1:8">2 Kings i. 8</A>),

 and John Baptist

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:4">Matt. iii. 4</A>)

 and those that pretended to be prophets supported their pretension by
 wearing rough garments

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:4">Zech. xiii. 4</A>);

 but Isaiah has orders given him to <I>loose his sackcloth from his
 loins,</I> not to exchange it for better clothing, but for none at 
 all--no upper garment, no mantle, cloak, or coat, but only that which 
 was next to him, we may suppose his shirt, waistcoat, and drawers; and 
 he must <I>put off his shoes,</I> and go barefoot; so that compared 
 with the dress of others, and what he himself usually wore, he might be 
 said to go <I>naked.</I> This was a great hardship upon the prophet; it 
 was a blemish to his reputation, and would expose him to contempt and 
 ridicule; the boys in the streets would hoot at him, and those who 
 sought occasion against him would say, <I>The prophet is</I> indeed 
 <I>a fool, and the spiritual man is mad,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:7">Hosea ix. 7</A>.

 It might likewise be a prejudice to his health; he was in danger of
 catching a cold, which might throw him into a fever, and cost him his 
 life; but God bade him do it, that he might give a proof of his 
 obedience to God in a most difficult command, and so shame the 
 disobedience of his people to the most easy and reasonable precepts. 
 When we are in the way of our duty we may trust God both with our 
 credit and with our safety. The hearts of that people were strangely
 stupid, and would not be affected with what they only heard, but must 
 be taught by signs, and therefore Isaiah must do this for their 
 edification. If the dress was scandalous, yet the design was glorious, 
 and what a prophet of the Lord needed not to be ashamed of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The exposition of this sign, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+20:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 It was intended to signify that the Egyptians and the Ethiopians should
 be led away captive by the king of Assyria, thus stripped, or in rags, 
 and very shabby clothing, as Isaiah was. God calls him his <I>servant 
 Isaiah,</I> because in this matter particularly he had approved himself 
 God's willing, faithful, obedient servant; and for this very thing, 
 which perhaps others laughed at him for, God gloried in him. To obey is 
 better than sacrifice; it pleases God and praises him more, and shall 
 be more praised by him. Isaiah is said to have <I>walked naked and
 barefoot three years,</I> whenever in that time he appeared as a 
 prophet. But some refer the three years, not to the sign, but to the 
 thing signified: <I>He has walked naked and barefoot;</I> there is a 
 stop in the original; provided he did so once that was enough to give 
 occasion to all about him to enquire what was the meaning of his doing 
 so; or, as some think, he did it three days, a day for a year; and this 
 for a three years' sign and wonder, for a sign of that which should be 
 done three years afterwards or which should be three years in the 
 doing. Three campaigns successively shall the Assyrian army make, in 
 spoiling the Egyptians and Ethiopians, and carrying them away captive 
 in this barbarous manner, not only the soldiers taken in the field of 
 battle, but the inhabitants, young and old; and it being a very piteous 
 sight, and such as must needs move compassion in those that had the 
 least degree of tenderness left them to see those who had gone all 
 their days well dressed now stripped, and scarcely having rags to cover 
 their nakedness, that circumstance of their captivity is particularly 
 taken notice of, and foretold, the more to affect those to whom this 
 prophecy was delivered. It is particularly said to be <I>to the shame 
 of Egypt</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+20:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 because the Egyptians were a proud people, and therefore when they did
 fall into disgrace it was the more shameful to them; and the higher 
 they had lifted up themselves the lower was their fall, both in their 
 own eyes and in the eyes of others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The use and application of this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+20:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 1. All that had any dependence upon, or correspondence with, Egypt and
 Ethiopia, should now be ashamed of them, and afraid of having any thing 
 to do with them. Those countries that were in danger of being overrun
 by the Assyrians expected that Tirhakah, king of Ethiopia, with his 
 numerous forces, would put a stop to the progress of their victorious 
 arms, and be a barrier to his neighbours; and with yet more assurance 
 they gloried that Egypt, a kingdom so famous for policy and prowess, 
 would do their business, would oblige them to raise the siege of Ashdod 
 and retire with precipitation. But, instead of this, by attempting to 
 oppose the king of Assyria they did but expose themselves and make 
 their country a prey to him. Hereupon all about them were ashamed that 
 ever they promised themselves any advantage from two such weak and 
 cowardly nations, and were more afraid now than ever they were of the 
 growing greatness of the king of Assyria, before whom Egypt and 
 Ethiopia proved but as briers and thorns put to stop a consuming fire, 
 which do but make it burn the more strongly. Note, Those who make any 
 creature their expectation and glory, and so put it in the place of 
 God, will sooner or later be ashamed of it, and their disappointment in 
 it will but increase their fear. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:6,7">Ezek. xxix. 6, 7</A>.

 2. The Jews in particular should be convinced of their folly in resting
 upon such broken reeds, and should despair of any relief from them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+20:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>The inhabitants of this isle</I> (the land of Judah, situated upon
 the sea, though not surrounded by it), of this country (so the margin); 
 every one shall now have his eyes opened, and shall say, "<I>Behold, 
 such is our expectation,</I> so vain, so foolish, and this is that 
 which it will come to. We have fled for help to the Egyptians and 
 Ethiopians, and have hoped by them to be delivered from the king of 
 Assyria; but, now that they are broken thus, how shall we escape, that 
 are not able to bring such armies into the field as they did?" Note,

 (1.) Those that confide in creatures will be disappointed, and will be
 made ashamed of their confidence; <I>for vain is the help of man, and 
 in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills or the height and 
 multitude of the mountains.</I>

 (2.) Disappointment in creature confidences, instead of driving us to
 despair, as here (<I>how shall we escape?</I>), should drive us to God; 
 for, if we flee to him for help, our expectation shall not be 
 frustrated.</P>
