 As the prophet Isaiah, after he had largely foretold the deliverance of 
 Jerusalem out of the hands of the king of Assyria, gave a particular 
 narrative of the story, that it might appear how exactly the event 
 answered to the prediction, so the prophet Jeremiah, after he had 
 largely foretold the delivering of Jerusalem into the hands of the king 
 of Babylon, gives a particular account of that sad event for the same 
 reason. That melancholy story we have in this chapter, which serves to 
 disprove the false flattering prophets and to confirm the word of God's 
 messengers. We are here told, 

 I. That Jerusalem, after eighteen months' siege, was taken by the
 Chaldean army, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+39:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. That king Zedekiah, attempting to make his escape, was seized and
 made a miserable captive to the king of Babylon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+39:4-7">ver. 4-7</A>.

 III. That Jerusalem was burnt to the ground, and the people were
 carried captive, except the poor, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+39:8-10">ver. 8-10</A>.

 IV. That the Chaldeans were very kind to Jeremiah, and took particular 
 care of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+39:11-14">ver. 11-14</A>.

 V. That Ebed-melech too, for his kindness, had a protection from God 
 himself in this day of desolation,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth
 month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army
 against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.
 &nbsp; 2  <I>And</I> in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month,
 the ninth <I>day</I> of the month, the city was broken up.
 &nbsp; 3  And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat
 in the middle gate, <I>even</I> Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim,
 Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, with all the residue of the
 princes of the king of Babylon.
 &nbsp; 4  And it came to pass, <I>that</I> when Zedekiah the king of Judah
 saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth
 out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the
 gate betwixt the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain.
 &nbsp; 5  But the Chaldeans' army pursued after them, and overtook
 Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him,
 they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah
 in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him.
 &nbsp; 6  Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah
 before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of
 Judah.
 &nbsp; 7  Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him with
 chains, to carry him to Babylon.
 &nbsp; 8  And the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of
 the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 9  Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away
 captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in
 the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the
 rest of the people that remained.
 &nbsp; 10  But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of
 the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave
 them vineyards and fields at the same time.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We were told, in the close of the foregoing chapter, that <I>Jeremiah 
 abode patiently in the court of the prison, until the day that 
 Jerusalem was taken.</I> He gave the princes no further disturbance by 
 his prophesying, nor they him by their persecutions; for he had no more 
 to say than what he had said, and, the siege being carried on briskly, 
 God found them other work to do. See here what it came to.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The city is at length taken by storm; for how could it hold out when 
 God himself fought against it? Nebuchadnezzar's army sat down before it 
 in the <I>ninth</I> year of Zedekiah, <I>in the tenth month</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+39:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),
 
 in the depth of winter.  Nebuchadnezzar himself soon after retired to 
 take his pleasure, and left his generals to carry on the siege: they 
 intermitted it awhile, but soon renewed it with redoubled force and 
 vigour. At length, <I>in the eleventh year, in the fourth month,</I> 
 about midsummer, they entered the city, the soldiers being so weakened 
 by famine, and all their provisions being now spent, that they were not 
 able to make any resistance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+39:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Jerusalem was so strong a place that nobody would have believed the 
 enemy could ever enter its gates, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:12">Lam.  iv. 12</A>.

 But sin had provoked God to withdraw his protection, and then, like
 Samson when his hair was cut, it was weak as other cities.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The princes of the king of Babylon take possession of the <I>middle 
 gate,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+39:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Some think that this was the same with that which is called the 
 <I>second gate</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:10">Zeph. i. 10</A>),

 which is supposed to be in the middle wall that divided between one
 part of the city and the other. Here they cautiously made a half, and 
 durst not go forward into so large a city, among men that perhaps would 
 sell their lives as dearly as they could, until they had given 
 directions for the searching of all places, that they might not be 
 surprised by any ambush. They sat in the <I>middle gate,</I> thence to 
 take a view of the city and give orders. The princes are here named, 
 rough and uncouth names they are, to intimate what a sad change sin had 
 made; there, where <I>Eliakim</I> and <I>Hilkiah,</I> who bore the name 
 of the God of Israel, used to sit, now sit <I>Nergal-sharezer,</I> and 
 <I>Samgar-nebo,</I> &c., who bore the names of the heathen gods. 
 <I>Rab-saris</I> and <I>Rab-mag</I> are supposed to be not the names of 
 distinct persons, but the titles of those whose names go before. 
 <I>Sarsechim</I> was <I>Rab-saris,</I> that is, <I>captain of the 
 guard;</I> and <I>Nergal-sharezer,</I> to distinguish him from the 
 other of the same name that is put first, is called 
 <I>Ram-mag--camp-master,</I> either muster-master or quarter-master: 
 these and the other great generals sat in the gate. And now was 
 fulfilled what Jeremiah prophesied long since

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:15"><I>ch.</I> i. 15</A>),

 that the families of the kingdoms of the north should set every one his
 throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem. Justly do the princes 
 of the heathen set up themselves there, where the gods of the heathen 
 had been so often set up.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Zedekiah, having in disguise perhaps seen the princes of the king 
 of Babylon take possession of one of the gates of the city, thought it 
 high time to shift for his own safety, and, loaded with guilt and fear, 
 he <I>went out of the city,</I> under no other protection but that of 
 <I>the night</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+39:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 which soon failed him, for he was discovered, pursued, and overtaken. 
 Though he made the best of his way, he could make nothing of it, could 
 not get forward, but <I>in the plains of Jericho</I> fell into the 
 hands of the pursuers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+39:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Thence he was brought prisoner to Riblah, where the king of Babylon 
 passed sentence upon him as a rebel, not sentence of death, but, one 
 many almost say, a worse thing. For, 

 1. He <I>slew his sons before his eyes,</I> and they must all be
 little, some of them infants, for Zedekiah himself was now but 
 thirty-two years of age. The death of these sweet babes must needs be 
 so many deaths to himself, especially when he considered that his own 
 obstinacy was the cause of it, for he was particularly told of this 
 thing: <I>They shall bring forth thy wives and children to the 
 Chaldeans,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:23"><I>ch.</I> xxxviii. 23</A>.

 2. He <I>slew all the nobles of Judah</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+39:6"><I>v.</I>  6</A>),

 probably not those princes of Jerusalem who had advised him to this 
 desperate course (it would be a satisfaction to him to see them cut 
 off), but the great men of the country, who were innocent of the 
 matter. 
 
 3. He ordered <I>Zedekiah to have his eyes put out</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+39:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),
 
 so condemning <I>him</I> to darkness for life who had shut his eyes 
 against the clear light of God's word, and was of those princes who 
 <I>will not understand,</I> but <I>walk on in darkness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:5">Ps. lxxxii. 5</A>.

 4. He <I>bound him with two brazen chains or fetters</I> (so the margin
 reads it), to carry him away to Babylon, there to spend the rest of his 
 days in misery. All this sad story we had before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+25:4">2 Kings xxv. 4</A>,

 &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Some time afterwards the city was burnt, temple and palace and all, 
 and the wall of it broken down, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+39:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 "<I>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem!</I> this comes of <I>killing the 
 prophets,</I> and <I>stoning those that were sent to thee. O Zedekiah, 
 Zedekiah!</I> this thou mightest have prevented if thou wouldst but 
 have taken God's counsel, and yielded in time."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The people that were left were all <I>carried away captives to 
 Babylon,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+39:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Now they must bid a final farewell to the land of their nativity, that 
 pleasant land, and to all their possessions and enjoyments in it, must 
 be driven some hundreds of miles, like beasts, before the conquerors, 
 that were now their cruel masters, must lie at their mercy in a strange 
 land, and be servants to those who would be sure to rule them with 
 rigour. The word <I>tyrant</I> is originally a Chaldee word, and is 
 often used for <I>lords</I> by the Chaldee paraphrast, as if the 
 Chaldeans, when they were lords, tyrannized more than any other: we 
 have reason to think that the poor Jews had reason to say so. Some few 
 were left behind, but they were <I>the poor of the people,</I> that had 
 nothing to lose, and therefore never made any resistance. And they not 
 only had their liberty, and were left to tarry at home, but the 
 <I>captain of the guard gave them vineyards and fields at the same 
 time,</I> such as they were never masters of before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+39:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Observe here, 

 1. The wonderful changes of Providence. Some are abased, others 
 advanced, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:5">1 Sam. ii. 5</A>.

 The <I>hungry are filled with good things, and the rich sent empty
 away.</I> The ruin of some proves the rise of others.  Let us therefore 
 in our abundance <I>rejoice as though we rejoiced not,</I> and in our 
 distresses <I>weep as though we wept not.</I>

 2.  The just retributions or Providence. The rich had been proud
 oppressors, and now they were justly punished for their injustice; the 
 poor had been patient sufferers, and now they were graciously rewarded 
 for their patience and amends made them for all their losses; for 
 <I>verily there is a God that judges in the earth,</I> even in this 
 world, much more in the other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning
 Jeremiah to Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard, saying,
 &nbsp; 12  Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do
 unto him even as he shall say unto thee.
 &nbsp; 13  So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard sent, and
 Nebushasban, Rab-saris, and Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, and all the
 king of Babylon's princes;
 &nbsp; 14  Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the
 prison, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son
 of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the
 people.
 &nbsp; 15  Now the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto Jeremiah, while he was
 shut up in the court of the prison, saying,
 &nbsp; 16  Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my
 words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall
 be <I>accomplished</I> in that day before thee.
 &nbsp; 17  But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and
 thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou
 <I>art</I> afraid.
 &nbsp; 18  For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by
 the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee: because
 thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we must sing of mercy, as in the former part of the chapter we 
 sang of judgment, and must sing unto God of both. We may observe 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A gracious providence concerning Jeremiah. When Jerusalem was laid 
 in ruins, and all <I>men's hearts failed them for fear,</I> then might 
 he <I>lift up his head</I> with comfort, <I>knowing that his redemption 
 drew nigh,</I> as Christ's followers when the second destruction of 
 Jerusalem was hastening on, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:28">Luke xxi. 28</A>.

 Nebuchadnezzar had given particular orders that care should be taken of
 him, and that he should be in all respects well used,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+39:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 Hebuzar-adan and the rest of the king of Babylon's princes observed 
 these orders, discharged him out of prison, and did every thing to make 
 him easy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+39:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 Now we may look upon this, 

 1. As a very generous act of Nebuchadnezzar, who, though he was a
 haughty potentate, yet took cognizance of this poor prophet. Doubtless 
 he had received information concerning him from the deserters, that he 
 had foretold the king of Babylon's successes against Judah and other 
 countries, that he had pressed his prince and people to submit to him, 
 and that he had suffered very hard things for so doing; and in 
 consideration of all this (though perhaps he might have heard also that 
 he had foretold the destruction of Babylon at length) he gave him these 
 extraordinary marks of his favour. Note, It is the character of a great 
 soul to take notice of the services and sufferings of the meanest. It 
 was honourably done of the king to give this charge even before the 
 city was taken, and of the captains to observe it even in the heat of 
 action, and it is recorded for imitation. 

 2.  As a reproach to Zedekiah and the princes of Israel.  They put him
 in prison, and the king of Babylon and his princes took him out. God's 
 people and ministers have often found fairer and kinder usage among 
 strangers and infidels than among those that call themselves of the 
 holy city. Paul found more favour and justice with king Agrippa than 
 with Ananias the high priest.  

 3. As the performance of God's promise to Jeremiah, in recompence for
 his services. <I>I will cause the enemy to treat thee well in the day 
 of evil,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:11"><I>ch.</I> xv. 11</A>.

 Jeremiah had been faithful to his trust as a prophet, and now God
 approves himself faithful to him and the promise he had made him. Now 
 he is comforted according to the time wherein he had been afflicted, 
 and sees thousands fall on each hand and himself safe. The false 
 prophets fell by those judgments which they said should never come 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:15"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 15</A>),

 which made their misery the more terrible to them. The true prophet
 escaped those judgments which he said would come, and that made his 
 escape the more comfortable to him. The same that were the instruments 
 of punishing the persecutors were the instruments of relieving the 
 persecuted; and Jeremiah thought never the worse of his deliverance for 
 its coming by the hand of the king of Babylon, but saw the more of the 
 hand of God in it. A fuller account of this matter we shall meet with 
 in the next chapter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A gracious message to Ebed-melech, to assure him of a recompence 
 for his kindness to Jeremiah. This message was sent to him by Jeremiah 
 himself, who, when he returned him thanks for his kindness to him, thus 
 turned him over to God to be his paymaster. He relieved <I>a prophet in 
 the name of a prophet,</I> and thus he had <I>a prophet's reward.</I> 
 This message was delivered to him immediately after he had done that 
 kindness to Jeremiah, but it is mentioned here after the taking of the 
 city, to show that, as God was kind to Jeremiah at that time, so he was 
 to Ebed-melech for his sake; and it was a token of special favour to 
 both, and they ought so to account it, that they were not involved in 
 any of the common calamities. Jeremiah is directed to tell him, 

 1. That God would certainly bring upon Jerusalem the ruin that had been
 long and often threatened; and, for his further satisfaction in having 
 been kind to Jeremiah, he should see him abundantly proved a true 
 prophet,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+39:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 2. That God took notice of the fear he had of the judgments coming. 
 Though he was bravely bold in the service of God, yet he was afraid of 
 the rod of God. The enemies were <I>men of whom he was afraid,</I> 
 Note, God knows how to adapt and accommodate his comforts to the fears 
 and griefs of his people, for he <I>knows their souls in adversity.</I> 
 
 3. That he shall be delivered from having a share in the common
 calamity: <I>I will deliver thee; I will surely deliver thee.</I> He 
 had been instrumental to deliver God's prophet out of the dungeon, and 
 now God promises to deliver him; for he will be behind-hand with none 
 for any service they do, directly or indirectly, for his name: "Thou 
 has saved Jeremiah's life, that was precious to thee, and therefore 
 <I>thy life shall be given thee for a prey.</I>" 

 4.  The reason given for this distinguishing favour which God had in
 store for him is <I>because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the 
 Lord.</I> God, in recompensing men's services, has an eye to the 
 principle they go upon in those services, and rewards according to 
 those principles; and there is no principle of obedience that will be 
 more acceptable to God, nor have a greater influence upon us, than a 
 believing confidence in God.  Ebed-melech trusted in God that he would 
 own him, and stand by him, and then he was not afraid of the face of 
 man. And those who trust God, as this good man did, in the way of duty, 
 will find that their hope shall not make them ashamed in times of the 
 greatest danger.</P>
