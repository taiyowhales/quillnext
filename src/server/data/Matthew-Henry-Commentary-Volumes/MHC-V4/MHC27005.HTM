 The destruction of the kingdom of Babylon had been long and often 
 foretold when it was at a distance; in this chapter we have it 
 accomplished, and a prediction of it the very same night that it was 
 accomplished. Belshazzar now reigned in Babylon; some compute he had 
 reigned seventeen years, others but three; we have here the story of 
 his exit and the period of his kingdom. We must know that about two 
 years before this Cyrus king of Persia, a growing monarch, came against 
 Babylon with a great army; Belshazzar met him, fought him, and was 
 routed by him in a pitched battle. He and his scattered forces retired 
 into the city, where Cyrus besieged them. They were very secure, 
 because the river Euphrates was their bulwark, and they had twenty 
 years; provision in the city; but in the second year of the siege he 
 took it, as is here related. We have in this chapter, 

 I. The riotous, idolatrous, sacrilegious feast which Belshazzar made,
 in which he filled up the measure of his iniquity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. The alarm given him in the midst of his jollity by a hand-writing
 on the wall, which none of his wise men could read or tell him the 
 meaning of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:5-9">ver. 5-9</A>.

 III. The interpretation of the mystical characters by Daniel, who was
 at length brought in to him, and dealt plainly with him, and showed him 
 his doom written, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:10-28">ver. 10-28</A>.

 IV. The immediate accomplishment of the interpretation in the slaying 
 of the king and seizing of the kingdom,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his
 lords, and drank wine before the thousand.
 &nbsp; 2  Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the
 golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had
 taken out of the temple which <I>was</I> in Jerusalem; that the king,
 and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink
 therein.
 &nbsp; 3  Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of
 the temple of the house of God which <I>was</I> at Jerusalem; and the
 king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in
 them.
 &nbsp; 4  They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver,
 of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.
 &nbsp; 5  In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and
 wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall
 of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that
 wrote.
 &nbsp; 6  Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts
 troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and
 his knees smote one against another.
 &nbsp; 7  The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the
 Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. <I>And</I> the king spake, and said to
 the wise <I>men</I> of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and
 show me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with
 scarlet, and <I>have</I> a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be
 the third ruler in the kingdom.
 &nbsp; 8  Then came in all the king's wise <I>men:</I> but they could not
 read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation
 thereof.
 &nbsp; 9  Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his
 countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonied.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Belshazzar the king very gay, but all of a sudden very 
 gloomy, and in straits in the fulness of his sufficiency. See how he 
 affronts God, and God affrights him; and wait what will be the issue of 
 this contest; and whether he that hardened his heart against God 
 prospered.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. See how the king affronted God, and put contempt upon him. He 
 <I>made a great feast,</I> or <I>banquet of wine;</I> probably it was 
 some anniversary solemnity, in honour off his birth-day or 
 coronation-day, or in honour of some of their idols. Historians say
 that Cyrus, who was now with his army besieging Babylon, knew of this 
 feast, and presuming that they then would be off their guard, <I>somno 
 vinoque sepulti--buried in sleep and wine,</I> took that opportunity to
 attack the city, and so with the more ease made himself master of it. 
 Belshazzar upon this occasion invited <I>a thousand of his lords</I> to 
 come and drink with him. Perhaps they were such as had signalized 
 themselves in defense of the city against the besiegers; or these were 
 his great council of war, with whom, when they had well drunk, he would 
 advise what was further to be done. And they were to look upon it as a 
 great favour that he <I>drank wine before</I> them, for it was the 
 pride of those eastern kings to be seldom seen. He drank wine before 
 them, for he made this feast, as Ahasuerus did, to show the <I>honour 
 of his majesty.</I> Now in this sumptuous feast, 

 1. He put an affront upon the providence of God and bade defiance to 
 his judgments. His city was now besieged; a powerful enemy was at his 
 gates; his life and kingdom lay at stake. In all this the hand of the 
 Lord had gone out against him, and by it he called him to <I>weeping, 
 and mourning, and girding with sackcloth.</I> God's voice cried in the 
 city, as Jonah to Nineveh, <I>Yet forty days,</I> or fewer, <I>and 
 Babylon shall be destroyed.</I> He should therefore, like the king of 
 Nineveh, have proclaimed a fast; but, as one resolved to walk contrary 
 to God, he proclaims a feast, and behold <I>joy and gladness, slaying 
 oxen, killing sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine,</I> as if he 
 dared the Almighty to do his worst, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:12,13">Isa. xxii. 12, 13</A>.

 To show how little fear he had of being forced to surrender, for want
 of provisions, he spent thus extravagantly. Note, Security and 
 sensuality are sad presages of approaching ruin. Those that will not be 
 warned by judgments of God may expect to be wounded by them.

 2. He put an affront upon the temple of God, and bade defiance to his 
 sanctuary,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 <I>While he tasted the wine, he commanded to bring the vessels of</I> 
 the temple, that they might drink in them. When he tasted how rich and 
 fine the wine was, "O," said he, "it is a pity but we should have holy 
 vessels to drink such delicious wine as this in," which was looked upon 
 as a piece of wit, and, to carry on the humour, the vessels of the 
 temple were immediately sent for. Nay, there seems to have been 
 something more in it than a frolic, and that it was done in a malicious 
 despite to the God of Israel. The heart of his people was very much 
 upon these sacred vessels, as appears from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:16,18">Jer. xxvii. 16, 18</A>.

 Their principal care, at their return, was about these,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:7">Ezra i. 7</A>.

 Now, we may suppose, they had an expectation of their deliverance
 approaching, reckoning the seventy years of their captivity near a 
 period; and some of them might perhaps have given out some words to 
 that purport, that shortly they should have the vessels of the 
 sanctuary restored to them, in defiance of which Belshazzar here 
 proclaims them to be his own, will keep them in store no longer, but 
 will make use of them among his own plate. Note, That mirth is sinful 
 indeed, and fills the measure of men's iniquity apace, which profanes 
 sacred things and jests with them. This ripened Babylon for ruin--that
 no songs would serve them but the <I>songs of Zion</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:3">Ps. cxxxvii. 3</A>),

 no vessels but the vessels of the sanctuary. Let those who thus
 sacrilegiously alienate what is dedicated to God and his honour know 
 that he <I>will not be mocked.</I> 

 3. He put an affront upon God himself, and bade defiance to his deity;
 for <I>they drank wine, and praised the gods of gold and silver,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 They gave that glory to images, the work of their own hands and 
 creatures of their own fancy, which is due to the true and living God 
 only. They praised them either with sacrifices offered to them or with 
 songs sung in honour of them. When their heads were giddy, and their 
 hearts merry, with wine, they were in the fittest frame to <I>praise 
 the gods of gold and silver, wood and stone;</I> for one would think 
 that men in their senses, who had the command of a clear and sober 
 thought, could not be guilty of so gross an absurdity; they must be 
 intoxicated ere they could be so infatuated. Drunken worshippers, who 
 are not men, but beasts, are the most proper for the service of 
 dunghill deities, that are not gods, but devils. <I>They have erred 
 through wine,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:7">Isa. xxvii. 7</A>.

 They drank wine, and praised their idol-gods, as if they had been the
 founders of their feast and the givers of all good things to them. Or,
 when they were drinking wine, they praised their gods by drinking 
 healths to them; and the king <I>drank wine before</I> them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 that is, he began the health, first to this god, and then to the other, 
 till they went through the <I>bead-roll</I> or <I>farrago</I> of them, 
 those of <I>wood and stone</I> not excepted. Note, Immorality and 
 impiety, vice and profaneness, strengthen the hands and advance the 
 interests one of another. Drunken frolics were an introduction to 
 idolatry, and then idolatrous healths were a shoeing-horn to further 
 drunkenness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. See how God affrighted the king, and struck a terror upon him. 
 Belshazzar and his lords are in the midst of their revels, the cups 
 going round apace, and all upon the merry pin, drinking confusion, it 
 may be, to Cyrus and his army, and roaring out huzzas, in confidence of 
 the speedy raising of the siege; but the hour had come when that must 
 be fulfilled which had been long ago said of the king of Babylon, when 
 his city should be besieged by the Persians and Medes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:2-4">Isa. xxi. 2-4</A>.
 
 <I>The night of my pleasures has he turned into fear to me.</I> The
 mirth of this ball at court must be spoiled, and a damp cast upon their 
 jollity, though the king himself be master of the revels; immediately, 
 when God speaks the word, we have him and all his guests in the utmost 
 confusion, and the end of their mirth is heaviness. 

 1. There appear the <I>fingers of a man's hand writing on the plaster 
 of the wall,</I> before the king's face

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 "the angel Gabriel," say the rabbin, "directing these fingers and 
 writing by them." "That divine hand" (says a rabbi of our own, Dr. 
 Lightfoot) "that had written the two tables for a law to his people now 
 writes the doom of Babel and Belshazzar upon the wall." Here was 
 nothing sent to frighten them which made a noise, or threatened their 
 lives, no claps of thunder nor flashes of lightning, no destroying 
 angel with his sword drawn in his hand, only a pen in the hand, writing 
 upon the wall, <I>over-against the candlestick,</I> where they might 
 all see it by the light of their own candle. Note, God's written word 
 is sufficient to put the proudest boldest sinners into a fright, when 
 he is pleased to give it the setting on. The king saw <I>the part of 
 the hand that wrote,</I> but saw not the person whose hand it was, 
 which made the thing more frightful. Note, What we see of God, the part 
 of the hand that writes in the book of the creatures and the book of 
 the scriptures (<I>Lo, these are parts of his ways,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+26:14">Job xxvi. 14</A>),

 may serve to possess us with awful thoughts concerning that of God
 which we do not see. If this be <I>the finger of God,</I> what is his 
 arm made bare? And what is he?

 2. The king is immediately seized with a panic fear

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>His countenance was changed</I> (his colour went and came); <I>the 
 joints of his loins were loosed,</I> so that he had no strength in 
 them, but was struck with a pain in his back, as is usual in a great 
 fright; <I>his knees smote one against another,</I> so violently did he 
 tremble like an aspen leaf. But what was the matter? Why is he in such
 a fright? He perceives not what is written, and how does he know but it 
 may be some happy presage of deliverance to him and to his kingdom? But 
 the business was <I>his thoughts troubled him;</I> his own guilty 
 conscience flew in his face, and told him that he had no reason to 
 expect any good news from Heaven, and that the hand of an angel could 
 write nothing but terror to him. He that knew himself liable to the 
 justice of God immediately concluded this to be an arrest in his name, 
 a summons to appear before him. Note, God can soon awaken the most 
 secure and make the heart of the stoutest sinner to tremble; and there 
 needs no more to do it than to let loose his own thoughts upon him; 
 they will soon play the tyrant, and give him trouble enough.

 3. The wise men of Babylon are immediately called in, to see what they
 can make of this writing upon the wall,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The king <I>cried aloud,</I> as one in haste, as one in earnest, to 
 bring the whole college of magicians, to try if they can <I>read this 
 writing,</I> and <I>show the interpretation of it;</I> for the king and 
 all his lords cannot pretend to it, it is out of their sphere. The 
 study of divine revelation (such as they had, or thought they had) and 
 converse with the world of spirits were by the heathen confined to one 
 profession, and no other meddled with it; but what is written to us by 
 the finger of God is legible to all; whoever will may read the mind of 
 God in the scriptures. To engage these wise men to exert the utmost of 
 their skill in this matter, and provoke them to an emulation in the 
 attempt, he promised that whoever would give him a satisfactory account 
 of this writing should be dignified with the highest honours of the 
 court. He knew what these pretenders to wisdom aimed at, and what would 
 please them, and therefore promised them a <I>scarlet robe</I> and a 
 <I>gold chain,</I> glorious things in the eyes of those that know no 
 better. Nay, he should be <I>primus par regni--chief minister of
 state, the third ruler</I> in the kingdom, next to the king and his 
 heir apparent.

 4. The king is disappointed in his expectations from them; they can
 none of them <I>read the writing,</I> much less interpret it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 which increases the king's confusion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 He likes the thing yet worse and worse, and fears that mischief is 
 towards him. <I>His lords</I> also, that had been partners with him in 
 his jollity, are now sharers with him in his terrors; they also were 
 <I>astonished</I> at their wits' end; and neither their numbers nor 
 their refreshment by wine would serve to keep up their spirits. The 
 reason why the wise men could not read the writing was not because it 
 was written in any language or characters unknown to them, but God 
 either cast a mist before their eyes or put such confusion upon their 
 spirits that they could not read it, that the honour of expounding this 
 mystical writing might be reserved for Daniel. Note, The terror of an 
 awakened convinced conscience may justly be increased by the utter 
 insufficiency of all creatures to give it ease or satisfaction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  <I>Now</I> the queen, by reason of the words of the king and his
 lords, came into the banquet house: <I>and</I> the queen spake and
 said, O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee,
 nor let thy countenance be changed:
 &nbsp; 11  There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom <I>is</I> the spirit of
 the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and
 understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found
 in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, <I>I
 say,</I> thy father, made master of the magicians, astrologers,
 Chaldeans, <I>and</I> soothsayers;
 &nbsp; 12  Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and
 understanding, interpreting of dreams, and showing of hard
 sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same
 Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be
 called, and he will show the interpretation.
 &nbsp; 13  Then was Daniel brought in before the king. <I>And</I> the king
 spake and said unto Daniel, <I>Art</I> thou that Daniel, which <I>art</I>
 of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my
 father brought out of Jewry?
 &nbsp; 14  I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods <I>is</I>
 in thee, and <I>that</I> light and understanding and excellent wisdom
 is found in thee.
 &nbsp; 15  And now the wise <I>men,</I> the astrologers, have been brought
 in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known
 unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not show the
 interpretation of the thing:
 &nbsp; 16  And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make
 interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the
 writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou
 shalt be clothed with scarlet, and <I>have</I> a chain of gold about
 thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.
 &nbsp; 17  Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts
 be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read
 the writing unto the king, and make known to him the
 interpretation.
 &nbsp; 18  O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy
 father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour:
 &nbsp; 19  And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations,
 and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he
 slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set
 up; and whom he would he put down.
 &nbsp; 20  But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in
 pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his
 glory from him:
 &nbsp; 21  And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was
 made like the beasts, and his dwelling <I>was</I> with the wild asses:
 they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the
 dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the
 kingdom of men, and <I>that</I> he appointeth over it whomsoever he
 will.
 &nbsp; 22  And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine
 heart, though thou knewest all this;
 &nbsp; 23  But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and
 they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou,
 and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in
 them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of
 brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know:
 and the God in whose hand thy breath <I>is,</I> and whose <I>are</I> all
 thy ways, hast thou not glorified:
 &nbsp; 24  Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this
 writing was written.
 &nbsp; 25  And this <I>is</I> the writing that was written, MENE, MENE,
 TEKEL, UPHARSIN.
 &nbsp; 26  This <I>is</I> the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath
 numbered thy kingdom, and finished it.
 &nbsp; 27  TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found
 wanting.
 &nbsp; 28  PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and
 Persians.
 &nbsp; 29  Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with
 scarlet, and <I>put</I> a chain of gold about his neck, and made a
 proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in
 the kingdom.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The information given to the king, by the queen-mother, concerning 
 Daniel, how fit he was to be consulted in this difficult case. It is
 supposed that this queen was the widow of Evil-Merodach, and was that 
 famous Nitocris whom Herodotus mentions as a woman of extraordinary 
 prudence. She was not present at the feast, as the king's <I>wives and 
 concubines were</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 it was not agreeable to her age and gravity to keep a merry night. But, 
 tidings of the fright which the king and his lords were put into being 
 brought to her apartment, she came herself to the banqueting-house, to 
 recommend to the king a physician for his melancholy. She entreated him 
 not to be discouraged by the insufficiency of his wise men to solve 
 this riddle, for that there was <I>a man in his kingdom</I> that had 
 more than once helped his grandfather at such a dead lift, and, no 
 doubt, could help him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 She could not undertake to read the writing herself, but directed him 
 to one that could; let <I>Daniel be called</I> now, who should have 
 been called first. Now observe, 

 1. The high character she gives of Daniel: He is a <I>man in whom is 
 the spirit of the holy gods,</I> who has something in him more than 
 human, not only the <I>spirit of a man,</I> which, in all, is the 
 <I>candle of the Lord,</I> but a divine spirit. According to the 
 language of her country and religion, she could not give a higher 
 encomium of any man; she speaks honourably of him as a man that had,

 (1.) An admirably good head: <I>Light, and understanding, and wisdom,
 like the wisdom of the gods, were found in him.</I> Such an insight had 
 he into things secret, and such a foresight of things to come, that it 
 was evident he was divinely inspired; he had <I>knowledge</I> and 
 <I>understanding</I> beyond all the other wise men for <I>interpreting 
 dreams,</I> explaining enigmas or hard sentences, untying knots, and 
 resolving doubts. Solomon had a wonderful sagacity of this kind; but it 
 should seem that in these things Daniel had more of an immediate divine 
 direction. <I>Behold, a greater than Solomon</I> himself <I>is 
 here.</I> Yet what was the wisdom of them both compared with the 
 treasures of wisdom hidden in Christ?

 (2.) He had an admirably good heart: <I>An excellent spirit was found
 in him,</I> which was a great ornament to his wisdom and knowledge, and 
 qualified him to receive that gift; for God <I>gives to a man that is 
 good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy.</I> He was of a 
 humble, holy, heavenly spirit, had a devout and gracious spirit, a 
 spirit of zeal for the glory of God and the good of men. This was 
 indeed an excellent spirit. 

 2. The account she gives of the respect that Nebuchadnezzar had for
 him; he was much in his favour, and was preferred by him: "<I>The king 
 thy father" </I> (that is, thy grandfather, but even to many 
 generations Nebuchadnezzar might well be called the father of that 
 royal family, for he it was that raised it to such a pitch of 
 grandeur), "<I>the king,</I> I say, <I>thy father, made him master of 
 the magicians.</I>" Perhaps Belshazzar had sometimes, in his pride, 
 spoken slightly of Nebuchadnezzar, and his politics, and the methods of 
 his government, and the ministers he employed, and thought himself 
 wiser than he; and therefore his mother harps upon that. "<I>The
 king,</I> I say, <I>thy father,</I> to whose good management all thou 
 hast owing, he pronounced him chief of, and gave him dominion over, all 
 the wise men of Babylon, and <I>named him Belteshazzar,</I> according 
 to the name of his god, thinking thereby to put honour upon him;" but 
 Daniel, by constantly making use of his Jewish name himself (which he 
 resolved to keep, in token of his faithful adherence to his religion), 
 had worn out that name; only the queen-dowager remembered it, otherwise 
 he was generally called <I>Daniel.</I> Note, It is a very good office 
 to revive the remembrance of the good services of worthy men, who are 
 themselves modest, and willing that they should be forgotten. 

 3. The motion she makes concerning him: <I>Let Daniel be called, and he
 will show the interpretation.</I> By this it appears that Daniel was 
 now forgotten at court. Belshazzar was a stranger to him, knew not that 
 he had such a jewel in his kingdom. With the new king there came in a 
 new ministry, and the old one was laid aside. Note, There are a great
 many valuable men, and such as might be made very useful, that lie long 
 buried in obscurity, and some that have done eminent services that live 
 to be overlooked and taken no notice of; but, whatever men are, God is 
 not unrighteous to forget the services done to his kingdom. Daniel, 
 being turned out of his place, lived privately, and sought not any 
 opportunity to come into notice again; yet he lived near the court and 
 within call, though Babylon was now besieged, that he might be ready, 
 if there were occasion, to do any good office, by what interest he had 
 among the great ones, for the children of his people. But Providence so 
 ordered it that now, just at the fall of that monarchy, he should by 
 the queen's means be brought to court again, that he might lie there 
 ready for preferment in the ensuing government. Thus do <I>the 
 righteous shine forth out of obscurity,</I> and <I>before honour is 
 humility.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The introducing of Daniel to the king, and his request to him to 
 read and expound the writing. Daniel was <I>brought in before the 
 king,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 He was now nearly ninety years of age, so that his years, and honours, 
 and former preferments, might have entitled him to a free admission 
 into the king's presence; yet he was willing to be conducted in, as a 
 stranger, by the master of the ceremonies. Note, 

 1. The king asks, with an air of haughtiness: <I>Art thou that Daniel
 who art of the children of the captivity?</I> Being a Jew, and a 
 captive, he was loth to be beholden to him if he could help it. 

 2. He tells him what an encomium he had heard of him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 <I>that the spirit of the gods was in him;</I> and he had sent for him 
 to try whether he deserved so high a character or no. 

 3. He acknowledges that all the wise men of Babylon were baffled; they
 could not <I>read this writing,</I> nor <I>show the interpretation,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 But, 

 4. He promises him the same rewards that he had promised them if he 
 would do it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 It was strange that the magicians, when now, and in Nebuchadnezzar's 
 time, once and again, they were nonplussed, did not attempt something 
 to save their credit; if they had with a good assurance said, "This is 
 the meaning of such a dream, such a writing," who could disprove them? 
 But God so ordered it that they had nothing at all to say, as, when 
 Christ was born, the heathen oracles were struck dumb.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The interpretation which Daniel gave of these mystic characters, 
 which was so far from easing the king of his fears that we may suppose 
 it increased them rather. Daniel was now in years, and Belshazzar was 
 young; and therefore he seems to take a greater liberty of dealing 
 plainly and roundly with him than he had done upon the like occasions 
 with Nebuchadnezzar. In reproving any man, especially great men, there 
 is need of wisdom to consider all circumstances; for they are <I>the 
 reproofs of instruction</I> that are <I>the way of life.</I> In 
 Daniel's discourse here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He undertakes to read the writing which gave them this alarm, and to 
 show them the interpretation of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 He slights the offer he made him of rewards, is not pleased that it was 
 mentioned, for he is not one of those that <I>divine for money;</I> 
 what gratuities Nebuchadnezzar gave him afterwards he gladly accepted, 
 but he scorned to bargain for them, or to read the <I>writing to the 
 king</I> for and in consideration of such and such honours promised 
 him. No: "<I>Let thy gifts be to thyself,</I> for they will not be long 
 thine, and <I>give thy fee to another,</I> to any of the wise men whom 
 thou wouldst have most wished to earn it; I value it not." Daniel sees 
 his kingdom now at its last gasp, and therefore looks with contempt 
 upon his gifts and rewards. And thus should we despise all the gifts 
 and rewards that this world can give did we see, as we may by faith, 
 its final period hastening on. Let it give its perishing gifts to 
 another; there are better gifts which we have our eyes and hearts upon; 
 but let us do our duty in the world, do it all the real service we can, 
 read God's writing to it in a profession of religion, and by an 
 agreeable conversation make known the interpretation of it, and then 
 trust God for his gifts, his rewards, in comparison with which all the 
 world can give is mere trash and trifles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He largely recounts to the king God's dealings with his father 
 Nebuchadnezzar, which were intended for instruction and warning to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:18,21"><I>v.</I> 18, 21</A>.

 This is not intended for a flourish or an amusement, but is a necessary 
 preliminary to the interpretation of the writing. Note, That we may 
 understand aright what God is doing with us, it is of use to us to 
 review what he has done with others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He describes the great dignity and power to which the divine 
 Providence had advanced Nebuchadnezzar, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 He had <I>a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour,</I> for aught 
 we know, above what any heathen prince ever had before him; he thought 
 that he got his glory by his own extraordinary conduct and courage, and 
 ascribed his successes to a projecting active genius of his own; but 
 Daniel tells him who now enjoyed what he had laboured for that it was 
 the <I>most high God, the God of gods and Lord of kings</I> (as 
 Nebuchadnezzar himself had called him), that gave him <I>that 
 kingdom,</I> that vast dominion, that majesty wherewith he presided in 
 the affairs of it, and that <I>glory and honour</I> which by his 
 prosperous management he acquired. Note, Whatever degree of outward 
 prosperity any arrive at, they must own that it is of God's giving, not 
 their own getting. Let it never be said, <I>My might,</I> and <I>the 
 power of my hand, have gotten me this wealth,</I> this preferment; but 
 let it always be remembered that it is <I>God that gives men power to 
 get wealth,</I> and gives success to their endeavours. Now the power 
 which God gave to Nebuchadnezzar is here described to be very great in 
 respect both of ability and of authority. 

 [1.] His ability was so strong that it was irresistible; such was the 
 majesty that God gave him, so numerous were the forces he had at 
 command, and such an admirable dexterity he had at commanding them, 
 that, which way soever his sword turned, it prospered. He could
 captivate and subdue nations by threatening them, without striking a 
 stroke, for <I>all people trembled and feared before him,</I> and would 
 compound with him for their lives upon any terms. See what force is,
 and what the fear of it does. It is that by which the brutal part of 
 the world, even of the world of mankind, both governs and is governed. 
 
 [2.] His authority was so absolute that it was uncontrollable. The
 power which was allowed him, which descended upon him, or which, at 
 least, he assumed, was without contradiction, was absolute and 
 despotic, none shared with him either in the legislative or in the 
 executive part of it. In dispensing punishments he condemned or 
 acquitted at pleasure: <I>Whom he would he slew, and whom he would he 
 saved alive,</I> though both were equally innocent or equally guilty. 
 The <I>jus vit&aelig; et necis--the power of life and death</I> was 
 entirely in his hand. In dispensing rewards he granted or denied 
 preferment at pleasure: <I>Whom he would he set up, and whom he would 
 he put down,</I> merely for a humour, and without giving a reason so 
 much as to himself; but it is all <I>ex mero motu--of his own good 
 pleasure,</I> and <I>stat pro ratione voluntas--his will stands for a 
 reason.</I> Such was the constitution of the eastern monarchies, such 
 the manner of their kings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He sets before him the sins which Nebuchadnezzar had been guilty 
 of, whereby he had provoked God against him. 

 [1.] He behaved insultingly towards those that were under him, and grew 
 tyrannical and oppressive. The description given of his power intimates 
 his abuse of his power, and that he was directed in what he did by 
 humour and passion, not by reason and equity; so that he often 
 condemned the innocent and acquitted the guilty, both which are an 
 <I>abomination to the Lord.</I> He deposed men of merit and preferred 
 unworthy men, to the great detriment of the public, and for this he was 
 accountable to the most high God, that gave him his power. Note, It is 
 a very hard and rare thing for men to have an absolute arbitrary power, 
 and not to make an ill use of it. Camden has a distich of Giraldus, 
 wherein he speaks of it as a rare instance, concerning our king Henry 
 II of England, that never any man had so much power and did so little 
 hurt with it.</P>

 <BR>Nec potuisse magis, nec nocuisse minus--
 <BR>
 <BR>Of him I can say, exulting, that with the same power
 <BR>to do harm no one was ever more inoffensive.
 </TD></TR>
 </TABLE>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But that was not all. 

 [2.] He behaved insolently towards the God above him, and grew proud
 and haughty

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>His heart was lifted up,</I> and there his sin and ruin began; his 
 <I>mind was hardened</I> in pride, hardened against the commands of God 
 and his judgments; he was willful and obstinate, and neither the word 
 of God nor his rod made any lasting impression upon him. Note, Pride is 
 a sin that hardens the heart in all other sin and renders the means of 
 repentance and reformation ineffectual.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He reminds him of the judgments of God that were brought upon him 
 for his pride and obstinacy, how he was deprived of his reason, and so 
 <I>deposed from his kingly throne</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 <I>driven from among men,</I> to <I>dwell with the wild asses,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 He that would not govern his subjects by rules of reason had not reason 
 sufficient for the government himself. Note, Justly does God deprive 
 men of their reason when they become unreasonable and will not use it, 
 and of their power when they become oppressive and use it ill. He
 continued like a brute till <I>he knew</I> and embraced that first 
 principle of religion, <I>That the most high God rules.</I> And it is 
 rather by religion than reason that man is distinguished from, and 
 dignified above, the beasts; and it is more his honour to be a subject 
 to the supreme Creator than to be lord of the inferior creatures. Note, 
 Kings must know, or shall be made to know, that the most high God rules 
 in their kingdoms (that is an <I>imperium in imperio--an empire within 
 an empire,</I> not to be excepted against), and that he appoints over 
 them whomsoever he will. As he makes heirs, so he makes princes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. In God's name, he exhibits articles of impeachment against 
 Belshazzar. Before he reads him his doom, from the hand-writing on the 
 wall, he shows him his crime, that God may be <I>justified when he 
 speaks, and clear when he judges.</I> Now that which he lays to his 
 charge is, 

 (1.) That he had not taken warning by the judgments of God upon his
 father

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>Thou his son, O Belshazzar! hast not humbled thy heart, though thou 
 knewest all this.</I> Note, It is a great offence to God if our hearts 
 be not humbled before him to comply both with his precepts and with his 
 providences, humbled by repentance, obedience, and patience; nay, he 
 expects from the greatest of men that their hearts should be humbled 
 before him, by an acknowledgment that, great as they are, to him they 
 are accountable. And it is a great aggravation of the unhumbledness of 
 our hearts when we know enough to humble them but do not consider and 
 improve it, particularly when we know how others have been broken that 
 would not bend, how others have fallen that would not stoop, and yet we 
 continue stiff and inflexible. It makes the sin of children the more
 heinous if they tread in the steps of their parents' wickedness, though 
 they have seen how dearly it has cost them, and how pernicious the 
 consequences of it have been. Do we know this, do we know all this, and 
 yet are we not humbled? 

 (2.) That he had affronted God more impudently than Nebuchadnezzar
 himself had done, witness the revels of this very night, in the midst 
 of which he was seized with this horror

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):
 
 "<I>Thou hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven,</I> hast 
 swelled with rage against him, and taken up arms against his crown and 
 dignity, in this particular instance, that thou hast profaned the 
 <I>vessels of his house,</I> and made the utensils of his sanctuary 
 instruments of thy iniquity, and, in an actual designed contempt of 
 him, hast <I>praised the gods of silver and gold, which see not, nor 
 hear, nor know</I> anything, as if they were to be preferred before the 
 God that sees, and hears, and knows every thing." Sinners that are 
 resolved to go on in sin are well enough pleased with gods that 
 <I>neither see, nor hear, nor know,</I> for then they may sin securely; 
 but they will find, to their confusion, that though those are the gods 
 they choose those are not the gods they must be judged by, but one to 
 whom <I>all things are naked and open.</I> 

 (3.) That he had not answered the end of his creation and maintenance:
 <I>The God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, 
 hast thou not glorified.</I> This is a general charge, which stands 
 good against us all; let us consider how we shall answer it. Observe, 
 
 [1.] Our dependence upon God as our creator, preserver, benefactor,
 owner, and ruler; not only from his hand our breath was at first, but 
 <I>in his hand our breath is</I> still; it is he that <I>holds our 
 souls in life,</I> and, if he <I>take away our breath, we die.</I> Our 
 times being <I>in his hand,</I> so is our breath, by which our times 
 are measured. <I>In him we live, and move, and have our being;</I> we 
 live by him, live upon him, and cannot live without him. <I>The way of 
 man is not in himself,</I> not at his own command, at his own disposal, 
 <I>but his are all our ways;</I> for our hearts are in his hand, and so 
 are the hearts of all men, even of kings, who seem to act most as 
 free-agents. 

 [2.] Our duty to God, in consideration of this dependence; we ought to
 glorify him, to devote ourselves to his honour and employ ourselves in 
 his service, to make it our care to please him and our business to 
 praise him. 

 [3.] Our default in this duty, notwithstanding that dependence; we have
 not done it; for we have <I>all sinned, and come short of the glory of 
 God.</I> This is the indictment against Belshazzar; there needs no 
 proof, it is made good by the notorious evidence of the fact, and his 
 own conscience cannot but plead guilty to it. And therefore,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He now proceeds to read the sentence, as he found it <I>written upon 
 the wall: "Then</I>" (says Daniel) "when thou hast come to such a 
 height of impiety as thus to trample upon the most sacred things, 
 <I>then</I> when thou wast in the midst of thy sacrilegious idolatrous 
 feast, then was <I>the part of the hand,</I> the writing fingers, sent 
 <I>from him,</I> from that God whom thou didst so daringly affront, and 
 who had borne so long with thee, but would bear no longer; he <I>sent 
 them,</I> and <I>this writing,</I> thou now seest, <I>was written,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 It is he that now <I>writes bitter things against thee,</I> and 
 <I>makes thee to possess thy iniquities,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:26">Job xiii. 26</A>.

 Note, As the sin of sinners is written in the book of God's
 omniscience, so the doom of sinners is written in the book of God's 
 law; and the day is coming when those <I>books shall be opened,</I> and 
 they shall be judged by them. Now the writing was, <I>Mene, Mene, 
 Tekel, Upharsin,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 
 It is well that we have an authentic exposition of these words annexed, 
 else we could make little of them, so concise are they; the 
 signification of them is, <I>He has numbered, he has weighed, and they 
 divide.</I> The Chaldean wise men, because they knew not that there is 
 but one God only, could not understand who this <I>He</I> should be, 
 and for that reason (some think) the writing puzzled them. 

 (1.) <I>Mene;</I> that is repeated, for the thing is certain--<I>Mene,
 mene;</I> that signifies, both in Hebrew and Chaldee, <I>He has 
 numbered and finished,</I> which Daniel explains thus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 "<I>God has numbered thy kingdom,</I> the years and days of the 
 continuance of it; these were numbered in the counsel of God, and now 
 they are finished; the term has expired for and during which thou wast 
 to hold it, and now it must be surrendered. Here is an end of thy 
 kingdom." 

 (2.) <I>Tekel;</I> that signifies, in Chaldee, <I>Thou art weighed,</I>
 and, in Hebrew, <I>Thou art too light.</I> So Dr. Lightfoot. For this
 king and his actions are weighed in the just and unerring balances of 
 divine equity. God does as perfectly know his true character as the 
 goldsmith knows the weight of that which he has weighed in the nicest 
 scales. God does not give judgment against him till he has first 
 pondered his actions, and considered the merits of his case. "But thou 
 art <I>found wanting,</I> unworthy to have such a trust lodged in thee, 
 a vain, light, empty man, a man of no weight or consideration."

 (3.) <I>Upharsin,</I> which should be rendered, <I>and Pharsin,</I> or
 <I>Peres.</I> <I>Parsin,</I> in Hebrew, signifies the <I>Persians; 
 Paresin,</I> in Chaldee, signifies <I>dividing;</I> Daniel puts both 
 together

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 "<I>Thy kingdom is divided,</I> is rent from thee, and <I>given to the 
 Medes and Persians,</I> as a prey to be divided among them." Now this 
 may, without any force, be applied to the doom of sinners. <I>Mene, 
 Tekel, Peres,</I> may easily be made to signify <I>death, judgment,</I> 
 and <I>hell.</I> At death, the sinner's days are <I>numbered</I> and 
 <I>finished;</I> after death the judgment, when he will be <I>weighed 
 in the balance and found wanting;</I> and after judgment the sinner 
 will be <I>cut asunder,</I> and given as a prey to the devil and his 
 angels. Daniel does not here give Belshazzar such advice and 
 encouragement to repent as he had given Nebuchadnezzar, because he saw 
 the decree had gone forth and he would not be allowed any space to 
 repent.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 One would have thought that Belshazzar would be exasperated against 
 Daniel, and, seeing his own case desperate, would be in a rage against 
 him. But he was so far convicted by his own conscience of the 
 reasonableness of all he said that he objected nothing against it; but, 
 on the contrary, gave Daniel the reward he promised him, put on him the 
 <I>scarlet gown</I> and the <I>gold chain,</I> and proclaimed him the 
 <I>third ruler in the kingdom</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 because he would be as good as his word, and because it was not 
 Daniel's fault if the exposition of the hand-writing was not such as he 
 desired. Note, Many show great respect to God's prophets who yet have 
 no regard to his word. Daniel did not value these titles and ensigns of 
 honour, yet would not refuse them, because they were tokens of his 
 prince's good-will: but we have reason to think that he received them 
 with a smile, foreseeing how soon they would all wither with him that 
 bestowed them. They were like Jonah's gourd, which came up in a night 
 and perished in a night, and therefore it was folly for him to be 
 <I>exceedingly glad</I> of them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>30  In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans
 slain.
 &nbsp; 31  And Darius the Median took the kingdom, <I>being</I> about
 threescore and two years old.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The death of the king. Reason enough he had to tremble, for he was
 just falling into the hands of the <I>king of terrors,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 <I>In that night,</I> when his heart was merry with wine, the besiegers 
 broke into the city, aimed at the palace; there they found the king, 
 and gave him his death's wound. He could not find any place so secret 
 as to conceal him, or so strong as to protect him. Heathen writers 
 speak of Cyrus's taking Babylon by surprise, with the assistance of two 
 deserters that showed him the best way into the city. And it was
 foretold what a consternation it would be to the court, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:11,39">Jer. li. 11, 39</A>.

 Note, Death comes as a snare upon those whose hearts are overcharged
 with surfeiting and drunkenness.

 2. The transferring of the kingdom into other hands. From the head of
 gold we now descend to the breast and arms of silver. <I>Darius the 
 Mede took the kingdom</I> in partnership with, and by the consent of, 
 Cyrus, who had conquered it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 They were partners in war and conquest, and so they were in dominion,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:28"><I>ch.</I> vi. 28</A>.

 Notice is taken of his age, that he was now sixty-two years old, for
 which reason Cyrus, who was his nephew, gave him the precedency. Some 
 observe that being now sixty-two years old, in the last year of the 
 captivity, he was born in the eighth year of it, and that was the year 
 when Jeconiah was carried captive and all the nobles, &c. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:13-15">2 Kings xxiv. 13-15</A>.

 Just at that time when the most fatal stroke was given was a prince
 born that in process of time should avenge Jerusalem upon Babylon, and 
 heal the wound that was now given. Thus deep are the counsels of God
 concerning his people, thus kind are his designs towards them.</P>
