 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have the fatal doom of all the nations that are 
 enemies to God's church and people, though Edom only is mentioned, 
 because of the old enmity of Esau to Jacob, which was typical, as much 
 as that more ancient enmity of Cain to Abel, and flowed from the 
 original enmity of the serpent to the seed of the woman. It is probable 
 that this prophecy had its accomplishment in the great desolations made 
 by the Assyrian army first, or rather by Nebuchadnezzar's army some 
 time after, among those nations that were neighbours to Israel and had 
 been in some way or other injurious to them. That mighty conqueror took 
 a pride in shedding blood, and laying countries waste, and therein, 
 quite beyond his design, he was fulfilling what God here threatened 
 against his and his people's enemies. But we have reason to think it is 
 intended as a denunciation of the wrath of God against all those who 
 fight against the interests of his kingdom among men, that it has its 
 frequent accomplishment in the havoc made by the wars of the nations 
 and other desolating judgments, and will have its full accomplishment 
 in the final dissolution of all things at the day of judgment and 
 perdition of ungodly men. Here is, 

 I. A demand of universal attention, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. A direful scene of blood and confusion presented, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:2-7">ver. 2-7</A>.

 III. The reason given for these judgments,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:8">ver. 8</A>.

 IV. The continuance of this desolation, the country being made like the 
 lake of Sodom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:9,10">ver. 9, 10</A>),

 and the cities abandoned to wild beasts and melancholy fowls,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:11-15">ver. 11-15</A>.

 V. The solemn ratification of all this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:16,17">ver. 16, 17</A>.

 Let us hear, and fear.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people: let
 the earth hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all
 things that come forth of it.
 &nbsp; 2  For the indignation of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> upon all nations, and
 <I>his</I> fury upon all their armies: he hath utterly destroyed them,
 he hath delivered them to the slaughter.
 &nbsp; 3  Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall
 come up out of their carcases, and the mountains shall be melted
 with their blood.
 &nbsp; 4  And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the
 heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host
 shall fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a
 falling <I>fig</I> from the fig tree.
 &nbsp; 5  For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come
 down upon Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.
 &nbsp; 6  The sword of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> is filled with blood, it is made fat
 with fatness, <I>and</I> with the blood of lambs and goats, with the
 fat of the kidneys of rams: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath a sacrifice in
 Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea.
 &nbsp; 7  And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks
 with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and
 their dust made fat with fatness.
 &nbsp; 8  For <I>it is</I> the day of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s vengeance, <I>and</I> the year
 of recompences for the controversy of Zion.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have a prophecy, as elsewhere we have a history, of the wars of
 the Lord, which we are sure are all both righteous and successful. This
 world, as it is his creature, he does good to; but as it is in the
 interest of Satan, who is called <I>the god of this world,</I> he
 fights against it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is the trumpet sounded and the war proclaimed,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 All nations must hear and hearken, not only because what God is about 
 to do is well worthy their remark (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:13"><I>ch.</I> xxxiii. 13</A>),

 but because they are all concerned in it; it is with them that God has
 a quarrel; it is against them that God is coming forth in wrath. Let 
 them all take notice that the great God is angry with them; his 
 indignation is upon all nations, and therefore let all nations come 
 near to hear. <I>The trumpet is blown in the city</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:6">Amos iii. 6</A>),
 
 <I>and the watchmen on the walls cry, Hearken to the sound of the
 trumpet,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:17">Jer. vi. 17</A>.

 <I>Let the earth hear, and the fulness thereof, for it is the
 Lord's</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:1">Ps. xxiv. 1</A>)

 and ought to hearken to its Maker and Master. The world must hear, and
 <I>all things that come forth of it,</I> the children of men, that are 
 of the earth earthy, come out of it, and must return to it; or the 
 inanimate products of the earth are called to, as more likely to 
 hearken than sinners, whose hearts are hardened against the calls of 
 God. <I>Hear, O you mountains! the Lord's controversy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:2">Micah vi. 2</A>.
 
 It is so just a controversy that all the world may be safely appealed
 to concerning the equity of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is the manifesto published, setting forth,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Whom he makes war against 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>The indignation of the Lord is upon all nations;</I> they are all in 
 confederacy against God and religion, all in the interests of the 
 devil, and therefore he is angry with them all, even with all the 
 nations that forget him. He has long <I>suffered all nations to walk in 
 their own ways</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:16">Acts xiv. 16</A>),

 but now he will no longer keep silence. As they have all had the
 benefit of his patience, so they must all expect now to feel his 
 resentments. <I>His fury is</I> in a special manner <I>upon all their
 armies,</I>

 (1.) Because with them they have done mischief to the people of God; 
 those are they that have made bloody work with them, and therefore they 
 must be sure to have blood given them to drink. 

 (2.) Because with them they hope to make their part good against the 
 justice and power of God they trust to them as their defence, and 
 therefore on them, in the first place, God's fury will come. Armies 
 before God's fury are but as dry stubble before a consuming fire, 
 though ever so numerous and courageous.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Whom he makes war for, and what are the grounds and reasons of the 
 war 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>It is the day of the Lord's vengeance,</I> and he it is <I>to whom 
 vengeance belongs,</I> and who is never <I>unrighteous in taking 
 vengeance,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:5">Rom. iii. 5</A>.

 As there is a day of the Lord's patience, so there will be a day of his
 vengeance; for, though he bear long, he will not bear always. It is 
 <I>the year of recompences for the controversy of Zion.</I> Zion is the 
 holy city, the city of our solemnities, a type and figure of the church 
 of God in the world. Zion has a just quarrel with her neighbours for 
 the wrongs they have done her, for all their treacherous and barbarous 
 usage of her, profaning her holy things, laying waste her palaces, and 
 slaying her sons. She has left it to God to plead her cause, and he 
 will do so when the time, even the set time, to favour Zion shall have 
 come; then he will recompense to her persecutors and oppressors all the 
 mischiefs they have done her. The controversy will be decided, that 
 Zion has been wronged, and therein Zion's God has been himself abused. 
 Judgment will be given upon this decision, and execution done. Note, 
 There is a time prefixed in the divine counsels for the deliverance of 
 the church and the destruction of her enemies, a year of the redeemed, 
 which will come, <I>a year of recompences for the controversy of 
 Zion;</I> and we must patiently wait till then, and <I>judge nothing 
 before the time.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here are the operations of the war, and the methods of it, 
 settled, with an infallible assurance of success. 

 1. The sword of the Lord is <I>bathed in heaven;</I> this is all the
 preparation here made for the war,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 It may probably allude to some custom they had then of bathing their 
 swords in some liquor or other, to harden them or brighten them; it is 
 the same with the furbishing of it, that it may glitter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:9-11">Ezek. xxi. 9-11</A>.
 
 God's sword is bathed in heaven, in his counsel and decree, in his
 justice and power, and then there is not standing before it. 

 2. <I>It shall come down.</I> What he has determined shall without fail 
 be put in execution. It shall come down from heaven, and the higher the 
 place is, whence it comes, the heavier will it fall. It will come down
 <I>upon Idumea, the people of God's curse,</I> the people that lie 
 under his curse and are by it doomed to destruction. Miserable, for
 ever miserable, are those that have by their sins made themselves the 
 people of God's curse; for the sword of the Lord will infallibly attend 
 the curse of the Lord and execute the sentences of it; and those whom 
 he curses are cursed indeed. It shall come down <I>to judgment,</I> to 
 execute judgment upon sinners. Note, God's sword of war is always a 
 sword of justice. It is observed of him out of whose mouth goeth the 
 sharp sword that <I>in righteousness he doth judge and make war,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:11,15">Rev. xix. 11, 15</A>.

 3. The nations and their armies shall be given up to the sword

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>God has delivered them to the slaughter,</I> and then they cannot 
 deliver themselves, nor can all the friends they have deliver them from 
 it. Those only are slain whom God delivers to the slaughter, for the 
 keys of death are in his hand; and, in delivering them to the 
 slaughter, he has <I>utterly destroyed</I> them; their destruction is 
 as sure, when God has doomed them to it, as if they were destroyed 
 already, utterly destroyed. God has, in effect, delivered all the cruel 
 enemies of his church to the slaughter by that word 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:10">Rev. xiii. 10</A>),

 <I>He that kills with the sword must be killed by the sword,</I> for
 the Lord is righteous.

 4. Pursuant to the sentence, a terrible slaughter shall be made among 
 them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>The sword of the Lord,</I> when it comes down with commission, does 
 vast execution; it <I>is filled,</I> satiated, surfeited, <I>with 
 blood,</I> the blood of the slain, and <I>made fat with their 
 fatness.</I> When the day of God's abused mercy and patience is over 
 the sword of his justice gives no quarter, spares none. Men have by sin 
 lost the honour of the human nature and made themselves like the beasts 
 that perish; they are therefore justly denied the compassion and 
 respect that are owing to the human nature and killed as beasts, and no 
 more is made of slaying an army of men than of butchering a flock of 
 lambs or goats and feeding on the fat of the kidneys of rams. Nay, the 
 sword of the Lord shall not only dispatch the lambs and goats, the 
 infantry of their armies, the poor common soldiers, but 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>)

 <I>the unicorns</I> too <I>shall</I> be made to <I>come down with them, 
 and the bullocks with the bulls,</I> though they are ever so proud, and 
 strong, and fierce (<I>the great men, and the mighty men, and the chief 
 captains</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:15">Rev. vi. 15</A>),

 the sword of the Lord will make as easy a prey of as of the lambs and
 the goats. The greatest of men are nothing before the wrath of the 
 great God. See what bloody work will be made: <I>The land shall be 
 soaked with blood,</I> as with the rain that comes often upon it and in 
 great abundance; <I>and their dust,</I> their dry and barren land, 
 shall be <I>made fat with the fatness</I> of men slain in their full 
 strength, as with manure. Nay even <I>the mountains,</I> which are hard 
 and rocky, <I>shall be melted with their blood,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 These expressions are hyperbolical (as St. John's vision of <I>blood to 
 the horse-bridles,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:20">Rev. xiv. 20</A>),

 and are made use of because they sound very dreadful to sense (it makes
 us even shiver to think of such abundance of human gore), and are 
 therefore proper to express the terror of God's wrath, which is 
 dreadful beyond conception and expression. See what work sin and wrath 
 make even in this world, and think how much more terrible the wrath to 
 come is, which will bring down the unicorns themselves to the bars of 
 the pit.

 5. This great slaughter will be a great sacrifice to the justice of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):
 
 <I>The Lord has a sacrifice in Bozrah;</I> there it is that the great 
 Redeemer has his <I>garments dyed with blood,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:1"><I>ch.</I> lxiii. 1</A>.

 Sacrifices were intended for the honour of God, to make it appear that
 he hates sin and demands satisfaction for it, and that nothing but 
 blood will make atonement; and for these ends the slaughter is made, 
 that in it <I>the wrath of God may be revealed from heaven against all 
 the ungodliness and unrighteousness of men,</I> especially their 
 ungodly unrighteous enmity to his people, which was the sin that the 
 Edomites were notoriously guilty of. In great sacrifices abundance of 
 beasts were killed, hecatombs offered, and their blood poured out 
 before the altar; and so will it be in this day of the Lord's 
 vengeance. And thus would the whole earth have been soaked with the 
 blood of sinners if Jesus Christ, the great propitiation, had not shed 
 his blood for us; but those who reject him, and will not make a 
 covenant with God by that sacrifice, will themselves fall as victims to 
 divine wrath. Damned sinners are everlasting sacrifices, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:48,49">Mark ix. 48, 49</A>.
 
 Those that sacrifice not (which is the character of the ungodly,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:2">Eccl. ix. 2</A>)
 
 must be sacrificed.

 6. These slain shall be detestable to mankind, and shall be as much 
 their loathing as ever they were their terror

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>They shall be cast out,</I> and none shall pay them the respect of a 
 decent burial; but <I>their stink shall come up out of their 
 carcases,</I> that all people by the odious smell, as well as by the 
 ghastly sight, may be made to conceive an indignation against sin and a 
 dread of the wrath of God. They lie unburied, that they may remain 
 monuments of divine justice. 

 7. The effect and consequence of this slaughter shall be universal 
 confusion and desolation, as if the whole frame of nature were 
 dissolved and melted down

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>All the host of heaven shall pine and waste away</I> (so the word 
 is); the sun shall be darkened, and the moon look black, or be turned 
 into blood; <I>the heavens</I> themselves <I>shall be rolled together 
 as a scroll</I> or parchment when we have done with it, and lay it by, 
 or as when it is shrivelled up by the heat of the fire. The stars shall 
 fall as the leaves in autumn; all the beauty, joy, and comfort, of the 
 vanquished nation shall be lost and done away, magistracy and 
 government shall be abolished, and all dominion and rule, but that of 
 the sword of war, shall fall. Conquerors, in those times, affected to 
 lay waste the countries they conquered; and such a complete desolation 
 is here described by such figurative expressions as will yet have a 
 literal and full accomplishment in the dissolution of all things at the 
 end of time, of which last day of judgment the judgments which God does 
 now sometimes remarkably execute on sinful nations are figures, 
 earnests, and forerunners; and by these we should be awakened to think 
 of that, for which reason these expressions are used here and 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:12,13">Rev. vi. 12, 13</A>.

 But they are used without a metaphor,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:10">2 Pet. iii. 10</A>,

 where we are told that <I>the heavens shall pass away with a great
 noise and the earth shall be burnt up.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This prophecy looks very black, but surely it looks so further than 
 upon Edom and Bozrah. 

 1. It describes the melancholy changes that are often made by the
 divine Providence, in countries, cities, palaces, and families. Places 
 that have flourished and been much frequented strangely go to decay. We 
 know not where to find the places where many great towns, celebrated in 
 history, once stood. Fruitful countries, in process of time, are turned 
 into barrenness, and pompous populous cities into ruinous heaps. Old
 decayed castles look frightful, and their ruins are almost as much 
 dreaded as ever their garrisons were. 

 2. It describes the destroying judgments which are the effects of
 God's wrath and the just punishment of those that are enemies to his 
 people, which God will inflict when <I>the year of the redeemed has 
 come,</I> and <I>the year of recompences for the controversy of 
 Zion.</I> Those that aim to ruin the church can never do that, but will 
 infallibly ruin themselves. 

 3. It describes the final desolation of this wicked world, which is 
 <I>reserved unto fire at the day of judgment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:7">2 Pet. iii. 7</A>.

 The earth itself, when it, and all the works that are therein, shall be
 burnt up, will (for aught I know) be turned into a hell to all those 
 that set their affections on earthly things. However, this prophecy
 shows us what will be the lot of the <I>generation of God's 
 curse.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The country shall become like the lake of Sodom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 <I>The streams thereof,</I> that both watered the land and pleased and 
 refreshed the inhabitants, <I>shall</I> now <I>be turned into 
 pitch,</I> shall be congealed, shall look black, and shall move slowly, 
 or not at all. <I>Their floods to lazy streams of pitch shall turn;</I> 
 so Sir <I>R. Blackmore. The dust thereof shall be turned into 
 brimstone;</I> so combustible has sin made their land that it shall 
 take fire at the first spark of God's wrath struck upon it; and, when 
 it has taken fire, it shall become burning pitch; the fire shall be 
 universal, not a house, or town, on fire, but a whole country; and it 
 shall not be in the power of any to suppress or extinguish it. It shall 
 burn continually, burn perpetually, and <I>shall not be quenched night 
 nor day.</I> The torment of those in hell, or that have a hell within 
 them in their own consciences, is without interruption; the <I>smoke of 
 this fire goes up for ever.</I> As long as there are provoking sinners 
 on earth, <I>from one generation to another,</I> an increase of sinful 
 men, to <I>augment the fierce anger of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:14">Num. xxxii. 14</A>),

 there will be a righteous God in heaven to punish them for it. And as
 long as a people keep up a succession of sinners God will have a 
 succession of plagues for them; nor will any that fall under the wrath 
 of God be ever able to recover themselves. It will be found, how light 
 soever men make of it, that it is a <I>fearful thing to fall into the 
 hands of the living God.</I> If the land be doomed to destruction, none 
 shall pass through it, but travellers will choose rather to go a great 
 way about than come within the smell of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The cities shall become like old decayed houses, which, being 
 deserted by the owners, look very frightful, being commonly possessed 
 by beasts of prey or birds of ill omen. See how dismally the palaces of 
 the enemy look; the description is peculiarly elegant and fine. 

 1. God shall mark them for ruin and destruction. <I>He shall stretch
 out upon Bozrah the line of confusion with the stones</I> or plummets 
 <I>of emptiness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 This intimates the equity of the sentence passed upon it; it is given 
 according to the rules of justice and the exact agreeableness of the 
 execution with the sentence; the destruction is not wrought at random, 
 but by line and level. The confusion and emptiness that shall 
 overspread the face of the whole country shall be like that of the 
 whole earth when it was <I>Tohu and Bohu</I> (the very words here 
 used)--<I>without form and void.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:2">Gen. i. 2</A>.

 Sin will soon turn a paradise into a chaos, and sully the beauty of the
 whole creation. When there is confusion there will soon be emptiness; 
 but both are appointed by the governor of the world, and in exact 
 proportions.

 2. Their great men shall be all cut off, and none of them shall dare to 
 appear

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>They shall call the nobles of the kingdom</I> to take care of the 
 arduous affairs which lie before them, but none shall be there to take 
 this ruin under their hand, and all her princes, having the sad tidings 
 brought them, shall be nothing, shall be at their wits' end, and not be 
 able to stand them in stead, to shelter them from destruction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Even the houses of state, and those of strength, shall become as 
 wildernesses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 not only grass shall grow, but <I>thorns shall come up, in her palaces, 
 nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof,</I> and there shall be 
 none to cut them up or tread them down. We sometimes see ruined
 buildings thus overgrown with rubbish. It intimates that the place 
 shall not only be uninhabited and unfrequented where a full court used 
 to be kept, but that it shall be under the curse of God; for thorns and 
 thistles were the production of the curse, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:18">Gen. iii. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. They shall become the residence and rendezvous of fearful frightful 
 beasts and birds, which usually frequent such melancholy places, 
 because there they may be undisturbed, and, when they are frightened 
 thither, they help to frighten men thence. This circumstance of the
 desolation, being apt to strike a horror upon the mind, is much 
 enlarged upon here, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 <I>The cormorant shall possess it,</I> or the pelican, which affects to 
 be solitary 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:6">Ps. cii. 6</A>);

 and <I>the bittern,</I> which makes a hideous noise, <I>the owl,</I> a
 melancholy bird, <I>the raven,</I> a bird of prey, invited by the dead 
 carcases, shall dwell there (<I>with all the ill-boding monsters of the 
 air,</I> Sir <I>R. B.</I>), all the unclean birds, which were not for 
 the service of man,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 <I>It shall be a habitation for dragons,</I> which are poisonous and 
 hurtful.</P>

 That which was a court for princes shall now be a court for owls or 
 ostriches, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 <I>The wild beasts of the desert,</I> the dry and sandy country, shall
 meet, as it were by appointment, with the wild beasts of the island, 
 the wet marshy country, and shall regale themselves with such a perfect 
 desolation as they shall find there.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>The satyr shall cry to his fellow</I> to go with him to this desert 
 place, or, being there, they shall please themselves that they have 
 found such an agreeable habitation. There shall <I>the screech-owl 
 rest,</I> a night-bird and an ominous one. <I>The great owl shall
 there make her nest</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 <I>and lay and hatch;</I> the breed of them shall be kept up to provide 
 heirs for this desolate place. <I>The vultures</I> which feast on 
 carcases, <I>shall be gathered there, every one with his mate.</I> Now 
 observe, 

 1. How the places which men have deserted, and keep at a distance from,
 are proper receptacles for other animals, which the providence of God 
 takes care of, and will not neglect. 

 2. Whom those resemble that are morose, unsociable, and unconversable, 
 and affect a melancholy retirement; they are like these solitary 
 creatures that take delight in desolations. 

 3. What a dismal change sin makes; it turns a fruitful land into
 barrenness, a frequented city into a wilderness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Here is an assurance given of the full accomplishment of this 
 prediction, even to the most minute circumstance of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>):
 
 "<I>Seek you out of the book of the Lord and read.</I> When this 
 destruction comes compare the event with the prediction, and you will 
 find it to answer exactly." Note, The book of the prophets is the book 
 of the Lord, and we ought to consult it and converse with it as of 
 divine origin and authority. We must not only read it, but see out of 
 it, search into it, turn first to one text and then to another and 
 compare them together. Abundance of useful knowledge might thus be 
 extracted, by a diligent search, out of the scriptures, which cannot be 
 got by a superficial reading of them. When you have read the prediction 
 out of the book of the Lord then observe, 

 1. That according to what you have read so you see; <I>not one of these
 shall fail,</I> either beast or fowl: and, it being foretold that they 
 shall possess it <I>from generation to generation,</I> in order to 
 that, that the species may be propagated, <I>none shall want her 
 mate;</I> these marks of desolation shall be fruitful, and multiply, 
 and replenish the land. 

 2. That God's mouth having commanded this direful muster <I>his Spirit 
 shall gather them,</I> as the creatures by instinct were gathered to 
 Adam to be named and to Noah to be housed. What God's word has
 appointed his Spirit will effect and bring about, for no word of God 
 shall fall to the ground. The word of God's promise shall in like 
 manner be accomplished by the operations of the Spirit.

 3. That there is an exact order and proportion observed in the
 accomplishment of this threatening: <I>He has cast the lot</I> for 
 these birds and beasts, so that each one shall know his place as 
 readily as if it were marked by line. See the like, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:7,8">Joel ii. 7, 8</A>,

 <I>They shall not break their ranks, neither shall one thrust 
 another.</I> The soothsayers among the heathen foretold events by the 
 flight of birds, as if the fate of men depended on them. But here we 
 find that the flight of birds is under the direction of the God of 
 Israel: <I>he has cast the lot for them.</I> 

 4. That the desolation shall be perpetual: <I>They shall possess it
 for ever.</I> God's Jerusalem may be laid in ruins; but Jerusalem of 
 old recovered itself out of its ruins, till it gave place to the gospel 
 Jerusalem, which may be brought low, but shall be rebuilt, and shall 
 continue till it give place to the heavenly Jerusalem. But the enemies 
 of the church shall be for ever desolate, shall be punished with an 
 everlasting destruction.</P>
