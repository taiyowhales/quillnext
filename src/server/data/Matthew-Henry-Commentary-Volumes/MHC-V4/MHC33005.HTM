 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath
 laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with
 a rod upon the cheek.
 &nbsp; 2 But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, <I>though</I> thou be little among
 the thousands of Judah, <I>yet</I> out of thee shall he come forth
 unto me <I>that is</I> to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth <I>have
 been</I> from of old, from everlasting.
 &nbsp; 3 Therefore will he give them up, until the time <I>that</I> she
 which travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his
 brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.
 &nbsp; 4 And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, in
 the majesty of the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> his God; and they shall
 abide: for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.
 &nbsp; 5 And this <I>man</I> shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall
 come into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then
 shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal
 men.
 &nbsp; 6 And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and
 the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he
 deliver <I>us</I> from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and
 when he treadeth within our borders.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, as before, we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The abasement and distress of Zion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 The Jewish nation, for many years before the captivity, dwindled, and 
 fell into disgrace: <I>Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of 
 troops!</I> It is either a summons to Zion's enemies, that had troops 
 at their service, to come and do their worst against her (God will 
 suffer them to do it), or a challenge to Zion's friends, that had 
 troops too at command, to come and do their best for her; Let them 
 <I>gather in troops,</I> yet it shall be to no purpose; for, says the 
 prophet, in the name of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, <I>He has laid 
 siege against us;</I> the king of Assyria has, the king of Babylon has, 
 and we know not which way to defend ourselves; so that the enemies 
 shall gain their point, and prevail so far as <I>to smite the judge of 
 Israel</I>--the king, the chief justice, and the other inferior 
 judges--<I>with a rod upon the cheek,</I> in contempt of them and their 
 dignity; having made them prisoners, they shall use them as shamefully 
 as any of the common captives. Complaint had been made of the judges of 
 Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+3:11"><I>ch.</I> iii. 11</A>)

 that they were corrupt and took bribes, and this disgrace came justly 
 upon them for abusing their power; yet it was a great calamity to 
 Israel to have their judges treated thus ignominiously. Some make this 
 the reason why the troops (that is, the Roman army) shall lay siege to 
 Jerusalem, because the Jews <I>shall smite the judge of Israel upon the 
 cheek,</I> because of the indignities they shall do to the Messiah, the 
 Judge of Israel, whom they smote on the cheek, saying, <I>Prophesy, who 
 smote thee.</I> But the former sense seems more probable, and that it 
 is meant of the besieging of Jerusalem, not by the Romans, but the 
 Chaldeans, and was fulfilled in the indignities done to king Zedekiah 
 and the princes of the house of David.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The advancement of Zion's King. Having shown how low the house of 
 David should be brought, and how vilely the shield of that mighty 
 family should be cast away, as though it had not been anointed with 
 oil, to encourage the faith of God's people, who might be tempted now 
 to think that his covenant with David and his house was abrogated 
 (according to the psalmist's complaint, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:38,39">Ps. lxxxix. 38, 39</A>),

 he adds an illustrious prediction of the Messiah and his kingdom, in
 whom that covenant should be established, and the honours of that house 
 should be revived, advanced, and perpetuated. Now let us see,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How the Messiah is here described. It is he that is to be <I>ruler 
 in Israel, whose goings forth have been from of old, from 
 everlasting,</I> from the <I>days of eternity,</I> as the word is. Here 
 we have, 

 (1.) His existence from eternity, as God: <I>his goings forth,</I> or 
 <I>emanations,</I> as the going forth of the beams from the sun, were, 
 or have been, <I>of old, from everlasting,</I> which (says Dr. Pocock) 
 is so signal a description of Christ's eternal generation, or his going 
 forth as the Son of God, begotten of his Father before all worlds, that 
 this prophecy must belong only to him, and could never be verified of 
 any other. It certainly speaks of a going forth that was now past, when 
 the prophet spoke, and cannot but be read, as we read it, his 
 <I>outgoings have been;</I> and the putting of both these words 
 together, which severally are used to denote eternity, plainly shows 
 that they must here be taken in the strictest sense (the same with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:2">Ps. xc. 2</A>,

 <I>From everlasting to everlasting thou are God</I>), and can be
 applied to no other than to him who was able to say, <I>Before Abraham
 was, I am,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:58">John viii. 58</A>.

 Dr. Pocock observes that the <I>going forth</I> is used

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:3">Deut. viii. 3</A>)

 for a <I>word</I> which <I>proceeds out of the mouth,</I> and is
 therefore very fitly used to signify the eternal generation of him who
 is called the <I>Word of God,</I> that was <I>in the beginning with
 God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:1,2">John i. 1, 2</A>.

 (2.) His office as Mediator; he was to be <I>ruler in Israel,</I> king
 of his church; he was to <I>reign over the house of Jacob for ever,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:32,33">Luke i. 32, 33</A>.

 The Jews object that our Lord Jesus could not be the Messiah, for he
 was so far from being ruler in Israel that Israel ruled over him, and
 put him to death, and would not have him to reign over them; but he
 answered that himself when he said, <I>My kingdom is not of this 
 world,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:36">John xviii. 36</A>.

 And it is a spiritual Israel that he reigns over, the children of 
 promise, all the followers of believing Abraham and praying Jacob. In
 the hearts of these he reigns by his Spirit and grace, and in the 
 society of these by his word and ordinances. And was not he <I>ruler in 
 Israel</I> whom winds and seas obeyed, to whom legions of devils were 
 forced to submit, and who commanded away diseases from the sick and 
 called the dead out of their graves? None but he whose <I>goings forth 
 were from of old, from everlasting,</I> was fit to be <I>ruler in 
 Israel,</I> to be head of the church, and <I>head over all things to 
 the church.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What is here foretold concerning him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That Bethlehem should be the place of his nativity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 This was the scripture which the scribes went upon when with the 
 greatest assurance they told Herod <I>where Christ should be born</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:6">Matt. ii. 6</A>),

 and hence it was universally known among the Jews that
 <I>Christ should come out of the town of Bethlehem where David was,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:42">John vii. 42</A>.

 <I>Beth-lehem</I> signifies <I>the house of bread,</I> the fittest
 place for him to be born in who is <I>the bread of life.</I> And,
 because it was the city of David, by a special providence it was
 ordered that he should be born there who was to be the <I>Son of
 David,</I> and his heir and successor for ever. It is called
 <I>Bethlehem-Ephratah,</I> both names of the same city, as appears

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:19">Gen. xxxv. 19</A>.

 It was <I>little among the thousands of Judah,</I> not considerable
 either for the number of the inhabitants or the figure they made; it 
 had nothing in it worthy to have this honour put upon it; but God in 
 that, as in other instances, chose to <I>exalt those of low degree,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:52">Luke i. 52</A>.

 Christ would give honour to the place of his birth, and not derive
 honour from it: <I>Though thou be little,</I> yet this shall make thee 
 great, and, as St. Matthew reads it, Thou <I>art not the least among 
 the princes of Judah,</I> but upon this account art really honourable 
 above any of them. A relation to Christ will magnify those that are 
 little in the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That in the fulness of time he should be born of a woman 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):
 
 <I>Therefore will he give them up;</I> he will give up his people 
 Israel to distress and trouble, and will defer their salvation, which 
 has been so long promised and expected, <I>until the time,</I> the set 
 time, <I>that she who travails has brought forth,</I> or (as it should 
 be read) <I>that she who shall bring forth shall have brought 
 forth,</I> that the blessed virgin, who was to be the mother of the 
 Messiah, shall have brought him forth at Bethlehem, the place 
 appointed. This Dr. Pocock thinks to be the most genuine sense of the 
 words. Though the out-goings of the Messiah were <I>from 
 everlasting,</I> yet the <I>redemption in Jerusalem,</I> the 
 <I>consolation of Israel,</I> must be <I>waited for</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:25-38">Luke ii. 25-38</A>)
 
 until the time that <I>she who should bring forth</I> (so the virgin
 Mary is called, as Christ is himself called, <I>He that shall come</I>) 
 shall <I>bring forth;</I> and in the mean time <I>he will give them 
 up.</I> Divine salvations must be waited for until the time fixed for 
 the bringing of them forth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) That <I>the remnant of his brethren shall then return to the 
 children of Israel.</I> The remnant of the Jewish nation shall return 
 to the spirit of the true genuine children of Israel, a people in 
 covenant with God; the hearts of the children shall be turned to the 
 fathers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:6">Mal. iv. 6</A>.

 Some understand it of all believers, Gentiles as well as Jews; they
 shall all be incorporated into the commonwealth of Israel; and, as they 
 are all brethren to one another, so <I>he is not ashamed to call them 
 brethren,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:11">Heb. ii. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) That he shall be a glorious prince, and his subjects shall be 
 happy under his government 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>He shall stand and feed,</I> that is, he shall both teach and rule, 
 and continue to do so, as a good shepherd, with wisdom, and care, and 
 love. So it was foretold. <I>He shall feed his flock like a 
 shepherd,</I> shall provide green pastures for them, and 
 under-shepherds to lead them into these pastures. He is the <I>good 
 shepherd</I> that <I>goes before the sheep,</I> and presides among 
 them. He shall do this, not as an ordinary man, but <I>in the strength 
 of the Lord,</I> as one clothed with a divine power to go through his 
 work, and break through the difficulties in his way, so as not to 
 <I>fail,</I> or be <I>discouraged;</I> he shall do it <I>in the majesty 
 of the name of the Lord his God,</I> so as plainly to evidence that 
 <I>God's name was in him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:21">Exod. xxiii. 21</A>)

 the majesty of his name, for <I>he taught as one having authority and
 not as the scribes.</I> The prophets prefaced their messages with, 
 <I>Thus saith the Lord;</I> but Christ spoke, not as a servant, but as 
 a Son--<I>Verily, verily, I say unto you.</I> This was feeding <I>in 
 the majesty of the name of the Lord his God. All power was given him in 
 heaven and in earth,</I> a <I>power over all flesh,</I> by virtue of 
 which he still rules <I>in the majesty of the name of the Lord his 
 God,</I> a name above every name. Christ's government shall be,

 [1.] Very happy for his subjects, for <I>they shall abide;</I> they 
 shall be safe and easy, and continue so for ever. <I>Because he lives, 
 they shall live also.</I> They shall lie down in the green pastures to 
 which he shall lead them, <I>shall abide in God's tabernacle for 
 ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+61:4">Ps. lxi. 4</A>.

 His church shall abide, and he in it, and with it, always, even to the
 end of the world.

 [2.] It shall be very glorious to himself: <I>Now shall he be great to 
 the ends of the earth.</I> Now that he stands and feeds his flock, 
 <I>now shall he be great.</I> For Christ reckons it his greatness to do 
 good. Now he shall be <I>great to the ends of the earth,</I> for the 
 uttermost parts of the earth shall be given him for his possession, and 
 the ends of the world shall see his salvation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5) That he shall secure the peace and welfare of his church and people 
 against all the attempts of his and their enemies 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>):

 <I>This man,</I> as king and ruler, <I>shall be the peace when the 
 Assyrians shall come into our land.</I> This refers to the deliverance 
 of Hezekiah and his kingdom from the power of Sennacherib, who invaded 
 them, in the type; but, under the shadow of that, it is a promise of 
 the safety of the gospel-church and of all believers from the designs 
 and attempts of the powers of darkness, Satan and all his instruments, 
 the dragon and his angels, that seek to devour the church of the 
 first-born and all that belong to it. Observe, 

 [1.] The peril and danger which Christ's subjects are supposed to be 
 in. The Assyrian, a potent enemy, <I>comes into their land</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>),

 <I>treads within their borders,</I> nay, prevails so far as to <I>tread 
 in their palaces;</I> it was a time of <I>treading down and of 
 perplexity</I> when Sennacherib made a descent upon Judah, took all the 
 defenced cities, and laid siege to Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+36:1,37:3">Isa. xxxvi. 1; xxxvii. 3</A>.

 This represented the gates of hell fighting against the kingdom of
 Christ, <I>encompassing the camp of the saints and of the holy 
 city,</I> and threatening to bear down all before them. When the 
 terrors of the law set themselves in array against a convinced soul, 
 when the temptations of Satan assault the people of God, and the 
 troubles of the world threaten to rob them of all their comforts, then 
 the <I>Assyrian comes into their land</I> and treads in their palaces. 
 <I>Without are fightings, within are fears.</I>

 [2.] The protection and defence which his subjects are then sure to be 
 under. <I>First,</I> Christ will himself be <I>their peace.</I> When 
 the Assyrian comes with such a force into a land, can there be any 
 other peace than a tame submission and an unresisted desolation? Yes, 
 even then the church's King will be the conservator of the church's 
 peace, will be <I>for a hiding-place,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:1,2">Isa. xxxii. 1, 2</A>.

 Christ is our peace as a priest, making atonement for sin, and
 reconciling us to God; and he is our peace as a king, conquering our 
 enemies and commanding down disquieting fears and passions; he 
 <I>creates the fruit of the lips, peace.</I> Even when the Assyrian 
 comes into the land, when we are in the greatest distress and danger 
 and have received a sentence of death within ourselves, yet <I>this man 
 may be the peace. In me,</I> says Christ, <I>you shall have peace,</I> 
 when <I>in the world you have tribulation;</I> at such a time our souls 
 may dwell at ease in him. <I>Secondly,</I> He will find out proper
 instruments to be employed for their protection and deliverance, and 
 the defeat of their enemies: <I>Then shall we raise against him seven 
 shepherds and eight principal men,</I> that is, a competent number of 
 persons, proper to oppose the enemy, and make head against him, and 
 protect the church of God in peace, men that shall have the care and 
 tenderness of shepherds and the courage and authority of <I>principal 
 men,</I> or <I>princes of men. Seven</I> and <I>eight</I> are a
 certain number for an uncertain. Note, When God has work to do he will 
 not want fitting instruments to do it with; and when he pleases he can 
 do it by a few; he needs not raise thousands, but seven or eight 
 principal men may serve the turn if God be with them. Magistrates and
 ministers are shepherds and principal men, raised in defence of 
 religion's righteous cause against the powers of sin and Satan in the 
 world. <I>Thirdly,</I> The opposition given to the church shall be got 
 over, and the opposers brought down. This is represented by the laying 
 of Assyria and Chaldea waste, which two nations were the most 
 formidable enemies to the Israel of God of any, and the destruction of 
 them signified the making of Christ's enemies his footstool: <I>They 
 shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod 
 in the entrances thereof;</I> they shall make inroads upon the land, 
 and put to the sword all that they find in arms. Note, Those that
 threaten ruin to the church of God hasten ruin to themselves; and their 
 destruction is the church's salvation: <I>Thus</I> shall he <I>deliver 
 us from the Assyrian.</I> When <I>Satan fell as lightning from 
 heaven</I> before the preaching of the gospel, and Christ's enemies, 
 that would not have him to reign over them, were <I>slain before 
 him,</I> then this was fulfilled.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Glorious things are here spoken of <I>the remnant of Jacob,</I> that 
 remnant which was raised of <I>her that halted</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+4:7"><I>ch.</I> iv. 7</A>),

 and it seems to be that <I>remnant which the Lord our God shall
 call</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:32">Joel ii. 32</A>),

 on whom the Spirit shall be poured out, the remnant that shall be
 saved, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:27">Rom. ix. 27</A>.

 Note, God's people are but a remnant, a small number in comparison with
 the many that are left to perish, a <I>little flock;</I> but they are 
 <I>the remnant of Jacob,</I> a people in covenant with God, and in his 
 favour. Now concerning this remnant it is here promised,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That they shall be <I>as a dew</I> in the midst of the nations, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 God's church is dispersed all the world over; it is <I>in the midst of 
 many people,</I> as gold in the ore, wheat in the heap. Israel 
 according to the flesh dwelt alone, and was not numbered among the 
 nations; but the spiritual Israel lies scattered <I>in the midst of 
 many people,</I> as the <I>salt of the earth,</I> or as seed sown in 
 the ground, here a grain and there a grain, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:23">Hos. ii. 23</A>.

 Now this remnant shall be <I>as dew from the Lord.</I>

 1. They shall be of a heavenly extraction; as <I>dew from the Lord,</I>
 who is the <I>Father of the rain,</I> and has <I>begotten the drops of 
 the dew,</I>

 They are <I>born from above,</I> and are not of the earth, savouring 
 the things of the earth.

 2. They shall be numerous as the drops of dew in a summer's morning.
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:3">Ps. cx. 3</A>,

 <I>Thou hast the dew of thy youth.</I> 

 3. They shall be pure and clear, not muddy and corrupt, but crystal
 drops, as the <I>water of life.</I> 

 4. They shall be produced silently and without noise, as the dew that
 distils insensibly, we know not how; such is the way of the Spirit. 

 5. They shall live in a continual dependence upon God, and be still
 deriving from him, as the dew, which <I>tarries not for man,</I> not 
 <I>waits for the sons of men;</I> they shall not rely upon human aids 
 and powers, but on divine grace, for they are, and own that they are, 
 no more than what the free grace of God makes them every day. 

 6. They shall be great blessings to those among whom they live, as the
 dew and the showers are to the grass, to make it grow without the help 
 of man, or the sons of men. Their doctrine, example, and prayers, shall 
 make them as dew, to soften and moisten others, and make them fruitful.
 Their speech shall <I>distil as the dew</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:2">Deut. xxxii. 2</A>),

 and all about them shall <I>wait for them as for the rain,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+29:23">Job xxix. 23</A>.

 The people among whom they live shall be as the grass, which flourishes
 only by the blessing of God, and not by the art and care of man; they
 shall be beneficial to those about them by drawing down God's blessings
 on them, as Jacob on Laban's house, and by cooling and mitigating God's
 wrath, which otherwise would burn them up, as the dew preserves the
 grass from being scorched by the sun; so Dr. Pocock; they shall be mild
 and gentle in their behaviour, like their Master, who comes down
 <I>like rain upon the new-mown grass,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:6">Ps. lxxii. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That they shall be <I>as a lion among the beasts of the forest,</I> 
 that <I>treads down and tears in pieces,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 As they shall be silent, and gentle, and communicative of all good, to 
 those that receive the truth in the love of it, so they shall be bold 
 as a lion in witnessing against the corruptions of the times and places 
 they live in, and strong as a lion, in the strength of God, to resist 
 and overcome their spiritual enemies. The <I>weapons of their warfare 
 are mighty, through God, to the pulling down of strongholds,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:4,5">2 Cor. x. 4, 5</A>.

 They shall have <I>courage which all their adversaries shall not be
 able to resist</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:15">Luke xxi. 15</A>),

 as when the lion tears none can deliver. When infidelity is silenced,
 and all iniquity made <I>to stop her mouth,</I> when sinners are 
 convinced and converted by the power of the gospel, in the doctrine of 
 its ministers and the conversation of its professors, then the remnant 
 of Jacob is like a lion. This is explained,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>,

 <I>Thy hand shall be lifted up upon thy adversaries;</I> the church 
 shall have the upper hand at last of all that oppose her. Her 
 <I>enemies shall be cut off;</I> they shall cease to be enemies; their 
 enmity shall be cut off. Christ's arrows of conviction shall be sharp 
 in their hearts, so that they shall fall under him; they shall yield 
 themselves subjects to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:5">Ps. xlv. 5</A>)

 and be happily conquered and subdued, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:2">Ps. cx. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That they shall be brought off from all carnal confidences, which 
 they have relied on, that by the providence of God they shall enjoy 
 such a security that they shall not need them, and by the grace of God 
 they shall be brought to see the folly of them and come off from them. 
 It was the sin of Israel that they furnished themselves extravagantly 
 with <I>horses and chariots,</I> and were <I>soothsayers</I> and 
 <I>idolaters;</I> see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:6-8">Isa. ii. 6-8</A>.

 But here it is promised that they shall not regard them any more. The
 tranquillity of the kingdom of Christ is intended in that promise, 
 which explains this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:10">Zech. ix. 10</A>,

 <I>I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the horse from 
 Jerusalem.</I> Note, It is a great mercy to be deprived of those things 
 in which we have reposed a confidence in competition with God, which we 
 have made our arm, and after which we have gone a whoring from God. Let 
 us observe the particulars:--

 1. They had trusted in chariots and horses, and multiplied them 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:7">Ps. xx. 7</A>);

 but now God will <I>cut off their horses,</I> and <I>destroy their
 chariots</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 as <I>David houghed the chariot-horses,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:4">2 Sam. viii. 4</A>.

 They shall not have them, lest they should be tempted to trust in them. 
 
 2. They depended upon their strongholds, and fortified cities, for
 their security; but God will take care that they be demolished 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):
 
 <I>I will cut off the cities of thy land;</I> I will <I>throw down thy 
 strongholds.</I> They shall have them for habitations, but not for 
 garrisons, for God will be their only place of defence, their <I>high 
 tower,</I> and <I>their deliverer.</I> 

 3. Many of them depended much upon the conduct and advice of their
 conjurors, diviners, and fortune-tellers; and those God will cut off, 
 not only as weak things, and insufficient to relieve them, but as 
 wicked things, and sufficient to ruin them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 "<I>I will cut off witchcrafts out of thy hand,</I> that thou shalt no 
 more take hold of them, and stay thyself upon them, and <I>thou shalt 
 have no more soothsayers,</I> for thou shalt be convinced that all 
 their pretensions are a cheat." The justice of the nation shall cut 
 them off according to law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:27">Lev. xx. 27</A>.

 The preaching of the gospel brought men off from using curious arts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:19">Acts xix. 19</A>.

 4. Many of them had said to the work of their hands, <I>You are our 
 gods;</I> but now idolatry shall be abolished and abandoned 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):
 
 "<I>Thy graven images will I cut off, and thy standing images,</I> both 
 those that were movable and those that were fixed; they shall be 
 destroyed by the power of the law of Moses and deserted by the power of 
 the gospel of Christ, so that <I>thou shalt no more worship the work of 
 thy hands,</I> but be ashamed that ever thou hast been so deluded.
 Among other monuments of idolatry, <I>I will pluck up thy groves out of 
 the midst of thee,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 These were planted and preserved in honour of their idols, and used in 
 the worship of them; these they were ordered to burn 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:2,3">Deut. xii. 2, 3</A>),
 
 and, if they do not, God will, so that they shall not have them to
 trust to. And so <I>will I destroy their cities,</I> meaning the cities 
 that were dedicated to the idols, to some dunghill-deity or other, 
 which they confided in for their protection.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That those who stand it out against the gospel of Christ, and 
 continue in league with their idolatries and witchcrafts, shall fall 
 under the wrath of God, and be consumed by it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen</I> 
 (that is, upon heathenism), <I>such as they have not heard;</I> 
 idolatries shall be done away, and idolaters put to shame. I will 
 execute vengeance upon the heathen <I>who have not heard</I> (so some 
 read it), or who would not hear and receive the doctrine of Christ. God
 will give his Son either the hearts or the necks of his enemies, and
 make them either his friends or his footstool.</P>
