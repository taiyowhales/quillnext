 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter, just as in the former, we have Jeremiah greatly 
 debased under the frowns of the princes, and yet greatly honoured by 
 the favour of the king. They used him as a criminal; he used him as a 
 privy-counsellor. Here, 

 I. Jeremiah for his faithfulness is put into the dungeon by the princes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. At the intercession of Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, by special order
 from the king, he is taken up out of the dungeon and confined only to 
 the court of the prison, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:7-13">ver. 7-13</A>.

 III. He has a private conference with the king upon the present
 conjuncture of affairs, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:14-22">ver. 14-22</A>.

 IV. Care is taken to keep that conference private,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:24-28">ver. 24-28</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of
 Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of
 Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the
 people, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, He that remaineth in this city shall die
 by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that
 goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his
 life for a prey, and shall live.
 &nbsp; 3  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, This city shall surely be given into the
 hand of the king of Babylon's army, which shall take it.
 &nbsp; 4  Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee,
 let this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of
 the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the
 people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh
 not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.
 &nbsp; 5  Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he <I>is</I> in your hand:
 for the king <I>is</I> not <I>he that</I> can do <I>any</I> thing against you.
 &nbsp; 6  Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of
 Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that <I>was</I> in the court of the
 prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon
 <I>there was</I> no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.
 &nbsp; 7  Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which
 was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the
 dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;
 &nbsp; 8  Ebed-melech went forth out of the king's house, and spake to
 the king, saying,
 &nbsp; 9  My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they
 have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the
 dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he
 is: for <I>there is</I> no more bread in the city.
 &nbsp; 10  Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying,
 Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the
 prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.
 &nbsp; 11  So Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house
 of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts
 and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon
 to Jeremiah.
 &nbsp; 12  And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now
 <I>these</I> old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes
 under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.
 &nbsp; 13  So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of
 the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 1. Jeremiah persists in his plain preaching; what he had many a time 
 said, he still says

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>This city shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon;</I>
 though it hold out long, it will taken at last. Nor would he have so 
 often repeated this unwelcome message but that he could put them in a 
 certain way, though not to save the city, yet to save themselves; so 
 that every man might have his own life given him for a prey if he would 
 be advised, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Let him not stay in the city, in hopes to defend that, for it will be 
 to no purpose, but let him <I>go forth to the Chaldeans,</I> and throw 
 himself upon their mercy, before things come to extremity, and then he 
 <I>shall live;</I> they will not put him to the sword, but give him 
 quarter (<I>satis est prostrasse leoni--it suffices the lion to lay his 
 antagonist prostrate</I>) and he shall escape the <I>famine and 
 pestilence,</I> which will be the death of multitudes within the city. 
 Note, Those do better for themselves who patiently submit to the rebukes 
 of Providence than those who contend with them. And, if we cannot have 
 our liberty, we must reckon it a mercy to have our lives, and not 
 foolishly throw them away upon a point of honour; they may be reserved 
 for better times. 

 2. The princes persist in their malice against Jeremiah. He was
 faithful to his country and to his trust as a prophet, though he had 
 suffered many a time for his faithfulness; and, though at this time he 
 ate the king's bread, yet that did not stop his mouth. But his 
 persecutors were still bitter against him, and complained that he 
 abused the liberty he had of walking in the court of the prison; for, 
 though he could not go to the temple to preach, yet he vented the same 
 things in private conversation to those that came to visit him, and 
 therefore

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)

 they represented him to the king as a dangerous man, disaffected to his 
 country and to the government he lived under: <I>He seeks not the 
 welfare of this people, but the hurt</I>--an unjust insinuation, for no 
 man had laid out himself more for the good of Jerusalem than he had 
 done. They represent his preaching as having a bad tendency. The design 
 of it was plainly to bring men to repent and turn to God, which would 
 have been as much as any thing a strengthening to the hands both the 
 soldiery and of the burghers, and yet they represented it <I>as 
 weakening their hands</I> and discouraging them; and, if it did this, 
 it was their own fault. Note, It is common for wicked people to look 
 upon God's faithful ministers as their enemies, only because they show 
 them what enemies they are to themselves while they continue 
 impenitent. 

 3. Jeremiah hereupon, by the king's permission, is put into a dungeon,
 with a view to his destruction there. Zedekiah, though he felt a 
 conviction that Jeremiah was a prophet, sent of God, had not courage to 
 own it, but yielded to the violence of his persecutors

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>He is in your hand;</I> and a worse sentence he could not have 
 passed upon him. We found in Jehoiakim's reign that the princes were 
 better affected to the prophet than the king was

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:25"><I>ch.</I> xxxvi. 25</A>);

 but now they were more violent against him, a sign that they were
 ripening apace for ruin. Had it been in a cause that concerned his own 
 honour or profit, he would have let them know that the king is he who 
 can do what he pleases, whether they will or no; but in the cause of 
 God and his prophet, which he was very cool in, he basely sneaks, and 
 truckles to them: <I>The king is not he that can do any thing against 
 you.</I> Note, Those will have a great deal to answer for who, though 
 they have a secret kindness for good people, dare not own it in a time 
 of need, nor will do what they might do to prevent mischief designed 
 them. The princes, having this general warrant from the king, 
 immediately put poor <I>Jeremiah into the dungeon of Malchiah, that was 
 in the court of the prison</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 a deep dungeon, for they <I>let</I> him <I>down</I> into it <I>with 
 cords,</I> and a dirty one, for <I>there was no water</I> in it, <I>but 
 mire;</I> and he <I>sunk in the mire, up to the neck,</I> says 
 Josephus. Those that put him here doubtless designed that he should die 
 here, die for hunger, die for cold, and so die miserably, die 
 obscurely, fearing, if they should put him to death openly, the people 
 might be affected with what he would say and be incensed against them.
 Many of God's faithful witnesses have thus been privately made away, 
 and starved to death, in prisons, whose blood will be brought to 
 account in the day of discovery. We are not here told what Jeremiah did 
 in this distress, but he tells us himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:55,57">Lam. iii. 55, 57</A>),

 <I>I called upon thy name, O Lord! out of the low dungeon, and thou
 drewest near, saying, Fear not.</I> 

 4. Application is made to the king by an honest courtier,
 <I>Ebed-melech,</I> one of the gentlemen of the bed-chamber, in behalf 
 of the poor sufferer. Though the princes carried on the matter as 
 privately as they could, yet it came to the ear of this good man, who 
 probably sought opportunities to do good. It may be he came to the 
 knowledge of it by hearing Jeremiah's moans out of the dungeon, for it 
 was in the king's house,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 <I>Ebed-melech</I> was an Ethiopian, a <I>stranger to the commonwealth 
 of Israel,</I> and yet had in him more humanity, and more divinity too, 
 than native Israelites had. Christ found more faith among Gentiles
 than among Jews. Ebed-melech lived in a wicked court and in a very 
 corrupt degenerate age, and yet had a great sense both of equity and 
 piety. God has his remnant in all places, among all sorts. There were
 <I>saints</I> even <I>in C&aelig;sar's household.</I> The king was now 
 <I>sitting in the gate of Benjamin,</I> to try causes and receive 
 appeals and petitions, or perhaps holding a council of war there. 
 Thither Ebed-melech went immediately to him, for the case would not 
 admit delay; the prophet might have perished if he had trifled or put 
 it off till he had an opportunity of speaking to the king in private. 
 Not time must be lost when life is in danger, especially so valuable a 
 life. He boldly asserts the Jeremiah had a great deal of wrong done 
 him, and is not afraid to tell the king so, though they were princes 
 that did it, though they were now present in court, and though they had 
 the king's warrant for what they did. Whither should oppressed
 innocency flee for protection but to the throne, especially when great 
 men are its oppressors? Ebed-melech appears truly brave in this matter. 
 He does not mince the matter; though he had a place at court, which he 
 would be in danger of losing for his plain dealing, yet he tells the 
 king faithfully, let him take it as he will, <I>These men have done ill 
 in all that they have done to Jeremiah.</I> They had dealt unjustly 
 with him, for he had not deserved any punishment at all; and they had 
 dealt barbarously with him, so as they used not to deal with the vilest 
 malefactors. And they needed not to have put him to this miserable 
 death; for, if they had let him alone where he was, he was <I>likely to 
 die for hunger in the place where he was,</I> in the court of the 
 prison to which he was confined, <I>for there was not more bread in the 
 city:</I> the stores out of which he was to have his allowance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+37:21"><I>ch.</I> xxxvii. 21</A>)

 were in a manner spent. See how God can raise up friends for his people
 in distress where they little thought of them, and animate men for his 
 service even beyond expectation. 

 5. Orders are immediately given for his release, and Ebed-melech takes
 care to see them executed. The king, who but now durst do nothing 
 against the princes, had his heart wonderfully changed on a sudden, and 
 will now have Jeremiah released in defiance of the princes, for 
 therefore he orders no less than thirty men, and those of the 
 lifeguard, to be employed in fetching him out of the dungeon, lest the 
 princes should raise a party to oppose it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 Let this encourage us to appear boldly for God--we may succeed better 
 that we could have thought, for <I>the hearts of kings are in the hand 
 of God.</I> Ebed-melech gained his point, and soon brought Jeremiah the 
 good news; and it is observable how particularly the manner of his 
 drawing him out of the dungeon is related (for <I>God is not 
 unrighteous to forget</I> any <I>work or labour of love</I> which is 
 shown to his people or ministers, no, nor any circumstance of it, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:10">Heb. vi. 10</A>);

 special notice is taken of his great tenderness in providing old soft
 rags for Jeremiah to put under his arm-holes, to keep the cords 
 wherewith he was to be drawn up from hurting him, his arm-holes being 
 probably galled by the cords wherewith he was let down. Nor did he
 throw the rags down to him, lest they should be lost in the mire, but 
 carefully let them down,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 Note, Those that are in distress should not only be relieved, but 
 relieved with compassion and marks of respect, all which shall be 
 placed to account and abound to a good account in the day of 
 recompence. See what a good use even old rotten rags may be put to, 
 which therefore should not be made waste of, any more than broken meat: 
 even in the king's house, and <I>under the treasury</I> too, these were 
 carefully preserved for the use of the poor or sick. Jeremiah is 
 brought up out of the dungeon, and is now where he was, <I>in the court 
 of the prison,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Perhaps Ebed-melech could have made interest with the king to get him 
 his discharge thence also, now that he had the king's ear; but he 
 though him safer and better provided for there than he would be any 
 where else. God can, when he pleases, make a prison to become a refuge 
 and hiding-place to his people in distress and danger.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet
 unto him into the third entry that <I>is</I> in the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide
 nothing from me.
 &nbsp; 15  Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare <I>it</I> unto
 thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee
 counsel, wilt thou not hearken unto me?
 &nbsp; 16  So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying,
 <I>As</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee
 to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men
 that seek thy life.
 &nbsp; 17  Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the
 God of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth
 unto the king of Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live, and
 this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and
 thine house:
 &nbsp; 18  But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's
 princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the
 Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not
 escape out of their hand.
 &nbsp; 19  And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the
 Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into
 their hand, and they mock me.
 &nbsp; 20  But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver <I>thee.</I> Obey, I
 beseech thee, the voice of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, which I speak unto thee: so
 it shall be well unto thee, and thy soul shall live.
 &nbsp; 21  But if thou refuse to go forth, this <I>is</I> the word that the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath shewed me:
 &nbsp; 22  And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of
 Judah's house <I>shall be</I> brought forth to the king of Babylon's
 princes, and those <I>women</I> shall say, Thy friends have set thee
 on, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the
 mire, <I>and</I> they are turned away back.
 &nbsp; 23  So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to
 the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but
 shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt
 cause this city to be burned with fire.
 &nbsp; 24  Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these
 words, and thou shalt not die.
 &nbsp; 25  But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and
 they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what
 thou hast said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will
 not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee:
 &nbsp; 26  Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication
 before the king, that he would not cause me to return to
 Jonathan's house, to die there.
 &nbsp; 27  Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and
 he told them according to all these words that the king had
 commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was
 not perceived.
 &nbsp; 28  So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day
 that Jerusalem was taken: and he was <I>there</I> when Jerusalem was
 taken.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the foregoing chapter we had the king in close conference with 
 Jeremiah, and here again, though 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 he had given him up into the hands of his enemies; such a struggle 
 there was in the breast of this unhappy prince between his convictions 
 and his corruptions. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The honour that Zedekiah did to the prophet. When he was newly 
 fetched out of the dungeon he sent for him to advise with him 
 privately. He met him in <I>the third entry,</I> or (as the margin 
 reads it) <I>the principal entry,</I> that <I>is in,</I> or leads 
 towards, or adjoins to, <I>the house of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 In appointing this place of interview with the prophet perhaps he 
 intended to show a respect and reverence for <I>the house of God,</I> 
 which was proper enough now that he was desiring to hear <I>the word of 
 God.</I> Zedekiah would ask <I>Jeremiah a thing;</I> it should rather 
 be rendered, <I>a word.</I> "I am here asking thee for <I>a word of 
 prediction,</I> of counsel, of comfort, <I>a word from the Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+37:17"><I>ch.</I> xxxvii. 17</A>.

 Whatever word thou has for me <I>hide it not from me;</I> let me know
 the worst." He had been told plainly what things would come to in the 
 foregoing chapter, but, like Balaam, he asks again, in hopes to get a 
 more pleasing answer, as if God, who is <I>in one mind,</I> were 
 altogether such a one as himself, who was in many minds.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The bargain that Jeremiah made with him before he would give him 
 his advice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 He would stipulate, 

 1. For his own safety. Zedekiah would have him deal faithfully with 
 him: "And if I do," says Jeremiah, "<I>wilt thou not put me to 
 death?</I> I am afraid <I>thou wilt</I>" (so some take it); "what else 
 can I expect when thou art led blindfold by the princes?" Not that 
 Jeremiah was backward to seal the doctrine he preached with his blood, 
 when he was called to do so; but, in doing our duty, we ought to use 
 all lawful means for our own preservation; even the apostles of Christ 
 did so. 

 2. He would answer for the success of his advice, being no less
 concerned for Zedekiah's welfare than for his own. He is willing to 
 give him wholesome advice, and does not upbraid him with his unkindness 
 in suffering him to be put into the dungeon, nor bid him go and consult 
 with his princes, whose judgments he had such a value for. Ministers 
 must with meekness instruct even those that oppose themselves, and 
 render good for evil. He is desirous that he should <I>hear counsel and 
 receive instruction: "Wilt thou not hearken unto me?</I> Surely thou 
 wilt; I am in hopes to find thee pliable at last, and now <I>in this 
 thy day</I> willing to know <I>the things that belong to thy 
 peace.</I>" Note, Then, and then only, there is hope of sinners, when 
 they are willing to hearken to good counsel. Some read it as spoken 
 despairingly: "<I>If I give thee counsel, thou wilt not hearken unto 
 me;</I> I have reason to fear thou wilt not, and then I might as well 
 keep my counsel to myself." Note, Ministers have little heart to speak 
 to those who have long and often turned a deaf ear to them. Now, as to 
 this latter concern of Jeremiah's, Zedekiah makes him no answer, will 
 not promise to hearken to his advice: though he desires to know what is 
 the mind of God, yet he will reserve himself a liberty, when he does 
 know it, to do as he things fit; as if it were the prerogative of a 
 prince not to have his ruin prevented by good counsel. But, as to the
 prophet's safety, he promises him, upon the word of a king, and 
 confirms his promise with an oath, that, whatever he should say to him, 
 no advantage should be taken against him for it: <I>I will neither put 
 thee to death nor deliver thee into the hands of those that will,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 This, he thought, was a mighty favour, and yet Nebuchadnezzar and 
 Belshazzar, when Daniel read their doom, not only protected him, but 
 preferred and rewarded him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:48,Jer+38:29">Dan. ii. 48; <I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 Zedekiah's oath on this occasion is solemn, and very observable: "<I>As 
 the Lord liveth, who made us this soul,</I> who gave me my life and 
 thee thine, I dare not take away thy life unjustly, knowing that then I 
 should forfeit my own to him that is the Lord of life." Note, God is 
 the Father of spirits; souls are his workmanship, and they are more 
 <I>fearfully and wonderfully made</I> than bodies are. The soul both of 
 the greatest prince and of the poorest prisoner is of God's making.
 <I>He fashioneth their hearts</I> alike easily. In all our appeals to
 God, and in all our dealings both with ourselves and others, we ought 
 to consider this, that <I>the living God made us these souls.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The good advice that Jeremiah gave him, with good reasons why he 
 should take it, not from any prudence or politics of his own, but in 
 the <I>name of the Lord, the God of hosts</I> and <I>God of Israel.</I> 
 Not as a statesman, but as a prophet, he advises him by all means to 
 surrender himself and his city <I>to the king of Babylon's princes: "Go 
 forth to them,</I> and make the best terms thou canst with them," 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 This was the advice he had given to the people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>,
 
 and before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+21:9"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 9</A>),

 to submit to divine judgments, and not think of contending with them.
 Note, In dealing with God, that which is good counsel to the meanest is 
 so to the greatest, for <I>there is no respect of persons</I> with him. 
 To persuade him to take this counsel, he sets before him good and evil, 
 life and death. 

 1. If he will tamely yield, he shall save his children from the sword 
 and Jerusalem from the flames. The white flag is yet hung out; if he 
 will be acknowledge God's justice, he shall experience his mercy: 
 <I>The city shall not be burnt,</I> and <I>thou shalt live and thy 
 house.</I> But, 

 2. If he will obstinately stand it out, it will be the ruin both of his
 house and Jerusalem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>);

 for when God judges he will overcome. This is the case of sinners with 
 God; let them humbly submit to his grace and government and they shall 
 live; let them <I>take hold on his strength, that they may make peace, 
 and they shall make peace;</I> but, if they harden their hearts against 
 his proposals, it will certainly be to their destruction: they must 
 either bend or break.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The objection which Zedekiah made against the prophet's advice,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Jeremiah spoke to him by prophecy, in the name of God, and therefore if 
 he had had a due regard to the divine authority, wisdom, and goodness, 
 as soon as he understood what the mind of God was he would immediately 
 have acquiesced in it and resolved to observe it, without disputing; 
 but, as if it had been the dictate only of Jeremiah's prudence, he 
 advances against it some prudential considerations of his own: but 
 human wisdom is folly when it contradicts the divine counsel. All he 
 suggests is, "<I>I am afraid,</I> not of the Chaldeans; their princes 
 are men of honour, but of the Jews, that have already gone over to the 
 Chaldeans; when they see <I>me</I> follow them, and who had so much 
 opposed their going, they will laugh at me, and say, <I>Hast thou also 
 become weak as water?</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:10">Isa. xiv. 10</A>.
 
 Now,

 1. It was not at all likely that he should be thus exposed and 
 ridiculed, that the Chaldeans should so far gratify the Jews, or 
 trample upon him, as to deliver him into their hands; nor that the 
 Jews, who were themselves captives, should be in such a gay humour as 
 to make a jest of the misery of their prince. Note, We often frighten
 ourselves from our duty by foolish, causeless, groundless, fears, that 
 are merely the creatures of our own fancy and imagination.

 2. If he should be taunted at a little by the Jews, could he not
 despise it and make light of it? What harm would it do him? Note,
 Those have very weak and fretful spirits indeed that cannot bear to be 
 laughed at for that which is both their duty and their interest.

 3. Though it had been really the greatest personal mischief that he
 could imagine it to be, yet he ought to have ventured it, in obedience 
 to God, and for the preservation of his family and city. He thought it 
 would be looked upon as a piece of cowardice to surrender; whereas it 
 would be really an instance of true courage cheerfully to bear a less 
 evil, the mocking of the Jews, for the avoiding of a greater, the ruin 
 of his family and kingdom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The pressing importunity with which Jeremiah followed the advice he 
 had given the king. He assures him that, if he would comply with the 
 will of God herein, the thing he feared should not come upon him 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>They shall not deliver thee up,</I> but treat thee as becomes thy 
 character. He begs of him, after all the foolish games he had played, 
 to manage wisely the last stake, and now at length to do well for 
 himself: <I>Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the Lord,</I> because it 
 is his voice, so it <I>shall be well unto thee.</I> But he tells him 
 what would be the consequence if he would not obey. 

 1. He himself would <I>fall into the hands of the Chaldeans,</I> as 
 implacable enemies, whom he might now make his friends by throwing 
 himself into their hands. If he must fall, he should contrive how to
 fall easily: "<I>Thou shalt not escape,</I> as thou hopest to do,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 2. He would himself be chargeable with the destruction of Jerusalem, 
 which he pretended a concern for the preservation of: <I>"Thou shalt 
 cause this city to be burnt with fire,</I> for by a little submission 
 and self-denial thou mightest have prevented it." Thus subjects often 
 suffer for the pride and wilfulness of their rulers, who should be 
 their protectors, but prove their destroyers. 

 3. Whereas he causelessly feared an unjust reproach for surrendering,
 he should certainly fall under a just reproach for standing it out, and 
 that from women too,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 The court ladies who were left when Jehoiakim and Jeconiah were carried 
 away will now at length fall into the hands of the enemy, and they 
 shall say, "<I>The men of thy peace,</I> whom thou didst consult with 
 and confide in, and who promised thee peace if thou wouldst be ruled by 
 them, have <I>set thee on,</I> have encouraged thee to be bold and 
 brace and hold out to the last extremity; and see what comes of it? 
 They, by prevailing upon thee, have <I>prevailed against thee,</I> and 
 thou findest those thy real enemies that would be thought thy only 
 friends. <I>Now thy feet are sunk in the mire,</I> thou art 
 embarrassed, and hast noway to help thyself; thy feet cannot get 
 forward, but are <I>turned away back.</I>" Thus will Zedekiah be 
 bantered by the women, when all his wives and children shall be made a 
 prey to the conquerors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Note, What we seek to avoid by sin will be justly brought upon us by 
 the righteousness of God. And those that decline the way of duty for 
 fear of reproach will certainly meet with much greater reproach in the 
 way of disobedience. <I>The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon 
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+10:24">Prov. x. 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The care which Zedekiah took to keep this conference private 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>Let no man know of these words.</I> he does not at all incline to 
 take God's counsel, nor so much as promise to consider of it; for so 
 obstinate has he been to the calls of God, and so wilful in the ways of 
 sin, that though he has good counsel given him he seems to be given up 
 to walk in his own counsels. He has nothing to object against 
 Jeremiah's advice, and yet he will not follow it. Many hear God's 
 words, but will not do them. 

 1. Jeremiah is charged to let no man know of what had passed between 
 the king and him. Zedekiah is concerned to keep it private, not so much 
 for Jeremiah's safety (for he knew the princes could do him no hurt 
 without his permission), but for his own reputation. Note, Many have 
 really a better affection to good men and good things than they are 
 willing to own. God's prophets are manifest in their consciences

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:11">2 Cor. v. 11</A>),

 but they care not for manifesting that to the world; they would rather
 do them a kindness than have it known that they do: such, it is to be 
 feared, <I>love the praise of men more than the praise of God.</I> 

 2. He is instructed what to say to the princes if they should examine
 him about it. He must tell them that he was petitioning the king not to 
 remand him back to <I>the house of Jonathan the scribe</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>),

 and he did tell them so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 and no doubt it was true: he would not let slip so fair an opportunity 
 of engaging the king's favour; so that this was no lie or equivocation, 
 but a part of the truth, which it was lawful for him to put them off 
 with when he was under no obligation at all to tell them the whole 
 truth. Note, Though we must be harmless as doves, so as never to tell a 
 wilful lie, yet we must be wise as serpents, so as not needlessly to 
 expose ourselves to danger by telling all we know.</P>
