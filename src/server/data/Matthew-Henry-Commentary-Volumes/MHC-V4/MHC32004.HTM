 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We read, with a great deal of pleasure, in the close of the foregoing 
 chapter, concerning the repentance of Nineveh; but in this chapter we 
 read, with a great deal of uneasiness, concerning the sin of Jonah; 
 and, as there is joy in heaven and earth for the conversion of sinners, 
 so there is grief for the follies and infirmities of saints. In all the 
 book of God we scarcely find a "servant of the Lord" (and such a one we 
 are sure Jonah was, for the scripture calls him so) so very much out of 
 temper as he is here, so very peevish and provoking to God himself. In 
 the first chapter we had him fleeing from the face of God; but here we 
 have him, in effect, flying in the face of God; and, which is more 
 grieving to us, there we had an account of his repentance and return to 
 God; but here, though no doubt he did repent, yet, as in Solomon's 
 case, no account is left us of his recovering himself; but, while we 
 read with wonder of his perverseness, we read with no less wonder of 
 God's tenderness towards him, by which it appeared that he had not cast 
 him off. Here is, 

 I. Jonah's repining at God's mercy to Nineveh, and the fret he was in
 about it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+4:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.
 
 II. The gentle reproof God gave him for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+4:4">ver. 4</A>.

 III. Jonah's discontent at the withering of the gourd, and his
 justifying himself in that discontent, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+4:5-9">ver. 5-9</A>.

 IV. God's improving it for his conviction, that he ought not to be
 angry at the sparing of Nineveh, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+4:10-11">ver. 10-11</A>.

 Man's badness and God's goodness serve here for a foil to each other, 
 that the former may appear the more exceedingly sinful and the latter 
 the more exceedingly gracious.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.
 &nbsp; 2 And he prayed unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and said, I pray thee, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 <I>was</I> not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore
 I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou <I>art</I> a
 gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness,
 and repentest thee of the evil.
 &nbsp; 3 Therefore now, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, take, I beseech thee, my life from me;
 for <I>it is</I> better for me to die than to live.
 &nbsp; 4 Then said the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Doest thou well to be angry?

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 I. How unjustly Jonah quarrelled with God for his mercy to Nineveh, 
 upon their repentance. This gives us occasion to suspect that Jonah had 
 only delivered the message of wrath against the Ninevites, and had not 
 at all assisted or encouraged them in their repentance, as one would 
 think he should have done; for when they did repent, and found 
 mercy,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Jonah grudged them the mercy they found 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+4:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>It displeased Jonah exceedingly;</I> and (would you think it?) <I>he 
 was very angry,</I> was in a great heat about it. It was very wrong, 
 
 (1.) That he had so little government of himself as to be displeased
 and very angry; he had <I>no rule over his own spirit,</I> and 
 therefore, as a city broken down, lay exposed to temptations and 
 snares. 

 (2.) That he had so little reverence of God as to be displeased and 
 angry at what he did, as David was when the Lord had made a breach upon 
 Uzza; whatever pleases God should please us, and, though we cannot 
 account for it, yet we must acquiesce in it.

 (3.) That he had so little affection for men as to be displeased and 
 very angry at the conversion of the Ninevites and their reception into 
 the divine favour. This was the sin of the scribes and Pharisees, who 
 murmured at our Saviour because he entertained publicans and sinners; 
 but <I>is our eye evil because his is good?</I> But why was Jonah so 
 uneasy at it, that the Ninevites repented and were spared? It cannot be 
 expected that we should give any good reason for a thing so very absurd 
 and unreasonable; no, nor any thing that has the face or colour of a 
 reason; but we may conjecture what the provocation was. Hot spirits are 
 usually high spirits. <I>Only by pride comes contention</I> both with 
 God and man. It was a point of honour that Jonah stood upon and that 
 made him angry.

 [1.] He was jealous for the honour of his country; the repentance and 
 reformation of Nineveh shamed the obstinacy of Israel that repented 
 not, but <I>hated to be reformed;</I> and the favour God had shown to 
 these Gentiles, upon their repentance, was an ill omen to the Jewish 
 nation, as if they should be (as at length they were) rejected and cast 
 out of the church and the Gentiles substituted in their room. When it 
 was intimated to St. Peter himself that he should make no difference 
 between Jews and Gentiles he startled at the thing, and said, <I>Not 
 so, Lord;</I> no marvel then that Jonah looked upon it with regret that 
 Nineveh should become a favourite. Jonah herein had <I>a zeal for 
 God</I> as the God of Israel in a particular manner, <I>but not 
 according to knowledge.</I> Note, Many are displeased with God under 
 pretence of concern for his glory. 

 [2.] He was jealous for his own honour, fearing lest, if Nineveh was 
 not destroyed within forty days, he should be accounted a false 
 prophet, and stigmatized accordingly; whereas he needed not be under 
 any discontent about that, for in the threatening of ruin it was 
 implied that, for the preventing of it, they should repent, and, if 
 they did, it should be prevented. And no one will complain of being 
 deceived by him that is better than his word; and he would rather gain 
 honour among them, by being instrumental to save them, than fall under 
 any disgrace. But melancholy men (and such a one Jonah seems to have 
 been) are apt to make themselves uneasy by fancying evils to themselves 
 that are not, nor are ever likely to be. Most of our frets, as well as
 our frights, are owing to the power of imagination; and those are to be 
 pitied as perfect bond-slaves that are under the power of such a 
 tyrant.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He quarreled with God about it. When his heart was hot within him, 
 he <I>spoke unadvisedly with his lips;</I> and here he tells us what he 
 said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+4:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>):

 He <I>prayed unto the Lord,</I> but it is a very awkward prayer, not 
 like that which he prayed in the fish's belly; for affliction teaches 
 us to pray submissively, which Jonah now forgot to do. Being in 
 discontent, he applied to the duty of prayer, as he used to do in his 
 troubles, but his corruptions got head of his graces, and, when he 
 should have been praying for benefit by the mercy of God himself, he 
 was complaining of the benefit others had by that mercy. Nothing could
 be spoken more unbecomingly. 

 (1.) He now begins to justify himself in fleeing <I>from the presence
 of the Lord,</I> when he was first ordered to go to Nineveh, for which 
 he had before, with good reason, condemned himself: "<I>Lord,</I>" said 
 he, "<I>was not this my saying when I was in my own country?</I> Did I 
 not foresee that if I went to preach to Nineveh they would repent, and 
 thou wouldst forgive them, and then thy word would be reflected upon 
 and reproached as yea and nay?" What a strange sort of man was Jonah, 
 to dread the success of his ministry! Many have been tempted to
 withdraw from their work because they had despaired of doing good by 
 it, but Jonah declined preaching because he was afraid of doing good by 
 it; and still he persists in the same corrupt notion, for, it seems, 
 the whale's belly itself could not cure him of it. It was his saying 
 when he was <I>in his own country,</I> but it was a bad saying; yet 
 here he stands to it, and, very unlike the other prophets, <I>desires 
 the woeful day</I> which he had foretold and grieves because it does 
 not come. Even Christ's disciples <I>know not what manner of spirit 
 they are of;</I> those did not who wished for fire from heaven upon the 
 city that did not receive them, much less did Jonah, who wished for 
 fire from heaven upon the city that did receive him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:55">Luke ix. 55</A>.

 Jonah thinks he has reason to complain of that, when it is done, which
 he was before afraid of; so hard is it to get a root of bitterness 
 plucked out of the mind, when once it is fastened there. And why did 
 Jonah expect that God would spare Nineveh? <I>Because I knew that thou 
 was a gracious God,</I> indulgent and easily pleased, that <I>thou wast 
 slow to anger and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the 
 evil.</I> All this is very true; and Jonah could not but know it by 
 God's proclamation of his name and the experiences of all ages; but it 
 is strange and very unaccountable that that which all the saints had 
 made the matter of their joy and praise Jonah should make the matter of 
 reflection upon God, as if that were an imperfection of the divine 
 nature which is indeed the greatest glory of it--that God <I>is 
 gracious and merciful.</I> The servant that said, <I>I knew thee to be 
 a hard man,</I> said that which was false, and yet, had it been true, 
 it was not the proper matter of a complaint; but Jonah, though he says 
 what is true, yet, speaking it by way of reproach, speaks very 
 absurdly. Those have a spirit of contention and contradiction indeed 
 that can find in their hearts to quarrel with the goodness of God, and 
 his sparing pardoning mercy, to which we all owe it that we are out of 
 hell. This is making that to be to us <I>a savour of death unto 
 death</I> which ought to be <I>a savour of life unto life.</I>

 (2.) In a passion, he wishes for death

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 a strange expression of his causeless passion! "<I>Now, O Lord! take,
 I beseech thee, my life from me.</I> If Nineveh must live, let me die, 
 rather than see thy word and mine disproved, rather than see the glory 
 of Israel transferred to the Gentiles," as if there were not grace 
 enough in God both for Jews and Gentiles, or as if his countrymen were 
 the further off from mercy for the Ninevites being taken into favour. 
 When the prophet Elijah had laboured in vain, he wished he might die, 
 and it was his infirmity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:4">1 Kings xix. 4</A>.

 But Jonah labours to good purpose, saves a great city from ruin, and
 yet wishes he may die, as if, having done much good, he were afraid of 
 living to do more; he <I>sees of the travail of his soul, and is 
 dissatisfied.</I> What a perverse spirit is mingled with every word he 
 says! When Jonah was brought alive out of the whale's belly, he thought 
 life a very valuable mercy, and was thankful to that God who brought up 
 <I>his life from corruption,</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+2:6"><I>ch.</I> ii. 6</A>),

 and a great blessing his life had been to Nineveh; yet now, for that
 very reason, it became a burden to himself and he begs to be eased of 
 it, pleading, <I>It is better for me to die than to live.</I> Such a 
 word as this may be the language of grace, as it was in Paul, who 
 desired to depart and be with Christ, <I>which is far better;</I> but 
 here it was the language of folly, and passion, and strong corruption; 
 and so much the worse, 

 [1.] Jonah being now in the midst of his usefulness, and therefore fit 
 to live. He was one whose ministry God wonderfully owned and prospered.
 The conversion of Nineveh might give him hopes of being instrumental to 
 convert the whole kingdom of Assyria; it was therefore very absurd for 
 him to wish he might die when he had a prospect of living to so good a 
 purpose and could be so ill spared. 

 [2.] Jonah being now so much out of temper and therefore unfit to die. 
 How durst he think of dying, and going to appear before God's 
 judgment-seat, when he was actually quarrelling with him? Was this a 
 frame of spirit proper for a man to go out of the world in? But those 
 who passionately desire death commonly have least reason to do it, as 
 being very much unprepared for it. Our business is to get ready to die 
 by doing the work of life, and then to refer ourselves to God to take 
 away our life when and how he pleases.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. See how justly God reproved Jonah for this heat that he was in 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 The Lord said, <I>Doest thou well to be angry? Is doing well a 
 displeasure to thee?</I> so some read it. What! dost thou repent of thy 
 good deeds? God might justly have rejected him for this impious heat 
 which he was in, might justly have taken him at his word, and have 
 struck him dead when he wished to die; but he vouchsafes to reason with 
 him for his conviction and to bring him to a better temper, as the 
 father of the prodigal reasoned with his elder son, when, as Jonah 
 here, he murmured at the remission and reception of his brother.
 <I>Doest thou well to be angry?</I> See how mildly the great God speaks 
 to this foolish man, to teach us to restore those that have fallen with 
 a <I>spirit of meekness,</I> and with <I>soft answers</I> to <I>turn 
 away wrath.</I> God appeals to himself and to his own conscience: 
 "<I>Doest thou well?</I> Thou knowest thou does not." We should often 
 put this question to ourselves, Is it well to say thus, to do thus? Can 
 I justify it? Must I not unsay it and undo it again by repentance, or 
 be undone forever? Ask, 

 1. Do I well to be angry? When passion is up, let it meet with this
 check, "Do I well to be so soon angry, so often angry, so long angry, 
 to put myself into such a heat, and to give others such ill language in 
 my anger? Is this well, that I suffer these headstrong passions to get 
 dominion over me?" 

 2. "Do I well to be angry at the mercy of God to repenting sinners?" 
 That was Jonah's crime. Do we do well to be angry at that which is so
 much for the glory of God and the advancement of his kingdom among 
 men--to be angry at that which angels rejoice in and for which abundant 
 thanksgivings will be rendered to God? We do ill to be angry at that 
 grace which we ourselves need and are undone without; if room were not 
 left for repentance, and hope given of pardon upon repentance, what 
 would become of us? Let the conversion of sinners, which is the joy of 
 heaven, be our joy, and never our grief.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5 So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of
 the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the
 shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.
 &nbsp; 6 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God prepared a gourd, and made <I>it</I> to come up
 over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver
 him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.
 &nbsp; 7 But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day,
 and it smote the gourd that it withered.
 &nbsp; 8 And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God
 prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of
 Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said,
 <I>It is</I> better for me to die than to live.
 &nbsp; 9 And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the
 gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, <I>even</I> unto death.
 &nbsp; 10 Then said the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the
 which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came
 up in a night, and perished in a night:
 &nbsp; 11 And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are
 more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between
 their right hand and their left hand; and <I>also</I> much cattle?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Jonah persists here in his discontent; for the <I>beginning of 
 strife</I> both with God and man <I>is as the letting forth of 
 waters,</I> the breach grows wider and wider, and, when passion gets 
 head, bad is made worse; it should therefore be silenced and suppressed 
 at first. We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Jonah's sullen expectation of the fate of Nineveh. We may suppose 
 that the Ninevites, giving credit to the message he brought, were ready 
 to give entertainment to the messenger that brought it, and to show him 
 respect, that they would have made him welcome to the best of their 
 houses and tables. But Jonah was out of humour, would not accept their 
 kindness, nor behave towards them with common civility, which one might 
 have feared would have prejudiced them against him and his word; but 
 when there is not only the <I>treasure</I> put into <I>earthen 
 vessels,</I> but the trust lodged with men <I>subject to like passions 
 as we are,</I> and yet the point gained, it must be owned that the 
 <I>excellency of the power</I> appears so much the more to be of God 
 <I>and not of man.</I> Jonah retires, <I>goes out of the city,</I> sits 
 alone, and keeps silence, because he sees the Ninevites repent and 
 reform, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+4:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Perhaps he told those about him that he went out of the city for fear 
 of perishing in the ruins of it; but he went to <I>see what would 
 become of the city,</I> as Abraham went up to see what would become of 
 Sodom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:27">Gen. xix. 27</A>.

 The forty days were now expiring, or had expired, and Jonah hoped that,
 if Nineveh was not overthrown, yet some judgement or other would come 
 upon it, sufficient to save his credit; however, it was with great 
 uneasiness that he waited the issue. He would not sojourn in a house, 
 expecting it would fall upon his head, but he <I>made himself a 
 booth</I> of the boughs of trees, and sat in that, though there he 
 would lie exposed to wind and weather. Note, It is common for those 
 that have fretful uneasy spirits industriously to create inconveniences 
 themselves, that, resolving to complain, they may still have something 
 to complain of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God's gracious provision for his shelter and refreshment when he 
 thus foolishly afflicted himself and was still adding yet more and more 
 to his own affliction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Jonah was sitting in his booth, fretting at the cold of the night and 
 the heat of the day, which were both grievous to him, and God might 
 have said, It is his own choice, his own doing, a house of his own 
 building, let him make the best of it; but he looked on him with 
 compassion, as the tender mother does on the froward child, and 
 relieved him against the grievances which he by his own wilfulness 
 created to himself. He <I>prepared a gourd,</I> a plant with broad 
 leaves, and full of them, that suddenly grew up, and covered his hut or 
 booth, so as to keep off much of the injury of the cold and heat. It 
 was <I>a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief,</I> that, 
 being refreshed in body, he might the better guard against the 
 uneasiness of his mind, which outward crosses and troubles are often 
 the occasion and increase of. See how tender God is of his people in 
 their afflictions, yea, though they are foolish and froward, nor is he 
 <I>extreme to mark what they do amiss.</I> God had before <I>prepared a 
 great fish</I> to secure Jonah from the injuries of the water, and here 
 a great gourd to secure him from the injuries of the air; for he is the 
 protector of his people against evils of every kind, has the command of 
 plants as well as animals, and can soon prepare them, to make them 
 serve his purposes, can make their growth sudden, which, in a course of 
 nature, is slow and gradual. A gourd, one would think, was but a 
 slender fortification at the best, yet Jonah <I>was exceedingly glad of 
 the gourd;</I> for, 

 1. It was really at that time a great comfort to him. A thing in itself
 small and inconsiderable, yet, coming seasonably, may be to us a very 
 valuable blessing. A gourd in the right place may do us more service 
 than a cedar. The least creatures may be great plagues (as flies and 
 lice were to Pharaoh) or great comforts (as the gourd to Jonah), 
 according as God is pleased to make them. 

 2. He being now much under the power of imagination took a greater 
 complacency in it than there was cause for. He was exceedingly glad of 
 it, was proud of it, and triumphed in it. Note, Persons of strong 
 passions, as they are apt to be cast down with a trifle that crosses 
 them, so they are apt to be lifted up with a trifle that pleases them.
 A small toy will serve sometimes to pacify a cross child, as the gourd 
 did Jonah. But wisdom and grace would teach us both to <I>weep</I> for 
 our troubles <I>as though we wept not,</I> and to <I>rejoice</I> in our 
 comforts <I>as though we rejoiced not.</I> Creature-comforts we ought 
 to enjoy and be thankful for, but we need not be exceedingly glad of 
 them; it is God only that must be our <I>exceeding joy,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+43:4">
 Ps. xliii. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The sudden loss of this provision which God had made for his 
 refreshment, and the return of his trouble, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+4:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 God that had provided comfort for him provided also an affliction for 
 him in that very thing which was his comfort; the affliction did not 
 come by chance, but by divine direction and appointment. 

 1. God <I>prepared a worm</I> to destroy the gourd. He that gave took
 away, and Jonah ought to have <I>blessed his name</I> in both; but 
 because, when he took the comfort of the gourd, he did not give God the 
 praise of it, God deprived him of the benefit of it, and justly. See 
 what all our creature-comforts are, and what we may expect them to be; 
 they are gourds, have their root in the earth, are but a thin and 
 slender defence compared with the <I>rock of ages;</I> they are 
 withering things; they perish in the using, and we are soon deprived of 
 the comfort of them. The gourd withered the next day after it sprang 
 up; our comforts <I>come forth like flowers and are soon cut down.</I> 
 When we please ourselves most with them, and promise ourselves most 
 from them, we are disappointed. A little thing withers them; a small 
 worm at the root destroys a large gourd. Something unseen and 
 undiscerned does it. Our gourds wither, and we know not what to 
 attribute it to. And perhaps those wither first that we have been more 
 exceedingly glad of; that proves least safe that is most dear. God did 
 not send an angel to pluck up Jonah's gourd, but sent a worm to smite 
 it; there it grew still, but it stood him in no stead. Perhaps our 
 creature-comforts are continued to us, but they are embittered; the 
 creature is continued, but the comfort is gone; and the remains, or 
 ruins of it rather, do but upbraid us with our folly in being 
 exceedingly glad of it. 

 2. He <I>prepared a wind</I> to make Jonah feel the want of the gourd,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 It was a <I>vehement east wind,</I> which drove the heat of the rising 
 sun violently upon the head of Jonah. This wind was not as a fan to 
 abate the heat, but as bellows to make it more intense. Thus poor Jonah 
 lay open to sun and wind.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The further fret that this put Jonah into 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 He <I>fainted, and wished in himself that he might die.</I> "If the 
 gourd be killed, if the gourd be dead, kill me too, <I>let me die with 
 the gourd.</I>" Foolish man, that thinks his life bound up in the life 
 of a weed! Note, It is just that those who love to complain should 
 never be left without something to complain of, that their folly may be 
 manifested and corrected, and, if possible, cured. And see here how the 
 passions that run into an extreme one way commonly run into an extreme 
 the other way. Jonah, who was in transports of joy when the gourd
 flourished, is in pangs of grief when the gourd has withered. 
 Inordinate affection lays a foundation for inordinate affliction; what 
 we are over-fond of when we have it we are apt to over-grieve for when 
 we lose it, and we may see our folly in both.</P>

 V. The rebuke God gave him for this; he again reasoned with him: 
 <I>Dost thou well to be angry for the gourd?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Note, The withering of a gourd is a thing which it does not become us 
 to be angry at. When afflicting providences deprive us of our 
 relations, possessions, and enjoyments, we must bear it patiently, must 
 not be angry at God, must not be angry <I>for the gourd.</I> It is 
 comparatively but a small loss, the loss of a shadow; that is the most 
 we can make of it. It was a gourd, a withering thing; we could expect 
 no other than that it should wither. Our being angry for the withering 
 of it will not recover it; we ourselves shall shortly wither like it.
 If one gourd be withered, another gourd may spring up in the room of 
 it; but that which should especially silence our discontent is that 
 though our gourd be gone our God is not gone, and there is enough in 
 him to make up all our losses.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Let us therefore own that we do ill, that we do very ill, to be angry 
 for the gourd; and let us under such events quiet ourselves <I>as a 
 child that is weaned from his mother.</I></P>

 VI. His justification of his passion and discontent; and it is very 
 strange, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 He said, <I>I do well to be angry, even unto death.</I> It is bad to 
 speak amiss, yet if it be in haste, if what is said amiss be speedily 
 recalled and unsaid again, it is the more excusable; but to speak amiss 
 and stand to it is bad indeed. So Jonah did here, though God himself 
 rebuked him, and by appealing to his conscience expected he would 
 rebuke himself. See what brutish things ungoverned passions are, and 
 how much it is our interest, and ought to be our endeavour, to chain up 
 these roaring lions and ranging bears. <I>Sin</I> and <I>death</I> are 
 two very dreadful things, yet Jonah, in his heat, makes light of them 
 both. 

 1. He has so little regard for God as to fly in the face of his
 authority, and to say that he did well in that which God said was ill 
 done. Passion often over-rules conscience, and forces it, when it is 
 appealed to, to give a false judgment, as Jonah here did. 

 2. He has so little regard to himself as to abandon his own life, and 
 to think it no harm to indulge his passion even to death, to kill 
 himself with fretting. We read of <I>wrath</I> that <I>kills the 
 foolish man,</I> and <I>envy</I> that <I>slays the silly one</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:2">Job v. 2</A>),

 and foolish silly ones indeed those are that cut their own throats with
 their own passions, that fret themselves into consumptions and other 
 weaknesses, and put themselves into fevers with their own intemperate 
 heats.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The improvement of it against him for his conviction that he did 
 ill to murmur at the sparing of Nineveh. Out of his own mouth God will 
 judge him; and we have reason to think it overcame him; for he made no 
 reply, but, we hope, returned to his right mind and recovered his 
 temper, though he could not keep it, and all was well. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Let us see how God argued with him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+4:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>):

 "<I>Thou hast had pity on the gourd,</I> hast <I>spared</I> it" (so the 
 word is), "didst what thou couldst, and wouldst have done more, to keep 
 it alive, and saidst, <I>What a pity it is</I> that this gourd should 
 ever wither! and <I>should not I then spare Nineveh?</I> Should not I
 have as much compassion upon that as thou hadst upon the gourd, and 
 forbid the earthquake which would ruin that, as thou wouldst have 
 forbidden the worm that smote the gourd? Consider," 

 (1.) "The gourd thou hadst pity on was but one; but the inhabitants of
 Nineveh, whom I have pity on, are numerous." It is a great city and 
 very populous, as appears by the number of the infants, suppose from 
 two years old and under; there are 120,000 such in Nineveh, that have 
 not come to so much use of understanding as to know <I>their right hand 
 from their left,</I> for they are yet but babes. These are taken notice 
 of because the age of infants is commonly looked upon as the age of 
 innocence. So many there were in Nineveh that had not been guilty of 
 any actual transgression, and consequently had not themselves 
 contributed to the common guilt, and yet, if Nineveh had been 
 overthrown, they would all have been involved in the common calamity; 
 "and <I>shall not I spare</I> Nineveh then, with an eye to them?" God 
 has a tender regard to little children, and is ready to pity and 
 succour them, nay, here a whole city is spared for their sakes, which 
 may encourage parents to present their children to God by faith and 
 prayer, that though they are not capable of doing him any service (for 
 they cannot discern <I>between their right hand and their left,</I> 
 between good and evil, sin and duty), yet they are capable of 
 participating in his favours and of obtaining salvation. The great 
 Saviour discovered a particular kindness for the children that were 
 brought to him, when he <I>took them up in his arms, put his hands upon 
 them, and blessed them.</I> Nay, God took notice of the abundance of 
 cattle too that were in Nineveh, which he had more reason to pity and 
 spare than Jonah had to pity and to spare the gourd, inasmuch as the 
 animal life is more excellent than the vegetable.

 (2.) The gourd which Jonah was concerned for was none of his own; it
 was that for which he did not labour and which he made not to grow; but 
 the persons in Nineveh whom God had compassion on were all the <I>work 
 of his own hands,</I> whose being he was the author of, whose lives he 
 was the preserver of, whom he planted and made to grow; he made them, 
 and his they were, and therefore he had much more reason to have 
 compassion on them, for he cannot <I>despise the work of his own 
 hands</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+10:3">Job x. 3</A>);

 and thus Job there argues with him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+4:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>),

 <I>Thy hands have made me, and fashioned me,</I> have <I>made me as the
 clay;</I> and <I>wilt thou destroy</I> me, <I>wilt thou bring me into 
 dust again?</I> And thus he here argues with himself. 

 (3.) The gourd which Jonah had pity on was of a sudden growth, and 
 therefore of less value; it <I>came up in a night, it was the son of a 
 night</I> (so the word is); but Nineveh is an ancient city, of many 
 ages standing, and therefore cannot be so easily given up; "the persons 
 I spare have been many years in growing up, not so soon reared as the 
 gourd; and shall not I then have pity on those that have been so many 
 years the care of my providence, so many years my tenants?"

 (4.) The gourd which Jonah had pity on <I>perished in a night;</I> it 
 withered, and there was an end of it. But the precious souls in
 Nineveh that God had pity on are not so short-lived; they are immortal, 
 and therefore to be carefully and tenderly considered. One soul is of 
 more value than the whole world, and the gain of the world will not 
 countervail the loss of it; surely then one soul is of more value than 
 many gourds, of more value than many sparrows; so God accounts, and so 
 should we, and therefore have a greater concern for the children of men 
 than for any of the inferior creatures, and for our own and others' 
 precious souls than for any of the riches and enjoyments of this 
 world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. From all this we may learn, 

 (1.) That though God may suffer his people to fall into sin, yet he 
 will not suffer them to lie still in it, but will take a course 
 effectually to show them their error, and to bring them to themselves 
 and to their right mind again. We have reason to hope that Jonah, after 
 this, was well reconciled to the sparing of Nineveh, and was as well 
 pleased with it as ever he had been displeased.

 (2.) That God will justify himself in the methods of his grace towards 
 repenting returning sinners as well as in the course his justice takes 
 with those that persist in their rebellion; though there be those that 
 murmur at the mercy of God, because they do not understand it (for his 
 thoughts and ways therein are as far above ours as heaven above the 
 earth), yet he will make it evident that therein he acts like himself, 
 and will be <I>justified when he speaks.</I> See what pains he takes 
 with Jonah to convince him that it is very fit that Nineveh should be 
 spared. Jonah had said, <I>I do well to be angry,</I> but he could not 
 prove it. God says and proves it, <I>I do well to be merciful;</I> and 
 it is a great encouragement to poor sinners to hope that they shall 
 find mercy with him, that he is so ready to justify himself in showing 
 mercy and to triumph in those whom he makes the monuments of it, 
 against those whose eye is evil because his is good. Such murmurers
 shall be made to understand this doctrine, that, how narrow soever 
 their souls, their principles, are, and how willing soever they are to 
 engross divine grace to themselves and those of their own way, there is 
 one <I>Lord over all, that is rich in mercy to all that call upon 
 him,</I> and in <I>every nation,</I> in Nineveh as well as in Israel, 
 <I>he that fears God and works righteousness is accepted of him;</I> he 
 that repents, and turns from his evil way, shall find mercy with 
 him.</P>
