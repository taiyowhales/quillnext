 This chapter continues and concludes the describing and measuring of 
 this mystical temple, which it is very hard to understand the 
 particular architecture of, and yet more hard to comprehend the 
 mystical meaning of. Here is, 

 I. A description of the chambers that were about the courts, their
 situation and structure 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+42:1-13">ver. 1-13</A>),

 and the uses for which they were designed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+42:13,14">ver. 13, 14</A>.

 II. A survey of the whole compass of ground which was taken up with the
 house, and the courts belonging to it,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward
 the north: and he brought me into the chamber that <I>was</I> over
 against the separate place, and which <I>was</I> before the building
 toward the north.
 &nbsp; 2  Before the length of a hundred cubits <I>was</I> the north door,
 and the breadth <I>was</I> fifty cubits.
 &nbsp; 3  Over against the twenty <I>cubits</I> which <I>were</I> for the inner
 court, and over against the pavement which <I>was</I> for the utter
 court, <I>was</I> gallery against gallery in three <I>stories.</I>
 &nbsp; 4  And before the chambers <I>was</I> a walk of ten cubits breadth
 inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.
 &nbsp; 5  Now the upper chambers <I>were</I> shorter: for the galleries were
 higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the
 building.
 &nbsp; 6  For they <I>were</I> in three <I>stories,</I> but had not pillars as
 the pillars of the courts: therefore <I>the building</I> was
 straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the
 ground.
 &nbsp; 7  And the wall that <I>was</I> without over against the chambers,
 toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the
 length thereof <I>was</I> fifty cubits.
 &nbsp; 8  For the length of the chambers that <I>were</I> in the utter court
 <I>was</I> fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple <I>were</I> a hundred
 cubits.
 &nbsp; 9  And from under these chambers <I>was</I> the entry on the east
 side, as one goeth into them from the utter court.
 &nbsp; 10  The chambers <I>were</I> in the thickness of the wall of the
 court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over
 against the building.
 &nbsp; 11  And the way before them <I>was</I> like the appearance of the
 chambers which <I>were</I> toward the north, as long as they, <I>and</I> as
 broad as they: and all their goings out <I>were</I> both according to
 their fashions, and according to their doors.
 &nbsp; 12  And according to the doors of the chambers that <I>were</I>
 toward the south <I>was</I> a door in the head of the way, <I>even</I> the
 way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth
 into them.
 &nbsp; 13  Then said he unto me, The north chambers <I>and</I> the south
 chambers, which <I>are</I> before the separate place, they <I>be</I> holy
 chambers, where the priests that approach unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall eat
 the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things,
 and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass
 offering; for the place <I>is</I> holy.
 &nbsp; 14  When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out
 of the holy <I>place</I> into the utter court, but there they shall
 lay their garments wherein they minister; for they <I>are</I> holy;
 and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to <I>those
 things</I> which <I>are</I> for the people.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet has taken a very exact view of the temple and the buildings 
 belonging to it, and is now brought again into the outer court, to 
 observe the chambers that were in that square.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is a description of these chambers, which (as that which went 
 before) seems to us very perplexed and intricate, through our 
 unacquaintedness with the Hebrew language and the rules of architecture 
 at that time. We shall only observe, in general, 

 1. That about the temple, which was the place of public worship, there
 were private chambers, to teach us that our attendance upon God in 
 solemn ordinances will not excuse us from the duties of the closet. We 
 must not only worship in the courts of God's house, but must, both 
 before and after our attendance there, enter into our chambers, enter 
 into our closets, and read and meditate, and <I>pray to our Father in 
 secret;</I> and a great deal of comfort the people of God have found in 
 their communion with God in solitude. 

 2. That these chambers were many; there were <I>three stories</I> of 
 them, and, though the higher stories were not so large as the lower, 
 yet they served as well for retirement,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+42:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.
 
 There were many, that there might be conveniences for all such devout 
 people as Anna the prophetess, who <I>departed not from the temple 
 night or day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:37">Luke ii. 37</A>.

 <I>In my Father's house are many mansions.</I> In his house on earth
 there are so; multitudes by faith have taken lodgings in his sanctuary, 
 and <I>yet there is room.</I>

 3. That these chambers, though they were private, yet were near the
 temple, within view of it, within reach of it, to teach us to prefer 
 public worship before private (<I>the Lord loves the gates of Zion more 
 than all the dwellings of Jacob,</I> and so must we), and to refer our 
 private worship to the public. Our religious performances in our 
 chambers must be to prepare us for the exercises of devotion in public, 
 and to further us in our improvement of them, as our opportunities are.

 4. That before these chambers there were <I>walks of five yards
 broad</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+42:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 in which those that had lodgings in these chambers might meet for 
 conversation, might walk and talk together for their mutual 
 edification, might communicate their knowledge and experiences. For we
 are not to spend all our time between the church and the chamber, 
 though a great deal of time may be spent to very good purpose in both. 
 But man is made for society, and Christians for the communion of 
 saints; and the duties of that communion we must make conscience of, 
 and the privileges and pleasures of that communion we must take the 
 comfort of. It is promised to Joshua, who was high priest in the second 
 temple, that God will <I>give him places to walk in among those that 
 stand by,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+3:7">Zech. iii. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is the use of these chambers appointed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+42:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 1. They were <I>for the priests</I> that approach unto the Lord, that 
 they may be always near their business and may not be non-residents.
 <I>Therefore</I> they are called <I>holy chambers,</I> because they 
 were for use of those that ministered in holy things during their 
 ministration. Those that have public work to do for God and the souls 
 of men have need to be much in private, to fit themselves for it.
 Ministers should spend much time in their chambers, in reading, 
 meditation, and prayer, that their <I>profiting may appear;</I> and 
 they ought to be provided with conveniences for this purpose. 

 2. There the priests were to deposit <I>the most holy things,</I> those 
 parts of the offerings which fell to their share; and there they were 
 to <I>eat them,</I> they and their families, in a religious manner, for 
 <I>the place is holy;</I> and thus they must make a difference between 
 those feasts upon the sacrifice and other meals. 

 3. There (among other uses) they were to lay their vestments, which God
 had appointed them to wear when they ministered at the altar, their
 linen ephods, coats, girdles, and bonnets. We read of the providing of
 priests garments after their return out of captivity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+7:70,72">Neh. vii. 70, 72</A>.
 
 When they had ended their service at the altar they must lay by those
 garments, to signify that the use of them should continue only during 
 that dispensation; but they must <I>put on other garments,</I> such as 
 other people wear, when they <I>approached to those things which were 
 for the people,</I> that is, to do that part of their service which 
 related to the people, to teach them the law and to answer their 
 enquiries. Their holy garments must be <I>laid up,</I> that they may be 
 kept clean and decent for the credit of their service.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he
 brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect <I>is</I> toward the
 east, and measured it round about.
 &nbsp; 16  He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five
 hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.
 &nbsp; 17  He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the
 measuring reed round about.
 &nbsp; 18  He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the
 measuring reed.
 &nbsp; 19  He turned about to the west side, <I>and</I> measured five
 hundred reeds with the measuring reed.
 &nbsp; 20  He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about,
 five hundred <I>reeds</I> long, and five hundred broad, to make a
 separation between the sanctuary and the profane place.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have attended the measuring of this mystical temple and are now to 
 see how far the holy ground on which we tread extends; and that also is 
 here measured, and found to take in a great compass. Observe, 

 1. What the dimensions of it were. It extended each way 500 reeds

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+42:16-19"><I>v.</I> 16-19</A>),
 
 each reed above three yards and a half, so that it reached every way 
 about an English measured mile, which, the ground lying square, was 
 above four miles round. Thus large were the suburbs (as I may call 
 them) of this mystical temple, signifying the great extent of the
 church in gospel-times, when all nations should be discipled and the 
 kingdoms of the world made Christ's kingdoms. Room should be made in 
 God's courts for the numerous forces of the Gentiles that shall flow 
 into them, as was foretold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:18,60:4">Isa. xlix. 18; lx. 4</A>.

 It is in part fulfilled already in the accession of the Gentiles to the
 church; and we trust it shall have a more full accomplishment when the 
 <I>fulness of the Gentiles shall come in</I> and <I>all Israel shall be 
 saved.</I>

 2. Why the dimensions of it were made thus large. It was to <I>make a 
 separation,</I> by putting a very large distance <I>between the 
 sanctuary</I> and <I>the profane place;</I> and <I>therefore</I> there 
 was a wall surrounding it, to keep off those that were unclean and to 
 separate between the <I>previous and the vile.</I> Note, A difference 
 is to be put between common and sacred things, between God's name and 
 other names, between his day and other days, his book and other books, 
 his institutions and other observances; and a distance is to be put 
 between our worldly and religious actions, so as still to go about the 
 worship of God with a solemn pause.</P>
