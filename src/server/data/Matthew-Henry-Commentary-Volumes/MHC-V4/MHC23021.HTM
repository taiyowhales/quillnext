 In this chapter we have a prophecy of sad times coming, and heavy 
 burdens, 

 I. Upon Babylon, here called "the desert of the sea," that it should be
 destroyed by the Medes and Persians with a terrible destruction, which 
 yet God's people should have advantage by, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:1-10">ver. 1-10</A>.

 II. Upon Dumah, or Idumea, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:11,12">ver. 11, 12</A>.

 III. Upon Arabia, or Kedar, the desolation of which country was very
 near, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:13-17">ver. 13-17</A>.

 These and other nations which the princes and people of Israel had so
 much to do with the prophets of Israel could not but have something to 
 say to. Foreign affairs must be taken notice of as well as domestic 
 ones, and news from abroad enquired after as well as news at home.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the
 south pass through; <I>so</I> it cometh from the desert, from a
 terrible land.
 &nbsp; 2  A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer
 dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam:
 besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.
 &nbsp; 3  Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken
 hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was
 bowed down at the hearing <I>of it;</I> I was dismayed at the seeing
 <I>of it.</I>
 &nbsp; 4  My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my
 pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me.
 &nbsp; 5  Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink:
 arise, ye princes, <I>and</I> anoint the shield.
 &nbsp; 6  For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let
 him declare what he seeth.
 &nbsp; 7  And he saw a chariot <I>with</I> a couple of horsemen, a chariot
 of asses, <I>and</I> a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently
 with much heed:
 &nbsp; 8  And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the
 watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights:
 &nbsp; 9  And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, <I>with</I> a couple of
 horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen;
 and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the
 ground.
 &nbsp; 10  O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have
 heard of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared
 unto you.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We had one burden of Babylon before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+13:1-22"><I>ch.</I> xiii.</A>);

 here we have another prediction of its fall. God saw fit thus to
 possess his people with the belief of this event by line upon line, 
 because Babylon sometimes pretended to be a friend to them (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+39:1"><I>ch.</I> xxxix. 1</A>),

 and God would hereby warn them not to trust to that friendship, and
 sometimes was really an enemy to them, and God would hereby warn them 
 not to be afraid of that enmity. Babylon is marked for ruin; and all 
 that believe God's prophets can, through that glass, see it tottering, 
 see it tumbling, even when with an eye of sense they see it flourishing 
 and sitting as a queen. Babylon is here called the <I>desert</I> or
 <I>plain of the sea;</I> for it was a flat country, and full of lakes, 
 or loughs (as they call them in Ireland), like little seas, and was 
 abundantly watered with the many streams of the river Euphrates. 
 Babylon did but lately begin to be famous, Nineveh having outshone it 
 while the monarchy was in the Assyrian hands; but in a little time it 
 became the lady of kingdoms; and, before it arrived at that pitch of 
 eminency which it was at in Nebuchadnezzar's time, God by this prophet 
 plainly foretold its fall, again and again, that his people might not 
 be terrified at its rise, nor despair of relief in due time when they 
 were its prisoners, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:3,Ps+37:35,37">Job v. 3; Ps. xxxvii. 35, 36</A>.

 Some think it is here called a <I>desert</I> because, though it was now
 a populous city, it should in time be made a desert. And 
 <I>therefore</I> the destruction of Babylon is so often prophesied of 
 by this evangelical prophet, because it was typical of the destruction 
 of the man of sin, the great enemy of the New-Testament church, which 
 is foretold in the <I>Revelation</I> in many expressions borrowed from 
 these prophecies, which therefore must be consulted and collated by 
 those who would understand the prophecy of that book. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The powerful irruption and descent which the Medes and Persians 
 should make upon Babylon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>):

 They will come <I>from the desert, from a terrible land.</I> The 
 northern parts of Media and Persia, where their soldiers were mostly 
 bred, was waste and mountainous, terrible to strangers that were to 
 pass through it and producing soldiers that were very formidable. 
 <I>Elam</I> (that is, Persia) is summoned to go up against Babylon, 
 and, in conjunction with the forces of Media, to besiege it. When God 
 has work of this kind to do he will find, though it be in a desert, in 
 a terrible land, proper instruments to be employed in it. These forces 
 come <I>as whirlwinds from the south,</I> so suddenly, so strongly, so 
 terribly, such a mighty noise shall they make, and throw down every 
 thing that stands in their way. As is usual in such a case, some 
 deserters will go over to them: <I>The treacherous dealers will deal 
 treacherously.</I> Historians tell us of Gadatas and Gobryas, two great 
 officers of the king of Babylon, that went over to Cyrus, and, being 
 well acquainted with all the avenues of the city, led a party directly 
 to the palace, where Belshazzar was slain. Thus with the help of the 
 <I>treacherous dealers the spoilers spoiled.</I> Some read it thus: 
 <I>There shall be a deceiver of that deceiver, Babylon, and a spoiler 
 of that spoiler,</I> or, which comes all to one, <I>The treacherous 
 dealer has found one that deals treacherously, and the spoiler one that 
 spoils,</I> as it is expounded,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:1"><I>ch.</I> xxxiii. 1</A>.

 The Persians shall pay the Babylonians in their own coin; those that by
 fraud and violence, cheating and plundering, unrighteous wars and 
 deceitful treaties, have made a prey of their neighbours, shall meet 
 with their match, and by the same methods shall themselves be made a 
 prey of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The different impressions made hereby upon those concerned in 
 Babylon. 

 1. To the poor oppressed captives it would be welcome news; for they
 had been told long ago that Babylon's destroyer would be their 
 deliverer, and therefore, "when they hear that Elam and Media are 
 coming up to besiege Babylon, <I>all their sighing will be made to 
 cease;</I> they shall no longer mingle their tears with Euphrates' 
 streams, but resume their harps, and smile when they remember Zion, 
 which, before, they wept at the thought of." For the sighing of the 
 needy the God of pity will arise in due time

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:5">Ps. xii. 5</A>);

 he will break the yoke from all their neck, will remove the rod of the
 wicked from off their lot, and so make their sighing to cease. 

 2. To the proud oppressors it would be a grievous vision

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 particularly to the king of Babylon for the time being, and it should 
 seem that he it is who is here brought in sadly lamenting his 
 inevitable fate 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>):

 <I>Therefore are my loins filled with pain; pangs have taken hold upon 
 me, &c.,</I> which was literally fulfilled in Belshazzar, for that very 
 night in which his city was taken, and himself slain, upon the sight of 
 a hand writing mystic characters upon the wall <I>his countenance was 
 changed and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins 
 were loosed and his knees smote one against another,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:6">Dan. v. 6</A>.

 And yet that was but the beginning of sorrows. Daniel's deciphering the
 writing could not but increase his terror, and the alarm which 
 immediately followed of the executioners at the door would be the 
 completing of it. And those words, <I>The night of my pleasure has he 
 turned into fear to me,</I> plainly refer to that aggravating 
 circumstance of Belshazzar's fall that he was slain on that night when 
 he was in the height of his mirth and jollity, with his cups and 
 concubines about him and a thousand of his lords revelling with him; 
 that night of his pleasure, when he promised himself an undisturbed 
 unallayed enjoyment of the most exquisite gratifications of sense, with 
 a particular defiance of God and religion in the profanation of the 
 temple vessels, was the night that was turned into all this fear. Let 
 this give an effectual check to vain mirth and sensual pleasures, and 
 forbid us ever to lay the reins on the neck of them--that we know not 
 what heaviness the mirth may end in, nor how soon laughter may be 
 turned into mourning; but this we know that for all these things God 
 shall bring us into judgment; let us therefore mix trembling always 
 with our joys.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A representation of the posture in which Babylon should be found 
 when the enemy should surprise it--all in festival gaiety 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):
 
 "Prepare the table with all manner of dainties. Set the guards; let 
 them watch in the watch-tower while we eat and drink securely and make 
 merry; and, if any alarm should be given, the princes shall arise and 
 anoint the shield, and be in readiness to give the enemy a warm 
 reception." Thus secure are they, and thus do they gird on the harness 
 with as much joy as if they were putting it off.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. A description of the alarm which should be given to Babylon upon 
 its being forced by Cyrus and Darius. The Lord, in vision, showed the 
 prophet the watchman set in his watch-tower, near the watch-tower, near 
 the palace, as is usual in times of danger; the king ordered those 
 about him to post a sentinel in the most advantageous place for 
 discovery, and, according to the duty of a watchman, let <I>him declare 
 what he sees,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 We read of watchmen thus set to receive intelligence in the story of
 David 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:24">2 Sam. xviii. 24</A>),

 and in the story of Jehu, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:17">2 Kings ix. 17</A>.

 This watchman here discovered a chariot with a couple of horsemen
 attending it, in which we may suppose the commander-in-chief to ride. 
 He then saw another chariot drawn by asses or mules, which were much in 
 use among the Persians, and a chariot drawn by camels, which were 
 likewise much in use among the Medes; so that (as Grotius thinks) these 
 two chariots signify the two nations combined against Babylon, or 
 rather these chariots come to bring tidings to the palace; compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:31,32">Jer. li. 31, 32</A>.

 <I>One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet
 another, to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken at one 
 end</I> while he is revelling at the other end and knows nothing of the 
 matter. The watchman, seeing these chariots at some distance,
 <I>hearkened diligently with much heed,</I> to receive the first 
 tidings. And

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>)

 <I>he cried, A lion;</I> this word, coming out of a watchman's mouth, 
 no doubt gave them a certain sound, and everybody knew the meaning of 
 it, though we do not know it now. It is likely that it was intended to 
 raise attention: he that has an ear to hear, let him hear, as when a 
 lion roars. Or <I>he cried as a lion,</I> very loud and in good 
 earnest, the occasion being very urgent. And what has he to say? 

 1. He professes his constancy to the post assigned him: "<I>I stand, my
 lord, continually upon the watch-tower,</I> and have never discovered 
 any thing material till just now; all seemed safe and quiet." Some make 
 it to be a complaint of the people of God that they had long expected 
 the downfall of Babylon, according to the prophecy, and it had not yet 
 come; but withal a resolution to continue waiting; as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:1">Hab. ii. 1</A>,

 <I>I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower,</I> to see
 what will be the issue of the present providences.

 2. He gives notice of the discoveries he had made

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Here comes a chariot of men with a couple of horsemen,</I> a vision 
 representing the enemy's entry into the city with all their force or 
 the tidings brought to the royal palace of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. A certain account is at length given of the overthrow of Babylon. He 
 in the chariot <I>answered and said</I> (when he heard the watchman 
 speak), <I>Babylon has fallen, has fallen;</I> or God answered thus to 
 the prophet enquiring concerning the issue of these affairs: "It has 
 now come to this, Babylon has surely and irrecoverably fallen. 
 Babylon's business is done now. <I>All the graven images of her gods he 
 has broken unto the ground.</I>" Babylon was the mother of harlots 
 (that is, of idolatry), which was one of the grounds of God's quarrel 
 with her; but her idols should now be so far from protecting her that 
 some of them should be broken down to the ground, and others of them, 
 that were worth carrying way, should go into captivity, and be a burden 
 to the beasts that carried them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:1,2"><I>ch.</I> xlvi. 1, 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Notice is given to the people of God, who were then captives in 
 Babylon, that this prophecy of the downfall of Babylon was particularly 
 intended for their comfort and encouragement, and they might depend 
 upon it that it should be accomplished in due season, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The title the prophet gives them in God's name: <I>O my threshing, 
 and the corn of my floor!</I> The prophet calls them <I>his,</I> 
 because they were his countrymen, and such as he had a particular 
 interest in and concern for; but he speaks it as from God, and directs 
 his speech to those that were Israelites indeed, the faithful in the 
 land. Note, 

 (1.) The church is God's floor, in which the most valuable fruits and
 products of this earth are, as it were, gathered together and laid up.

 (2.) True believers are the corn of God's floor. Hypocrites are but as
 the chaff and straw, which take up a great deal of room, but are of 
 small value, with which the wheat is now mixed, but from which it shall 
 be shortly and for ever separated.

 (3.) The corn of God's floor must expect to be threshed by afflictions
 and persecutions. God's Israel of old was afflicted from her youth,
 often under the plougher's plough

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+129:3">Ps. cxxix. 3</A>)
 
 and the thresher's flail.

 (4.) Even then God owns it for his threshing; it is his still; nay, the
 threshing of it is by his appointment, and under his restraint and 
 direction. The threshers could have no power against it <I>but what was 
 given them from above.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The assurance he gives them of the truth of what he had delivered to 
 them, which therefore they might build their hopes upon: <I>That which 
 I have heard of the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel</I>--that, and
 nothing else, that, and no fiction or fancy of my own--<I>have I
 declared unto you.</I> Note, In all events concerning the church, past, 
 present, and to come, we must have an eye to God both as the Lord of 
 hosts and as the God of Israel, who has power enough to do any thing 
 for his church and grace enough to do every thing that is for her good, 
 and to the words of his prophets, as words received from the Lord. As 
 they dare not smother any thing which he has entrusted them to declare, 
 so they dare not declare any thing as from him which he has not made 
 known to them,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman,
 what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?
 &nbsp; 12  The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night:
 if ye will enquire, enquire ye: return, come.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This prophecy concerning Dumah is very short, and withal dark and hard 
 to be understood. Some think that Dumah is a part of Arabia, and that 
 the inhabitants descended from Dumah the sixth son of Ishmael, as those 
 of Kedar 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>)

 from Ishmael's second son, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:13,14">Gen. xxv. 13, 14</A>.

 Others, because Mount Seir is here mentioned, by Dumah understand
 Idumea, the country of the Edomites. Some of Israel's neighbours are 
 certainly meant, and their distress is foretold, not only for warning 
 to them to prepare them for it, but for warning to Israel not to depend 
 upon them, or any of the nations about them, for relief in a time of 
 danger, but upon God only. We must see all creature confidences
 failing us, and feel them breaking under us, that we may not lay more 
 weight upon them than they will bear. But though the explication of 
 this prophecy be difficult, because we have no history in which we find 
 the accomplishment of it, yet the application will be easy. We have 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A question put by an Edomite to the watchman. Some one or other 
 <I>called out of Seir,</I> somebody that was more concerned for the 
 public safety and welfare than the rest, who were generally careless 
 and secure. As the man of Macedonia, in a vision, desired Paul to come 
 over and help them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:9">Acts xvi. 9</A>),

 so this man of Mount Seir, in a vision, desired the prophet to inform
 and instruct them. He calls not many; it is well there are any, that 
 all are not alike unconcerned about the things that belong to the 
 public peace. Some out of Seir ask advice of God's prophets, and are 
 willing to be taught, when many of God's Israel heed nothing. The 
 question is serious: <I>What of the night?</I> It is put to a proper 
 person, the <I>watchman,</I> whose office it is to answer such 
 enquiries. He repeats the question, as one in care, as one in earnest, 
 and desirous to have an answer. Note,

 (1.) God's prophets and ministers are appointed to be watchmen, and we 
 are to look upon them as such. They are as watchmen in the city in a 
 time of peace, to see that all be safe, to knock at every door by 
 personal enquiries ("Is it locked? Is the fire safe?"), to direct those 
 that are at a loss, and check those that are disorderly, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:3,5:7">Cant. iii. 3; v. 7</A>.
 
 They are as watchmen in the camp in time of war,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:7">Ezek. xxxiii. 7</A>.

 They are to take notice of the motions of the enemy and to give notice
 of them, to make discoveries and then give warning; and in this they 
 must deny themselves.

 (2.) It is our duty to enquire of the watchmen, especially to ask again
 and again, <I>What of the night?</I> for watchmen wake when other
 sleep. 

 [1.] What time of the night? After a long sleep in sin and security, is
 it not time to rise, high time to awake out of sleep? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:11">Rom. xiii. 11</A>.

 We have a great deal of work to do, a long journey to go; is it not
 time to be stirring? "Watchman, what o'clock is it? After a long dark
 night is there any hope of the day dawning?"

 [2.] What tidings of the night? <I>What from the night?</I> (so some); 
 "what vision has the prophet had to-night? We are ready to receive it." 
 Or, rather, "What occurs to night? What weather is it? What news?" We 
 must expect an alarm, and never be secure. The <I>day of the Lord will 
 come as a thief in the night;</I> we must prepare to receive the alarm, 
 and resolve to keep our ground, and then take the first hint of danger, 
 and to our arms presently, to our spiritual weapons.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The watchman's answer to this question. The watchman was neither 
 asleep nor dumb; though it was a man of Mount Seir that called to him, 
 he was ready to give him an answer: <I>The morning comes.</I> He 
 answers, 

 (1.) By way of prediction: "There comes first a morning of light, and 
 peace, and opportunity; you will enjoy one day of comfort more; but 
 afterwards comes a night of trouble and calamity." Note, In the course 
 of God's providence it is usual that morning and night are 
 counterchanged and succeed each other. Is it night? Yet the morning 
 comes, and the day-spring knows his place, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+30:5">Ps. xxx. 5</A>.

 Is it day? Yet the night comes also. If there be a morning of youth and
 health, there will come a night of sickness and old age; if a morning 
 of prosperity in the family, in the public, yet we must look for 
 changes. But God usually gives a morning of opportunity before he sends 
 a night of calamity, that his own people may be prepared for the storm 
 and others left inexcusable.

 (2.) By way of excitement: <I>If you will enquire, enquire.</I> Note, 
 It is our wisdom to improve the present morning in preparation for the 
 night that is coming after it. "<I>Enquire, return, come.</I> Be 
 inquisitive, be penitent, be willing and obedient." The manner of 
 expression is very observable, for we are put to our choice what we 
 will do: "<I>If you will enquire, enquire;</I> if not, it is at your 
 peril; you cannot say but you have a fair offer made you." We are also 
 urged to be at a point: "If you will, say so, and do not stand pausing; 
 what you will do do quickly, for it is no time to trifle." Those that 
 return and come to God will find they have a great deal of work to do 
 and but a little time to do it in, and therefore they have need to be 
 busy.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye
 lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanim.
 &nbsp; 14  The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him
 that was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled.
 &nbsp; 15  For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and
 from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.
 &nbsp; 16  For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year,
 according to the years of a hireling, and all the glory of Kedar
 shall fail:
 &nbsp; 17  And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of
 the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of
 Israel hath spoken <I>it.</I>
 </FONT></P>
 

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Arabia was a large country, that lay eastward and southward of the land 
 of Canaan. Much of it was possessed by the posterity of Abraham. The 
 <I>Dedanim,</I> here mentioned 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 descended from Dedan, Abraham's son by Keturah; the inhabitants of Tema 
 and Kedar descended from Ishmael, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:3,13,15">Gen. xxv. 3, 13, 15</A>.

 The Arabians generally lived in tents, and kept cattle, were a hardy
 people, inured to labour; probably the Jews depended upon them as a 
 sort of a wall between them and the more warlike eastern nations; and 
 therefore, to alarm them, they shall hear <I>the burden of Arabia,</I> 
 and see it sinking under its own burden.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A destroying army shall be brought upon them, with a sword, with 
 <I>a drawn sword,</I> with <I>a bow</I> ready <I>bent,</I> and with all 
 the <I>grievousness of war,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 It is probable that the king of Assyria, in some of the marches of his
 formidable and victorious army, took Arabia in his way, and, meeting 
 with little resistance, made an easy prey of them. The consideration of 
 the grievousness of war should make us thankful for the blessings of 
 peace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The poor country people will hereby be forced to flee for shelter 
 wherever they can find a place; so that <I>the travelling companies of 
 Dedanium,</I> which used to keep the high roads with their caravans, 
 shall be obliged to quit them and <I>lodge in the forest in Arabia</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 and shall not have the wonted convenience of their own tents, poor and 
 weather-beaten as they are.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They shall stand in need of refreshment, being ready to perish for 
 want of it, in their flight from the invading army: "<I>O you 
 inhabitants of the land of Tema!</I>" (who probably were next 
 neighbours to the companies of Dedanim) "<I>bring you water</I>" (so 
 the margin reads it) "<I>to him that is thirsty,</I> and <I>prevent 
 with your bread those that flee,</I> for they are objects of your 
 compassion; they do not wander for wandering sake, nor are they reduced 
 to straits by any extravagance of their own, but <I>they flee from the 
 sword.</I>" Tema was a country where water was sometimes a scarce 
 commodity (as we find, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:19">Job vi. 19</A>),

 and we may conclude it would be in a particular manner acceptable to
 these poor distressed refugees. Let us learn hence. 

 1. To look for distress ourselves. We know not what straits we may be 
 brought into before we die. Those that live in cities may be forced to 
 lodge in forests; and those may know the want of necessary food who now 
 eat bread to the full. Our mountain stands not so strong but that it 
 may be moved, rises not so high but that it may be scaled. These 
 Arabians would the better bear these calamities because in their way of 
 living they had used themselves to hardships.

 2. To look with compassion upon those that are in distress, and with
 all cheerfulness to relieve them, not knowing how soon their case may 
 be ours: "<I>Bring water to those that are thirsty,</I> and not only 
 give bread to those that need and ask it, but prevent those with it 
 that have need; give it to them unasked." Those that do so shall find 
 it remembered to their praise, as (according to our reading) it is here 
 remembered to the praise of the land of Tema that they did bring water 
 to the thirsty and relieved even those that were on the falling 
 side.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. All that which is the glory of Kedar shall vanish away and fail. 
 Did they glory in their numerous herds and flocks? They shall all be 
 driven away by the enemy. It seems they were famous about other nations 
 for the use of the bow in battle; but their archers, instead of foiling 
 the enemy, shall fall themselves; and <I>the residue of their 
 number,</I> when they are reduced to a small number, <I>shall be 
 diminished</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);

 their mighty able-bodied men, and men of spirit too, shall become very 
 few; for they, being most forward in the defence of their country, were 
 most exposed, and fell first, either by the enemies' sword or into the 
 enemies' hand. Note, Neither the skill of archers (though they be ever 
 so good marksmen) nor the courage of mighty men can protect a people 
 from the judgments of God, when they come with commission; they rather 
 expose the undertakers. That is poor glory which will thus quickly come 
 to nothing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. All this shall be done in a little time: "<I>Within one year 
 according to the years of a hireling</I> (within one year precisely 
 reckoned) this judgment shall come upon Kedar." If this fixing of the 
 time be of no great use to us now (because we find not either when the 
 prophecy was delivered or when it was accomplished), yet it might be of
 great use to the Arabians then, to awaken them to repentance, that, 
 like the men of Nineveh, they might prevent the judgment when they were 
 thus told it was just at the door. Or, when it begins to be fulfilled, 
 the business shall be done, be begun and ended in one year's time. God, 
 when he please, can do a great work in a little time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. It is all ratified by the truth of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);

 "<I>Thus hath the Lord said to me;</I> you may take my word for it that 
 it is his word;" and we may be sure no word of his shall fall to the 
 ground. And again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>The Lord God of Israel hath spoken it,</I> as the God of Israel, in 
 pursuance of his gracious designs concerning them; and we may be sure 
 <I>the strength of Israel will not lie.</I></P>
