 Reproof for sin and threatenings of judgment are intermixed in this 
 chapter, and are set the one over against the other: judgments are
 threatened, that the reproofs of sin might be the more effectual to 
 bring them to repentance; sin is discovered, that God might be 
 justified in the judgments threatened. 

 I. The sins they are charged with are very great:--Injustice

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:1">ver. 1</A>),

 hypocrisy in religion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:2">ver. 2</A>),

 incorrigibleness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:3">ver. 3</A>),

 the corruption and debauchery of both poor and rich 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:4,5">ver. 4, 5</A>),

 idolatry and adultery 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:7,8">ver. 7, 8</A>),

 treacherous departures from God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:11">ver. 11</A>),
 
 and impudent defiance of him
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:12,13">ver. 12, 13</A>),

 and, that which is at the bottom of all this, want of the fear of God, 
 notwithstanding the frequent calls given them to fear him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:20-24">ver. 20-24</A>.
 
 In the close of the chapter they are charged with violence and 
 oppression 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:26-28">ver. 26-28</A>),

 and a combination of those to debauch the nation who should have been 
 active to reform it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:30,31">
 ver. 30, 31</A>.

 II. The judgments they are threatened with are very terrible. In 
 general, they shall be reckoned with, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:9,29">ver. 9, 29</A>.

 A foreign enemy shall be brought in upon them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:15-17">ver. 15-17</A>),

 shall set guards upon them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:6">ver. 6</A>),
 
 shall destroy their fortification
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:10">ver. 10</A>),
 
 shall carry them away into captivity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:19">ver. 19</A>),

 and keep all good things from them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:25">ver. 25</A>.

 Herein the words of God's prophets shall be fulfilled, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:14">ver. 14</A>.
 
 But,
 
 III. Here is an intimation twice given that God would in the midst of
 wrath remember mercy, and not utterly destroy them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:10,18">ver. 10, 18</A>.

 This was the scope and purport of Jeremiah's preaching in the latter 
 end of Josiah's reign and the beginning of Jehoiakim's; but the success 
 of it did not answer expectation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see
 now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can
 find a man, if there be <I>any</I> that executeth judgment, that
 seeketh the truth; and I will pardon it.
 &nbsp; 2  And though they say, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> liveth; surely they swear
 falsely.
 &nbsp; 3  O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>are</I> not thine eyes upon the truth? thou hast
 stricken them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed
 them, <I>but</I> they have refused to receive correction: they have
 made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.
 &nbsp; 4  Therefore I said, Surely these <I>are</I> poor; they are foolish:
 for they know not the way of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>nor</I> the judgment of
 their God.
 &nbsp; 5  I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them;
 for they have known the way of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>and</I> the judgment of
 their God: but these have altogether broken the yoke, <I>and</I> burst
 the bonds.
 &nbsp; 6  Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, <I>and</I> a
 wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over
 their cities: every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in
 pieces: because their transgressions are many, <I>and</I> their
 backslidings are increased.
 &nbsp; 7  How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken
 me, and sworn by <I>them that are</I> no gods: when I had fed them to
 the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves
 by troops in the harlots' houses.
 &nbsp; 8  They were <I>as</I> fed horses in the morning: every one neighed
 after his neighbour's wife.
 &nbsp; 9  Shall I not visit for these <I>things?</I> saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and
 shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A challenge to produce any one right honest man, or at least any 
 considerable number of such, in Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Jerusalem had become like the old world, in which <I>all flesh had 
 corrupted their way.</I> There were some perhaps who flattered 
 themselves with hopes that there were yet many good men in Jerusalem, 
 who would stand in the gap to turn away the wrath of God; and there 
 might be others who boasted of its being the holy city and thought that 
 this would save it. But God bids them search the town, and intimates
 that they should scarcely find a man in it who executed judgment and 
 made conscience of what he said and did: "Look in <I>the streets,</I> 
 where they make their appearance and converse together, and in <I>the 
 broad places,</I> where they keep their markets; <I>see if you can find 
 a man, a magistrate</I> (so some), <I>that executes judgment,</I> and 
 administers justice impartially, that will put the laws in execution 
 against vice and profaneness." When the faithful thus cease and fail it 
 is time to cry <I>Woe is me!</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:1,2">Mic. vii. 1, 2</A>),

 high time to cry, <I>Help Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:1">Ps. xii. 1</A>.

 "If there be here and there a man that is truly conscientious, and does
 at least <I>speak the truth,</I> yet you shall not find him <I>in the 
 streets and broad places;</I> he dares not appear publicly, lest he 
 should be abused and run down. <I>Truth has fallen in the street</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:14">Isa. lix. 14</A>),

 and is forced to <I>seek for corners.</I>" So pleasing would it be to
 God to find any such that for their sake he would pardon the city; if 
 there were but ten righteous men in Sodom, if but one of a thousand, of 
 ten thousand, in Jerusalem, it should be spared. See how ready God is 
 to forgive, how swift to show mercy. But it might be said, "What do you 
 make of those in Jerusalem that continue to make profession of religion 
 and relation to God? Are not they men for whose sakes Jerusalem may be 
 spared?" No, for they are not sincere in their profession

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>They say, The Lord liveth,</I> and will swear by his name only, but
 they <I>swear falsely,</I> that is, 

 1. They are not sincere in the profession they make of respect to God,
 but are false to him; they <I>honour him with their lips, but their 
 hearts are far from him.</I> 

 2. Though they appeal to God only, they make no conscience of calling 
 him to witness to a lie. Though they do not swear by idols, they 
 forswear themselves, which is no less an affront to God, as the God of 
 truth, than the other is as the only true God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A complaint which the prophet makes to God of the obstinacy and 
 wilfulness of these people. God had appealed to their eyes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>);

 but here the prophet appeals to his eyes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>Are not thy eyes upon the truth?</I> Dost thou not see every man's
 true character? And is not this the truth of their character, that 
 <I>they have made their faces harder than a rock?</I>" Or, "<I>Behold, 
 thou desirest truth in the inward part;</I> but where is it to be found 
 among the men of this generation? For though they say, <I>The Lord 
 liveth,</I> yet they never regard him; <I>thou hast stricken them</I> 
 with one affliction after another, <I>but they have not grieved</I> for 
 the affliction, they have been as stocks and stones under it, much less 
 have they grieved for the sin by which they have brought it upon 
 themselves. <I>Thou</I> hast gone further yet, <I>hast consumed 
 them,</I> hast corrected them yet more severely; <I>but they have 
 refused to receive correction,</I> to accommodate themselves to thy 
 design in correcting them and to answer to it. They would not receive 
 instruction by the correction. The have set themselves to outface the 
 divine sentence and to outbrave the execution of it, for <I>they have 
 made their faces harder than a rock;</I> they cannot change 
 countenance, neither blush for shame nor look pale for fear, cannot be 
 beaten back from the pursuit of their lusts, whatever check is given 
 them; for, though often called to it, <I>they have refused to 
 return,</I> and would go forward, right or wrong, as <I>the horse into 
 the battle.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The trial made both of rich and poor, and the bad character given 
 of both.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The poor were ignorant, and therefore they were wicked. He found 
 many that <I>refused to return,</I> for whom he was willing to make the 
 best excuse their case would bear, and it was this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>Surely, these are poor, they are foolish.</I> They never had the
 advantage of a good education, nor have they wherewithal to help 
 themselves now with the means of instruction. They are forced to work 
 hard for their living, and have no time nor capacity for reading or 
 hearing, so that <I>they know not the way of the Lord, nor the 
 judgments of their God;</I> they understand neither the way in which 
 God by his precepts will have them to walk towards him nor the way in 
 which he by his providence is walking towards them." Note, 

 (1.) Prevailing ignorance is the lamentable cause of abounding impiety 
 and iniquity. What can one expect but works of darkness from brutish 
 sottish people that know nothing of God and religion, but choose to 
 <I>sit in darkness?</I> 

 (2.) This is commonly a reigning sin among poor people. There are the 
 devil's poor as well as God's, who, notwithstanding their poverty, 
 might <I>know the way of the Lord,</I> so as to walk in it and do their 
 duty, without being book-learned; but they are willingly ignorant, and 
 therefore their ignorance will not be their excuse.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The rich were insolent and haughty, and therefore they were wicked 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>I will get me to the great men,</I> and see if I can find them more
 pliable to the word and providence of God. I will <I>speak to them,</I> 
 preach at court, in hopes to make some impression upon men of polite 
 literature. But all in vain; <I>for,</I> though <I>they know the way of 
 the Lord and the judgment of their God,</I> yet they are too stiff to 
 stoop to his government: <I>These have altogether broken the yoke and 
 burst the bonds.</I> They know their Master's will, but are resolved to 
 have their own will, to <I>walk in the way of their heart and in the 
 sight of their eyes.</I> They think themselves too goodly to be 
 controlled, too big to be corrected, even by the sovereign Lord of all 
 himself. They are for breaking even <I>his bands asunder,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:3">Ps. ii. 3</A>.
 
 The poor are weak, the rich are wilful, and so neither do their
 duty."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Some particular sins specified, which they were notoriously guilty 
 of, and which cried most loudly to heaven for vengeance. <I>Their 
 transgressions</I> indeed <I>were many,</I> of many kinds and often 
 repeated, <I>and their backslidings were increased;</I> they added to 
 the number of them and grew more and more impudent in them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 But two sins especially were justly to be looked upon as unpardonable 
 crimes:--

 1. Their spiritual whoredom, giving that honour to idols which is due 
 to God only. "<I>Thy children have forsaken me,</I> to whom they were
 born and dedicated and under whom they have been brought up, <I>and</I> 
 they <I>have sworn by those that are no gods,</I> have made their 
 appeal to them as if they had been omniscient and their proper judges." 
 This is here put for all acts of religious worship due to God only, but 
 with which they had honoured their idols. <I>They have sworn to 
 them</I> (so it may be read), have joined themselves to them and 
 covenanted with them. Those that forsake God make a bad change for 
 those that are no gods. 

 2. Their corporal whoredom. Because they had forsaken God and served 
 idols, he gave them up to vile affections; and those that dishonoured 
 him were left to dishonour themselves and their own families. They 
 <I>committed adultery</I> most scandalously, without sense of shame or 
 fear of punishment, for they <I>assembled themselves by troops in the 
 harlots' houses</I> and did not blush to be seen by one another in the 
 most scandalous places. So impudent and violent was their lust, so 
 impatient of check, and so eager to be gratified, that they became 
 perfect beasts

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 like high-fed horses, they <I>neighed every one after his neighbour's
 wife,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Unbridled lusts make men <I>like natural brute beasts,</I> such 
 monstrous odious things are they. And that which aggravated their sin 
 was that it was the abuse of God's favours to them: <I>When they were 
 fed to the full,</I> then their lusts grew thus furious. Fulness of 
 bread was fuel to the fire of Sodom's lusts. <I>Sine Cerere et Bacchio
 friget Venu--Luxurious living feeds the flames of lust.</I> Fasting 
 would help to tame the unruly evil that is so <I>full of deadly 
 poison,</I> and bring the body into subjection.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. A threatening of God's wrath against them for their wickedness and 
 the universal debauchery of their land.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The particular judgment that is threatened, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 A foreign enemy shall break in upon them, get dominion over them, and 
 shall lay waste: their country shall be as if it were overrun and 
 perfectly mastered by wild beasts. This enemy shall be, 

 (1.) Like <I>a lion of the forest;</I> so strong, so furious, so 
 irresistible; and he <I>shall slay them.</I> 

 (2.) Like <I>a wolf of the evening,</I> which comes out at night, when 
 he is hungry, to seek his prey, and is very fierce and ravenous; and 
 the noise both of the lions' roaring and of the wolves' howling is very 
 hideous. 

 (3.) Like <I>a leopard,</I> which is very swift and very cruel, and 
 withal careful not to miss his prey. The army of the enemy shall
 <I>watch over their cities</I> so strictly as to put the inhabitants to 
 this sad dilemma--if they stay in, they are starved; if they stir out, 
 they are stabbed; <I>Every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in 
 pieces,</I> which intimates that in many places the enemy gave no 
 quarter. And all this bloody work is owing to the <I>multitude of their 
 transgressions.</I> It is sin that makes the great slaughter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. An appeal to themselves concerning the equity of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);
 
 "<I>Shall I not visit for these things?</I> Can you yourselves think
 that the God whose name is <I>Jealous</I> will let such idolatries go 
 unpunished, or that a God of infinite purity will connive at such 
 abominable uncleanness?" These are things that must be reckoned for, 
 else the honour of God's government cannot be maintained, nor his laws 
 saved from contempt; but sinners will be tempted to think him 
 <I>altogether such a one as themselves,</I> contrary to that conviction 
 of their own consciences concerning the judgment of God which is 
 necessary to be supported, That <I>those who</I> do <I>such things are 
 worthy of death,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:32">Rom. i. 32</A>.

 Observe, when God punishes sin, he is said to <I>visit</I> for it, or
 enquire into it; for he weighs the cause before he passes sentence. 
 Sinners have reason to expect punishment upon the account of God's 
 holiness, to which sin is highly offensive, as well as upon the account 
 of his justice, to which it renders us obnoxious; this is intimated in 
 that, <I>Shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</I> It 
 is not only the word of God, but his soul, that takes vengeance. And he 
 has national judgments wherewith to take vengeance for national sins.
 <I>Such nations as this</I> was cannot long go unpunished. <I>How shall 
 I pardon thee for this?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Not but that those who have been guilty of these sins have found mercy 
 with God, as to their eternal state (Manasseh himself did, though so 
 much accessory to the iniquity of these times); but nations, <I>as 
 such,</I> being rewardable and punishable only in this life, it would 
 not be for the glory of God to let a nation so very wicked as this pass 
 without some manifest tokens of his displeasure.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may observe in these verses, as before,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The sin of this people, upon which the commission signed against 
 them is grounded. God disowns them and dooms them to destruction, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 But <I>is there not a cause?</I> Yes; for, 

 1. They have deserted the law of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>The house of Israel and the house of Judah,</I> though at variance
 with one another, yet both agreed to <I>deal very treacherously against 
 God.</I> They forsook the worship of him, and therein violated their 
 covenants with him; they revolted from him, and played the hypocrite 
 with him. 

 2. They have defied the judgments of God and given the lie to his 
 threatenings in the mouth of his prophets,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.

 They were often told that evil would certainly come upon them; they 
 must expect some desolating judgment, <I>sword or famine;</I> but they 
 were secure and said, <I>We shall have peace, though we go on.</I> For, 
 
 (1.) They did not fear what God is. They belied him, and confronted the 
 dictates even of natural light concerning him; for they said, "<I>It is 
 not he,</I> that is, he is not such a one as we have been made to 
 believe he is; he does not see, or not regard, or will not require it; 
 and therefore <I>no evil shall come upon us.</I>" Multitudes are ruined 
 by being made to believe that God will not be so strict with them as 
 his word says he will; nay, by this artifice Satan undid us all: <I>You 
 shall not surely die.</I> So here: <I>Neither shall we see sword nor 
 famine.</I> Vain hopes of impunity are the deceitful support of all 
 impiety. 

 (2.) They did not fear what God said. The prophets gave them fair 
 warning, but they turned it off with a jest: "They do but talk so, 
 because it is their trade; they are words of course, and words are but 
 wind. It is not the word of the Lord that is in them; it is only the 
 language of their melancholy fancy or their ill-will to their country, 
 because they are not preferred." Note, Impenitent sinners are not 
 willing to own any thing to be the word of God that makes against them, 
 that tends either to part them from, or disquiet them in, their sins.
 They threaten the prophets: "<I>They shall become wind,</I> shall pass 
 away unregarded, and <I>thus shall it be done unto them;</I> what they 
 threaten against us we will inflict upon them. Do they frighten us with 
 famine? Let them be <I>fed with the bread of affliction.</I>" So 
 Micaiah was, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+22:27">1 Kings xxii. 27</A>.

 "Do they tell us of the sword? Let them perish by the sword,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:30"><I>ch.</I> ii. 30</A>.

 Thus their mocking and misusing God's messengers filled the measure of
 their iniquity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The punishment of this people for their sin. 

 1. The threatenings they laughed at shall be executed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>Because you speak this word</I> of contempt concerning the prophets,
 and the word in their mouths, therefore God will put honour upon them 
 and their words, for not one iota or tittle of them shall <I>fall to 
 the ground,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:19">1 Sam. iii. 19</A>.

 Here God turns to the prophet Jeremiah, who had been thus bantered, and
 perhaps had been a little uneasy at it: <I>Behold, I will make my words 
 in thy mouth fire.</I> God owns them for his words, though men denied 
 them, and will as surely make them to take effect as the fire consumes 
 combustible material that is in its way. <I>The word shall be fire and 
 the people wood.</I> Sinners by sin make themselves fuel to that wrath 
 of God which is <I>revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and 
 unrighteousness of men</I> in the scripture. The word of God will 
 certainly be too hard for those that contend with it. Those shall break 
 who will not bow before it.

 2. The enemy they thought themselves in no danger of shall be brought
 upon them. God gives them their commission

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "<I>Go you up upon her walls,</I> mount them, trample upon them, tread
 them down. Walls of stone, before the divine commission, shall be but 
 mud walls. Having made yourselves masters of the walls, you may 
 <I>destroy</I> at pleasure. You may <I>take away her battlements,</I> 
 and leave the fenced fortified cities to lie open; for her battlements 
 <I>are not the Lord's</I> he does not own them and therefore will not 
 protect and fortify them." They were not erected in his fear, nor with 
 a dependence upon him; the people have trusted to them more than to 
 God, and therefore they are not his. When the city is filled with sin 
 God will not patronise the fortifications of it, and then they are 
 paper walls. What can defend us when he who is our defence, and the 
 defender of all our defences, has <I>departed from us?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:9">Num. xiv. 9</A>.
 
 What is not of God cannot stand, not stand long, nor stand us in any
 stead. What dreadful work these invaders should make is here described

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>Lo, I will bring a nation upon you, O house of Israel!</I> Note, God
 has all nations at his command, does what he pleases with them and 
 makes what use he pleases of them. And sometimes he is pleased to make 
 the nations of the earth, the heathen nations, a scourge to the house 
 of Israel, when that has become a <I>hypocritical nation.</I> This 
 nation of the Chaldeans is here said to be a remote nation; it is 
 <I>brought upon them from afar,</I> and therefore will make the greater 
 spoil and the longer stay, that the soldiers may pay themselves well 
 for so long a march. "It is a nation that thou hast had no commerce 
 with, by reason of their distance, and therefore canst not expect to 
 find favour with." God can bring trouble upon us from places and causes 
 very remote. It is a <I>mighty nation,</I> that there is no making head 
 against, an <I>ancient nation,</I> that value themselves upon their 
 antiquity and will therefore be the more haughty and imperious. It is 
 <I>a nation whose language thou knowest not;</I> they spoke the Syriac 
 tongue, which the Jews at that time were not acquainted with, as 
 appears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:26">2 Kings xviii. 26</A>.

 The difference of language would make it the more difficult to treat
 with them of peace. Compare this with the threatening, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:49">Deut. xxviii. 49</A>,

 which it seems to have a reference to, for the law and the prophets 
 exactly agree. They are well armed: <I>Their quiver is as an open 
 sepulchre;</I> their arrows shall fly so thick, hit so sure, and wound 
 so deep, that they shall be reckoned to breathe nothing but death and 
 slaughter: they are able-bodied, all effective, <I>mighty men,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 And, when they have made themselves masters of the country, they shall 
 devour all before them, and reckon all their own that they can lay 
 their hands on, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 (1.) They shall strip the country, shall not only sustain, but surfeit, 
 their soldiers with the rich products of this fruitful land. "They
 shall not store up (then it might possibly by retrieved), but <I>eat up 
 thy harvest</I> in the field <I>and thy bread</I> in the house, 
 <I>which thy sons and thy daughters should eat.</I>" Note, What we have 
 we have for our families, and it is a comfort to see our sons and 
 daughters eating that which we have taken care and pains for. But it is 
 a grievous vexation to see it devoured by strangers and enemies, to see 
 their camps victualled with our stores, while those that are dear to us 
 are perishing for want of it: this also is according to the curse of 
 the law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:33">Deut. xxviii. 33</A>.

 "<I>They shall eat up thy flocks and herds,</I> out of which thou hast
 taken sacrifices for thy idols; they shall not leave thee the fruit of 
 <I>thy vines and fig-trees.</I>"

 (2.) They shall starve the towns: "They <I>shall impoverish thy fenced 
 cities</I>" (and what fence is there against poverty, when it comes 
 like an armed man?), "those cities <I>wherein thou trustedst</I> to be 
 a protection to the country." Note, It is just with God to impoverish 
 that which we make our confidence. They shall impoverish them <I>with
 the sword,</I> cutting off all provisions from coming to them and 
 intercepting trade and commerce, which will impoverish even fenced 
 cities.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. An intimation of the tender compassion God has yet for them. The 
 enemy is commissioned to destroy and lay waste, but must not <I>make a 
 full end,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Though they make a great slaughter, yet some must be left to live; 
 though they make a great spoil, yet something must be left to live 
 upon, for God has said it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>)

 with a <I>non obstante--a nevertheless</I> to the present desolation:
 "Even <I>in those days,</I> dismal as they are, <I>I will not make a 
 full end with you;</I>" and, if God will not, the enemy shall not. God 
 has mercy in store for his people, and therefore will set bounds to 
 this desolating judgment. <I>Hitherto it shall come, and no
 further.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The justification of God in these proceedings against them. As he 
 will appear to be gracious in not making a full end with them, so he 
 will appear to be righteous in coming so near it, and will have it 
 acknowledged that he has done them no wrong, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. A reason demanded, insolently demanded, by the people for these 
 judgments. They <I>will say "Wherefore doth the Lord our God do all 
 this unto us?</I> What provocation have we given him, or what quarrel 
 has he with us?" As if against such a sinful nation there did not 
 appear cause enough of action. Note, Unhumbled hearts are ready to 
 charge God with injustice in their afflictions, and pretend they have 
 to seek for the cause of them when it is written in the forehead of 
 them. But, 

 2. Here is a reason immediately assigned. The prophet is instructed
 what answer to give them; for God <I>will be justified when he 
 speaks,</I> though he speaks with ever so much terror. He must tell 
 them that God does this against them for what they have done against 
 him, and that they may, if they please, read their sin in their 
 punishment. Do not they know very well that they have <I>forsaken 
 God,</I> and therefore can they think it strange if he has forsaken 
 them? Have they forgotten how often they <I>served gods in their own 
 land,</I> that good land, in the abundance of the fruits of which they 
 ought to have served God with gladness of heart? and therefore is it 
 not just with God to make them <I>serve strangers</I> in a strange 
 land, where they can call nothing their own, as he has threatened to 
 do? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:47,48">Deut. xxviii. 47, 48</A>.

 Those that are fond of strangers, to strangers let them go.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah,
 saying,
 &nbsp; 21  Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding;
 which have eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear not:
 &nbsp; 22  Fear ye not me? saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: will ye not tremble at my
 presence, which have placed the sand <I>for</I> the bound of the sea
 by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the
 waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though
 they roar, yet can they not pass over it?
 &nbsp; 23  But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart;
 they are revolted and gone.
 &nbsp; 24  Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 our God, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in his
 season: he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet, having reproved them for sin and threatened the judgments 
 of God against them, is here sent to them again upon another errand, 
 which he must <I>publish in Judah;</I> the purport of it is to persuade 
 them to fear God, which would be an effectual principle of their 
 reformation, as the want of that fear had been at the bottom of their 
 apostasy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He complains of the shameful stupidity of this people, and their 
 bent to backslide from God, speaking as if he knew not what course to 
 take with them. For,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Their understandings were darkened and unapt to admit the rays of 
 the divine light: They are a <I>foolish people and without 
 understanding;</I> they apprehend not the mind of God, though ever so 
 plainly declared to them by the written word, by his prophets, and by 
 his providence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>They have eyes, but they see not, ears, but they hear not,</I> like
 the idols which they made and worshipped, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:5,6,8">Ps. cxv. 5, 6, 8</A>.

 One would have thought that they took notice of things, but really they
 did not; they had intellectual faculties and capacities, but they did 
 not employ and improve them as they ought. Herein they disappointed
 the expectations of all their neighbours, who, observing what excellent 
 means of knowledge they had, concluded, <I>Surely they are a wise and 
 an understanding people</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:6">Deut. iv. 6</A>),

 and yet really they are a <I>foolish people and without
 understanding.</I> Note, We cannot judge of men by the advantages and 
 opportunities they enjoy: there are those that sit in darkness in a 
 land of light, that live in sin even in a holy land, that are bad in 
 the best places.

 2. Their wills were stubborn and unapt to submit to the rules of the 
 divine law

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>This people has a revolting and a rebellious heart;</I> and no
 wonder when they were <I>foolish and without understanding,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:5">Ps. lxxxii. 5</A>.

 Nay, it is the corrupt bias of the will that bribes and besots the
 understanding: none so blind as those that will not see. The character 
 of this people is the true character of all people by nature, till the 
 grace of God has wrought a change. We are <I>foolish,</I> slow of 
 understanding, and apt to mistake and forget; yet that is not the 
 worst. We have <I>a revolting and a rebellious heart,</I> a carnal 
 mind, that is enmity against God, and is not in subjection to his law, 
 not only revolting from him by a rooted aversion to that which is good, 
 but rebellious against him by a strong inclination to that which is 
 evil. Observe, The revolting heart is a rebellious one: those that 
 withdraw from their allegiance to God do not stop there, but by siding 
 in with sin and Satan take up arms against him. <I>They have revolted 
 and gone.</I> The revolting heart will produce a revolting life.
 <I>They are gone,</I> and they <I>will go</I> (so it may be read); now 
 <I>nothing will be restrained from them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+11:6">Gen. xi. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He ascribed this to the want of the fear of God. When he observes 
 them to be without understanding he asks, "<I>Fear you not me, saith 
 the Lord, and will you not tremble at my presence?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 If you would but keep up an awe of God, you would be more observant of 
 what he says to you: and, did you but understand your own interest 
 better, you would be more under the commanding rule of God's fear." 
 When he observes that <I>they have revolted and gone</I> he adds this, 
 as the root and cause of their apostasy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 <I>Neither say they in their hearts, Let us now fear the Lord our
 God.</I> Therefore so many bad thoughts come into their mind, and hurry 
 them to that which is evil, because they will not admit and entertain 
 good thoughts, and particularly not this good thought, <I>Let us now 
 fear the Lord our God.</I> It is true it is God's work to put his fear 
 into our hearts; but it is our work to stir up ourselves to fear him, 
 and to fasten upon those considerations which are proper to affect us 
 with a holy awe of him; and it is because we do not do this that our 
 hearts are so destitute of his fear as they are, and so apt to revolt 
 and rebel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He suggests some of those things which are proper to possess us 
 with a holy fear of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. We must fear the Lord and his greatness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Upon this account he demands our fear: <I>Shall we not tremble at his 
 presence,</I> and not be afraid of affronting him, or trifling with 
 him, who in the kingdom of nature and providence gives such 
 incontestable proofs of his almighty power and sovereign dominion? Here 
 is one instance given of very many that might be given: he keeps the 
 sea within compass. Though the tides flow with a mighty strength twice 
 every day, and if they should flow on awhile would drown the world, 
 though in a storm the billows rise high and dash to the shore with 
 incredible force and fury, yet they are under check, they return, they 
 retire, and no harm is done. <I>This is the Lord's doing,</I> and, if 
 it were not common, it would be <I>marvellous in our eyes.</I> He has 
 <I>placed the sand for the bound of the sea,</I> not only for a 
 <I>meer-stone,</I> to mark out how far it may come and where it must 
 stop, but as a <I>mound,</I> or fence, to put a stop to it. A wall of 
 sand shall be as effectual as a wall of brass to check the flowing 
 waves, when God is pleased to make it so; nay, that is chosen rather, 
 to teach us that a <I>soft answer,</I> like the soft sand, <I>turns 
 away wrath,</I> and quiets a foaming rage, when <I>grievous words,</I> 
 like hard rocks, do but exasperate, and make <I>the waters cast 
 forth</I> so much the more <I>mire and dirt.</I> This bound is placed 
 <I>by a perpetual decree,</I> by an ordinance <I>of antiquity</I> (so 
 some read it), and then it sends us as far back as to the creation of 
 the world, when God divided between the sea and dry land, and fixed 
 marches between them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:9,10">Gen. i. 9, 10</A>

 (which is elegantly described,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:6-26">Ps. civ. 6</A>,
 
 &c., and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:8-41">Job xxxviii. 8</A>,

 &c.), or to the period of Noah's flood, when God promised that he would
 never drown the world again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:11">Gen. ix. 11</A>.

 An ordinance of <I>perpetuity</I>--so our translation takes it. It is a
 <I>perpetual decree;</I> it has had its effect all along to this day 
 and shall still continue till day and night come to an end. This
 <I>perpetual decree</I> the waters of the sea <I>cannot pass over</I> 
 nor break through. <I>Though the waves thereof toss themselves,</I> as 
 the <I>troubled sea</I> does <I>when it cannot rest,</I> yet <I>can 
 they not prevail; though they roar</I> and rage as if they were vexed 
 at the check given them, <I>yet can they not pass over.</I> Now this is 
 a good reason why we should fear God; for,

 (1.) By this we see that he is a God of almighty power and universal 
 sovereignty, and therefore to be feared and had in reverence. 

 (2.) This shows us how easily he could drown the world again and how 
 much we continually lie at his mercy, and therefore we should be afraid 
 of making him our enemy. 

 (3.) Even the unruly waves of the sea observe his decree and retreat at 
 his check, and shall not we then? Why are our hearts revolting and 
 rebellious, when the sea neither revolts nor rebels?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. We must fear the Lord and his goodness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+3:5">Hos. iii. 5</A>.

 The instances of this, as of the former, are fetched from God's common
 providence,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 We must <I>fear the Lord our God,</I> that is, we must worship him, and 
 give him glory, and be always in care to keep ourselves in his love, 
 because he is continually doing us good: he gives us both <I>the former 
 and the latter rain,</I> the former a little after seed-time, the 
 latter a little before harvest, and both <I>in their season;</I> and by 
 this means <I>he reserves to us the appointed weeks of harvest.</I> 
 Harvest is reckoned by weeks, because in a few weeks enough is gathered 
 to serve for sustenance the year round. The weeks of the harvest are 
 appointed us by the promise of God, that <I>seed-time and harvest shall 
 not fail.</I> And in performance of that promise they are reserved to 
 us by the divine providence, otherwise we should come short of them. In 
 harvest mercies therefore God is to be acknowledged, his power, and 
 goodness, and faithfulness, for they all come from him. And it is good
 reason why we should fear him, that we may keep ourselves in his love, 
 because we have such a necessary dependence upon him. The fruitful 
 seasons were witnesses for God, even to the heathen world, sufficient 
 to leave them inexcusable in their contempt of him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:17">Acts xiv. 17</A>);

 and yet the Jews, who had the written word to explain their testimony
 by, were not wrought upon to fear the Lord, though it appears how much 
 it is our interest to do so.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>25  Your iniquities have turned away these <I>things,</I> and your
 sins have withholden good <I>things</I> from you.
 &nbsp; 26  For among my people are found wicked <I>men:</I> they lay wait,

 do in the end thereof?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. The prophet shows them what mischief their sins had done them: They 
 <I>have turned away these things</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 the <I>former and the latter rain,</I> which they used to have <I>in
 due season</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),
 
 but which had of late been withheld
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:3"><I>ch.</I> iii. 3</A>),

 by reason of which the appointed weeks of harvest had sometimes
 disappointed them. "It is <I>your sin</I> that <I>has withholden good 
 from you,</I> when God was ready to bestow it upon you." Note, It is 
 sin that stops the current of God's favour to us, and deprives us of 
 the blessings we used to receive. It is that which makes the heavens as 
 brass and the earth as iron.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He shows them how great their sins were, how heinous and provoking. 
 When they had forsaken the worship of the true God, even moral honesty 
 was lost among them: <I>Among my people are found wicked men</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 some of the worst of men, and so much the worse they were for being
 found among God's people. 

 1. They were spiteful and malicious. Such are properly <I>wicked
 men,</I> men that delight in doing mischief. They were <I>found</I>
 (that is, caught) in the very act of their wickedness. As hunters or 
 fowlers lay snares for their game, so did they <I>lie in wait</I> to 
 <I>catch men,</I> and made a sport of it, and took as much pleasure in 
 it as if they had been entrapping beasts or birds. They contrives ways 
 of doing mischief to good people (whom they hated for their goodness), 
 especially to those that faithfully reproved them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:21">Isa. xxix. 21</A>),

 or to those that stood in the way of their preferment or whom they
 supposed to have affronted them or done them a diskindness, or to those 
 whose estates they coveted; so Jezebel ensnared Naboth for his 
 vineyard. Nay, they did mischief for mischief's sake.

 2. They were false and treacherous

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 "<I>As a cage,</I> or <I>coop,</I> is <I>full of birds,</I> and of food
 for them to fatten them for the table, so are <I>their houses full of 
 deceit,</I> of wealth obtained by fraudulent practices or of arts and 
 methods of defrauding. All the business of their families is done with 
 deceit; whoever deals with them, they will cheat him if they can, which 
 is easily done by those who make no conscience of what they say and do.
 Herein <I>they overpass the deed of the wicked,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 Those that act by deceit, with a colour of law and justice, do more 
 mischief perhaps than those wicked men

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>)

 that carry all before them by open force and violence; or they are
 worse than the heathen themselves, yea, the worst of them. And (would 
 you think it?) they prosper in these wicked courses and therefore their 
 hearts are hardened in them. They are greedy of the world, because they 
 find it flows in upon them, and they stick not at any wickedness in 
 pursuit of it, because they find that it is so far from hindering their 
 prosperity that it furthers it: <I>They have become great</I> in the 
 world; <I>they have waxen rich,</I> and thrive upon it. They have 
 wherewithal to make provision for the flesh to fulfill all the lusts of 
 it, to which they are very indulgent, so that <I>they have waxen 
 fat</I> with living at ease and bathing themselves in all the delights 
 of sense. They are sleek and smooth: <I>The shine;</I> they look fair 
 and gay; every body admires them. And they <I>pass by matters of 
 evil</I> (so some read the following words); they escape the evils 
 which one would expect their sins should bring upon them; <I>they are 
 not in trouble as other men,</I> much less as we might expect bad men,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:5">Ps. lxxiii. 5</A>,

 &c.

 3. When they had grown great, and had got power in their hands, they 
 did not do that good with it which they ought to have done: <I>They 
 judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, and the right of the 
 needy.</I> The fatherless are often needy, always need assistance and 
 advice, and advantage is taken of their helpless condition to do them 
 an injury. Who should succour them then but the great and rich? What
 have men wealth for but to do good with it? But these would take no 
 cognizance of any such distressed cases: they had not so much sense of 
 justice, or compassion for the injured; or, if they did concern 
 themselves in the cause, it was not to do right, but to protect those 
 that did wrong. And <I>yet they prosper</I> still; <I>God layeth not 
 folly to them.</I> Certainly then the things of this world are not the 
 best things, for often-times the worst men have the most of them; yet 
 we are not to think that, because they prosper, God allows of their 
 practices. No; <I>though sentence against</I> their <I>evil works be 
 not executed speedily,</I> it will be executed. 

 4. There was a general corruption of all orders and degrees of men 
 among them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:30,31"><I>v.</I> 30, 31</A>);
 
 <I>A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land.</I> The
 degeneracy of such a people, so privileged and advanced, was a 
 wonderful thing, and to be viewed with amazement. How could they ever 
 break through so many obligations? It was a horrible thing, a thing to 
 be detested and the consequences of it dreaded. To frighten ourselves 
 from sin, let us call it a horrible thing. What was the matter? In 
 short, this: 

 (1.) The leaders misled the people: <I>The prophets prophesy 
 falsely,</I> counterfeit a commission from heaven when they are factors 
 for hell. Religion is never more dangerously attacked than under
 colour and pretence of divine revelation. But why did not the priests, 
 who had power in their hands for that purpose, restrain these false 
 prophets? Alas! instead of doing that they made use of them as the
 tools of their ambition and tyranny: <I>The priests bear rule by their 
 means;</I> they supported themselves in their grandeur and wealth, 
 their laziness and luxury, their impositions and oppressions, by the 
 help of the false prophets and their interest in the people. Thus they
 were in a combination against every thing that was good, and 
 strengthened one another's hands in evil. 

 (2.) The people were well enough pleased to be so misled: "They are 
 <I>my people,</I>" says God, "and should have stood up for me, and 
 borne their testimony against the wickedness of their priests and 
 prophets; but they <I>love to have it so.</I>" If the priests and 
 prophets will let them alone in their sins, they will give them no 
 disturbance in theirs. They love to be ridden with a loose rein, and 
 like those rulers very well that will not restrain their lusts and 
 those teachers that will not reprove them.</P>

 III. He shows them how fatal the consequences of this would certainly 
 be. Let them consider,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What the reckoning would be for their wickedness
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 <I>Shall not I visit for these things?</I> as before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Sometimes mercy rejoices against judgment: <I>How shall I give thee up, 
 Ephraim?</I> Here, judgment is reasoning against mercy: <I>Shall I not 
 visit?</I> We are sure that Infinite Wisdom knows how to accommodate 
 the matter between them. The manner of expression is very emphatic, and 
 denotes, 

 (1.) The certainty and necessity of God's judgments: <I>Shall not my 
 soul be avenged?</I> Yes, without doubt, vengeance will come, it must 
 come, if the sinner repent not. 

 (2.) The justice and equity of God's judgments; he appeals to the 
 sinner's own conscience, Do not those deserve to be punished that have 
 been guilty of such abominations? Shall he not be avenged on <I>such a
 nation,</I> such a wicked provoking nation as this?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What the direct tendency of their wickedness was: <I>What will you 
 do in the end thereof?</I> That is, 

 (1.) "What a pitch of wickedness will you come to at last! <I>What will 
 you do?</I> What will you not do that is base and wicked. What will 
 this grow to? You will certainly grow worse and worse, till you have 
 filled up the measure of your iniquity." 

 (2.) "What a pit of destruction will you come to at last! When things
 are brought to such a pass as this, nothing can be expected from you 
 but a deluge of sin, so nothing can be expected from God but a deluge 
 of wrath; and what will you do when that shall come?" Note, Those that 
 walk in bad ways would do well to consider the tendency of them both to 
 greater sin and utter ruin. An end will come; the end of a wicked life 
 will come, when it will be all called over again, and without doubt 
 will be bitterness in the latter end.</P>
