 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The scope of this chapter is the same with that of the foregoing 
 chapter, to discover the sin both of Israel and Judah, and to denounce 
 the judgments of God against them. 

 I. They are called to hearken to the charge, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:1,8">ver. 1, 8</A>.

 II. They are accused of many sins, which are here aggravated. 

 1. Persecution,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 2. Spiritual whoredom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>.

 3. Pride, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:5">ver. 5</A>.
 
 4. Apostasy from God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:7">ver. 7</A>.

 5. The tyranny of the princes, and the tameness of the people in
 submitting to it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:10,11">ver. 10, 11</A>.

 III. They are threatened with God's displeasure for their sins; he
 knows all their wickedness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:3">ver. 3</A>)

 and makes known his wrath against them for it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:9">ver. 9</A>.

 1. They shall fall in their iniquity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:5">ver. 5</A>.

 2. God will forsake them,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:6">ver. 6</A>.

 3. Their portions shall be devoured,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:7">ver. 7</A>.

 4. God will rebuke them, and pour out his wrath upon them,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:9,10">ver. 9, 10</A>.
 
 5. They shall be oppressed,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:11">ver. 11</A>.

 6. God will be as a moth to them in secret judgments 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:12">ver. 12</A>)

 and as a lion in public judgments,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:14">ver. 14</A>.

 IV. They are blamed for the wrong course they took under their
 afflictions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:13">ver. 13</A>.

 V. It is intimated that they shall at length take a right course, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:15">ver. 15</A>.

 The more generally these things are expressed of so much the more 
 general use they are for our learning, and particularly for our 
 admonition.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and
 give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment <I>is</I> toward you,
 because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon
 Tabor.
 &nbsp; 2  And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I
 <I>have been</I> a rebuker of them all.
 &nbsp; 3  I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O
 Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, <I>and</I> Israel is defiled.
 &nbsp; 4  They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for
 the spirit of whoredoms <I>is</I> in the midst of them, and they have
 not known the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 5  And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore
 shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall
 fall with them.
 &nbsp; 6  They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; but they shall not find <I>him;</I> he hath withdrawn
 himself from them.
 &nbsp; 7  They have dealt treacherously against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: for they have
 begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with
 their portions.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. All orders and degrees of men are cited to appear and answer to such 
 things as shall be laid to their charge 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>Hear you this, O priests!</I> whether <I>in holy orders</I> (as 
 those in Judah, and perhaps many in Israel too, for in the ten tribes 
 there were divers cities of priests and Levites, who, it is probable, 
 staid in their own lot after the revolt of the ten tribes and did so 
 much of their office as might be done at a distance from the temple) or 
 <I>pretending holy orders,</I> as the priests of the calves, who, some 
 think, are included here. "Hearken, <I>you house of Israel,</I> the 
 common people, and <I>give ear, O house of the king!</I>" let them all 
 take notice, for they have all contributed to the national guilt, and 
 they shall all share in the national judgments. Note, If neither the 
 sanctity of the priesthood nor the dignity of the royal family will 
 prevail to keep out sin, it cannot be expected that they should avail 
 to keep out wrath. If the priests, and the house of the king, though 
 they bear such noble characters, sin like others, their noble 
 characters will not excuse them, but they must smart like others. Nor 
 shall it be any plea for <I>the house of Israel</I> that they were 
 misled by their priests and princes, but they shall receive their doom 
 with them, and neither their meanness nor their multitude shall be 
 their exemption.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Witness is produced against them, one instead of a thousand; it is 
 God's omniscience 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from me.</I> They have 
 <I>not known the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 but the Lord has known them, knows their true character however 
 disguised, knows their secret wickedness however concealed. Note, Men's 
 rejecting the knowledge of God will not secure them from his knowledge 
 of them; and when he contends with them he will prove their sins upon 
 them by his own knowledge, so that is will be in vain to plead <I>Not 
 guilty.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Very bad things are laid to their charge. 

 1. They had been very ingenious and very industrious to draw people
 either into sin or into trouble: You have been <I>a snare on Mizpah, 
 and a net spread upon Tabor</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 that is, such snares and nets as the huntsmen used to lay upon those 
 mountains in pursuit of their game. When the worship of the calves was 
 set up in Israel the patrons of that idolatry, and sticklers for it, 
 contrived by all possible arts and wiles to draw men into it and 
 reconcile those to it that at first had a dread of it. Note, Those
 that allure and entice men to sin, however they may pretend friendship 
 and good-will, are to be looked upon as <I>snares and nets</I> to them, 
 and <I>their hands as bands,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:26">Eccl. vii. 26</A>.

 But to those whom they could not seduce into sin they were as a net and
 a snare to bring them into trouble. Some think it was their practice to 
 set spies in the road, and particularly upon the mountains of Mizpah 
 and Tabor, at the times of the solemn feasts at Jerusalem, to watch if 
 any of their people who were piously affected went thither, and to 
 inform against them, that they might be prosecuted for it, thus doing 
 the devil's work, who disquiets those whom he cannot debauch.

 2. They had been both very crafty and very cruel in carrying on their 
 designs

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>The revolters are profound to make slaughter.</I> Note, Those who 
 have themselves apostatized from the truths of God are often the most 
 subtle and barbarous persecutors of those who still adhere to them. 
 Nothing will serve them but to <I>make slaughter</I> (it is the blood 
 of the saints that they thirst after): and with the serpent's sting 
 they have his head; they are <I>profound</I> to do it. O the depth of 
 <I>the depths of Satan,</I> of the wickedness of his agents, of those 
 that have <I>deeply revolted!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+31:6">Isa. xxxi. 6</A>.

 Now that which aggravated this was the many reproofs and warnings that
 had been given them: <I>Though I have been a rebuker of them all.</I> 
 The prophet had been so, a reprover by office. He had many a time told 
 them of the evil of their ways and doings, had dealt plainly <I>with 
 them all,</I> and had not spared either the priests or the house of the 
 king. God himself had been <I>a rebuker of them all</I> by their own 
 consciences and by his providences. Note, Sins against reproof are 
 doubly sinful,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+29:1">Prov. xxix. 1</A>.
 
 3. They had <I>committed whoredom,</I> had defiled their own bodies 
 with fleshly lusts, had defiled their own souls with the worship of 
 idols, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 This God was a witness to, though secretly committed and artfully 
 palliated. Nay, the piercing eye of God saw <I>the spirit of 
 whoredom</I> that was <I>in the midst of them,</I> their secret 
 inclination and disposition to those sins, the love they had to their 
 sins, and the dominion their sins had over them, how much they were 
 under the power of a <I>spirit of whoredom,</I> that <I>root of 
 bitterness</I> which bore all this gall and wormwood, that corrupt and 
 poisoned fountain. 

 4. They had no disposition at all to come into acquaintance and 
 communion with God. The <I>spirit of whoredoms,</I> having <I>caused 
 them to err</I> from him, keeps them wandering endlessly,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 (1.) They <I>have not known the Lord,</I> nor desire to know him, but 
 have rather declined, nay dreaded, the knowledge of him, for that would 
 disturb them in their sinful ways. 

 (2.) Therefore <I>they will not frame their doings to turn to their 
 God,</I> by which it appeared that they did not know him aright. This 
 intimates their obstinate persistence in their apostasy from God; they 
 would not <I>turn to God,</I> though he was <I>their God,</I> theirs in 
 covenant, by whose name they had been called, and whom they were bound 
 to <I>serve.</I> They would not return to the worship of him, from 
 which they had turned aside. Nay, <I>they would not frame their doings
 to turn to God.</I> They would not <I>consider their ways,</I> nor 
 dispose themselves into a serious temper, nor apply their minds to 
 think of those things that would bring them to God. It is true we 
 cannot by our own power, without the special grace of God, turn to him; 
 but we may by the due improvement of our faculties, and the common aids 
 of his Spirit, <I>frame our doings</I> to turn to him. Those that will 
 not do this, that <I>prepare not their hearts to seek the Lord</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:14">2 Chron. xii. 14</A>),

 owe it to themselves that they are not turned; they die because they
 will die; and to those that will do this further grace shall not be 
 wanting.

 (5.) They were guilty of notorious arrogancy, and insolence in sin 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>The pride of Israel doth testify to his face,</I> doth witness 
 against him that he is a rebel to God and his government. The
 <I>spirit of whoredoms</I> which was <I>in the midst of them</I> showed 
 itself in the gaiety and gaudiness of their worship, as a harlot is 
 known by her attire, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+7:10">Prov. vii. 10</A>.

 The wantonness of her dress testifies to her face that she is not a 
 modest woman. Or their pride in confronting the prophets God sent them 
 and the message they brought 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+43:2">Jer. xliii. 2</A>),

 or a haughty scornful conduct towards their brethren and those that
 were under them, <I>witnessed against</I> them that they were not God's 
 people and justified God in all the humbling judgments he brought upon 
 them. His pride testifies <I>in his face;</I> so some read it, agreeing 
 with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:9">Isa. iii. 9</A>,

 <I>The show of their countenance doth witness against them.</I> They
 have that <I>proud look</I> which <I>the Lord hates.</I>

 (6.) They departed from God to idols, and bred up their children in 
 idolatry 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>They have dealt treacherously against the Lord,</I> as a wife, who, 
 in contempt of the marriage covenant, forsakes her husband, and lives 
 in adultery with another. Thus those who are guilty of spiritual 
 idolatry, whose god is their money, whose god is their belly, <I>deal 
 treacherously against the Lord;</I> they violate their engagements to 
 him and frustrate his expectations from them. Note, Wilful sinners are 
 treacherous dealers. <I>They have begotten strange children,</I> that 
 is, their children which they have begotten are estranged from God, and 
 trained up in a false way of worship; they are a spurious brood, as 
 <I>children of fornication</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:41">John viii. 41</A>),

 whom God will disown. Note, Those deal treacherously with God indeed
 who not only turn from following him themselves but train up their 
 children in wicked ways.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Very sad things are made to be their doom. In general 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),
 
 "<I>Judgment is towards you.</I> God is coming forth to contend with 
 you, and to testify his displeasure against you for your sins." It is 
 time to hearken when judgment is towards us. In particular,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They shall <I>fall in their iniquity.</I> This follows upon their 
 <I>pride testifying to their face</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 <I>Therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity.</I> Note, 
 Pride will have a fall; it is the certain presage and forerunner of it. 
 Those that exalt themselves shall be abased. The face in which pride 
 testifies shall be filled with confusion. They shall not only fall, but 
 fall in their iniquity, the saddest fall of any. Their pride kept them 
 from repenting of their iniquity, and therefore they shall fall in it. 
 Note, Those that are not humbled for their sins are likely to perish 
 for ever in their sins. It is added, <I>Judah also shall fall with
 them</I> in her iniquity. As the ten tribes were carried captive into 
 Assyria, for their idolatry, so the two tribes, in process of time, 
 were carried into Babylon for following their bad example; but the 
 former fell and were utterly cast down, the latter fell and were raised 
 up again. Judah had the temple and priesthood, and yet these shall not 
 secure them, but, if they sin with Israel and Ephraim, with them they 
 shall fall.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They shall fall short of God's favour when they profess to seek it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the 
 Lord,</I> but in vain; <I>they shall not find him.</I> This seems to be 
 spoken principally of Judah, when they fell into their iniquity, and 
 when they fell in their iniquity.

 (1.) When they fell into their iniquity they <I>sought the Lord;</I> 
 but they did not <I>seek him only,</I> and therefore he was not 
 <I>found of them.</I> When they worshipped strange gods, yet they kept 
 up the show and shadow of the worship of the true God; they went as 
 usual, at the solemn feasts, <I>with their flocks and herds to seek the 
 Lord;</I> but their hearts were not <I>upright with him,</I> because 
 they were not <I>entire for him,</I> and therefore he would not accept 
 them; for <I>then</I> only shall we find him when we <I>seek him with 
 our whole heart,</I> not divided between God and Baal, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:3">Ezek. xiv. 3</A>.

 (2.) When they fell in their iniquity, or found themselves falling by 
 it, they <I>sought the Lord;</I> but they did not seek him 
 <I>early,</I> and therefore he will not be found of them. They shall 
 see ruin coming upon them, and shall then, in their distress, flee to 
 God, and think to make him their friend with burnt-offerings and 
 sacrifices; but it will be too late then to turn away his wrath when 
 <I>the decree has gone forth.</I> Even Josiah's reformation did not 
 prevail to <I>turn away the wrath of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:25,26">2 Kings xxiii. 25, 26</A>.

 Those that go <I>with their flocks and their herds</I> only to seek the
 Lord, and not with their hearts and souls, cannot expect to find him, 
 for his favour is not to be purchased with <I>thousands of rams.</I> 
 Nor shall those speed who do not seek the Lord <I>while he may be 
 found,</I> for there is a time when he will not be found. They shall 
 not find him, for he has withdrawn himself; he will not be enquired of 
 by them, but will turn a deaf ear to their sacrifices. See how much it 
 is our concern to seek God early, now while the accepted time is, and 
 the day of salvation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They and their portions shall all be swallowed up. They have 
 <I>dealt treacherously against the Lord,</I> and have thought to 
 strengthen themselves in it by their alliances with strange children; 
 but <I>now shall a month devour them with their portions,</I> that is, 
 their estates and inheritances, all those things which they have taken, 
 and taken up with, as their portion; or by their <I>portions</I> is 
 meant their idols, whom they chose for their portion instead of God. 
 Note, Those that make an idol of the world, by taking it for their 
 portion, will themselves perish with it. A <I>month</I> shall 
 <I>devour</I> them, or eat them up--a certain time prefixed, and a short
 time. When God's judgments begin with them they shall soon make an end; 
 one month will do their business. How much may a body be weakened by 
 one month's sickness, or a kingdom wasted by one month's war! <I>Three 
 shepherds</I> (says God) <I>I cut off in one month,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:8">Zech. xi. 8</A>.
 
 Note, The judgments of God sometimes make quick work with a sinful
 people. A month devours more, and more portions, than many years can 
 repair.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, <I>and</I> the trumpet in Ramah: cry
 aloud <I>at</I> Beth-aven, after thee, O Benjamin.
 &nbsp; 9  Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the
 tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.
 &nbsp; 10  The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound:
 <I>therefore</I> I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.
 &nbsp; 11  Ephraim <I>is</I> oppressed <I>and</I> broken in judgment, because he
 willingly walked after the commandment.
 &nbsp; 12  Therefore <I>will</I> I <I>be</I> unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the
 house of Judah as rottenness.
 &nbsp; 13  When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah <I>saw</I> his wound,
 then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet
 could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.
 &nbsp; 14  For I <I>will be</I> unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion
 to the house of Judah: I, <I>even</I> I, will tear and go away; I will
 take away, and none shall rescue <I>him.</I>
 &nbsp; 15  I will go <I>and</I> return to my place, till they acknowledge
 their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will
 seek me early.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A loud alarm sounded, giving notice of judgments coming 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):
 
 <I>Blow you the cornet in Gibeah</I> and <I>in Ramah,</I> two cities 
 near together in the confines of the two kingdoms of Judah and Israel, 
 Gibeah a frontier-town of the kingdom of Judah, Ramah of Israel; so 
 that the warning is hereby sent into both kingdoms. "<I>Cry aloud at 
 Beth-aven,</I> or Bethel, which place seems to be already seized upon 
 by the enemy, and therefore the trumpet is not sounded there, but you 
 hear the outcries of those that shout for mastery, mixed with theirs 
 that are overcome." Let them <I>cry aloud, "After thee, O Benjamin!</I> 
 comes the enemy. The tribe of Ephraim is already vanquished, and the 
 enemy will be upon thy back, O Benjamin! in a little time; thy turn 
 comes next. The cup of trembling shall go round." The prophet had 
 described God's controversy with them as a trial at law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:1"><I>ch.</I> iv. 1</A>);

 here he describes it as a trial by battle; and here also <I>when he
 judges he will overcome.</I> Let all therefore prepare to meet their 
 God. He had before spoken of the judgments as certain; here he speaks 
 of them as near; and, when they are apprehended as just at the door, 
 they are very startling and awakening. The blowing of this cornet is 
 explained, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 <I>Among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely 
 be,</I> that which is <I>true</I> or <I>certain,</I> so the word is. 
 Note, The destruction of impenitent sinners is a thing which shall 
 surely be; it is not mere talk, to frighten them, but it is an 
 irrevocable sentence. And it is a mercy to us that it is <I>made 
 known</I> to us, that we have timely warning given us of it, that we 
 may <I>flee from the wrath to come.</I> It is the privilege of the 
 tribes of Israel that, as they are told their duty, so they are told 
 their danger, by the oracles of God committed to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The ground of God's controversy with them. 

 1. He has a quarrel with <I>the princes of Judah,</I> because they were
 daring leaders in sin,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 They are <I>like those that remove the bound,</I> or the ancient 
 land-marks. God has given them his law, to be a fence about his own 
 property; but they have sacrilegiously broken through it, and set it 
 aside; they have encroached even upon God's rights, have trampled upon 
 the distinctions between good and evil, and the most sacred obligations 
 of reason and equity, thinking, because they were princes, that they 
 might do any thing, <I>Quicquid libet, licet--Their will was a law.</I> Or it 
 may be understood of their invading the liberty and property of the 
 subject for the advancing of the prerogative, which was like removing 
 the ancient land-marks. Some have observed that the princes of Judah 
 were more absolute, and assumed a more arbitrary power, than the 
 princes of Israel did; now, for this, God has a controversy with them: 
 <I>I will pour out my wrath upon them like water,</I> in great 
 abundance, like the waters of the flood, which were poured upon the 
 <I>giants</I> of the <I>old world,</I> for the violence which the earth 
 was filled with through them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:13">Gen. vi. 13</A>.

 Note, There are <I>bounds</I> which even princes themselves must not
 remove, bounds both of religion and justice, which they are limited by, 
 and, if they break through them, they must know that there is a God 
 above them that will call them to account for it.

 2. He has a quarrel with the <I>people of Ephraim,</I> because they 
 were sneaking followers in sin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>He willingly walked after the commandment,</I> that is, the 
 commandment of Jeroboam and the succeeding kings of Israel, who obliged 
 all their subjects by a law to worship the calves at Dan and Bethel, 
 and never to go up to Jerusalem to worship. This was <I>the 
 commandment;</I> it was the law of the land, and backed with reasons of 
 state; and the people not only walked after it in a blind implicit 
 obedience to authority, but they willingly walked after it, from a 
 secret antipathy they had to the worship of idols. Note, An easy 
 compliance with the commandments of men that thwart the commandments of 
 God ripens a people for ruin as much as any thing. And the punishment 
 of the sequacious disobedience (if I may so call it) answers to the 
 sin; for it is for this that <I>Ephraim is oppressed and broken in 
 judgment,</I> has all his civil rights and liberties broken in upon and 
 trodden down; and,

 (1.) It is just with God that it should be so, that those who betray 
 God's property should lose their own, that those who subject their 
 consciences to an infallible judge, and an arbitrary power, should have 
 enough of both. 

 (2.) There is a natural tendency in the thing itself towards it. 
 <I>Those</I> that <I>willingly walk after the commandment,</I> even 
 when it walks contrary to the command of God, will find the commandment 
 an encroaching thing, and that the more power is given it the more it 
 will claim. Note, Nothing gives greater advantage to a mastiff-like 
 tyranny, that is fierce and furious, than a spaniel-like submission, 
 that is fawning and flattering. Thus is <I>Ephraim oppressed and broken 
 in judgment,</I> that is, he is wronged under a face and colour of 
 right. Note, It is a sad and sore judgment upon any people to be 
 oppressed under pretence of having justice done them. This explains the 
 threatening 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>,

 <I>Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke.</I> Note, Daring 
 sinners must expect that a day of rebuke will come, and such a day of 
 rebuke as will make them desolate, will deprive them of the comfort of 
 all they have and all they hope for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The different methods that God would take both with Judah and 
 Ephraim, sometimes one method and sometimes the other, and sometimes 
 both together, or rather by which, first the one and then the other, he 
 would advance towards their complete ruin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He would begin with less judgments, which should sometimes work 
 silently and insensibly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>I will be</I> (that is, my providences shall be) <I>unto Ephraim as 
 a moth;</I> nay (as it might better be supplied), they <I>are unto 
 Ephraim as a moth,</I> for it is such <I>a sickness</I> as Ephraim now 
 sees, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Note, The judgments of God are sometimes to a sinful people <I>as a 
 moth,</I> and <I>as rottenness,</I> or as <I>a worm.</I> The former 
 signifies the little animals that breed in clothes, the latter those 
 that breed in wood; as these consume the clothes and the wood, so shall 
 the judgments of God consume them.

 (1.) Silently, so as not to make any noise in the world, nay, so as 
 they themselves shall not be sensible of it; they shall think 
 themselves safe and thriving, but, when they come to look more narrowly 
 into their state, shall find themselves wasting and decaying.

 (2.) Slowly, and with long delays and intervals, that he may give them 
 <I>space to repent.</I> Many a nation, as well as many a person, in the 
 prime of its time, dies of a consumption. 

 (3.) Gradually. God comes upon sinners with less judgments, so to 
 prevent greater, if they will be wise and take warning; he comes upon 
 them step by step, to show he is not willing that they should perish. 
 
 (4.) The moth breeds in the clothes, and the worm or rottenness in the
 wood; thus sinners are consumed by a fire of their own kindling.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. When it appeared that those had not done their work he would come 
 upon them with greater 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and to the house of Judah as a 
 young lion,</I> though Judah is himself, in Jacob's blessing, a 
 <I>lion's whelp.</I> Lest any should think his power weakened, because 
 he was said to be <I>as a moth</I> to them, he says that he will now be 
 as <I>a lion</I> to them, not only to frighten them with his roaring, 
 but to pull them to pieces. Note, If less judgments prevail not to do 
 their work, it may be expected that God will send greater. 
 <I>Christ</I> is sometimes a lion of the tribe of Judah, here he is a 
 lion against that tribe. See what God will do to a people that are 
 secure in sin: <I>Even I will tear.</I> He seems to glory in it, as his 
 prerogative, to be able to <I>destroy,</I> as the <I>alone 
 lawgiver,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:12">Jam. iv. 12</A>.

 "<I>I, even I,</I> will take the work into my own hands; I <I>say
 it</I> that will <I>do it.</I>" There is a more immediate work of God 
 in some judgments than in others. <I>I will tear, and go away.</I> He 
 will go away,

 (1.) As not fearing them; he will go away in state, and with a majestic 
 face, as the lion from his prey. 

 (2.) As not helping them. If God tear by afflicting providences, and 
 yet by his graces and comforts stays with us, it is well enough; but 
 our condition is sad indeed if he <I>tear</I> and <I>go away,</I> if, 
 when he deprives us of our creature comforts, he does himself depart 
 from us. When he goes away he will take away all that is valuable and 
 dear, for, when God goes, all good goes along with him. He will take 
 away, <I>and none shall rescue him,</I> as the prey cannot be rescued 
 from the lion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:8">Mic. v. 8</A>.

 Note, None can be delivered out of the hands of God's justice but those
 that are delivered into the hands of his grace. It is in vain for a man 
 to strive with his Maker.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The different effects of those different methods. 

 1. When God contended with them by less judgments they neglected him,
 and sought to creatures for relief, but sought in vain,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 When God was to them <I>as a moth,</I> and <I>as rottenness,</I> they 
 perceived <I>their sickness</I> and <I>their wound;</I> after a while 
 they found themselves going down the hill, and that they were 
 behind--hand in their affairs, their estate was sensibly decaying, and 
 then they sent <I>to the Assyrian,</I> to come in to their assistance, 
 made their court to king Jareb, which some think, was one of the names 
 of Pul, or Tiglathpileser, kings of Assyria, to whom both Israel and 
 Judah applied for relief in their distress, hoping by an alliance with 
 them to repair and re-establish their declining interests. Note, Carnal 
 hearts, in time of trouble, see their sickness and see their wound, but 
 do not see the sin that is the cause of it, nor will be brought to 
 acknowledge that, no, nor to acknowledge the hand of God, his <I>mighty 
 hand,</I> much less his righteous hand, in their trouble; and 
 therefore, instead of going the next way to the Creator, who could 
 relieve them, they take a great deal of pains to go about to creatures, 
 who can do them no service. Those who repent not that they have 
 offended God by their sins are loth to be beholden to him in their 
 afflictions, but would rather seek relief any where than with him. And 
 what is the consequence? <I>Yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of
 your wound.</I> Note, Those who neglect God, and seek to creatures for 
 help, will certainly be disappointed; those who depend upon them for 
 support will find them, not <I>foundations,</I> but <I>broken 
 reeds;</I> those who depend upon them for supply will find them, not 
 <I>fountains,</I> but <I>broken cisterns;</I> those who depend upon 
 them for comfort and a cure will find them <I>miserable comforters,</I> 
 and <I>physicians of no value.</I> The kings of Assyria, whom Judah and 
 Israel sought unto, <I>distressed them</I> and <I>helped them not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:16,28">2 Chron. xxviii. 16, 28</A>.

 Some make king <I>Jareb</I> to signify the <I>great, potent,</I> or
 <I>magnificent king,</I> for they built much upon his power; others 
 <I>the king that will plead,</I> or <I>should plead,</I> for they built 
 much upon his wisdom and eloquence, and in his interesting himself in 
 their affairs. They had sent him <I>a present</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:6"><I>ch.</I> x. 6</A>),

 a good fee, and, having so retained him of counsel for them, they
 doubted not of his fidelity to them; but he deceived them, as an arm of 
 flesh does those that trust in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:5,6">Jer. xvii. 5, 6</A>.

 2. When, to convince them of their folly, God brought greater judgments
 upon them, then they would at length be forced to apply to him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 When he has <I>torn</I> as a <I>lion,</I>

 (1.) He will leave them: <I>I will go and return to my place,</I> to 
 heaven, or to the mercy-seat, the throne of grace, which is his glory. 
 When God punishes sinners he <I>comes out of his place</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:21">Isa. xxvi. 21</A>);

 but, when he designs them favour, he <I>returns to his place,</I> where
 he <I>waits to be gracious,</I> upon their submission. Or he will
 <I>return to his place</I> when he has corrected them, as not regarding 
 them, hiding his face from them, and not taking notice of their 
 troubles or prayers; and this for their further humiliation, till they 
 are qualified in some measure for the returns of his favour.

 (2.) He will at length work upon them, and bring them home to himself, 
 by their afflictions, which is the thing he waits for; and then he will 
 no longer withdraw from them. Two things are here mentioned as 
 instances of their return:--

 [1.] Their penitent confession of sin: <I>Till they acknowledge their 
 offence;</I> marg. <I>Till they be guilty,</I> that is, till they be 
 sensible of their guilt, and be brought to own it, and humble 
 themselves before God for it. Note, When men begin to complain more of 
 their sins than of their afflictions then there begins to be some hope 
 of them; and this is that which God requires of us, when we are under 
 his correcting hand, that we own ourselves in a fault and justly 
 corrected.

 [2.] Their humble petition for the favour of God: Till they <I>seek my
 face,</I> which, it may be expected, they will do when they are brought 
 to the last extremity, and they have tried other helpers in vain.
 <I>In their affliction they will seek me early,</I> that is, diligently 
 and earnestly, and with great importunity; and if they seek him thus, 
 and be sincere in it, though it might be called seeking him late, 
 because it was long ere they were brought to it, yet it is not too 
 late, nay, he is pleased to call it seeking him early, so willing is he 
 to make the best of true penitents in their return to him. Note, When 
 we are under the convictions of sin, and the corrections of the rod, 
 our business is to seek God's face; we must desire the knowledge of 
 him, and an acquaintance with him, that he may manifest himself to us, 
 and for us, in token of his being at peace with us. And it may 
 reasonably be expected that affliction will bring those to God that had 
 long gone astray from him, and kept at a distance. <I>Therefore</I> God 
 for a time turns away from us, that he may turn us to himself, and then 
 return to us. <I>Is any among you afflicted? Let him pray.</I></P>
