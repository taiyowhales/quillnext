 At this chapter begins another sermon, which is continued to the end of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:1-17"><I>ch.</I> xi.</A>

 It is called, "The burden of the word of the Lord," for every word of
 God has weight in it to those who regard it, and will be a heavy weight 
 upon those who do not, a dead weight. Here is, 

 I. A prophecy against the Jews' unrighteous neighbours--the Syrians,
 Tyrians, Philistines, and others 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>),

 with an intimation of mercy to some of them, in their conversion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:7">ver. 7</A>),
 
 and a promise of mercy to God's people, in their protection, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:8">ver. 8</A>.
 
 II. A prophecy of their righteous King, the Messiah, and his coming, 
 with a description of him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:9">ver. 9</A>)

 and of his kingdom, the nature and extent of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:10">ver. 10</A>.

 III. An account of the obligation the Jews lay under to Christ for 
 their deliverance out of their captivity in Babylon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:11,12">ver. 11, 12</A>.

 IV. A prophecy of the victories and successes God would grant to the 
 Jews over their enemies, as typical of our great deliverance by Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:13-15">ver. 13-15</A>.

 V. A promise of great plenty, and joy, and honour, which God had in 
 reserve for his people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:16,17">ver. 16, 17</A>),

 which was written for their encouragement.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 The burden of the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in the land of Hadrach,
 and Damascus <I>shall be</I> the rest thereof: when the eyes of man,
 as of all the tribes of Israel, <I>shall be</I> toward the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 2 And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon,
 though it be very wise.
 &nbsp; 3 And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up
 silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.
 &nbsp; 4 Behold, the Lord will cast her out, and he will smite her
 power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire.
 &nbsp; 5 Ashkelon shall see <I>it,</I> and fear; Gaza also <I>shall see it,</I>
 and be very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be
 ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall
 not be inhabited.
 &nbsp; 6 And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the
 pride of the Philistines.
 &nbsp; 7 And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his
 abominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even
 he, <I>shall be</I> for our God, and he shall be as a governor in
 Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.
 &nbsp; 8 And I will encamp about mine house because of the army,
 because of him that passeth by, and because of him that
 returneth: and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for
 now have I seen with mine eyes.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 After the precious promises we had in the foregoing chapter of favour 
 to God's people, their persecutors, who hated them, come to be reckoned 
 with, those particularly that bordered close upon them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The Syrians had been bad neighbours to Israel, and God had a 
 controversy with them. The word of the Lord shall be a <I>burden in the 
 land of Hadrach,</I> that is, of <I>Syria,</I> but it does not appear 
 why it was so called. That that kingdom is meant is plain, because
 Damascus, the metropolis of that kingdom, is said to be the <I>rest</I> 
 of this burden; that is, the judgments here threatened shall light and 
 lie upon that city. Those are miserable upon whom the burden of the 
 word of the Lord rests, upon whom <I>the wrath of God abides</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:36">John iii. 36</A>);

 for it is a weight that they can neither shake off nor bear up under.
 There are those whom God <I>causes his fury to rest</I> upon. Those
 whom the wrath of God makes its mark it will be sure to hit; those whom
 it makes its rest it will be sure to sink. And the reason of this
 burden's resting on Damascus is because <I>the eyes of man, as of all
 the tribes of Israel</I> (or rather, <I>even of all the tribes of
 Israel</I>), are <I>towards the Lord,</I> because the people of God by
 faith and prayer look up to him for succour and relief and depend upon
 him to take their part against their enemies. Note, It is a sign that
 God is about to appear remarkably for his people when he raises their
 believing expectations from him and dependence upon him, and when by
 his grace he turns them from idols to himself. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+17:7,8">Isa. xvii. 7, 8</A>,

 <I>At that day shall a man look to his Maker.</I> It may be read thus,
 <I>for the Lord has an eye upon man, and upon all the tribes of 
 Israel;</I> he is King of nations as well as King of saints; he governs 
 the world as well as the church, and therefore will punish the sins of 
 other people as well as those of his own people. God is <I>Judge of 
 all,</I> and therefore all must give account of themselves to him. When 
 St. Paul was converted at Damascus, and preached there, and disputed 
 with the Jews, then the word of the Lord might be said to rest there, 
 and then <I>the eyes of men,</I> of other men besides <I>the tribes of 
 Israel,</I> began to be <I>towards the Lord;</I> see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:22">Acts ix. 22</A>.

 Hamath, a country which lay north of Damascus, and which we often read
 of, <I>shall border thereby</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 it joins to Syria, and shall share in the <I>burden of the word of the 
 Lord</I> that rests upon Damascus. The Jews have a proverb, <I>Woe to
 the wicked man, and woe to his neighbour,</I> who is in danger of 
 partaking in his sins and in his plagues. Woe to <I>the land of 
 Hadrach,</I> and woe to <I>Hamath that borders thereby.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Tyre and Zidon come next to be called to an account here, as in 
 other prophecies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:2-4"><I>v.</I> 2-4</A>.
 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Tyrus flourishing, thinking herself very safe, and ready to set 
 God's judgments, not only at a distance, but at defiance: for, 

 (1.) She is <I>very wise.</I> It is spoken ironically; she thinks 
 herself very wise, and able to outwit even the wisdom of God. It is 
 granted that her king is a great politician, and that her statesmen are 
 so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:3">Ezek. xxviii. 3</A>.

 But with all their wit and policy they shall not be able to evade the
 judgments of God when they come with commission; there is no 
 <I>wisdom</I> nor <I>counsel against the Lord;</I> nay, it is his 
 honour to take the wise in their own craftiness.

 (2.) She is very strong, and well fortified both by nature and art: 
 <I>Tyrus did build herself a strong-hold,</I> which she thought could 
 never be brought down nor got over. 

 (3.) She is very rich; and <I>money is a defence;</I> it is the sinews
 of war, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:12">Eccl. vii. 12</A>.

 By her vast trade she has <I>heaped up silver as the dust, and fine 
 gold as the mire of the streets,</I> that is, she has an abundance of 
 them, heaps of silver as common as heaps of sand,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+27:16">Job xxvii. 16</A>.

 Solomon made silver to be in Jerusalem as the <I>stones of the
 streets;</I> but Tyre went further, and made <I>fine gold</I> to be as 
 <I>the mire of the streets.</I> It were well if we could all learn so 
 to look upon it, in comparison with the merchandise of wisdom and grace 
 and the gains thereof.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Tyrus falling, after all. Her wisdom, and wealth, and strength, 
 shall not be able to secure her 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>The Lord will cast her out</I> of that strong-hold wherein she has 
 fortified herself, will <I>make her poor</I> (so some read it); there 
 have been instances of those that have fallen from the height of plenty 
 to the depth of poverty, and great riches have come to nothing. God 
 will <I>smite her power in the sea;</I> her being surrounded by the 
 water shall not secure her, but <I>she shall be devoured with fire,</I> 
 and burnt down to the ground. Tyrus, being seated in the midst of the 
 water, was, one would have thought, in danger of being some time or 
 other overflowed or washed away by that; yet God chooses to destroy it 
 by the contrary element. Sometimes he brings ruin upon his enemies by
 those means which they least suspect. Water enough was nigh at hand to 
 quench the flames of Tyre, and yet by them she shall be devoured; for 
 who can put out the fire which the breath of the Almighty blows up?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. God next contends with the Philistines, with their great cities 
 and great lords, that bordered southward upon Israel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They shall be alarmed and affrighted by the word of the Lord 
 lighting and resting upon Damascus 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>);

 the disgraces of Israel had many a time been <I>published in the 
 streets of Ashkelon,</I> and they had triumphed in them; but now 
 <I>Ashkelon shall see</I> the ruin of her friends and allies, and shall 
 <I>fear; Gaza also shall see it, and be very sorrowful, and Ekron,</I> 
 concluding that their own turns come next, now that the cup of 
 trembling goes round. What will become of their house when their 
 neighbour's is on fire? They had looked upon Tyre and Zidon as a 
 barrier to their country; but, when those strong cities were ruined, 
 their <I>expectations</I> from them <I>were ashamed,</I> as our 
 expectation from all creatures will be in the issue.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They shall themselves be ruined and wasted. 

 (1.) The government shall be dissolved: <I>The king shall perish from 
 Gaza,</I> not only the present king shall be cut off, but there shall 
 be no succession, no successor, 

 (2.) The cities shall be dispeopled: <I>Ashkelon shall not be 
 inhabited;</I> the rightful owners shall be expelled, either slain or 
 carried into captivity. 

 (3.) Foreigners shall take possession of their land and become masters
 of all its wealth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>A bastard shall dwell in Ashdod;</I> a spurious brood of strangers 
 shall enter upon the inheritances of the natives, which they have no 
 more right to than a bastard has to the estates of the legitimate 
 children. And thus God will <I>cut off the pride of the 
 Philistines,</I> all the strength and wealth which they prided 
 themselves in, and which were the ground of their confidence in 
 themselves and their contempt of the Israel of God. This prophecy of 
 the destruction of the Philistines, and of Damascus, and Tyre, was 
 accomplished, not long after this, by Alexander the Great, who ravaged 
 all these countries with his victorious army, took the cities, and 
 planted colonies in them, which Quintus Curtius gives a particular 
 account of in the history of his conquests. And some think he is meant 
 by the bastard that shall dwell in Ashdod, for his mother Olympia owned 
 him begotten in adultery, but pretended it was by Jupiter. The Jews 
 afterwards got ground of the Philistines, Syrians, and others of their 
 neighbours, took some of their cities from them and possessed their 
 countries, as appears by the histories of Josephus and the Maccabees, 
 and this was foretold before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+2:4,Ob+1:20">Zeph. ii. 4, &c.; Obad. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Some among them shall be converted, and brought home to God, by his 
 gospel and grace; so some understand 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>,

 as a promise, 

 (1.) That God would take away the sins of these nations--<I>their 
 blood</I> and <I>their abominations,</I> their cruelties and their 
 idolatries. God will part between them and these sins which they have 
 rolled under their tongue as a sweet morsel, and are as loth to part 
 with as men are to part with the meat out of their mouths, and which 
 they hold fast between their teeth. Nothing is too hard for the grace
 of God to do.

 (2.) That he would accept of a remnant of them for his own: <I>He that 
 remains shall be for our God.</I> God would preserve a remnant even of 
 these nations, that should be the monuments of his mercy and grace and 
 be set apart for him; and the disadvantages of their birth shall be no 
 bar to their acceptance with God, but a Philistine shall be as 
 acceptable to God, upon gospel-terms, as one of Judah, nay, as a 
 governor, or chief one, in Judah, and a man of Ekron shall be as a 
 Jebusite, or a man of Jerusalem, as a proselyted Jebusite, as Araunah 
 the Jebusite, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:16">2 Sam. xxiv. 16</A>.

 In Christ Jesus there is no distinction of nations, but all are one in
 him, all alike welcome to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. In all this God intends mercy for Israel, and it is in kindness to 
 them that God will deal thus with the neighbouring nations, to avenge 
 their quarrel for what is past and to secure them for the future.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Thus some understand the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:7">seventh verse</A>,

 as intimating, 

 (1.) That thus God would deliver his people from their bloody 
 adversaries, who hated them, and to whom they were an abomination, when 
 they were just ready to devour them and make a prey of them: I will 
 <I>take away his blood</I> (that is, the blood of Israel) out of the 
 mouth of the Philistines and <I>from between their teeth</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:12">Amos iii. 12</A>),

 when, in their hatred of them and enmity to them, they were greedily 
 devouring them.

 (2.) That lie would thus give them victory and dominion over them: And
 <I>he that remains</I> (that is, the remnant of Israel) <I>shall be for 
 our God,</I> shall be taken into his favour, shall own him and be owned 
 by him, and <I>he shall be as a governor in Judah;</I> though the Jews 
 have been long in servitude, they shall recover their ancient dignity, 
 and be victorious, as David and other governors in Judah formerly were; 
 and Ekron (that is, the Philistines) shall be as the Jebusites, and the 
 rest of the devoted nations, who were brought into subjection under 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. However, this is plainly the sense of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>,

 that God will take his people under his special protection, and 
 <I>therefore</I> will weaken their neighbours, that it may not be in 
 their power to do them a mischief: <I>I will encamp about my house 
 because of the army.</I> Note, God's house lies in the midst of an 
 enemy's country, and his church is as a lily among thorns; and 
 therefore God's power and goodness are to be observed in the special 
 preservation of it. The <I>camp of the saints,</I> being a little flock 
 in comparison with the numerous armies of the powers of darkness that 
 are set against it round about, would certainly be swallowed up if the 
 angels of God did not encamp about it, as they did about Elisha, to 
 deliver it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:9,Ps+34:7">Rev. xx. 9; Ps. xxxiv. 7</A>.

 When the times are unusually perilous, when armies are marching and 
 counter-marching, and all bearing ill-will to Zion, then Providence 
 will as it were double its guards upon the church of God, <I>because of 
 him that passes by and because of him that returns,</I> that whether he 
 return a conqueror or conquered he may do it no harm. And, as none
 that pass by shall hurt them, so <I>no oppressor shall pass through 
 them any more;</I> they shall have no enemy within themselves to rule 
 them with rigour, and <I>to make their lives bitter</I> to them <I>with 
 sore bondage,</I> as of old in Egypt. This was fulfilled when, for some 
 time after the struggles of the Maccabees, Judea was a free and 
 flourishing state, or perhaps when Alexander the Great, struck with an 
 awe of Jaddus the high priest, favoured the Jews, and took them under 
 his protection, at the same time when he wasted the neighbouring 
 countries. And the reason given for all this is, "<I>For now have I 
 seen with my eyes,</I> now have I carefully distinguished between my 
 people and other people, with whom before they seemed to have their lot 
 in common, and have made it to appear that I know those that are mine," 
 This agrees with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:15">Ps. xxxiv. 15</A>,

 <I>The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous;</I> now his eyes, which
 <I>run to and fro through the earth,</I> shall fix upon them, that he 
 may show himself tender of them, and <I>strong on their behalf,</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 That here begins a prophecy of the Messiah and his kingdom is plain 
 from the literal accomplishment of the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:9">ninth verse</A>

 in, and its express application to, Christ's riding in triumph into
 <I>Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:5,Joh+12:15">Matt. xxi. 5; John xii. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is notice given of the approach of the Messiah promised, as 
 matter of great joy to the Old-Testament church: <I>Behold, thy king 
 cometh unto thee.</I> Christ is a king, invested with regal powers and 
 prerogatives, a sovereign prince, an absolute monarch, having all power 
 both in heaven and on earth. He is Zion's king. God has <I>set him upon 
 his holy hill of Zion,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:6">Ps. ii. 6</A>.

 In Zion his glory as a king shines; thence <I>his law went forth,</I>
 even the <I>word of the Lord.</I> In the gospel-church his spiritual 
 kingdom is administered; it is by him that the ordinances of the church 
 are instituted, and its officers commissioned; and it is taken under 
 his protection; he fights the church's battles and secures its 
 interests, as its king. "This King has been long in coming, but now, 
 <I>behold, he cometh;</I> he is at the door. There are but a few ages 
 more to run out, and he that shall come will come. He <I>cometh unto 
 thee;</I> the Word will shortly be made flesh, and dwell within thy 
 borders; he will <I>come to his own.</I> And therefore <I>rejoice,</I> 
 rejoice <I>greatly,</I> and <I>shout for joy;</I> look upon it as 
 <I>good news,</I> and be assured it is true; please thyself to think 
 that he is coming, that he is on his way towards thee; and be ready to 
 go forth to meet him with acclamations of joy, as one not able to 
 conceal it, it is so great, nor ashamed to own it, it is so just; cry 
 <I>Hosanna</I> to him." Christ's approaches ought to be the church's 
 applauses.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is such a description of him as renders him very amiable in 
 the eyes of all his loving subjects, and his coming to them very 
 acceptable. 

 1. He is a righteous ruler; all his acts of government will be exactly
 according to the rules of equity, for <I>he is just.</I> 

 2. He is a powerful protector to all those that bear faith and true
 allegiance to him, for he <I>has salvation;</I> he has it in his power; 
 he has it to bestow upon all his subjects. He is the <I>God of 
 salvation;</I> treasures of salvation are in him. He is 
 <I>servatus</I>--<I>saving himself</I> (so some read it), rising out of 
 the grave by his own power and so qualifying himself to be our Saviour.

 (3.) He is a <I>meek, humble, tender Father</I> to all his subjects as
 his children; he is <I>lowly;</I> he is <I>poor</I> and 
 <I>afflicted</I> (so the word signifies), so it denotes the meanness of
 his condition; having <I>emptied himself,</I> he was <I>despised and 
 rejected of men.</I> But the evangelist translates it so as to express 
 the temper of his spirit: he is <I>meek,</I> not taking state upon him, 
 nor resenting injuries, but <I>humbling himself</I> from first to last, 
 condescending to the mean, compassionate to the miserable; this was a 
 bright and excellent character of him as a prophet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:29">Matt. xi. 29</A>,

 <I>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart</I>), and no less so
 <I>as a king.</I> It was a proof of this that, when he made his public 
 entry into his own city (and it was the only passage of his life that 
 had any thing in it magnificent in the eye of the world), he chose to 
 ride, not upon a stately horse, or in a chariot, as great men used to 
 ride, but <I>upon an ass,</I> a beast of service indeed, but a poor 
 silly and contemptible one, low and slow, and in those days ridden only 
 by the meaner sort of people; nor was it an ass fitted for use, but an 
 <I>ass's colt,</I> a little foolish unmanageable thing, that would be 
 more likely to disgrace his rider than be any credit to him; and that 
 not his own neither, nor helped off, as sometimes a sorry horse is, by 
 good furniture, for he had no saddle, no housings, no trappings, no 
 equipage, but his disciples' clothes thrown upon the colt;' for he 
 <I>made himself of no reputation</I> when he visited us in great 
 humility.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His kingdom is here set forth in the glory of it. This king has, 
 and will have, a kingdom, not of this world, but a spiritual kingdom, a 
 <I>kingdom of heaven.</I> 

 1. It shall not be set up and advanced by external force, by an arm of
 flesh or carnal weapons of warfare. No; he <I>will cut off the chariot 
 from Ephraim and the horses from Jerusalem</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 for he shall have no occasion for them while he himself rides upon an 
 ass. He will, in kindness to his people, cut off their horses and 
 chariots, that they may not cut themselves off from God by putting that 
 confidence in them which they should put in the power of God only. He 
 will himself undertake their protection, will himself be <I>a wall of 
 fire about Jerusalem</I> and give his angels charge concerning it 
 (those <I>chariots of fire and horses of fire</I>), and then the 
 chariots and horses they had in their service shall be discarded and 
 cut off as altogether needless. 

 2. It shall be propagated and established by the preaching of the
 gospel, the <I>speaking of peace to the heathen;</I> for Christ <I>came 
 and preached peace to those that were afar off and to those that were 
 nigh;</I> and so established his kingdom by proclaiming <I>on earth 
 peace,</I> and <I>good-will towards men.</I> 

 3. His kingdom, as far as it prevails in the minds of men and has the
 ascendant over them, will make them peaceable, and slay all enmities; 
 it will cut off the battle-bow, and <I>beat swords into 
 plough-shares.</I> It will not only command the peace, but will 
 <I>create the fruit of the lips, peace.</I>

 4. It shall extend itself to all parts of the world, in defiance of the
 opposition given to it. "The chariot and horse that come against
 Ephraim and Jerusalem, to oppose the progress of Zion's King, shall be 
 cut off; his gospel shall be preached to the world, and be received 
 among the heathen, so that <I>his dominion shall be from sea to sea, 
 and from the river even to the ends of the earth,</I> as was foretold 
 by David," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:8">Ps. lxxii. 8</A>.

 The preachers of the gospel shall carry it from one country, one
 island, to another, till some of the remotest corners of the world are 
 enlightened and reduced by it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Here is an account of the great benefit procured for mankind by the 
 Messiah, which is redemption from extreme misery, typified by the 
 deliverance of the Jews out of their captivity in Babylon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):
 
 "<I>As for thee also</I> (thee, O daughter of Jerusalem! or thee, O 
 Messiah the Prince!) <I>by the blood of thy covenant,</I> by force and 
 virtue of the covenant made with Abraham, sealed with the blood of 
 circumcision, and the covenant made with Israel at Mount Sinai, sealed 
 with the blood of sacrifices, in pursuance and performance of that 
 covenant, <I>I have</I> now of late <I>sent forth thy prisoners,</I> 
 thy captives out of Babylon, which was to them a most uncomfortable 
 place, as <I>a pit</I> in which was <I>no water.</I>" It was part of 
 the covenant that, if in the land of their captivity, they sought the 
 Lord, he would be found of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:42,44,45,De+30:4">Lev. xxvi. 42, 44, 45; Deut. xxx. 4</A>.

 It was <I>by the blood of that covenant,</I> typifying the blood of 
 Christ, in whom all God's covenants with man are yea and amen, that 
 they were released out of captivity; and this was but a shadow of the 
 great salvation wrought out by <I>thy King, O daughter of Zion!</I> 
 Note, A sinful state is a state of bondage; it is a spiritual prison; 
 it is a pit, or a dungeon, in which <I>there is no water,</I> no 
 comfort at all to be had. We are all by nature prisoners in this pit; 
 the <I>scripture has concluded</I> us all <I>under sin,</I> and bound 
 us over to the justice of God. God is pleased to deal upon new terms 
 with these prisoners, to enter into another covenant with them; the 
 blood of Christ is the blood of that covenant, purchased it for us and 
 all the benefits of it; by that blood of the covenant effectual 
 provision is made for the sending forth of these prisoners upon easy 
 and honourable terms, and proclamation made of <I>liberty to the 
 captives and the opening of the prison to those that were bound,</I> 
 like Cyrus's proclamation to the Jews in Babylon, which all those whose 
 spirits God stirs up will come and take the benefit of.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12 Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to

 made thee as the sword of a mighty man.

 and subdue with sling stones; and they shall drink, <I>and</I> make a
 noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, <I>and</I>
 as the corners of the altar.
 &nbsp; 16 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> their God shall save them in that day as the
 flock of his people: for they <I>shall be as</I> the stones of a
 crown, lifted up as an ensign upon his land.

 beauty! corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the
 maids.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet, having taught those that had returned out of captivity to 
 attribute their deliverance to the <I>blood of the covenant</I> and to 
 the promise of the Messiah (for they were so wonderfully helped because 
 that blessing was in them, was yet in the womb of their nation), now 
 comes to encourage them with the prospect of a joyful and happy 
 settlement, and of glorious times before them; and such a happiness 
 they did enjoy, in a great measure, for some time; but these promises 
 have their full accomplishment in the spiritual blessings of the gospel 
 which we enjoy by Jesus Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They are invited to look unto Christ, and flee unto him as their 
 city of refuge 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>Turn you to the strong-hold, you prisoners of hope.</I> The Jews 
 that had returned out of captivity into their own land were yet, in 
 effect, but <I>prisoners (We are servants this day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:36">Neh. ix. 36</A>),

 yet <I>prisoners of hope,</I> or <I>expectation,</I> for God had given
 them a <I>little reviving in their bondage,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+9:8">Ezra ix. 8, 9</A>.

 Those that yet continued in Babylon, detained by their affairs there,
 yet lived in hope some time or other to see their own land again. Now
 both these are directed to turn their eyes upon the Messiah, set before
 them in the promise as their strong-hold, to shelter themselves in him,
 and stay themselves upon him, for the perfecting of the mercy which by
 his grace, and for his sake, was so gloriously begun. <I>Look unto him,
 and be you saved,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:22">Isa. xlv. 22</A>.

 The promise of the Messiah was the strong-hold of the faithful long 
 before his coming; they saw his day at a distance and were glad, and 
 the believing expectation of the <I>redemption in Jerusalem</I> was 
 long the support and <I>consolation of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:25,38">Luke ii. 25, 38</A>.

 They, in their dangers and distresses, were ready to turn towards this 
 and the other creature for relief; but the prophets directed them still 
 to turn to Christ, and to comfort themselves with the joy of their king 
 coming to them with salvation. But, as their deliverance was typical
 of our redemption by Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 so this invitation to the strong-hold speaks the language of the 
 gospel-call. Sinners are prisoners, but they are prisoners of hope;
 their case is sad, but it is not desperate; yet now there is hope in 
 Israel concerning them. Christ is a strong-hold for them, a strong 
 tower, in whom they may be safe and quiet from the fear of the wrath of 
 God, the curse of the law, and the assaults of their spiritual enemies.
 To him they must turn by a lively faith; to him they must flee, and 
 trust in his name.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They are assured of God's favour to them: "<I>Even to day do I 
 declare,</I> when things are at the worst, and you think your case 
 deplorable to the last degree, yet I solemnly promise that <I>I will 
 render double unto thee,</I> to thee, O Jerusalem! to every one of you 
 prisoners of hope. I will give you comforts double to the sorrows you 
 have experienced, or blessings double to what I ever bestowed upon your 
 fathers, when their condition was at the best; the glory of your latter 
 state, as well as of your latter house, shall be greater, shall be 
 twice as great as that of your former." And so it was no otherwise than 
 by the coming of the Messiah, the preaching of his gospel, and the 
 setting up of his kingdom; these spiritual blessings in heavenly things 
 were double to what they had ever enjoyed in their most prosperous 
 state. As a pledge of this, in the fulness of time God here promises to 
 the Jews victory, plenty, and joy, in their own land, which yet should 
 be but a type and shadow of more glorious victories, riches, and joys, 
 in the kingdom of Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They shall triumph over their enemies. The Jews, after their return, 
 were surrounded with enemies on all sides. They were <I>as a speckled 
 bird;</I> all the birds of the field were against them. Their land lay 
 between the two potent kingdoms of Syria and Egypt, branches of the 
 Grecian monarchy, and what frequent dangers they should be in between 
 them was foretold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:1-45">Dan. xi</A>.

 But it is here promised that out of them all the Lord would deliver
 them; and this promise had its primary accomplishment in the times of 
 the Maccabees, when the Jews made head against their enemies, kept 
 their head above water, and, after many struggles and difficulties, 
 came to be head over them. It is promised,

 (1.) That they shall be instruments in God's hand for the defeating and 
 baffling of their persecutors: "I <I>have bent Judah for me,</I> as my 
 bow of steel; that <I>bow I have filled with Ephraim</I> as my arrows, 
 have drawn it up to its full bent, till the arrow be at the head;" for 
 some think that this is signified by the phrase of <I>filling the 
 bow.</I> The expressions here are very fine, and the figures lively. 
 Judah had been <I>taught the use of the bow</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:18">2 Sam. i. 18</A>),

 and Ephraim had been famous for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:9">Ps. lxxviii. 9</A>.

 But let them not think that they gain their successes by their own bow,
 for they themselves are no more than God's bow and his arrows, tools in 
 his hands, which he makes use of and manages as he pleases, which he 
 holds as his bow and directs to the mark as his arrows. The best and 
 bravest of men are but what God makes them, and do no more service than 
 he enables them to do. The preachers of the gospel were the bow in
 Christ's hand, with which he went forth, he went on, <I>conquering and 
 to conquer,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:2">Rev. vi. 2</A>.

 The following words explain this: <I>I have raised up</I> and animated 
 <I>thy sons, O Zion! against thy sons, O Greece!</I> This was fulfilled 
 when <I>against Antiochus,</I> one of the kings of the Grecian 
 monarchy, the people that knew their God were <I>strong</I> and <I>did 
 exploits,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:32">Dan. xi. 32</A>.

 And they in the hand of an almighty God were made <I>as the sword of a
 mighty man,</I> which none can stand before. Wicked men are said to be
 God's sword

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:13">Ps. xvii. 13</A>),

 and sometimes good men are made so; for he employs both as he pleases.

 (2.) That God will be captain, and commander-in-chief, over them, in 
 every expedition and engagement

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>The Lord shall be seen over them;</I> he shall make it appear that 
 he presides in their affairs, and that in all their motions they are 
 under his direction, as apparently, though not as sensibly, as he was 
 <I>seen over Israel</I> in the pillar of cloud and fire when he led 
 them through the wilderness. 

 [1.] Is their army to be raised, or mustered, and brought into the 
 field? <I>The Lord shall blow the trumpet,</I> to gather the forces 
 together, to proclaim the war, to sound the alarm, and to give 
 directions which way to march, which way to move; for, if God blow the 
 trumpet, it shall not give an uncertain sound, nor a feeble ineffectual 
 one.

 [2.] Is the army taking the field, and entering upon action? Whatever 
 enterprise the campaign is opened with, God shall go forth at the head 
 of their forces, <I>with whirlwinds of the south,</I> which were of 
 incredible swiftness and fierceness; and before these whirlwinds thy 
 sons, O Greece! shall be as chaff.

 [3.] Is the army actually engaged? God's <I>arrows shall go forth as 
 lightning,</I> so strongly, so suddenly, so irresistibly; his 
 <I>lightnings</I> shall go forth <I>as arrows</I> and <I>scattered 
 them,</I> that is, he <I>shot out his lightnings and discomfited 
 them.</I> This alludes to that which God had done for Israel of old 
 when he brought them out of Egypt, and into Canaan, and had its 
 accomplishment partly in the wonderful successes which the Jews had 
 against their neighbours that attacked them in the time of the 
 Maccabees, by the special appearances of the divine Providence for 
 them, and perfectly in the glorious victories gained by the cross of 
 Christ and the preaching of the cross over Satan and all the powers of 
 darkness, whereby we are made more than conquerors.

 [4.] Are they in danger of being overpowered by the enemy? <I>The Lord 
 of hosts shall defend them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);

 <I>The Lord their God shall save them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);

 so that their enemies shall not prevail over them, nor prey upon them. 
 God shall be unto them for defence as well as offence, <I>the shield of 
 their help</I> as well as <I>the sword of their excellency,</I> and 
 this as <I>the Lord of hosts,</I> who has power to defend them, and as 
 <I>their God,</I> who is engaged by promise to defend them, and by the 
 property he has in them. He shall save them in <I>that day,</I> that 
 critical dangerous day, <I>as the flock of his people,</I> with the 
 same care and tenderness that the shepherd protects his sheep with. 
 Those are safe whom God saves. 

 [5.] Did their enemies hope to swallow them up? It shall be turned upon 
 them, and they shall <I>devour</I> their enemies, and shall <I>subdue 
 with sling-stones,</I> for want of better weapons, those that come 
 forth against them. The <I>stones of the brook,</I> when God pleases, 
 shall do as great execution as the best train of artillery; for the 
 <I>stars in their courses</I> shall fight on the same side. Goliath was 
 subdued with a sling-stone. Having subdued, they shall <I>devour, shall 
 drink</I> the blood of their enemies, as it were, and, as conquerors 
 are wont to do, they shall <I>make a noise as through wine.</I> It is 
 usual for conquerors with loud huzzas and acclamations to glory in 
 their victories and proclaim them. We read of those that <I>shout for 
 mastery,</I> and of the <I>shout of a king</I> among God's people. They 
 shall be filled with blood and spoil, as the bowls and basins of the 
 temple, or the <I>corners of the altar,</I> were wont to be filled with 
 the blood of the sacrifices; for their enemies shall fall as victims to 
 divine justice.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They shall triumph in their God. They shall take the comfort and 
 give God the glory of their successes. So some read 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 <I>They shall eat</I> (that is, they shall quietly enjoy) what they 
 have got; God will give them power to eat it <I>after they have subdued 
 the sling-stones</I> (that is, their enemies that slung stones at 
 them), and <I>they shall drink and make a noise,</I> a joyful noise, 
 before the Lord their maker and protector, <I>as through wine,</I> as 
 men are merry at a banquet of wine. <I>Being not drunk with wine,
 wherein is excess,</I> but <I>filled with the Spirit,</I> they shall 
 <I>speak</I> to themselves and one another <I>in psalms, and hymns, and 
 spiritual songs,</I> as those that are drunk do with vain and foolish 
 songs, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:18,19">Eph. v. 18, 19</A>.

 And, in the fulness of their joy, they shall offer abundance of
 sacrifices to the honour of God, so that <I>they shall fill both the 
 bowls and the corners of the altar</I> with the fat and blood of their 
 sacrifices. And, when they thus triumph in their successes, their joy 
 shall terminate in God as their God, the God of their salvation. They 
 shall triumph,

 (1.) In the love he has for them, and the relation wherein they stand 
 to him, that they are <I>the flock of his people</I> and he is their 
 Shepherd, and that they are to him <I>as the stones of a crown,</I> 
 which are very precious and of great value, and which are kept under a 
 strong guard. Never was any king so pleased with the jewels of his 
 crown as God is, and will be, with his people, who are near and dear 
 unto him, and in whom he glories. They are a <I>crown of glory</I> and 
 a <I>royal diadem</I> in his hand, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:2,3">Isa. lxii. 2, 3</A>.

 And <I>they shall be mine, saith the Lord, in that day when I make up
 my jewels,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:17">Mal. iii. 17</A>.

 And <I>they shall be lifted up as an ensign upon his land,</I> as the
 royal standard is displayed in token of triumph and joy. God's people 
 are his glory; so he is pleased to make them, so he is pleased to 
 reckon them. He sets them up as a banner upon his own land, waging war 
 against those who hate him, to whom it is a flag of defiance, while it 
 is a centre of unity to all that love him, to all the children of God, 
 that are scattered abroad, who are invited to come and enlist 
 themselves under this banner,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:10,12">Isa. xi. 10, 12</A>.

 (2.) In the provision he makes for them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 This is the matter of their triumph 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>For how great is his goodness and how great is his beauty!</I> This 
 is the substance, this the burden, of the songs wherewith they shall 
 <I>make a noise</I> before the Lord. We are here taught, 

 [1.] To admire and praise the amiableness of God's being: <I>How great 
 is his beauty!</I> All the perfections of God's nature conspire to make 
 him infinitely lovely in the eyes of all that know him. They are to him 
 as the <I>stones of a crown;</I> but what is he to them? Our business 
 in the temple is to <I>behold the beauty of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:4">Ps. xxvii. 4</A>),
 
 and <I>how great is that beauty!</I> How far does it transcend all
 other beauties, particularly the <I>beauty of his holiness.</I> This 
 may refer to the Messiah, to Zion's <I>King</I> that <I>cometh.</I> See 
 <I>that king in his beauty</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:17">Isa. xxxiii. 17</A>),

 who is <I>fairer than the children of men,</I> the <I>fairest of ten
 thousand,</I> and <I>altogether lovely.</I> Though, in the eye of the 
 world, he had no form or comeliness, in the eye of faith how great is 
 his beauty!

 [2.] To admire and give thanks for the gifts of God's favour and grace, 
 his bounty as well as his beauty; for <I>how great is his goodness!</I> 
 How rich in mercy is he! How deep, how full, are its springs! How 
 various, how plenteous, how precious, are its streams! What a great
 deal of good does God do! How rich in mercy is he! Here is an instance 
 of his goodness to his people: <I>Corn shall make the young men 
 cheerful and new wine the maids;</I> that is, God will bless his people 
 with an abundance of the fruits of the earth. Whereas they had been 
 afflicted with scarcity to such a degree that the <I>young men</I> and 
 the <I>maidens</I> were ready to swoon and faint away for hunger and 
 thirst 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:12,21,4:7,8,5:10">Lam. ii. 12, 21; iv. 7, 8; v. 10</A>),

 now they shall have bread enough and to spare, not water only, but
 <I>wine, new wine,</I> which shall make the young people grow and be 
 cheerful, and (which some have observed to be the effect of plenty and 
 the cheapness of corn) the poor will be encouraged to marry, and 
 re-people the land, when they shall have wherewithal to maintain their 
 families. Note, What good gifts God bestows upon us we must serve him 
 cheerfully with, and must race the streams up to the fountain, and, 
 when we are refreshed with corn and wine, must say, <I>How great is his 
 goodness!</I></P>
