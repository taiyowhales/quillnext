 This chapter gives us a more particular account of the beginning of 
 Daniel's life, his original and education, than we have of any other of 
 the prophets. Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, began immediately with 
 divine visions; but Daniel began with the study of human learning, and 
 was afterwards honoured with divine visions; such variety of methods 
 has God taken in training up men for the service of his church. We have 
 here, 
 
 I. Jehoiakim's first captivity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>),

 in which Daniel, with others of the seed-royal, was carried to Babylon.

 II. The choice made of Daniel, and some other young men, to be brought
 up in the Chaldean literature, that they might be fitted to serve the
 government, and the provision made for them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:3-7">ver. 3-7</A>.

 III. Their pious refusal to eat the portion of the king's meat, and
 their determining to live upon pulse and water, which, having tried it,
 the master of the eunuchs allowed them to do, finding that it agreed 
 very well with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:8-16">ver. 8-16</A>.

 IV. Their wonderful improvement, above all their fellows, in wisdom
 and knowledge,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah
 came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged
 it.
 &nbsp; 2  And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with
 part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into
 the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the
 vessels into the treasure house of his god.
 &nbsp; 3  And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs,
 that he should bring <I>certain</I> of the children of Israel, and of
 the king's seed, and of the princes;
 &nbsp; 4  Children in whom <I>was</I> no blemish, but well favoured, and
 skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and
 understanding science, and such as <I>had</I> ability in them to stand
 in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and
 the tongue of the Chaldeans.
 &nbsp; 5  And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's
 meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three
 years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.
 &nbsp; 6  Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel,
 Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:
 &nbsp; 7  Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave
 unto Daniel <I>the name</I> of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of
 Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of
 Abednego.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have in these verses an account,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Of the first descent which Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, in the 
 first year of his reign, made upon Judah and Jerusalem, in the third 
 year of the reign of Jehoiakim, and his success in that expedition 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>):

 He <I>besieged Jerusalem,</I> soon made himself master of it, seized 
 the king, took whom he pleased and what he pleased away with him, and 
 then left Jehoiakim to reign as tributary to him, which he did about 
 eight years longer, but then rebelled, and it was his ruin. Now from 
 this <I>first</I> captivity most interpreters think the seventy years 
 are to be dated, though Jerusalem was not destroyed, nor the captivity 
 completed, till about nineteen years after, In that first year Daniel 
 was carried to Babylon, and there continued the whole seventy years 
 (see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 during which time all nations shall serve Nebuchadnezzar, and his son, 
 and his son's son, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:11">Jer. xxv. 11</A>.

 This one prophet therefore saw within the compass of his own time the
 rise, reign, and ruin of that monarchy; so that it was <I>res unius 
 &aelig;tatis--the affair of a single age,</I> such short-lived things 
 are the kingdoms of the earth; but the kingdom of heaven is 
 everlasting. The righteous, that see them taking root, shall <I>see 
 their fall,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:3,Pr+29:16">Job v. 3; Prov. xxix. 16</A>.

 Mr. Broughton observes the proportion of times in God's government 
 since the coming out of Egypt: thence to their entering Canaan forty 
 years, thence seven years to the dividing of the land, thence seven 
 Jubilees to the first year of Samuel, in whom prophecy began, thence to 
 this first year of the captivity seven seventies of years, 490 (ten 
 Jubilees), thence to the return one seventy, thence to the death of 
 Christ seven seventies more, thence to the destruction of Jerusalem 
 forty years.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The improvement he made of this success. He did not destroy the 
 city or kingdom, but did that which just accomplished the first 
 threatening of mischief by Babylon. It was denounced against Hezekiah, 
 for showing his treasures to the king of Babylon's ambassadors 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+39:6,7">Isa. xxxix. 6, 7</A>),

 that the treasures and the children should be carried away, and, if
 they had been humbled and reformed by this, hitherto the king of 
 Babylon's power and success should have gone, but <I>no further.</I> If 
 less judgments do the work, God will not send greater; but, if not, he 
 will heat the furnace seven times hotter. Let us see what was now done.

 1. The vessels of the sanctuary were carried away, <I>part</I> of them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 They fondly trusted to the temple to defend them, though they went on 
 in their iniquity. And now, to show them the vanity of that confidence, 
 the temple is first plundered. Many of the holy vessels which used to 
 be employed in the service of God were taken away by the king of 
 Babylon, those of them, it is likely, which were most valuable, and he 
 brought them as trophies of victory to the <I>house of his god,</I> to 
 whom, with a blind devotion, he gave praise of his success; and having 
 appropriated these vessels, in token of gratitude, to his god, he 
 <I>put them in the treasury</I> of his temple. See the righteousness of 
 God; his people had brought the images of other gods into his temple, 
 and now he suffers the vessels of the temple to be carried into the 
 treasuries of those other gods. Note, When men profane the vessels of 
 the sanctuary with their sins it is just with God to profane them by 
 his judgments. It is probable that the treasures of the king's house 
 were rifled, as was foretold, but particular mention is made of the 
 taking away of the <I>vessels of the sanctuary</I> because we shall 
 find afterwards that the profanation of them was that which filled up 
 the measure of the Chaldeans' iniquity,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:3"><I>ch.</I> v. 3</A>.

 But observe, It was only <I>part of them</I> that went now; some were
 left them yet upon trial, to see if they would take the right course to 
 prevent the carrying away of the remainder. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:18">Jer. xxvii. 18</A>.

 2. The children and young men, especially such as were of noble or 
 royal extraction, that were sightly and promising, and of good natural 
 parts, were carried away. Thus was the iniquity of the fathers visited 
 upon the children. These were taken away by Nebuchadnezzar,

 (1.) As trophies, to be made a show of for the evidencing and 
 magnifying of his success. 

 (2.) As hostages for the fidelity of their parents in their own land, 
 who would be concerned to conduct themselves well that their children 
 might have the better treatment. 

 (3.) As a seed to serve him. He took them away to train them up for
 employments and preferments under him, either out of an unaccountable 
 affectation, which great men often have, to be attended by foreigners, 
 though they be blacks, rather than by those of their own nation, or 
 because he knew that there were no such witty, sprightly, ingenious 
 young men to be found among his Chaldeans as abounded among the youth 
 of Israel; and, if that were so, it was much for the honour of the 
 Jewish nation, as of an uncommon genius above other people, and a fruit 
 of the blessing. But it was a shame that a people who had so much wit 
 should have so little wisdom and grace. Now observe,

 [1.] The directions which the king of Babylon gave for the choice of 
 these youths,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 They must not choose such as were deformed in body, but comely and 
 well-favoured, whose countenances were indexes of ingenuity and good 
 humour. But that is not enough; they must be <I>skilful in all 
 wisdom,</I> and <I>cunning,</I> or <I>well-seen in knowledge,</I> and 
 <I>understanding science,</I> such as were quick and sharp, and could 
 give a ready and intelligent account of their own country and of the 
 learning they had hitherto been brought up in. He chose such as were 
 young, because they would be pliable and tractable, would forget their 
 own people and incorporate with the Chaldeans. He had an eye to what he 
 designed them for; they must be such as had ability in them to <I>stand 
 in the king's palace,</I> not only to attend his royal person, but to 
 preside in his affairs. This is an instance of the policy of this 
 rising monarch, now in the beginning of his reign, and was a good omen 
 of his prosperity, that he was in care to raise up a succession of 
 persons fit for public business. He did not, like Ahasuerus, appoint 
 them to choose him out young women for the service of his government. 
 It is the interest of princes to have wise men employed under them; it 
 is therefore their wisdom to take care for the finding out and training 
 up of such. It is the misery of this world that so many who are fit for 
 public stations are buried in obscurity, and so many who are unfit for 
 them are preferred to them.

 [2.] The care which he took concerning them. <I>First,</I> For their 
 education. He ordered that they should be taught <I>the learning and 
 tongue of the Chaldeans.</I> They are supposed to be wise and knowing 
 young men, and yet they must be further taught. <I>Give instructions to 
 a wise man and he will increase in learning.</I> Note, Those that would 
 do good in the world when they grow up must learn when they are young.
 That is the learning age; if that time be lost, it will hardly be 
 redeemed. It does not appear that Nebuchadnezzar designed they should 
 learn the unlawful arts that were used among the Chaldeans, magic and 
 divination; if he did, Daniel and his fellows would not defile 
 themselves with them. Nay, we do not find that he ordered them to be 
 taught the religion of the Chaldeans, by which it appears That he was 
 at this time no bigot; if men were skilful and faithful, and fit for 
 his business, it was not material to him what religion they were of, 
 provided they had but some religion. They must be trained up in the
 language and laws of the country, in history, philosophy, and 
 mathematics, in the arts of husbandry, war, and navigation, in such 
 learning as might qualify them to serve their generation. Note, It is 
 real service to the public to provide for the good education of the 
 youth. <I>Secondly,</I> For their maintenance. He provided for them 
 <I>three years,</I> not only necessaries, but dainties for their 
 encouragement in their studies. They had <I>daily provision of the
 king's meat, and of the wine which he drank,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 This was an instance of his generosity and humanity; though they were 
 captives, he considered their birth and quality, their spirit and 
 genius, and treated them honourably, and studied to make their 
 captivity easy to them. There is a respect due to those who are 
 well-born and bred when they have fallen into distress. With a liberal
 education there should be a liberal maintenance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A particular account of Daniel and his fellows. They were of the 
 <I>children of Judah,</I> the royal tribe, and probably of the house of 
 David, which had grown a numerous family; and God told Hezekiah that of 
 the children that should <I>issue from him</I> some should be taken and 
 made eunuchs, or chamberlains, <I>in the palace of the king of 
 Babylon.</I> The <I>prince of the eunuchs</I> changed the names of 
 Daniel and his fellows, partly to show his authority over them and 
 their subjection to him, and partly in token of their being naturalized 
 and made Chaldeans. Their Hebrew names, which they received at their 
 circumcision, had something of God, or Jah, in them: <I>Daniel--God is
 my Judge; Hananiah--The grace of the Lord; Mishael--He that is the strong
 God; Azariah--The Lord is a help.</I> To make them forget the God of
 their fathers, the guide of their youth, they give them names that 
 savour of the Chaldean idolatry. <I>Belteshazzar</I> signifies the 
 <I>keeper of the hidden treasures of Bel; Shadrach</I>--The
 <I>inspiration of the sun,</I> which the Chaldeans worshipped; 
 <I>Meshach</I>--<I>Of the goddess Shach,</I> under which name Venus was
 worshipped; <I>Abed-nego,</I> The <I>servant of the shining fire,</I> 
 which they worshipped also. Thus, though they would not force them from 
 the religion of their fathers to that of their conquerors, yet they did 
 what they could by fair means insensibly to wean them from the former 
 and instil the latter into them. Yet see how comfortably they were 
 provided for; though they suffered for their fathers' sins they were 
 preferred for their own merits, and the land of their captivity was 
 made more comfortable to them than the land of their nativity at this 
 time would have been.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile
 himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine
 which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the
 eunuchs that he might not defile himself.
 &nbsp; 9  Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with
 the prince of the eunuchs.
 &nbsp; 10  And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my
 lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for
 why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which
 <I>are</I> of your sort? then shall ye make <I>me</I> endanger my head to
 the king.
 &nbsp; 11  Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs
 had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
 &nbsp; 12  Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them
 give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.
 &nbsp; 13  Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and
 the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the
 king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.
 &nbsp; 14  So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten
 days.
 &nbsp; 15  And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared
 fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat
 the portion of the king's meat.
 &nbsp; 16  Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the
 wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We observe here, very much to our satisfaction,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That Daniel was a favourite with the <I>prince of the eunuchs</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 as Joseph was with the keeper of the prison; he had a <I>tender 
 love</I> for him. No doubt Daniel deserved it, and recommended himself 
 by his ingenuity and sweetness of temper (he was <I>greatly 
 beloved,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:23"><I>ch.</I> ix. 23</A>);

 and yet it is said here that it was God that <I>brought him into favour
 with the prince of the eunuchs,</I> for every one does not meet with 
 acceptance according to his merits. Note, The interest which we think 
 we make for ourselves we must acknowledge to be God's gift, and must 
 ascribe to him the glory of it. Whoever are in favour, it is God that 
 has brought them into favour; and it is by him that they <I>find good 
 understanding.</I> Herein was again verified That work 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:46">Ps. cvi. 46</A>),

 <I>He made them to be pitied of all those that carried them
 captives.</I> Let young ones know that the way to be acceptable is to 
 be tractable and dutiful.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That Daniel was still firm to his religion. They had changed his 
 name, but they could not change his nature. Whatever they pleased to 
 call him, he still retained the spirit of an Israelite indeed. He would 
 apply his mind as closely as any of them to his books, and took pains 
 to make himself master of the <I>learning and tongue of the 
 Chaldeans,</I> but he was resolved that <I>he would not defile himself 
 with the portion of the king's meat,</I> he would not meddle with it, 
 nor <I>with the wine which he drank,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 And having communicated his purpose, with the reasons of it, to his 
 fellows, they concurred in the same resolution, as appears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 This was not out of sullenness, or peevishness, or a spirit of 
 contradiction, but from a principle of conscience. Perhaps it was not 
 in itself unlawful for them to <I>eat of the king's meat</I> or to 
 <I>drink of his wine.</I> But, 

 1. They were scrupulous concerning the meat, lest it should be sinful.
 Sometimes such meat would be set before them as was expressly forbidden 
 by their law, as swine's flesh; or they were afraid lest it should have 
 been offered in sacrifice to an idol, or blessed in the name of an 
 idol. The Jews were distinguished from other nations very much by their 
 meats

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:45,46">Lev. xi. 45, 46</A>),

 and these pious young men, being in a strange country, thought 
 themselves obliged to keep up the honour of their being a peculiar 
 people. Though they could not keep up their dignity as princes, they 
 would not lose it as Israelites; for on that they most valued 
 themselves. Note, When God's people are in Babylon they have need to 
 take special care that they <I>partake not in her sins.</I> Providence 
 seemed to lay this meat before them; being captives they must eat what 
 they could get and must not disoblige their masters; yet, if the 
 command be against it, they must abide by that. Though Providence says, 
 <I>Kill and eat,</I> conscience says, <I>Not so, Lord, for nothing 
 common or unclean has come into my mouth.</I> 

 2. They were jealous over themselves, lest, though it should not be 
 sinful in itself, it should be an <I>occasion of sin</I> to them, lest, 
 by indulging their appetites with these dainties, they should grow 
 sinful, voluptuous, and in love with the pleasures of Babylon. They had 
 learned David's prayer, <I>Let me not eat of their dainties</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:4">Ps. cxli. 4</A>),

 and Solomon's precept, <I>Be not desirous of dainties, for they are
 deceitful meat</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:3">Prov. xxiii. 3</A>),

 and accordingly they form their resolution. Note, It is very much the
 praise of all, and especially of young people, to be dead to the 
 delights of sense, not to covet them, not to relish them, but to look 
 upon them with indifference. Those that would excel in wisdom and piety 
 must learn betimes to <I>keep under the body and bring it into 
 subjection.</I> 

 3. However, they thought it unseasonable now, when Jerusalem was in
 distress, and they themselves were in captivity. They had no heart to 
 <I>drink wine in bowls,</I> so much were they <I>grieved for the 
 affliction of Joseph.</I> Though they had royal blood in their veins, 
 yet they did not think it proper to have royal dainties in their mouths 
 when they were thus brought low. Note, It becomes us to be humble
 under humbling providences. <I>Call me not Naomi; call me Marah.</I> 
 See the benefit of affliction; by the account Jeremiah gives of the 
 princes and great men now at Jerusalem it appears that they were very 
 corrupt and wicked, and defiled themselves with things offered to 
 idols, while these young gentlemen that were in captivity would not 
 defile themselves, no, not with their <I>portion of the king's 
 meat.</I> How much better is it with those that retain their integrity 
 in the depths of affliction than with those that retain their iniquity 
 in the heights of prosperity! Observe, The great thing that Daniel 
 avoided was defiling himself with the pollutions of sin; that is the 
 thing we should be more afraid of than of any outward trouble. Daniel,
 having taken up this resolution, <I>requested of the prince of the 
 eunuchs that he might not defile himself,</I> not only that he might 
 not be compelled to do it, but that he might not be tempted to do it, 
 that the bait might not be laid before him, that he might not see the 
 portion appointed him of the king's meat, nor look upon the wine when 
 it was red. It will be easier to keep the temptation at a distance than 
 to suffer it to come near and then be forced to <I>put a knife to our 
 throat.</I> Note, We cannot better improve our interest in any with 
 whom we have found favour than by making use of them to keep us from 
 sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That God wonderfully owned him herein. When Daniel requested that 
 he might have none of the king's meat or wine set before him the prince 
 of the eunuchs objected that, if he and his fellows were not found in 
 as good case as any of their companions, he should be in danger of 
 having anger and of losing his head, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Daniel, to satisfy him that there would be no danger of any bad 
 consequence, desires the matter might be put to a trial. He applies 
 himself further to the under-officer, Melzar, or the steward: "<I>Prove 
 us for ten days;</I> during that time let us have nothing but <I>pulse 
 to eat,</I> nothing but herbs and fruits, or parched peas or lentils, 
 and nothing but <I>water to drink,</I> and see how we can live upon 
 that, and proceed accordingly," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 People will not believe the benefit of abstemiousness and a spare diet, 
 nor how much it contributes to the health of the body, unless they try 
 it. Trial was accordingly made. Daniel and his fellows lived for ten
 days upon <I>pulse and water,</I> hard fare for young men of genteel 
 extraction and education, and which one would rather expect they should 
 have indented against than petitioned for; but <I>at the end of the ten 
 days</I> they were compared with the other children, and were found 
 <I>fairer and fatter in flesh,</I> of a more healthful look and better 
 complexion, than <I>all those who did eat the portion of the king's 
 meat,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 This was in part a natural effect of their temperance, but it must be 
 ascribed to the special blessing of God, which will make a little to go 
 a great way, a <I>dinner of herbs</I> better than a <I>stalled ox.</I> 
 By this it appears that <I>man lives not by bread alone;</I> pulse and 
 water shall be the most nourishing food if God speak the word. See what 
 it is to keep ourselves pure from the pollutions of sin; it is the way 
 to have that comfort and satisfaction which will be <I>health to the 
 navel and marrow to the bones,</I> while the pleasures of sin are 
 <I>rottenness to the bones.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That his master countenanced him. The steward did not force them to 
 eat against their consciences, but, as they desired, <I>gave them pulse

 the pleasures of which they enjoyed, and we have reason to think were 
 not envied the enjoyment. Here is a great example of temperance and 
 contentment with mean things; and (as Epicurus said) "he that lives 
 according to nature will never be poor, but he that lives according to 
 opinion will never be rich." This wonderful abstemiousness of these 
 young men in the days of their youth contributed to the fitting of 
 them, 

 1. For their eminent services. Hereby they kept their minds clear and
 unclouded, and fit for contemplation, and saved for the best 
 employments a great deal both of time and thought; and thus they 
 prevented those diseases which indispose men for the business of age 
 that owe their rise to the intemperances of youth. 

 2. For their eminent sufferings. Those that had thus inured themselves 
 to hardship, and lived a life of self-denial and mortification, could 
 the more easily venture upon the fiery furnace and the den of lions, 
 rather than sin against God.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and
 skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in
 all visions and dreams.
 &nbsp; 18  Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should
 bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in
 before Nebuchadnezzar.
 &nbsp; 19  And the king communed with them; and among them all was
 found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore
 stood they before the king.
 &nbsp; 20  And in all matters of wisdom <I>and</I> understanding, that the
 king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all
 the magicians <I>and</I> astrologers that <I>were</I> in all his realm.
 &nbsp; 21  And Daniel continued <I>even</I> unto the first year of king
 Cyrus.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Concerning Daniel and his fellows we have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Their great attainments in learning, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 They were very sober and diligent, and studied hard; and we may suppose 
 their tutors, finding them of an uncommon capacity, took a great deal 
 of pains with them, but, after all, their achievements are ascribed to 
 God only. It was he that <I>gave them knowledge and skill in all 
 learning and wisdom;</I> for <I>every good and perfect gift is from 
 above, from the Father of the lights.</I> It is the Lord our God that 
 <I>gives men power to get</I> this wealth; the mind is furnished only 
 by him that formed it. The great learning which God gave these four
 children was, 

 1. A balance for their losses. They had, for the iniquity of their
 fathers, been deprived of the honours and pleasures that would have 
 attended their noble extraction; but, to make them amends for that, 
 God, in giving them learning, gave them better honours and pleasures 
 than those they had been deprived of. 

 2. A recompence for their integrity. They kept to their religion, even 
 in the minutest instances of it, and would not so much as defile 
 themselves with the king's meat or wine, but became, in effect, 
 Nazarites; and now God rewarded them for it with eminency in learning; 
 for God <I>gives to a man that is good in his sight, wisdom, and 
 knowledge, and joy</I> with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:26">Eccl. ii. 26</A>.

 To Daniel he gave a double portion; he had <I>understanding in visions
 and dreams;</I> he knew how to interpret dreams, as Joseph, not by 
 rules of art, such as are pretended to be given by the oneirocritics, 
 but by a divine sagacity and wisdom which God gave him. Nay, he was
 endued with a prophetic spirit, by which he was enabled to converse 
 with God, and to receive the notices of divine things in dreams and 
 visions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:6">Num. xii. 6</A>.

 According to this gift given to Daniel, we find him, in this book, all
 along employed about dreams and visions, interpreting or entertaining 
 them; for, <I>as every one has received the gift,</I> so shall he have 
 an opportunity, and so should he have a heart, to <I>minister the 
 same,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:10">1 Pet. iv. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Their great acceptance with the king. After <I>three years</I> 
 spent in their education (they being of some maturity, it is likely, 
 when they came, perhaps about twenty years old) they were presented to 
 the king with the rest that were of their standing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 And the king examined them and <I>communed with them</I> himself, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 He could do it, being a man of parts and learning himself, else he 
 would not have come to be so great; and he would do it, for it is the 
 wisdom of princes, in the choice of the persons they employ, to see 
 with their own eyes, to exercise their own judgment, and not trust too 
 much to the representation of others. The king examined them not so 
 much in the languages, in the rules of oratory or poetry, as <I>in all 
 matters of wisdom and understanding,</I> the rules of prudence and true 
 politics; he enquired into their judgment about the due conduct of 
 human life and public affairs; not "Were they wits?" but, "Were they 
 wise?" And he not only found them to excel the young candidates for 
 preferment that were of their own standing, but found that they had 
 <I>more understanding than the ancients, than all their teachers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:99,100">Ps. cxix. 99, 100</A>.

 So far was the king from being partial to his own countrymen, to
 seniors, to those of his own religion and of an established reputation, 
 that he freely owned that, upon trial, he found those poor young 
 captive Jews ten times wiser and <I>better than all the magicians that 
 were in all his realm,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 He was soon aware of something extraordinary in these young men, and, 
 which gave him a surprising satisfaction, was soon aware that a little 
 of their true divinity was preferable to a great deal of the divination 
 he had been used to. <I>What is the chaff to the wheat?</I> what are 
 the magicians' rods to Aaron's? There was no comparison between them. 
 These four young students were better, were <I>ten times</I> better, 
 than all the old practitioners, put them all together, that were <I>in 
 all his realm,</I> and we may be sure that they were not a few. This 
 contempt did God pour upon the pride of the Chaldeans, and this honour 
 did he put upon the low estate of his own people; and thus did he make 
 not only these persons, but the rest of their nation for their sakes, 
 the more respected in the land of their captivity. <I>Lastly,</I> This 
 judgment being given concerning them, they <I>stood before the king</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);

 they attended in the presence-chamber, nay, and in the council-chamber, 
 for to <I>see the king's face</I> is the periphrasis of a 
 privy-counsellor, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:14">Esth. i. 14</A>.

 This confirms Solomon's observation, <I>Seest thou a man diligent in
 his business,</I> sober and humble? <I>he shall stand before kings; he
 shall not stand before mean men.</I> Industry is the way to preferment.
 How long the other three were about the court we are not told; but 
 Daniel, for his part, <I>continued to the first year of Cyrus</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 though not always alike in favour and reputation. He lived and 
 prophesied after the first year of Cyrus; but that is mentioned to 
 intimate that he lived to see the deliverance of his people out of 
 their captivity and their return to their own land. Note, Sometimes God 
 favours his servants that mourn with Zion in her sorrows to let them 
 live to see better times with the church than they saw in the beginning 
 of their days and to share with her in her joys.</P>
