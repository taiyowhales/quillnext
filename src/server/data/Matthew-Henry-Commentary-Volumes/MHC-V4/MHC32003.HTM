 In this chapter we have, 

 I. Jonah's mission renewed, and the command a second time given him to
 go preach at Nineveh, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+3:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. Jonah's message to Nineveh faithfully delivered, by which its
 speedy overthrow was threatened, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+3:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>.

 III. The repentance, humiliation, and reformation of the Ninevites
 hereupon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+3:5-9">ver. 5-9</A>.

 IV. God's gracious revocation of the sentence passed upon them, and
 the preventing of the ruin threatened,

 saying,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a further evidence of the reconciliation between God and 
 Jonah, and that it was a thorough reconciliation, though the 
 controversy between them had run high.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Jonah's commission is renewed and readily obeyed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. By this it appears that God was perfectly reconciled to Jonah, that 
 he employed him again in his service; and the commission anew given him 
 was an evidence of the remission of his former disobedience. Among men, 
 it has been justly pleaded that the giving of a commission to a 
 criminal convicted is equivalent to a pardon, so it was to Jonah. 
 <I>The word of the Lord came unto Jonah the second time</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>);
 
 for, 

 1. Jonah must be tried, whether he do indeed repent of his former 
 disobedience or no, and whether he have gotten the good designed him 
 both by his strange punishment an by his strange deliverance. He had 
 deserted his work and duty, and had been under arrest for it, had 
 received a <I>sentence of death within himself;</I> but, upon his 
 submission, God had released him, had given him his life, had given him 
 his liberty; but it is upon his good behaviour that he is released, and 
 he must again be put upon the trial whether he will follow the will of 
 God or his own will. After he has been thrown into the sea, and thrown 
 out of it again, God comes and asks him, "Jonah, wilt thou go to 
 Nineveh now?" For <I>when God judges he will overcome,</I> he will gain 
 his point; he will bring the disobedient stubborn child to his foot at 
 last. Note, When God has afflicted us, and delivered us out of 
 affliction, we must hear his voice, saying to us, Now return to the 
 duties which before you neglected, and which by these providences you 
 are called to. God now said, in effect, to Jonah, as Christ said to the 
 impotent man, when he had healed him, "Now go and sin no more, <I>lest 
 a worse thing come unto thee</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:14">John v. 14</A>),

 a worse thing than lying three days and three nights in the whale's
 belly." God looks upon men, when he has afflicted them and has 
 delivered them out of their affliction, to see whether they will mend 
 of that fault, particularly, for which they were corrected; and 
 therefore in that thing we are concerned to see to it that we receive 
 not the grace of God in vain, neither in the correction nor in the 
 deliverance, for both are designed to be means of grace.

 (2.) Jonah shall be trusted, in token of God's favour to him. God might 
 justly have said concerning Jonah, as we should concerning one that had 
 cheated us and dealt treacherously with us, that though we would not 
 proceed to the rigour of the law against him, nor ruin him, yet we 
 would never again repose a confidence in him; justly might the Spirit 
 of prophecy, which Jonah had resisted and rebelled against, depart from 
 him, with a resolution never to return to him any more. One would have 
 expected that though his life was spared, yet he would be laid under a 
 disability and incapacity ever to serve the government again in the 
 character of a prophet. But, behold! the word of the Lord comes to him 
 again, to show that when God forgives he forgets, and whom he forgives 
 he gives a new heart and a new spirit to; he receives those into his 
 family again, and restores them to their former estate, that had been 
 prodigal children and disobedient servants. Note, God's making use of
 us is the best evidence of his being at peace with us. Hereby it will 
 appear that our sins are pardoned, and we have the good-will of God 
 towards us; does his good word come unto us, and do we experience his 
 good work in us! if so, we have reason to admire the riches of free 
 grace and to own our obligations to the Lord Jesus, who received gifts 
 for men, <I>yea, even for the rebellious also, that the Lord God might 
 dwell</I> even among them, and employ them in his word, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:18">Ps. lxviii. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. By this it appears that Jonah was well reconciled to God, that he 
 was not now, as he had been before, <I>disobedient to the heavenly 
 vision,</I> did not <I>flee from the presence of the Lord,</I> as he 
 had done. He neither endeavored to avoid hearing the command, nor did 
 he decline obeying it; he made no objections, as he had done, that the 
 journey was <I>long,</I> the errand invidious, the delivery of it 
 perilous, and, if the threatened judgment did come, he should be 
 reproached as a false prophet, and the impenitence of his own nation 
 would be upbraided, which he had objected, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+4:2"><I>ch.</I> iv. 2</A>.

 But now, without murmuring and disputing, <I>Jonah arose, and went unto
 Nineveh, according to the word of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 See here, 

 (1.) The nature of repentance; it is the change of our mind and way, 
 and a return to our work and duty, from which we had turned aside; it 
 is doing that good which we had left undone. 

 (2.) The benefit of affliction; it reduces those to their place that 
 had deserted it. Jonah might truly say with David, "<I>Before I was 
 afflicted I went astray, but now have I kept thy word;</I> and 
 therefore, though it was dreadful, though it was painful to me, and for 
 the present <I>not joyous, but grievous,</I> yet <I>it was good,</I> 
 very good, <I>for me, that I was afflicted.</I>"

 (3.) See the power of divine grace working with affliction, for 
 otherwise affliction of itself would rather drive men from God than 
 bring them to him; but God by his grace can <I>turn the disobedient to 
 the wisdom of the just,</I> and make those <I>willing in the day of his 
 power,</I> freely willing to come under his yoke, whose <I>neck</I> had 
 been <I>as an iron sinew.</I>

 (4.) See the duty of all those to whom the word of the Lord comes; they
 must in all points conform themselves to it, and yield a cheerful 
 faithful obedience to the orders God gives them. <I>Jonah arose,</I> 
 and did not sit still in sloth or sullenness; he went directly to 
 Nineveh, though it was a great way off, and a place where, it is 
 likely, he never was before; yet thither he took his journey, 
 <I>according to the word of the Lord.</I> God's servants must go where 
 he sends them, come when he calls them, and do what he bids them; 
 whatever appears to be the word of the Lord we must conscientiously do 
 according to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Let us now see what was the command or commission given him, and 
 what he did in prosecution of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He was sent as a herald at arms, in the name of the God of heaven, 
 to proclaim war with Nineveh 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city," that metropolis, and <I>preach 
 unto it,</I> preach <I>against it,</I> so the Chaldee. What is against 
 us is preached to us, that we may hear it and take warning; and what is 
 preached to us, if we do not give ear to it, and mix faith with it, 
 will prove to be against us. Jonah is sent to Nineveh, which was at
 this time the chief city of the Gentile world, as an indication of 
 God's gracious intentions in process of time to make the light of 
 divine revelation to shine in those dark regions. God knew that if 
 Sodom and Gomorrah, Tyre and Sidon, had had the means of grace, they 
 would have repented, and yet he denied them those means, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:21,23">Matt. xi. 21, 23</A>.
 
 He knew that if Nineveh had now the means of grace they would repent,
 and he gave them those means, sent Jonah, though not to preach 
 repentance to them expressly (for we find not that he had that in his 
 commission), yet to preach them to repentance, for that was the happy 
 effect of what he had in commission. If God thus in dispensing his 
 favours, in giving the means of grace to some places and not to others, 
 and the spirit of grace to some persons and not to others, acts by 
 prerogative and in a way of sovereignty, who may say unto him, What 
 doest thou? <I>May he not do what he will with his own?</I> He is 
 debtor to no man. Go, and preach (says God) <I>the preaching that I bid 
 thee.</I> That is, 

 (1.) "The preaching that I did bid thee when I first ordered thee to go
 thither

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:2"><I>ch.</I> i. 2</A>);

 go, <I>and cry against it;</I> denounce divine judgments against it;
 tell the men of Nineveh that their wickedness has come up to God, and 
 God's vengeance is coming down upon them." This was the message Jonah 
 was then very loth to deliver, and therefore flew off and went to 
 Tarshish; but, when he is brought to it the second time, God does not 
 at all alter the message, to gratify him, or make it the more passable 
 with him; no, he must now preach the very same that he was then ordered 
 to preach and would not. Note, The word of God is an unalterable thing, 
 and will not be made to bend to the humours either of its preachers or 
 of its hearers; it shall never comply with their humours and fancies, 
 but they must comply with its truths and laws. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:19">Jer. xv. 19</A>.

 <I>Let them return unto thee, but return not thou unto them.</I> Or,

 (2.) "The preaching that I shall bid thee when thou comest thither."
 This was an encouragement to him in his undertaking, that God would go 
 along with him, that the Spirit of prophecy should abide upon him, and 
 be ready to him, when he was at Nineveh, to give him all the further 
 instructions that were needed for him. This intimated that he should 
 hear from him again, which would be his great support in this hazardous 
 expedition; as, when God sent Abraham to offer up Isaac, he gave him a 
 similar intimation, by telling him he must do it upon <I>one of the 
 mountains which he would</I> afterwards direct <I>him to. The steps of 
 a good man are ordered by the Lord;</I> he leads his people step by 
 step, and so he expects they should follow him. Jonah must go with an 
 implicit faith. Though he knows whither he goes, he shall not know, 
 till he come thither, what message he must deliver, but, whatever it 
 is, he must deliver it, be it pleasing or displeasing. Thus God will 
 keep us in a continual dependence upon himself, and the directions of 
 his word and providence. What he does, and what he will have us do, we 
 <I>know not now,</I> but we <I>shall know hereafter.</I> Admirals, 
 sometimes, when they are sent abroad, are not to open their commission 
 till they have got so many leagues off at sea; so Jonah must go to 
 Nineveh, and, when he comes there, shall be told what to say.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He faithfully and boldly delivered his errand. When he came to 
 Nineveh he found his diocese large; it was an <I>exceedingly great city 
 of three days' journey</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 a city <I>great to God,</I> so the Hebrew phrase is, meaning no more 
 than as we render it, <I>exceedingly great;</I> this honour that 
 language does to the great God that great things derive their 
 denomination from him. The greatness of Nineveh consisted chiefly in 
 the extent of it; it was much larger than Babylon, such a city, says 
 Diodorus Siculus, as no man ever after built. It was 150 furlongs long 
 and 90 broad, and 480 in compass; the walls 100 feet high, and so thick 
 that three chariots might go a-breast upon them; on them were 1500 
 towers, each of them 200 feet high. It is here said to be of <I>three 
 days' journey;</I> for the compass of the walls, as some relate, was 
 480 furlongs, which, allowing eight furlongs to a mile, makes sixty 
 miles, which may well be reckoned <I>three days' journey</I> for a 
 footman, twenty miles a day. Or, walking slowly and gravely as Jonah 
 must when he went about preaching, it would take him up at least 
 <I>three days</I> to go through all the principal streets and lanes of 
 the city, to proclaim his message, that all might have notice of it. 
 When he came thither he lost no time; he did not come to look about 
 him, but applied closely to his work; and, when he began to enter into 
 the city, he did not retire into an inn, to refresh himself after his 
 journey, but opened his commission immediately, according to his 
 instructions, and he <I>cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh 
 shall be overthrown.</I> This, no doubt, he had particular warrant and 
 direction to say; whether he enlarged upon this text, as is most 
 probable, showing them the controversy God had with them, and how 
 provoking their wickedness was, and what reason they had to expect 
 destruction and give credit to this warning, or whether he only 
 repeated those words again and again, is not certain, but this was the 
 purport of his message.

 1. He must tell them that this great city shall be overthrown; he
 meant, and they understood him, that it should be overthrown, not by 
 war, but by some immediate stroke from heaven, either by an earthquake 
 or by fire and brimstone as Sodom was. The wickedness of cities ripens 
 them for destruction, and their wealth and greatness cannot protect 
 them from destruction when the measure of their iniquity is full and 
 the measure of their vengeance has come. Great cities are easily
 overthrown when the great God comes to reckon with them. 

 2. He must tell them that it shall shortly be overthrown, at the end of
 forty days. It has a reprieve granted. So long God will wait to see if, 
 upon this alarm given, they will humble themselves and amend their 
 doings, and so prevent the ruin threatened. See how slow God is to 
 wrath; though Nineveh's wickedness cried for vengeance, yet it shall be 
 spared for forty days, that it may have space to repent and meet God in 
 the way of his judgments. But he will wait no longer; if in that time 
 they turn not, they shall know that he has <I>whet his sword, and made 
 it ready.</I> Forty days is a long time for a righteous God to defer 
 his judgments, yet it is but a little time for an unrighteous people to 
 repent and reform in, and so turn away the judgments coming. The
 fixing of the day thus, with all possible assurance, would help to 
 convince them that it was a message from God, for no man durst be so 
 positive in fixing a time, however he might prognosticate the thing 
 itself; it would also startle them into preparation for it. It may 
 justly awaken secure sinners by a sincere conversion to prevent their 
 own ruin when they see they have but a little time to turn in. And 
 should it not awaken us to get ready for death, to consider that the 
 thing itself is certain, and the time fixed in the counsel of God, but 
 that we are kept in the dark and uncertainty about it in order that we 
 may be always ready? We cannot be so sure that we shall live forty days 
 as Nineveh now was that it should stand forty days; nay, I think it is 
 more probable that we shall die within thirty or forty days than we 
 should live thirty or forty years; and so many years in the day of our 
 security we are apt to promise ourselves.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5 So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast,
 and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least
 of them.
 &nbsp; 6 For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his
 throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered <I>him</I> with
 sackcloth, and sat in ashes.
 &nbsp; 7 And he caused <I>it</I> to be proclaimed and published through
 Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let
 neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them
 not feed, nor drink water:
 &nbsp; 8 But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry
 mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil
 way, and from the violence that <I>is</I> in their hands.
 &nbsp; 9 Who can tell <I>if</I> God will turn and repent, and turn away
 from his fierce anger, that we perish not?
 &nbsp; 10 And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil
 way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would
 do unto them; and he did <I>it</I> not.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is 

 I. A wonder of divine grace in the repentance and reformation of 
 Nineveh, upon the warning given them of their destruction approaching. 
 <I>Verily I say unto you,</I> we have not found so great an instance of 
 it, no, not in Israel; and it will <I>rise up in judgment against the 
 men of</I> the gospel--<I>generation, and condemn them; for the
 Ninevites repented at the preaching of Jonas, but behold, a greater 
 than Jonas is here,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:41">Matt. xii. 41</A>.

 Nay, it did condemn the impenitence and obstinacy of Israel at that
 time. God sent many prophets to Israel, and those well known among them 
 to be <I>mighty in word and deed;</I> but to Nineveh he sent only one, 
 and him a stranger, whose aspect was mean, we may suppose, and his 
 <I>bodily presence weak,</I> especially after the fatigue of so long a 
 journey; and yet they repented, but Israel repented not. Jonah preached 
 but one sermon, and we do not find that he gave them any sign or wonder 
 by the accomplishment of which his word might be confirmed; and yet 
 they were wrought upon, while Israel continued obstinate, whose 
 prophets chose out words wherewith to reason with them, and confirmed 
 them by signs following. Jonah only threatened wrath and ruin; we do 
 not find that he gave them any calls to repentance or directions how to 
 repent, much less any encouragements to hope that they should find 
 mercy if they did repent, much less any encouragements to hope that 
 they should find mercy if they did repent, and yet they repented; but 
 Israel persisted in impertinence, though the prophets sent to them drew 
 them <I>with cords of a man, and with bands of love,</I> and assured 
 them of great things which God would do for them if they did repent and 
 reform. Now let us see what was the method of Nineveh's repentance, 
 what were the steps and particular instances of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They <I>believed God;</I> they gave credit to the word which Jonah 
 spoke to them in the name of God: they believed that though they had 
 many that they called gods, yet there was but <I>one living and true 
 God,</I> the sovereign Lord of all,--that to him they were
 accountable,--that they had sinned against him and had become obnoxious
 to his justice,--that this notice sent them of ruin approaching came
 from him, and consequently that the ruin itself would come from him at 
 a time prefixed if it were not prevented by a timely repentance,--that
 he is a merciful God, and there might be some hopes of the turning away 
 of the wrath threatened, if they did turn away from the sins for which 
 it was threatened. Note, Those that <I>come to God,</I> that come back 
 to him after they have revolted from him, must believe, must believe 
 that he is, that he is reconcilable, that he will be theirs if they 
 take the right course. And observe what great faith God can work by 
 very small, weak, and unlikely means; he can bring even Ninevites by a 
 few threatening words to be <I>obedient to the faith.</I> Some think 
 the Ninevites heard, from the mariners or others, or from Jonah 
 himself, of his being cast into the sea and delivered thence by 
 miracle, and that this served for a confirmation of his mission, and 
 brought them the more readily to believe God speaking by him. But of 
 this we have no certainty. However, Christ's resurrection, typified by 
 that of Jonah's, served for the confirmation of his gospel, and 
 contributed abundantly to their great success who in his name 
 <I>preached repentance and remission of sins to all nations, beginning 
 at Jerusalem.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They brought word to the king of Nineveh, who, some think, was at 
 this time Sardanapalus, others Pul, king of Assyria. Jonah was not 
 directed to go to him first, in respect to his royal dignity; crowned 
 heads, when guilty heads, are before God upon a level with common 
 heads, and therefore Jonah is not sent to the court, but to the streets 
 of Nineveh, to make his proclamation. However, an account of his errand 
 is brought to the king of Nineveh, not by way of information against 
 Jonah, as a disturber of public peace, that he might be silenced and 
 punished, which perhaps would have been done if he had cried thus in 
 the streets of Jerusalem, who <I>killed God's prophets and stoned those 
 that were sent unto her.</I> No; the account was brought him of it, not 
 as of a crime, but as a message from heaven, by some that were 
 concerned for the public welfare, and whose hearts trembled for it. 
 Note, Those kings are happy who have such about them as will give them 
 notice of the things that belong to the kingdom's peace, of the 
 warnings both of the word and of the providence of God, and of the 
 tokens of God's displeasure which they are under; and those people are 
 happy who have such kings over them as will take notice of those 
 things.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The king set them a good example of humiliation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 When he heard of the <I>word of God</I> sent to him he <I>rose from his 
 throne,</I> as Eglon the king of Moab, who, when Ehud told him he had a 
 message to him form God, <I>rose up out of his seat.</I> The king of 
 Nineveh <I>rose from his throne,</I> not only in reverence to a word 
 from God in general, but in fear of a word of wrath in particular, and 
 in sorrow and shame for sin, by which he and his people had become 
 obnoxious to his wrath. He rose from his royal throne, and laid aside 
 his royal robe, the badge of his imperial dignity, as an acknowledgment 
 that, having not used his power as he ought to have done for the 
 restraining of violence and wrong, and the maintaining of right, he had 
 forfeited his throne and robe to the justice of God, had rendered 
 himself unworthy of the honour put upon him and the trust reposed in 
 him as a king, and that it was just with God to take his kingdom from 
 him. Even the king himself disdained not to put on the garb of a 
 penitent, for he <I>covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in 
 ashes,</I> in token of his humiliation for sin and his dread of divine 
 vengeance. It well becomes the greatest of men to abase themselves 
 before the great God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The people conformed to the example of the king, nay, it should 
 seem, they led the way, for they first began to <I>put on sackcloth, 
 from the greatest of them even to the least of them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The least of them, that had least to lose in the overthrow of the city, 
 did not think themselves unconcerned in the alarm; and the greatest of 
 them, that were accustomed to lie at ease and live in state, did not 
 think it below them to put on the marks of humiliation. The wearing of 
 sackcloth, especially to those who were used to fine linen, was a very 
 uneasy thing, and they would not have done it if they had not had a 
 deep sense of their sin and their danger by reason of sin, which hereby 
 they designed to express. Note, Those that would not be ruined must be 
 humbled, those that would not destroy their souls must afflict their 
 souls; when God's judgments threaten us we are concerned to <I>humble 
 ourselves under his mighty hand;</I> and though bodily exercise alone 
 profits nothing, and man's <I>spreading sackcloth and ashes under 
 him,</I> if that be all, is but a jest (it is the heart that God looks 
 at, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:5">Isa. lviii. 5</A>),

 yet on solemn days of humiliation, when God in his providence <I>calls
 to mourning and girding with sackcloth,</I> we must by the outward 
 expressions of inward sorrow <I>glorify God with our bodies,</I> at 
 least by laying aside their ornaments.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. A general fast was proclaimed and observed throughout that great 
 city, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+3:7-9"><I>v.</I> 7-9</A>.

 It was ordered <I>by the decree of the king and his nobles;</I> the 
 whole legislative power concurred in appointing it, and the whole body 
 of the people concurred in observing it, and in both these ways it 
 became a national act, and it was necessary that it should be so when 
 it was to prevent a national ruin. We have here the contents of this 
 proclamation, and it is very observable. See here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What it is that is required by it. 

 [1.] That the fast (properly so called) be very strictly observed. On 
 the day appointed for this solemnity, <I>let neither man or beast taste 
 any thing;</I> let them not take the least refreshment, no, no so much 
 as <I>drink water;</I> let them not plead that they cannot fast so long 
 without prejudice to their health, or that they cannot bear it; let 
 them try for once. What if they do feel it an uneasiness, and feel from 
 it for some time after? It is better to submit to that than be wanting
 in any act or instance of that repentance which is necessary to save a 
 sinking city. Let them make themselves uneasy in body by <I>putting on 
 sackcloth,</I> as well as by fasting, to show how uneasy they are in 
 mind, through sorrow for sin and the fear of divine wrath. Even the 
 <I>beasts</I> must do penance as well as man, because they have been 
 made <I>subject to vanity</I> as instruments of man's sin, and that, 
 either by their complaints or their silent pining for want of meat, 
 they might stir up their owners, and those that attended them, to the 
 expressions of sorrow and humiliation. Those cattle that were kept 
 within doors must not be fed and watered as usual, because no meat must 
 be stirring on that day. Things of that kind must be forgotten, and not 
 minded. As when the psalmist was intent upon the praises of God he 
 called upon the inferior creatures to join with him therein, so when 
 the Ninevites were full of sorrow for sin, and dread of God's 
 judgments, they would have the inferior creatures concur with them in 
 the expressions of penitence. The beasts that used to be covered with 
 rich and fine trappings, which were the pride of their masters, and 
 theirs too, must now be <I>covered with sackcloth;</I> for the great 
 men will (as becomes them) lay aside their equipage. 

 [2.] With their fasting and mourning they must join prayer and 
 supplication to God; for the fasting is designed to fit the body for 
 the service of the soul in the duty of prayer, which is the main 
 matter, and to which the other is but preparatory or subservient. 
 <I>Let them cry mightily to God;</I> let even the brute creatures do it 
 according to their capacity; let their cries and moans for want of food 
 be graciously construed as cries to God, as the cries of the <I>young 
 ravens</I> are 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:41">Job xxxviii. 41</A>),
 
 and of the <I>young lions,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:21">Ps. civ. 21</A>.
 
 But especially let the men, women, and children, <I>cry to God;</I> let
 them <I>cry mightily</I> for the pardon of the sins which cry against 
 them. It was time to cry to God when there was but a step between them 
 and ruin--high time to seek the Lord. In prayer we must cry mightily, 
 with a fixedness of thought, firmness of faith, and fervour of pious 
 and devout affections. By crying mightily we wrestle with God; we take 
 hold of him; and we are concerned to do so when he is not only 
 departing from us as a friend, but coming forth against us as an enemy. 
 It therefore concerns us in prayer to stir up all that is within us. 
 Yet this is not all; 

 [3.] They must to their fasting and praying add reformation and 
 amendment of life: <I>Let them turn every one from his evil way,</I> 
 the evil way he has chosen, the evil way he is addicted to, and walks 
 in, the evil way of his heart, and the evil way of his conversation, 
 and particularly <I>from the violence that is in their hands;</I> let 
 them restore what they had unjustly taken, and make reparation for what 
 wrong they have done, and let them not any more oppress those they have 
 power over nor defraud those they having dealings with; let the men in 
 authority, at the court-end of the town, turn <I>from the violence that 
 is in their hands,</I> and not <I>decree unrighteous decrees,</I> nor 
 give wrong judgment upon appeals made to them. Let the men of business, 
 at the trading-end of the town, turn <I>from the violence in their 
 hands,</I> and use no unjust weights or measures, nor impose upon the 
 ignorance or necessity of those they trade with. Note, It is not enough 
 to fast for sin, but we must fast from sin, and, in order to the 
 success of our prayers, must no more <I>regard iniquity in our 
 hearts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:18">Ps. lxvi. 18</A>.

 This is <I>the only fast that God has chosen</I> and will accept, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:6.Zec+7:5,9">Isa. lviii. 6; Zech. vii. 5, 9</A>.

 The work of a fast-day is not done with the day; no, then the hardest
 and most needful part of the work begins, which is to turn from sin, 
 and to live a new life, and not return with the dog to his vomit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Upon what inducement this fast is proclaimed and religiously 
 observed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>).

 <I>Who can tell if God will turn and repent?</I> Observe,

 [1.] What it is that they hope for--that God will, upon their repenting 
 and turning, change his way towards them and revoke his sentence 
 against them, that he will <I>turn from his fierce anger,</I> which 
 they own they deserve and yet humbly and earnestly deprecate, and that 
 thus their ruin will be prevented, and they perish not. They cannot 
 object against the equity of the judgment, they pretend not to set it 
 aside by appealing to a higher court, but hope in God himself, that he 
 will repent, and that his own mercy (to which they fly) <I>shall 
 rejoice against judgment.</I> They believe that God is justly angry 
 with them, that, their sin being very heinous, his anger is very 
 fierce, and that, if he proceed against them, there is no remedy, but 
 they die, they perish, they all perish, and are undone; for who knows 
 the power of his anger? It is not therefore the threatened overthrow 
 that they pray for the prevention of, but the anger of God that they 
 pray for the turning away of. As when we pray for the favour of God we 
 pray for all good, so when we pray against the wrath of God we pray 
 against all evil. 

 [2.] What degree of hope they had of it: <I>Who can tell if God will 
 turn to us?</I> Jonah had not told them; they had not among them any 
 other prophets to tell them, so that they could not be so confident of 
 finding mercy upon their repentance as we may be, who have the promise 
 and oath of God to depend upon, and especially the merit and mediation 
 of Christ to trust to, for pardon upon repentance. Yet they had a a
 general notion of the goodness of God's nature, his mercy to man, and 
 his being pleased with the repentance and conversion of sinners; and 
 from this they raised some hopes that he would spare them; they dare 
 not presume, but they will not despair. Note, Hope of mercy is the 
 great encouragement to repentance and reformation; and though there be 
 but some glimmerings of hope mixed with great fears arising from a 
 sense of our own sinfulness, and unworthiness, and long abuse of divine 
 patience, yet they may serve to quicken and engage our serious 
 repentance and reformation. Let us boldly cast ourselves at the 
 footstool of free grace, resolving that if we perish, we will perish 
 there; yet who knows but God will look upon us with compassion?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is a wonder of divine mercy in the sparing of these Ninevites 
 upon their repentance 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>God saw their works;</I> he not only heard their good words, by 
 which they professed repentance, but saw their good works, by which 
 they brought forth <I>fruits meet for repentance;</I> he saw that they 
 <I>turned from their evil way,</I> and that was the thing he looked for 
 and required. If he had not seen that, their fasting and sackcloth 
 would have been as nothing in his account. He saw there was among them
 a general conviction of their sins and a general resolution not to 
 return to them, and that for some days they lived better, and there was 
 a new face of things upon the city; and this he was well pleased with. 
 Note, God takes notice of every instance of the reformation of sinners, 
 even those instances that fall not under the cognizance and observation 
 of the world. He sees who turn from their evil way and who do not, and 
 meets those with favour that meet him in a sincere conversion. When 
 they repent of the evil of sin committed by them he repents of the evil 
 of judgment pronounced against them. Thus he spared Nineveh, and <I>did 
 not the evil which he said he would do against it.</I> Here were no 
 sacrifices offered to God, that we read of, to make atonement for sin, 
 but the <I>sacrifice of God is a broken spirit; a broken and contrite 
 heart,</I> such as the Ninevites now had, it what he <I>will not 
 despise;</I> it is what he will give countenance to and put honour 
 upon.</P>
