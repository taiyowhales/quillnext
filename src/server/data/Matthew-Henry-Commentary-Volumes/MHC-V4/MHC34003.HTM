 This chapter goes on with the burden of Nineveh, and concludes it. 

 I. The sins of that great city are charged upon it, murder
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+3:1">ver. 1</A>),

 whoredom and witchcraft

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+3:4">ver. 4</A>),

 and a general extent of wickedness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+3:19">ver. 19</A>.

 II. Judgments are here threatened against it, blood for blood 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+3:2,3">ver. 2, 3</A>),
 
 and shame for shameful sins, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+3:5-7">ver. 5-7</A>.

 III. Instances are given of the like desolations brought upon other 
 places for the like sins, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+3:8-11">ver. 8-11</A>.

 IV. The overthrow of all those things which they depended upon, and
 put confidence in, is foretold,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Woe to the bloody city! it <I>is</I> all full of lies <I>and</I>
 robbery; the prey departeth not;
 &nbsp; 2 The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the
 wheels, and of the pransing horses, and of the jumping chariots.
 &nbsp; 3 The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the
 glittering spear: and <I>there is</I> a multitude of slain, and a
 great number of carcases; and <I>there is</I> none end of <I>their</I>
 corpses; they stumble upon their corpses:
 &nbsp; 4 Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the well-favoured
 harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through
 her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.
 &nbsp; 5 Behold, I <I>am</I> against thee, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts; and I
 will discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the
 nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.
 &nbsp; 6 And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee
 vile, and will set thee as a gazing-stock.
 &nbsp; 7 And it shall come to pass, <I>that</I> all they that look upon
 thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who
 will bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Nineveh arraigned and indicted. It is a high charge that is here 
 drawn up against that great city, and neither her numbers nor her 
 grandeur shall secure her from prosecution. 

 1. It is a <I>city of blood,</I> in which a great deal of innocent
 blood is shed by unrighteous war, or under colour and pretence of 
 public justice, or by suffering barbarous murders to go unpunished; for 
 this the righteous God will make inquisition. 

 2. <I>It is all full of lies;</I> truth is banished from among them;
 there is no such thing as honesty; one knows not whom to believe nor 
 whom to trust. 

 3. It is all full of <I>robbery</I> and rapine; no man cares what
 mischief he does, nor to whom he does it: <I>The prey departs not,</I> 
 that is, they never know when they have got enough by spoil and 
 oppression. They shed blood, and told lies, in pursuit of the prey, 
 that they might enrich themselves.

 4. There is a <I>multitude of whoredoms</I> in it, that is, idolatries,
 spiritual whoredoms, by which she defiled herself, and to which she 
 seduced the neighbouring nations, as a well-favoured harlot, and sold 
 and ruined <I>nations through her whoredoms.</I> 

 5. She is a <I>mistress of witchcrafts,</I> and by them she <I>sells
 families,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 That which Nineveh aimed at was a universal monarchy, to be the 
 metropolis of the world, and to have all her neighbours under her feet; 
 to compass this, she used not only arms, but arts, compelling some, 
 deluding others, into subjection to her, and wheedling them as a harlot 
 by her charms to lay their necks under her yoke, suggesting to them 
 that it would be for their advantage. She courted them to join with her 
 in her idolatrous rites, to tie them the faster to her interests, and 
 made use of her wealth, power, and greatness, to draw people into 
 alliances with her, by which she gained advantages over them, and made 
 a hand of them. These were her whoredoms, like those of Tyre, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:15,17">Isa. xxiii. 15, 17</A>.

 These were her witchcrafts, with which she unaccountably gained
 dominion. And for this that God has a quarrel with her who, having 
 <I>made of one blood all nations of men,</I> never designed one to be a 
 nation of tyrants and another of slaves, and who claims it as his own 
 prerogative to be universal Monarch.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Nineveh condemned to ruin upon this indictment. Woe to this bloody 
 city! 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 
 See what this woe is.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Nineveh had with her cruelties been a terror and destruction to 
 others, and therefore destruction and terror shall be brought upon her. 
 Those that are for overthrowing all that come in their way will, sooner 
 or later, meet with their match. 

 (1.) Hear the alarm with which Nineveh shall be terrified, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 It is a formidable army that advances against it; you may hear them at 
 a distance, the <I>noise of the whip,</I> driving the chariot-horses 
 with fury; you may hear the noise of the <I>rattling of the wheels, the 
 prancing horses, and the jumping chariots;</I> the very noise is 
 frightful, but much more so when they know that all this force is 
 coming with all this speed against them, and they are not able to make 
 head against it. 

 (2.) See the slaughter with which Nineveh shall be laid waste

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 the sword drawn with which execution shall be done, <I>the bright sword 
 lifted up and the glittering spear,</I> the dazzling brightness of 
 which is very terrible to those whom they are lifted up against. See
 what havoc these make when they are commissioned to slay: <I>There is a 
 great number of carcases,</I> for the slain of the land shall be many; 
 <I>there is no end of their corpses;</I> there is such <I>a multitude 
 of slain</I> that it is in vain to go about to take the number of them; 
 they lie so thick that passengers are ready to stumble <I>upon their 
 corpses</I> at every step. The destruction of Sennacherib's army, 
 which, in the morning, were <I>all dead corpses,</I> is perhaps looked 
 upon here as a figure of the like destruction that should afterwards be 
 in Nineveh; for those that will not take warning by judgments at a 
 distance shall have them come nearer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Nineveh had with her whoredoms and witchcrafts drawn others to 
 shameful wickedness, and therefore God will load her with shame and 
 contempt 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+3:5-7"><I>v.</I> 5-7</A>):

 <I>The Lord of hosts</I> is <I>against her,</I> and then she shall be 
 exposed to the highest degree of disgrace and ignominy, shall not only 
 lose all her charms, but shall be made to appear very odious. When it 
 shall be seen that while she courted her neighbours it was with design 
 to ruin their liberty and property, when all her wicked artifices shall 
 be brought to light, then her <I>shame is discovered to the 
 nations.</I> When her proud pretensions are baffled, and her vain 
 towering hopes of an absolute and universal dominion brought to nought, 
 and she appears not to have been so strong and considerable as she 
 would have been thought to be, then <I>to see the nakedness of the land 
 do they come,</I> and it appears ridiculous. Then do they <I>cast
 abominable filth upon her,</I> as upon a carted strumpet, and <I>make 
 her vile</I> as the offscouring of all things; that great city, which 
 all nations had made court to and coveted an alliance with, has become 
 a gazing-stock, a laughing stock. Those that formerly looked upon her, 
 and fled to her, in hopes of protection from her, now <I>look upon her 
 and flee from her,</I> for fear of being ruined with her. Note, Those 
 that abuse their honour and interest will justly be disgraced and 
 abandoned, and, because miserable, will be made contemptible, and 
 thereby be made more miserable. When Nineveh is laid waste <I>who will 
 bemoan her?</I> Her trouble will be so great, and her sense of it so 
 deep, as not to admit relief from sympathy, or any comforting 
 considerations; or, if it would, none shall do any such good office: 
 <I>When shall I seek comforters for thee?</I> Note, Those that showed 
 no pity in the day of their power can expect to find no pity in the day 
 of their fall. When those about Nineveh, that had been deceived by her 
 wiles, come to be undeceived in her ruin, every one shall insult over 
 her, and none bemoan her. This was Nineveh's fate, when she was made a 
 spectacle, or gazing-stock. Note, The greater men's show was in the day 
 of their abused prosperity the greater will their shame be in the day 
 of their deserved destruction. <I>I will make thee an example;</I> so 
 Drusus reads it. Note, When proud sinners are humbled and brought down 
 it is designed that others should take example by them not to lift up 
 themselves in security and insolence when they prosper in the 
 world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8 Art thou better than populous No, that was situate among the
 rivers, <I>that had</I> the waters round about it, whose rampart <I>was</I>
 the sea, <I>and</I> her wall <I>was</I> from the sea?
 &nbsp; 9 Ethiopia and Egypt <I>were</I> her strength, and <I>it was</I>
 infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers.
 &nbsp; 10 Yet <I>was</I> she carried away, she went into captivity: her
 young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the
 streets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her
 great men were bound in chains.
 &nbsp; 11 Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also
 shalt seek strength because of the enemy.
 &nbsp; 12 All thy strong holds <I>shall be like</I> fig trees with the
 first-ripe figs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into the
 mouth of the eater.
 &nbsp; 13 Behold, thy people in the midst of thee <I>are</I> women: the
 gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the
 fire shall devour thy bars.
 &nbsp; 14 Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go
 into clay, and tread the mortar, make strong the brick-kiln.
 &nbsp; 15 There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee
 off, it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself many
 as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts.
 &nbsp; 16 Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of
 heaven: the cankerworm spoileth, and flieth away.
 &nbsp; 17 Thy crowned <I>are</I> as the locusts, and thy captains as the
 great grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day,
 <I>but</I> when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not
 known where they <I>are.</I>
 &nbsp; 18 Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall
 dwell <I>in the dust:</I> thy people is scattered upon the mountains,
 and no man gathereth <I>them.</I>
 &nbsp; 19 <I>There is</I> no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous:
 all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee:
 for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Nineveh has been told that God is against her, and then none can be for 
 her, to stand her in any stead; yet she sets God himself at defiance, 
 and his power and justice, and says, <I>I shall have peace.</I> 
 Threatened folks live long; therefore here the prophet largely shows 
 how vain her confidences would prove and insufficient to ward off the 
 judgment of God. To convince them of this,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He shows them that other places, which had been as strong and as 
 secure as they, could not keep their ground against the judgments of 
 God. Nineveh shall fall unpitied and uncomforted (for miserable 
 comforters will those prove who speak peace to those on whom God will 
 fasten trouble), and she shall not be able to help herself: <I>Art thou 
 better than populous No?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 He takes them off from their vain confidences by quoting precedents. 
 The city mentioned is <I>No,</I> a great city in the land of Egypt 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:25">Jer. xlvi. 25</A>),

 <I>No-Ammon,</I> so some read it both there and here. We read of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:14-16">Ezek. xxx. 14-16</A>.

 Some think it was <I>Diospolis,</I> others <I>Alexandria.</I> As God
 said to Jerusalem, <I>Go, see what I did to Shiloh</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:12">Jer. vii. 12</A>),

 so to Nineveh that great city, <I>Go, see what I did to populous
 No.</I> Note, It will help to keep us in a holy fear of the judgments 
 of God to consider that we are not better than those that have fallen 
 under those judgments before us. We deserve them as much, and are as 
 little able to grapple with them. This also should help to reconcile us 
 to afflictions. Are we better than such and such, who were in like 
 manner exercised? Nay, were not they better than we, and less likely to 
 be afflicted? Now, concerning No, observe, 

 1. How firm her standing seemed to be,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 She was fortified both by nature and art, was <I>situate among the 
 rivers.</I> Nile, in several branches, not only watered her fields, but 
 guarded her wall. <I>Her rampart was the sea,</I> the <I>lake of 
 Mareotis,</I> an Egyptian sea, like the sea of Tiberias. Her <I>wall 
 was from the sea;</I> it was fenced with a wall which was thought to 
 make the place impregnable. It was also supported by its interests and 
 alliances abroad, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 <I>Ethiopia,</I> or Arabia, <I>was her strength,</I> either by the 
 wealth brought to her in a way of trade or by the auxiliary forces 
 furnished for military service. The whole country of Egypt also 
 contributed to the strength of this populous city; so that it was 
 <I>infinite, and there was no end of it</I> (so it might be rendered); 
 She set no bounds to her ambition and knew no end of her wealth and 
 strength; people flocked to her endlessly, and she thought there never 
 would be any end of it; but it is God's prerogative to be infinite.
 <I>Put and Lubim were thy helpers,</I> two neighbouring countries of 
 Africa, Mauritania and Libya, that is, Libya Cyrenica, a country that 
 Egypt had much dependence upon. No, thus helped, seemed to sit as a 
 queen, and was not likely to see any sorrow. But,

 2. See how fatal her fall proved to be

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>Yet was she carried away,</I> and her strength failed her; even she
 that was so strong, so secure, yet <I>went into captivity.</I> This 
 refers to some destruction of that city which was then well-known, and 
 probably fresh in memory, though not recorded in history; for the 
 destruction of it by Nebuchadnezzar (if we should understand this 
 prophetically) could not be made an example to Nineveh; for the 
 reducing of Nineveh was one of the first of his victories and that of 
 Egypt one of the last. The strength and grandeur of that great city 
 could not be its protection from military execution.

 (1.) Not from that which was most barbarous; for <I>her young 
 children</I> had no compassion shown them, but were <I>dashed in pieces 
 at the top of all the streets</I> by the merciless conquerors.

 (2.) Not from that which was most inglorious and disgraceful: <I>They
 cast lots for her honourable men</I> that were made prisoners of war, 
 who should have them for their slaves. So many had they of them that 
 they knew not what to do with them, but they made sport with throwing 
 dice for them; <I>all her great men,</I> that used to be adorned on 
 state-days with chains of gold, <I>were</I> now <I>bound in chains of 
 iron;</I> they were <I>pinioned</I> or <I>handcuffed</I> (so the word 
 properly signifies), not only as slaves, but as condemned malefactors.
 What a mortification was this to <I>populous No,</I> to have her 
 honourable men and great men, that were her pride and confidence, thus 
 abused! Now hence he infers against Nineveh 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 "Thou also shalt be intoxicated, infatuated; thou also shalt reel and 
 stagger, as drunk with the cup of the Lord's fury, that shall be put 
 into thy hand" (see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:17,27">Jer. xxv. 17, 27</A>);

 "<I>Thou shalt fall and rise no more.</I> The cup shall go round, and
 come to thy turn, O Nineveh! to drink off at last, and shall be to thee 
 as the waters of jealousy."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He shows them that all those things which they reposed a confidence 
 in should fail them. 

 1. Did the men of Nineveh trust to their own magnanimity and bravery?
 Their hearts should sink and fail them. <I>They shall be hid,</I>
 shall abscond for shame, being in disgrace, abscond for fear, being in 
 distress and danger, and not able to face the enemies, because of whose 
 strength and terror, having no strength of their own, they shall 
 <I>seek strength,</I> shall come sneaking to their neighbours to beg 
 their assistance in a time of need. Thus God can <I>cut off the 
 spirit</I> of princes, and <I>take away their heart.</I> 

 2. Did they depend upon their barrier, the garrisons and strongholds
 they had, which were regularly fortified and bravely manned? Those
 shall prove but paper-walls, and <I>like the first-ripe figs,</I> 
 which, if you give the tree but a little shake, will <I>fall into the 
 mouth of the eater</I> that gapes for them; so easily will all their 
 strongholds be made to surrender to the advancing enemy, upon the first 
 summons,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Note, Strongholds, even the strongest, are no fence against the 
 judgments of God, when they come with commission. <I>The rich man's
 wealth is his strong city, and a high wall,</I> but only <I>in his own 
 conceit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:10">Prov. xviii. 10</A>.

 They are supposed to make their strongholds as strong as possible, and 
 are challenged to do their utmost to make them tenable, and serviceable 
 to them against the invader 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>Draw thee water for the siege;</I> lay in great quantities of water, 
 that that which is so necessary to the support of human life may not be 
 wanting; it is put here for all manner of provision, with which Nineveh 
 is ironically told to furnish herself, in expectation of a siege. "Take 
 ever so much care that thou mayest not be starved out, and forced by 
 famine to surrender, yet that shall not avail. <I>Fortify the 
 strongholds,</I> by adding out-works to them, or putting men and arms 
 into them," as with us by planting cannon upon them. "<I>Go into clay, 
 and tread the mortar,</I> and <I>make strong the brick-kiln;</I> take 
 all the pains thou canst in erecting new fortifications; but it shall 
 be all in vain, for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 there shall even <I>the fire devour thee</I> if it be taken by storm." 
 It is by fire and sword that in time of war the great devastations are 
 made. 

 3. Did they put confidence in the multitude of their inhabitants? Were
 they, from their number and valour, reckoned their strongest walls and 
 fortifications? Alas! these shall stand them in no stead; they shall 
 but sink the sooner under the weight of their own numbers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Thy people in the midst of thee are women;</I> they have no wisdom, 
 no courage; they shall be fickle, feeble, and faint-hearted, as women 
 commonly are in such times of danger and distress; they shall be at 
 their wits' end, adding to their griefs and fears by the power of their 
 own imagination, and utterly unable to do any thing for themselves; the 
 valiant men shall become cowards. <I>O ver&egrave; Phrygi&aelig;, neque 
 enim Phryges</I>--<I>Phrygian dames, not Phrygian men.</I> Though they 
 <I>make themselves many</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 as the <I>canker-worm</I> and <I>as the locust,</I> that come in vast 
 swarms, <I>though thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of 
 heaven,</I> though thy exchange be thronged with wealthy traders, who, 
 having so much money to stand up in defence of and so much to lay out 
 in the means of their defence, should, one would think, give the enemy 
 a warm reception, yet their hearts shall fail them too; though they be 
 numerous as caterpillars, yet the fire and sword shall eat them up 
 easily and irresistibly as the canker-worm, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 They are as numerous as those wasting insects, but their enemies shall 
 be mischievous like them. He adds 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+3:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 <I>The canker-worm spoils,</I> or <I>spreads herself, and flies 
 away.</I> Both the merchants and the enemies were compared to 
 canker-worms. The enemies shall spoil Nineveh, and carry away the 
 spoil, without opposition, or any hope of recovering it. Or the rich 
 merchants, who have come from abroad to settle in Nineveh, and have 
 raised vast estates there, out of which it was hoped they would 
 contribute largely for the defence of the city, when they see the 
 country invaded and the city likely to be besieged, will send away 
 their effects, and remove to some other place, will <I>spread their 
 wings</I> and <I>fly away</I> where they may be safe, and Nineveh shall 
 be never the better for them. Note, It is rare to find even those that 
 have shared with us in our joys willing to share with us in our griefs 
 too. The canker-worms will continue upon the field while there is any 
 thing to be had, but they are gone when all is gone. Those that men 
 have got by they do not care to lose by. Nineveh's merchants bid her
 farewell in her distress. Riches themselves are as the canker-worms,
 which on a sudden <I>fly away as the eagle towards heaven,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:5">Prov. xxiii. 5</A>.

 4. Did they put a confidence in the strength of their gates and bars? 
 What fence will those be against the force of the judgments of God?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 <I>The gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thy enemies,</I> 
 the gates of thy rivers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+2:6"><I>ch.</I> ii. 6</A>),

 the flood-gates, or the passes and avenues, by which the enemy would
 make his entrance into the country, or the gates of the cities; these, 
 though ever so strong and well-guarded, shall not answer their end: 
 <I>The fire shall devour thy bars,</I> the bars of thy gates, and then 
 they shall fly open. 

 5. Did they put a confidence in their king and princes? They should do
 them no service

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+3:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>Thy crowned heads are as the locusts;</I> those that had pomp and
 power, as crowned heads, were enfeebled, and had no power to make 
 resistance, when the enemy came in like a flood. "<I>Thy captains,</I> 
 that should lead thy forces into the field, are great indeed, and look 
 great, but they are as the great <I>grasshoppers,</I> the <I>maximum 
 quod sic--the largest specimens</I> of that <I>species;</I> still they 
 are but grasshoppers, worthless things, that can do no service. <I>They 
 encamp in the hedges, in the cold day,</I> the cold weather, <I>but, 
 when the sun arises, they flee away,</I> and are gone, nobody knows 
 whither. So these mercenary soldiers that lay slumbering about Nineveh, 
 when any trouble arises, flee away, and shift for their own safety.
 <I>The hireling flees, because he is a hireling.</I>" The <I>king of 
 Assyria</I> is told, and it is a shame he needs to be told it (who 
 might observe it himself), that <I>his shepherds slumber;</I> they have 
 no life or spirit to appear for the flock, and are very remiss in the 
 discharge of the duty of their place and the trust reposed in them: Thy 
 <I>nobles shall dwell in the dust,</I> and be buried in silence. 

 6. Did they hope that they should yet recover themselves and rally
 again? In this also they should be disappointed; for, when the 
 shepherds are smitten, the <I>sheep are scattered;</I> the people are 
 dispersed <I>upon the mountains</I> and <I>no man gathers them,</I> nor 
 will they ever come together of themselves, but will wander endlessly, 
 as scattered sheep do. The judgment they are under is as a wound, and 
 it is incurable; there is no relief for it, "<I>no healing of thy 
 bruise,</I> no possibility that the wound, which is so grievous and 
 painful to thee, should be so much as skinned over; thy case is 
 desperate

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+3:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>)

 and thy neighbours, instead of lending a hand to help thee, shall 
 <I>clap their hands over thee,</I> and triumph in thy fall; and the 
 reason is, because thou hast been one way or other injurious to them 
 all: <I>Upon whom has not thy wickedness passed continually?</I> Thou 
 hast been always doing mischief to those about thee; there is none of 
 them but what thou hast abused and insulted; and therefore they shall 
 be so far from pitying thee that they shall be glad to see thee 
 reckoned with." Note, Those that have been abusive to their neighbours 
 will, one time or another, find it come home to them; they are but 
 preparing enemies to themselves against their day comes to fall: and 
 those that dare not lay hands on them themselves will <I>clap their 
 hands over them,</I> and upbraid them with their former wickedness, for 
 which they are now well enough served and paid in their own coin.
 <I>The troublers shall be troubled</I> will be the burden of many, as 
 it is here <I>the burden of Nineveh.</I></P>
