 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The mind of God is revealed to this prophet, and by him to the people, 
 in the first three chapters, by signs and types, but afterwards only by 
 discourse. In this chapter we have, 

 I. The general title of the whole book, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. Some particular instructions which he was ordered to give to the
 people of God. 

 1. He must convince them of their sin in going a whoring from God, by
 marrying a wife of whoredoms, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:2,3">ver. 2, 3</A>.

 2. He must foretel the ruin coming upon them for their sin, in the
 names of his sons, which signified God's disowning and abandoning them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:4-6,8,9">ver. 4-6, 8, 9</A>.

 3. He must speak comfortable to the kingdom of Judah, which still
 retained the pure worship of God, and assure them of the salvation of 
 the Lord, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:7">ver. 7</A>.

 4. He must give an intimation of the great mercy God had in store both 
 for Israel and Judah, in the latter days 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:10,1">ver. 10, 11</A>),

 for in this prophecy many precious promises of mercy are mixed with the 
 threatenings of wrath.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri,
 in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, <I>and</I> Hezekiah, kings of
 Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of
 Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here is the prophet's name and surname; which he himself, as other 
 prophets, prefixes to his prophecy, for the satisfaction of all that he 
 is ready to attest what he writes to be of God; he sets his hand to it, 
 as that which he will stand by. His name, <I>Hosea,</I> or <I>Hosea</I> 
 (for it is the very same with Joshua's original name), signifies a 
 <I>saviour;</I> for prophets were instruments of salvation to the 
 people of God, so are faithful ministers; they help to save many a soul 
 from death, by saving it from sin. his surname was <I>Ben-Beeri,</I> or 
 <I>the son of Beeri.</I> As with us now, so with them then, some had 
 their surname from their place, as Micah the Morashite, Nahum the 
 Elkoshite; others from their parents, as Joel the son of Bethuel, and 
 here Hosea the son of Beeri. And perhaps they made use of that 
 distinction when the eminence of their parents was such as would bring 
 honour upon them; but it is a groundless conceit of the Jews that where 
 a prophet's father is names he also was a prophet. <I>Beeri</I> 
 signifies a <I>well,</I> which may put us in mind of the fountain of 
 life and living waters from which prophets are drawn and must be 
 continually drawing. 

 2. Here are his authority and commission: <I>The word of the Lord came 
 to him. It was to him;</I> it came with power and efficacy to him; it
 was revealed to him as a real thing, and not a fancy or imagination of 
 his own, in some such way as God then discovered himself to his 
 servants the prophets. What he said and wrote was by divine 
 inspiration; it was <I>by the word of the Lord,</I> as St. Paul speaks 
 concerning that which he had purely by revelation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:15">1 Thess. iv. 15</A>.
 
 Therefore this book was always received among the canonical books of
 the Old Testament, which is confirmed by what is quoted out of it in
 the New Testament, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:15,9:13,12:7,Ro+9:25,26,1Pe+2:10">Matt. ii. 15; ix. 13; xii. 7;
 Rom. ix. 25, 26; 1 Pet. ii. 10</A>.
 
 For the word of the Lord endures for ever.

 3. Here is a particular account of the times in which he
 prophesied--<I>in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings 
 of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of 
 Israel.</I> We have only this general date of his prophecy; and not the 
 date of any particular part of it, as, before, in Isaiah, Jeremiah, 
 Ezekiel, and Daniel, and, afterwards, in Haggai and Zechariah. Here is 
 only one king of Israel named, though there were many more within this 
 time, because, having mentioned the kings of Judah, there was no 
 necessity of naming the other; and, they being all wicked, he took no 
 pleasure in naming them, nor would do them the honour. Now by this 
 account here given of the several reigns in which Hosea prophesied (and 
 it should seem the word of the Lord still came to him, more or less, at 
 times, throughout all these reigns) it appears,

 (1.) That he prophesied a long time, that he began when he was very 
 young, which gave him the advantage of strength and sprightliness, and 
 that he continued at his work till he was very old, which gave him the 
 advantage of experience and authority. It was a great honour to him to 
 be thus long employed in such good work, and a great mercy to the 
 people to have a minister so long among them that so well knew their 
 state, and naturally cared for it, one they had been long used to and 
 who therefore was the more likely to be useful to them. And yet, for 
 aught that appears, he did but little good among them; the longer they 
 enjoyed him the less they regarded him; they despised his youth first, 
 and afterwards his age. 

 (2.) That he passed through a variety of conditions. Some of these 
 kings were very good, and, it is likely, countenanced and encouraged 
 him; others were very bad, who (we may suppose) frowned upon him and 
 discouraged him; and yet he was still the same. God's ministers must 
 expect to pass through <I>honour and dishonour, evil report and good 
 report,</I> and must resolve in both to hold fast their integrity and 
 keep close to their work. 

 (3.) That he began to prophesy at a time when the judgments of God were 
 abroad, when God was himself contending in a more immediate way with 
 that sinful people, who <I>fell into the hands of the Lord,</I> before 
 they were turned over <I>into the hands of man;</I> for in the days of 
 Uzziah, and of Jeroboam his contemporary, the dreadful earthquake was, 
 mentioned 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:5,Am+1:1">Zech. xiv. 5 and Amos i. 1</A>.
 
 And then was the plague of locusts,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:2-4,Am+7:1.Ho+4:3">Joel i. 2-4; Amos vii. 1; Hos. iv. 3</A>.

 The rod of God is sent to enforce the word and the word of God is sent
 to explain the rod, yet neither prevails till God by his Spirit opens 
 the ear to instruction and discipline.

 (4.) That he began to prophesy in Israel at a time when their kingdom 
 was in a flourishing prosperous condition, for so it was in the reign 
 of Jeroboam the second, as we find 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:25">2 Kings xiv. 25</A>,

 <I>He restored the coast of Israel,</I> and God <I>saved them by his
 hand;</I> yet then Hosea boldly tells them of their sins and foretels 
 their destruction. Men are not to be flattered in their sinful ways
 because they prosper in the world, but even then must be faithfully 
 reproved, and plainly told that their prosperity will not be their 
 security, nor will it last long if they <I>go on still in their 
 trespasses.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>2  The beginning of the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> by Hosea. And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and
 children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great
 whoredom, <I>departing</I> from the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 3  So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which
 conceived, and bare him a son.
 &nbsp; 4  And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a
 little <I>while,</I> and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the
 house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house
 of Israel.
 &nbsp; 5  And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the
 bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.
 &nbsp; 6  And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And <I>God</I> said
 unto him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah: for I will no more have mercy
 upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away.
 &nbsp; 7  But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save
 them by the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by
 sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These words, <I>The beginning of the word of the Lord by Hosea,</I> may 
 refer either, 

 1. To that glorious set of prophets which was raised up about this
 time. About this time there lived and prophesied Joel, Amos, Micah, 
 Jonah, Obadiah, and Isaiah; but Hosea was the first of them that 
 foretold the destruction of Israel; the <I>beginning of this word of 
 the Lord was by him.</I> We read in the history of this Jeroboam here 
 named

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:27">2 Kings xiv. 27</A>)

 that <I>the Lord</I> had <I>not</I> yet <I>said</I> he would <I>blot
 out the name of Israel,</I> but soon after he said he would, and Hosea 
 was the man that began to say it, which made it so much the harder task 
 to him, to be the first that should carry an unpleasing message and 
 some time before any were raised up to second him. Or, rather, 

 2. To Hosea's own prophecies. This was the first message God sent him 
 upon to this people, to tell them that they were <I>an evil and an 
 adulterous generation.</I> He might have desired to be excused from 
 dealing so roughly with them till he had gained authority and 
 reputation, and some interest in their affections. No; he must <I>begin 
 with this,</I> that they might know what to expect from a prophet of 
 the Lord. Nay, he must not only preach this to them, but he must write 
 it, and publish it, and leave it upon record as a witness against them. 
 Now here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The prophet must, as it were in a looking-glass, show them <I>their 
 sin,</I> and show it to be exceedingly sinful, exceedingly hateful. The 
 prophet is ordered to <I>take unto him a wife of whoredoms and children 
 of whoredoms,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 And he did so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 He married a woman of ill fame, <I>Gomer the daughter of Diblaim,</I> 
 not one that had been married and had committed adultery, for then she 
 must have been put to death, but one that had lived scandalously in the 
 single state. To marry such a one was not <I>malum in se--evil in 
 itself,</I> but only <I>malum per accidens--incidentally an evil,</I> 
 not prudent, decent, or expedient, and therefore forbidden to the 
 priests, and which, if it were really done, would be an affliction to 
 the prophet (it is threatened as a curse on Amaziah that his wife 
 should be a harlot, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:17">Amos vii. 17</A>),

 but not a sin when God commanded it for a holy end; nay, if commanded,
 it was his duty, and he must trust God with his reputation. But most
 commentators think that it was done <I>in vision,</I> or that it is no 
 more than a parable; and that was a way of teaching commonly used among 
 the ancients, particularly prophets; what they meant of others they 
 <I>transferred to themselves in a figure,</I> as St. Paul speaks, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:6">1 Cor. iv. 6</A>.

 He must take <I>a wife of whoredoms,</I> and have such children by her
 as every one would suspect, though born in wedlock, to be <I>children 
 of whoredoms,</I> begotten in adultery, because it is too common for 
 those who have lived lewdly in the single state to live no better in 
 the married state. "Now" (saith God) "Hosea, this people is to me such
 a dishonour, and such a grief and vexation, as a <I>wife of 
 whoredoms</I> and <I>children of whoredoms</I> would be to thee. <I>For 
 the land has committed great whoredoms.</I>" In all instances of 
 wickedness they had departed from the Lord; but their idolatry 
 especially is the whoredom they are here charged with. Giving that 
 glory to any creature which is due to God alone is such an injury and 
 affront to God as for a wife to embrace the bosom of a stranger is to 
 her husband. It is especially so in those that have made a profession 
 of religion, and have been taken into covenant with God; it is breaking 
 the marriage-bond; it is a heinous odious sin, and, as much as any 
 thing, besots the mind and takes away the heart. <I>Idolatry</I> is 
 <I>great whoredom,</I> worse than any other; it is departing from 
 <I>the Lord,</I> to whom we lie under greater obligations than any wife 
 does or can do to her husband. <I>The land has committed whoredom;</I>
 it is not here and there a particular person that is guilty of 
 idolatry, but the whole land is polluted with it; the sin has become 
 national, the disease epidemical. What an odious thing would it be for
 the prophet, a <I>holy man,</I> to have a whorish wife, and children 
 whorish like her! What an exercise would it be of his patience, and, if 
 she persisted in it, what could be expected but that he should give her 
 a bill of divorce! And is it not then much more offensive to the 
 <I>holy God</I> to have such a people as this to be called by his name 
 and have a place in his house? How great is his patience with them! And 
 how justly may he cast them off! It was as if he should have married
 Gomer the daughter of Diblaim, who probably was at that time a noted 
 harlot. The land of Israel was like Gomer the daughter of Diblaim.
 <I>Gomer</I> signifies <I>corruption; Diblaim</I> signifies <I>two 
 cakes,</I> or <I>lumps of figs;</I> this denotes that Israel was near 
 to ruin, and that their luxury and sensuality were the cause of it.
 They were as the <I>evil figs</I> that could not be eaten, they were so 
 evil. It intimates sin to be the daughter of plenty and destruction the 
 daughter of the abuse of plenty. Some give this sense of the command
 here given to the prophet: "Go, take thee a wife of <I>whoredoms,</I> 
 for, if thou shouldst go to seek for an honest modest woman, thou 
 wouldst not find any such, for the whole land, and all the people of 
 it, are given to whoredom, the usual concomitant of idolatry."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The prophet must, as it were through a perspective glass, show them 
 their ruin; and this he does in the names given to the children born of 
 this adulteress; for as <I>lust,</I> when it has <I>conceived, brings 
 forth sin,</I> so <I>sin, when it is finished, brings forth 
 death.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He foretels the fall of the royal family in the name he is appointed 
 to give to his first child, which was a son: <I>Call his name 
 Jezreel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 We find that the prophet Isaiah gave prophetical names to his children 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:3,8:3">Isa. vii. 3; viii. 3</A>),

 so this prophet here. Jezreel signifies <I>the seed of God</I> (so they 
 should have been); but it signifies also the <I>scattered of God;</I> 
 they shall be as sheep on the mountains that have no shepherds. <I>Call 
 them not Israel,</I> which signifies <I>dominion,</I> they have lost 
 all the honour of that name; but call them Jezreel, which signifies 
 <I>dispersion,</I> for those that have departed from the Lord will 
 wander endlessly. Hitherto they have been scattered as seek; let them 
 now be scattered as chaff. Jezreel was the name of one of the royal
 seats of the kings of Israel; it was a beautiful city, seated in a 
 pleasant valley, and it is with allusion to that city that this child 
 is called <I>Jezreel,</I> for <I>yet a little while and I will avenge 
 the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu,</I> from whom the present 
 king, Jeroboam, was lineally descended. The house of Jehu smarted for
 the sins of Jehu, for God often lays up men's iniquity for their 
 children and visits it upon them. It is <I>the kingdom of the house of 
 Israel,</I> which may be meant either of the present royal family, that 
 of Jehu, which God did quickly <I>cause to cease</I> (for the son of 
 this Jeroboam, Zechariah, reigned but <I>six months,</I> and he was the 
 last of Jehu's race), or of the whole kingdom in general, which 
 continued corrupt and wicked, and which was <I>made to cease</I> in the 
 reign of Hoshea, about seventy years after; and with God that is but a 
 <I>little while.</I> Note, Note, Neither the pomp of kings nor the 
 power of kingdoms can secure them from God's destroying judgments, if 
 they continue to rebel against him. 

 (2.) What is the ground of this controversy: <I>I will revenge the 
 blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu,</I> the blood which Jehu shed 
 at Jezreel, when by commission from God and in obedience to his 
 command, he utterly destroyed the house of Ahab, and all that were in 
 alliance with it, with all the worshippers of Baal. God approved of
 what he did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:30">2 Kings x. 30</A>):

 <I>Thou has done well in executing that which is right in my eyes;</I>
 and yet here God will avenge that <I>blood upon the house of Jehu,</I> 
 when the time has expired during which it was promised that his family 
 should reign, even to the fourth generation. But how comes the same
 action to be both rewarded and punished? Very justly; the matter of it 
 was good; it was the execution of a righteous sentence passed upon the 
 house of Ahab, and, as such, it was rewarded; but Jehu did it not in a 
 right manner; he aimed at his own advancement, not at the glory of God, 
 and mingled his own resentments with the execution of God's justice. He 
 did it with a malice against the sinners, but not with any antipathy to 
 the sin; for he kept up the worship of the golden calves, and <I>took 
 no heed to walk in the law of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:31">2 Kings x. 31</A>.

 And therefore when the measure of the iniquity of his house was full,
 and God came to reckon with them, the first article in the account is 
 (and, being first, it is put for all the rest) for the blood of the 
 house of Ahab, here called the <I>blood of Jezreel.</I> Thus when the 
 house of Baasha was rooted out it was because he did <I>like the house 
 of Jeroboam, and because he killed him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+16:7">1 Kings xvi. 7</A>.

 Note, Those that are entrusted with the administration of justice are
 concerned to see to it that they do it from a right principle and with 
 a right intention, and that they do not themselves live in those sins 
 which they punish in others, lest even their just executions should be 
 reckoned for, another day, as little less than murders.

 (3.) How far the controversy shall proceed; it shall be not a 
 correction, but a destruction. Some make those words, <I>I will visit, 
 or appoint, the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu,</I> to 
 signify, not as we read it the revenging of that bloodshed, but the 
 repeating of that bloodshed: "I will punish the house of Jehu, as I 
 punished the house of Ahab, because Jehu did not take warning by the 
 punishment of his predecessors, but trod in the steps of their 
 idolatry. And after the house of Jehu is destroyed <I>I will cause to 
 cease the kingdom of the house of Israel;</I> I will begin to bring it 
 down, though now it flourish." After the death of Zechariah, the last 
 of the house of Jehu, the kingdom of the ten tribes went to decay, and 
 dwindled sensibly. And, in order to the ruin of it, it is threatened

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 <I>I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel;</I> the 
 <I>strength of the warriors of Israel,</I> so the Chaldee. God will 
 disable them either to defend themselves or to resist their enemies. 
 And the <I>bow abiding in strength,</I> and being <I>renewed in the 
 hand,</I> intimates a growing power, so the <I>breaking of the bow</I> 
 intimates a sinking ruined power. The bow shall be broken <I>in the 
 valley of Jezreel,</I> where, probably, the armoury was; or, it may be, 
 in that valley some battle was fought, wherein the kingdom of Israel 
 was very much weakened. Note, There is no fence against God's 
 controversy; when he comes forth against a people their strong bows are 
 soon broken and their strong-holds broken down. In the valley of
 Jezreel they shed that blood which the righteous God would in that very 
 place avenge upon them; as some notorious malefactors are hanged in 
 chains just where the villainy they suffer for was perpetrated, that 
 the punishment may answer the sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He foretels God's abandoning the whole nation in the name he gives 
 to the second child. This was a daughter, as the former was a son, to 
 intimate that both sons and daughters had corrupted their way. Some 
 make to signify that Israel grew effeminate, and was thereby enfeebled 
 and made weak. Call the name of this daughter <I>Lo-ruhamah--not
 beloved</I> (so it is translated 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:25">Rom. ix. 25</A>),

 or <I>not having obtained mercy,</I> so it is translated 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:10">1 Pet. ii. 10</A>.

 It comes all to one. This reads the doom of the <I>house of Israel: I
 will no more have mercy</I> upon them. It intimates that God had shown 
 them great mercy, but they had abused his favours, and forfeited them, 
 and now he would show them favour no more. Note, Those that forsake 
 their own mercies for lying vanities have reason to expect that their 
 own mercies should forsake them, and that they should be left to their 
 <I>lying vanities,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+2:8">Jonah ii. 8</A>.

 Sin turns away the mercy of God even from <I>the house of Israel,</I>
 his own professing people, whose case is sad indeed when God says that 
 he will no more have mercy upon them. And then it follows, <I>I will
 utterly take them away,</I> will utterly <I>remove them</I> (so some), 
 will utterly <I>pluck them up,</I> so others. Note, When the streams of 
 mercy are stopped we can expect no other than that the vials of wrath 
 should be opened. Those whom God will no more have mercy upon shall be 
 utterly taken away, as dross and dung. The word for <I>taking away</I> 
 sometimes signifies to <I>forgive</I> sin; and some take it in that 
 sense here: <I>I will no more have mercy upon them, though in pardoning 
 I have pardoned them</I> heretofore. Though God has borne long, he will 
 not bear always, with a people that hate to be reformed. Or, <I>I will 
 no more have mercy upon them, that I should in any wise pardon 
 them,</I> or (as our margin reads it) <I>that I should altogether 
 pardon them.</I> If pardoning mercy is denied, no other mercy can be 
 expected, for that opens the door to all the rest. Some make this to 
 speak comfort: <I>I will no more have mercy upon them till in pardoning 
 I shall pardon them,</I> that is, till the Redeemer comes to Zion to 
 turn away ungodliness from Jacob. The Chaldee reads it, <I>But, if they 
 repent, in pardoning I will pardon them.</I> Even the greatest sinners, 
 if in time they bethink themselves and return, will find that <I>there 
 is forgiveness with God.</I></P>

 III. He must show them what mercy God had in store for the house of 
 Judah, at the same time that he was thus contending with the house of 
 Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah.</I> Note, Though some 
 are justly cast off for their disobedience, yet God will always secure 
 to himself a remnant that shall be the vessels and monuments of mercy. 
 When divine justice is glorified in some, yet there are others in whom 
 free grace is glorified. And, though some through unbelief are broken 
 off, yet God will have a church in this world till the end of time. It 
 aggravates the rejection of Israel that God will have mercy on Judah, 
 and not on them, and magnifies God's mercy to Judah that, though they 
 also have done wickedly, yet God did not reject them, as he rejected 
 Israel: <I>I will have mercy upon them and will save them.</I> Note, 
 Our salvation is owing purely to God's mercy, and not to any merit of 
 our own. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. This, without doubt, refers to the temporal salvations which God 
 wrought for Judah in a distinguishing way, the favours shown to them 
 and not to Israel. When the Assyrian armies had destroyed Samaria, and 
 carried the ten tribes away into captivity, they proceeded to besiege 
 Jerusalem; but God had mercy on the house of Judah, and saved them by 
 the vast slaughter which an angel made, in one night, in the camp of 
 the Assyrians; then they were <I>saved by the Lord their God</I> 
 immediately, and not by sword or bow. When the ten tribes were 
 continued in their captivity, and their land was possessed by others, 
 they being <I>utterly taken away,</I> God <I>had mercy on the house of 
 Judah</I> and <I>saved them,</I> and, after seventy years, brought them 
 back, <I>not by might or power, but by the Spirit of the Lord of 
 hosts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:6">Zech. iv. 6</A>.

 <I>I will save them by the Lord their God,</I> that is, by myself. God
 will be exalted <I>in his own strength,</I> will take the work into his 
 own hands. That salvation is sure which he undertakes to be the author 
 of; for, if he will work, none shall hinder. And that salvation is most 
 acceptable which he does <I>by himself. So the Lord alone did lead 
 him.</I> The less there is of man in any salvation, and the more of 
 God, the brighter it shines and the sweeter it tastes. I will save them 
 <I>in the word of the Lord</I> (so the Chaldee), for the sake of 
 Christ, the eternal word, and by his power. <I>I will save them not by 
 bow nor by sword,</I> that is,

 (1.) They shall be saved when they are reduced to so low an ebb that 
 they have neither bow nor sword to defend themselves with, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:8,1Sa+13:22">Judg. v. 8; 1 Sam. xiii. 22</A>.

 (2.) They shall be saved by the Lord when they are brought off from
 trusting to their own strength and their weapons of war, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:6">Ps. xliv. 6</A>.
 
 (3.) They shall be saved easily, without the trouble of sword and bow,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:5">Isa. ix. 5</A>,

 <I>I will save them by the Lord their God.</I> In the calling him 
 <I>their God,</I> he upbraids the ten tribes who had <I>cast him 
 off</I> from being <I>theirs,</I> for which reason he had <I>cast them 
 off,</I> and intimates what was the true reason why he had mercy, 
 distinguishing mercy, for the house of Judah, and saved them: it was in 
 pursuance of his covenant with them as the Lord their God, and in 
 recompence for their faithful adherence to him and to his word and 
 worship. But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. This may refer also to the salvation of Judah from idolatry, which 
 qualified and prepared them for their other salvations. And this is 
 indeed a salvation <I>by the Lord their God;</I> it is wrought only by 
 the power of his grace, and can never be wrought by <I>sword or 
 bow.</I> Just at the time that the kingdom of Israel was <I>utterly 
 taken away,</I> under Hoshea, the kingdom of Judah was gloriously 
 reformed, under Hezekiah, and was therefore preserved; and in Babylon 
 God saved them from their idolatry first, and then from their 
 captivity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Some make this promise to look forward to the great salvation which, 
 in the fulness of time, was to be wrought out <I>by the Lord our 
 God,</I> Jesus Christ, who came into the world to <I>save his people 
 from their sins.</I></P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a prediction,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Of the rejection of Israel for a time, which is signified by the 
 name of another child that Hosea had by his adulterous spouse, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.
 
 And still we must observe that those children whose names carried these 
 direful omens in them to Israel were all <I>children of whoredoms</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 all born of the harlot that Hosea married, to intimate that the ruin of 
 Israel was the natural product of the sin of Israel. If they had not 
 first revolted from God, they would never have been rejected by him; 
 God never leaves any till they first leave him. Here is, 

 1. The birth of this child: <I>When she had weaned</I> her daughter, 
 <I>she conceived and bore a son.</I> Notice is taken of the delay of 
 the birth of this child, which was to carry in its name a certain 
 presage of their utter rejection, to intimate God's patience with them, 
 and his unwillingness to proceed to extremity. Some think that her 
 bearing another son signifies that people's persisting in their 
 wickedness; lust still <I>conceived</I> and <I>brought forth sin.</I> 
 They<I> added to do evil</I> (so the Chaldee paraphrase expounds it); 
 they were old in adulteries, and obstinate. 

 2. The name given him: <I>Call him Lo-ammi--Not my people.</I> When
 they were told that God would <I>no more have mercy on them</I> they 
 regarded it not, but buoyed up themselves with this conceit, that they 
 were God's people, whom he could not but have mercy on. And therefore 
 he plucks that staff from under them, and disowns all relation to them: 
 <I>You are not my people, and I will not be your God.</I> "<I>I will 
 not be yours</I> (so the word it); I will be in no relation to you, 
 will have nothing to do with you; I will not be <I>your King, your</I> 
 Father, <I>your</I> patron and protector." We supply it very well with 
 that which includes all, "<I>I will not be your God; I will not be to 
 you</I> what I have been, nor what you vainly expect I should be, nor 
 what I would have been if you had kept close to me." Observe, "<I>You 
 are not my people;</I> you do not act as becomes my people; you are not 
 observant of me and obedient to me, as my people should be; you are not 
 my people, but the people of this and the other dunghill-deity; and 
 therefore I will not own you for my people, will not protect you, will 
 not put in any claim to you, not demand you, not deliver you out of the 
 hands of those that have seized you; let them take you; you are none of 
 mine. You will not have me to be your God, but pay your homage to the 
 pretenders, and therefore <I>I will not be your God;</I> you shall have 
 no interest in me, shall expect no benefit from me." Note, Our being 
 taken into covenant with God is owing purely to him and to his grace, 
 for then it begins on his side: <I>I will be to them a God,</I> and 
 then they shall be <I>to me a people; we love him because he first 
 loved us.</I> But our being cast out of covenant is owing purely to 
 ourselves and our own folly. The breach is on man's side: <I>You are 
 not my people,</I> and therefore <I>I will not be your God;</I> if God 
 <I>hate any,</I> it is because they <I>first hated him.</I> This was 
 fulfilled in Israel when they were <I>utterly taken away</I> into the 
 <I>land of Assyria,</I> and their place knew them no more. They were no 
 longer <I>God's people,</I> for they lost the knowledge and worship of 
 him; no prophets were sent to them, no promises made to them, as were 
 to the two tribes in their captivity; nay, they were no longer <I>a 
 people,</I> but, for aught that appears, were mingled with the nations 
 into which they were carried, and lost among them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Of the reduction and restoration of Israel in the fulness of time. 
 Here, as before, mercy is remembered in the midst of wrath; the 
 rejection, as it shall not be total, so it shall not be final 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>):

 <I>Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the 
 sea.</I> See how the same hand that wounded is stretched forth to heal, 
 and how tenderly he that has <I>torn binds up;</I> though God <I>cause 
 grief</I> by his threatenings, yet <I>he will have compassion,</I> and 
 will gather with everlasting kindness. They are very precious promises
 which are here made concerning the Israel of God, and which may be of 
 use to us now.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Some think that these promises had their accomplishment in the 
 return of the Jews out of their captivity in Babylon, when many of the 
 ten tribes joined themselves to Judah, and took the benefit of the 
 liberty which Cyrus proclaimed, came up in great numbers out of the 
 several countries into which they were dispersed, to their own land, 
 appointed Zerubbabel their head, and coalesced into one people, whereas 
 before they had been two distinct nations. And in their own land, where 
 God had by his prophets disowned and rejected them as none of his, he 
 would by his prophets own them and appear for them as his children; and 
 from all parts of the country they should come up to the temple to 
 worship. And we have reason to think that, though this promise has a 
 further reference, yet it was graciously intended and piously used for 
 the support and comfort of the captives in Babylon, as giving them a 
 general assurance of mercy which God had in store for them and their 
 land; their nation could not be destroyed so long as this blessing was 
 in it, was in reserve for it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Some think that these promises will not have their accomplishment, 
 at least not in full, till the general conversion of the Jews in the 
 latter days, which is expected yet to come, when the vast incredible 
 numbers of Jews, that are now dispersed as the sand of the sea, shall 
 be brought to embrace the faith of Christ and be incorporated in the 
 gospel-church. Then, and not till then, God will own them as his 
 people, his children, even there where they had lain under the dismal 
 tokens of their rejection. The Jewish doctors look upon this promise as 
 not having had its accomplishment yet. But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. It is certain that this promise had its accomplishment in the 
 setting up of the kingdom of Christ, by the preaching of the gospel, 
 and the bringing in both of Jews and Gentiles to it, for to this these 
 words are applied by St. Paul 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:25,26">Rom. ix. 25, 26</A>),

 and by St. Peter when he writes to the Jews of the dispersion,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:10">1 Pet. ii. 10</A>.

 Israel here is the gospel-church, the spiritual Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:16">Gal. vi. 16</A>),

 all believers who follow the steps, and inherit the blessing of
 faithful Abraham, who is the father of all that believe, whether Jews 
 or Gentiles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:11,12">Rom. iv. 11, 12</A>.

 Now let us see what is promised concerning this Israel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That it shall greatly multiply, and the numbers of it be
 increased; it shall be <I>as the sand of the sea, which cannot be 
 measured nor numbered.</I> Though Israel according to the flesh be 
 diminished and made few, the spiritual Israel shall be numerous, shall 
 be innumerable. In the vast multitudes that by the preaching of the 
 gospel have been brought to Christ, both in the first ages of 
 Christianity and ever since, this promise is fulfilled, thousands out 
 of every tribe in Israel, and out of other nations, <I>a multitude 
 which no man can number,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:4,9,Ga+4:27">Rev. vii. 4, 9; Gal. iv. 27</A>.

 In this the promise made to Abraham, when God called him Abraham the 
 <I>high father of a multitude,</I> had its full accomplishment 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:5">Gen. xvii. 5</A>),
 
 and that 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:17">Gen. xxii. 17</A>.

 Some observe that they are here compared to the <I>sand of the sea,</I>
 not only for their numbers, but as the sand of the sea serves for a 
 boundary to the waters, that they shall not overflow the earth, so the 
 Israelites indeed are a wall of defence to the places where they live, 
 to keep off judgments. God can do nothing against Sodom while Lot is 
 there.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That God will renew his covenant with the gospel-Israel, and will 
 incorporate it a church to himself, by as full and ample a charter as 
 that whereby the Old-Testament church was incorporated; nay, and its 
 privileges shall be much greater: "<I>In the place where it was said 
 unto them, You are not my people,</I> there shall you be again admitted 
 into covenant, and owned as my people." The <I>abandoned Gentiles</I> 
 in their respective places, and the <I>rejected Jews</I> in theirs, 
 shall be favoured and blessed. There, where the fathers were cast off 
 for their unbelief, the children, upon their believing, shall be taken 
 in. This is a blessed resurrection, the making of those the people of 
 God that were <I>not a people.</I> Nay, but the privilege is enlarged; 
 now it is not only, <I>You are my people,</I> as formerly, but <I>You 
 are the sons of the living God,</I> whether by birth you were Jews or 
 Gentiles. Israel under the law was <I>God's son, his first-born,</I> 
 but then they were as children <I>under age;</I> now, under the gospel, 
 they have grown up both to greater understanding and greater liberty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:1,2">Gal. iv. 1, 2</A>.
 
 Note,

 [1.] It is the unspeakable privilege of all believers that they have
 the living God for their Father, the ever-living God, and may look upon 
 themselves as his children by grace and adoption. 

 [2.] The sonship of believers shall be owned and acknowledged; it shall
 be <I>said to them,</I> for their comfort and satisfaction, nay, and it 
 shall be said for their honour in the hearing of the world, <I>You are 
 the sons of the living God.</I> Let not the saints disquiet themselves; 
 let not others despise them; for, sooner or later, there shall be a 
 manifestation of the children of God, and all the world shall be made 
 to know their excellency and the value God has for them. 

 [3.] It will add much to their comfort, very much to their honour, when
 they are dignified with the tokens of God's favour in that very place 
 where they had long lain under the tokens of his displeasure. This 
 speaks comfort to the believing Gentiles, that they need not go up to 
 Jerusalem, to be received and owned as God's children; no, they may 
 stay where they are, and <I>in that place,</I> though it be in the 
 remotest corner of the earth, <I>in that place</I> where they were at a 
 distance, where it was said to them, "<I>You are not God's people,</I>" 
 but are separated from them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:3,6">Isa. lvi. 3, 6</A>),

 even there, without leaving their country and kindred, they may by
 faith receive the <I>Spirit of adoption,</I> witnessing with their 
 spirits that "<I>they are the children of God.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) That those who had been at variance should be happily brought 
 together 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be 
 gathered together.</I> This uniting of Judah and Israel, those two 
 kingdoms that were now so much at variance, biting and devouring one 
 another, is mentioned only as a specimen, or one instance, of the happy 
 effect of the setting up of Christ's kingdom in the world, the bringing 
 of those that had been at the greatest enmity one against another to a 
 good understanding one of another and a good affection one to another. 
 This was literally fulfilled when the Galileans, who inhabited that 
 part of the country which belonged to the ten tribes, and probably for 
 the most part descended from them, so heartily joined with those that 
 were probably called <I>Jews</I> (that were of Judea) in following 
 Christ and embracing his gospel; and his first disciples were partly 
 Jews and partly Galileans. The first that were blessed with the light 
 of the gospel were of the <I>land of Zebulun and Naphtali</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:15">Matt. iv. 15</A>);

 and, though there was no good-will at all between the Jews and the
 Galileans, yet, upon their believing in Christ, they were happily 
 consolidated, and there were no remains of the former disaffection they 
 had to one another; nay, when the Samaritans believed, though between 
 them and the Jews there was a much greater enmity, yet in Christ there 
 was a perfect unanimity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:14">Acts viii. 14</A>.

 Thus Judah and Israel were <I>gathered together;</I> yet this was but a
 type of the much more celebrated coalition between Jews and Gentiles, 
 when, by the death of Christ, the partition-wall of the ceremonial law 
 was taken down. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:14-16">Eph. ii. 14-16</A>.

 Christ died, to <I>gather together in one all the children of God that 
 were scattered abroad,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:51,Eph+1:10">John xi. 51; Eph. i. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) That Jesus Christ should be the centre of unity to all God's 
 spiritual Israel. They shall all agree to <I>appoint to themselves one 
 head,</I> which can be no other than he whom God has appointed, even 
 Christ. Note, Jesus Christ is the head of the church, the one only head 
 of it, not only a head of government, as of the body politic, but a 
 head of vital influence, as of the natural body. To believe in Christ 
 is to appoint him to ourselves for our head, that is, to consent to 
 God's appointment, and willingly commit ourselves to his guidance and 
 government; and this in concurrence and communion with all good 
 Christians that make him their head; so that, though they are many, yet 
 in him they are one, and so become one with each other. <I>Qui 
 conveniunt in aliquo tertio inter se conveniunt--Those who agree with a
 third agree with each other.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) That, having appointed Christ for their head, <I>they shall come 
 up out of the land;</I> they shall come, some of all sorts, from all 
 parts, to join themselves to the church, as, under the Jewish economy, 
 they came up from all corners of the land of Israel to Jerusalem, to 
 worship 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+122:4">Ps. cxxii. 4</A>),

 <I>Thither the tribes go up,</I> to which there is a plain allusion in
 that prophecy of the accession of the Gentiles to the church

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:3">Isa. ii. 3</A>),

 <I>Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord.</I> It denotes
 not a local remove (for they are said to be in the same place,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 but a change of their mind, a spiritual ascent to Christ. They shall 
 <I>come up from the earth</I> (so it may be read); for those who have 
 given up themselves to Christ as their head take their affections off 
 from <I>this earth,</I> and the things of it, to set them upon 
 <I>things above</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:1,2">Col. iii. 1, 2</A>);
 
 for they are not of the world

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:19">John xv. 19</A>),

 but have their conversation in heaven. They shall <I>come up out of the
 land,</I> though it be the land of their nativity; they shall, in 
 affection, come out from it, that they may <I>follow the Lamb 
 withersoever he goes.</I> Thus the learned Dr. Pocock takes it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) That, when all this comes to pass, <I>great shall be the day of 
 Jezreel.</I> Though <I>great</I> is <I>the day of Jezreel's</I> 
 affliction (so some understand it), yet <I>great shall be the day</I> 
 of Jezreel's glory. This shall be Israel's day; the day shall be 
 <I>their own,</I> after their enemies have long had their day. Israel
 is here called <I>Jezreel,</I> the <I>seed of God,</I> the <I>holy 
 seed</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:13">Isa. vi. 13</A>),

 the <I>substance</I> of the land. This seed is now sown in the earth,
 and buried under the clods; but great shall be its day when the harvest 
 comes. Great was the church's day when there were <I>added to it daily 
 such as should be saved;</I> then did the Almighty <I>do great 
 things</I> for it.</P>
