 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have, 

 I. A threatening of the paucity and scarceness of man 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+4:1">ver. 1</A>),

 which might fitly enough have been added to the close of the foregoing
 chapter, to which it has a plain reference.

 II. A promise of the restoration of Jerusalem's peace and purity,
 righteousness and safety, in the days of the Messiah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+4:2-6">ver. 2-6</A>.

 Thus, in wrath, mercy is remembered, and gospel grace is a sovereign
 relief, in reference to the terrors of the law and the desolations made 
 by sin.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man,
 saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only
 let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It was threatened 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:25"><I>ch.</I> iii. 25</A>)

 that <I>the mighty men should fall by the sword in war,</I> and it was
 threatened as a punishment to the women that affected gaiety and a 
 loose sort of conversation. Now here we have the effect and consequence 
 of that great slaughter of men, 

 1. That though Providence has so wisely ordered that, <I>communibus
 annis--on an average of years,</I> there is nearly an equal number of 
 males and females born into the world, yet, through the devastations 
 made by war, there should scarcely be one man in seven left alive. As 
 there are deaths attending the bringing forth of children, which are 
 peculiar to the woman, who was first in transgression, so, to balance 
 that, there are deaths peculiar to men, those by the sword in the high 
 places of the field, which perhaps devour more than child-bed does. 
 Here it is foretold that such multitudes of men should be cut off that 
 there should be <I>seven women to one man.</I> 

 2. That by reason of the scarcity of men, though marriage should be
 kept up for the raising of recruits and the preserving of the race of 
 mankind upon earth, yet the usual method of it should be quite 
 altered,--that, whereas men ordinarily make their court to the women, 
 the women should now take hold of the men, foolishly fearing (as Lot's 
 daughters did, when they saw the ruin of Sodom and perhaps thought it 
 reached further than it did) that in a little time there would be none 
 left

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:31">Gen. xix. 31</A>),--

 that whereas women naturally hate to come in sharers with others, seven
 should now, by consent, become the wives of one man,--and that whereas 
 by the law the husband was obliged to provide food and raiment for his 
 wife

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+21:10">Exod. xxi. 10</A>),

 which with many would be the most powerful argument against multiplying
 wives, these women will be bound to support themselves; they will 
 <I>eat bread of their own earning, and wear apparel of their own 
 working,</I> and the man they court shall be at no expense upon them, 
 only they desire to be called his wives, to <I>take away the 
 reproach</I> of a single life. They are willing to be wives upon any 
 terms, though ever so unreasonable; and perhaps the rather because in 
 these troublesome times it would be a kindness to them to have a 
 husband for their protector. Paul, on the contrary, thinks the single 
 state preferable in a time of distress, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:26">1 Cor. vii. 26</A>.

 It were well if this were not introduced here partly as a reflection
 upon the daughters of Zion, that, notwithstanding the humbling 
 providences they were under

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:18"><I>ch.</I> iii. 18</A>),

 they remained unhumbled, and, instead of repenting of their pride and
 vanity, when God was contending with them for them, all their care was 
 to get husbands--that modesty, which is the greatest beauty of the fair
 sex, was forgotten, and with them the reproach of vice was nothing to 
 the reproach of virginity, a sad symptom of the irrecoverable 
 desolations of virtue.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>2  In that day shall the branch of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> be beautiful and
 glorious, and the fruit of the earth <I>shall be</I> excellent and
 comely for them that are escaped of Israel.
 &nbsp; 3  And it shall come to pass, <I>that he that is</I> left in Zion,
 and <I>he that</I> remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy,
 <I>even</I> every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem:
 &nbsp; 4  When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the
 daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem
 from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the
 spirit of burning.
 &nbsp; 5  And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will create upon every dwelling place of mount
 Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the
 shining of a flaming fire by night: for upon all the glory <I>shall
 be</I> a defence.
 &nbsp; 6  And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime
 from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from
 storm and from rain.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 By the foregoing threatenings Jerusalem is brought into a very 
 deplorable condition: every thing looks melancholy. But here the sun 
 breaks out from behind the cloud. Many exceedingly great and precious 
 promises we have in these verses, giving assurance of comfort which may 
 be discerned through the troubles, and of happy days which shall come 
 after them, and these certainly point at the kingdom of the Messiah, 
 and the great redemption to be wrought out by him, under the figure and 
 type of the restoration of Judah and Jerusalem by the reforming reign 
 of Hezekiah after Ahaz and the return out of their captivity in 
 Babylon; to both these events the passage may have some reference, but 
 chiefly to Christ. It is here promised, as the issue of all these 
 troubles,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That God will raise up a righteous branch, which shall produce 
 fruits of righteousness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>In that day,</I> that same day, at that very time, when Jerusalem
 shall be destroyed and the Jewish nation extirpated and dispersed, the 
 kingdom of the Messiah shall be set up; and then shall be the reviving 
 of the church, when every one shall fear the utter ruin of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Christ himself shall be exalted. He is the <I>branch of the 
 Lord,</I> the man the branch; it is one of prophetical names, <I>my 
 servant the branch</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+3:8,6:12">Zech. iii. 8; vi. 12</A>),

 the <I>branch of righteousness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:5,33:15">Jer. xxiii. 5; xxxiii. 15</A>),

 a <I>rod out of the stem of Jesse and a branch out of his roots</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:1"><I>ch.</I> xi. 1</A>),

 and this, as some think, is alluded to when he is called a
 <I>Nazarene,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:23">Matt. ii. 23</A>.

 Here he is called <I>the branch of the Lord,</I> because planted by his
 power and flourishing to his praise. The ancient Chaldee paraphrase
 here reads it, <I>The Christ, or Messiah, of the Lord.</I> He shall be 
 the beauty, and glory, and joy.

 (1.) He shall himself be advanced to the joy set before him and the
 glory which he had with the Father before the world was. He that was a
 reproach of men, whose visage was marred more than any man's, is now, 
 in the upper world, beautiful and glorious, as the sun in his strength, 
 admired and adored by angels. 

 (2.) He shall be beautiful and glorious in the esteem of all believers,
 shall gain an interest in the world, and a name among men above every 
 name. To those that believe he is precious, he is an honour

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:7">1 Pet. ii. 7</A>),

 the <I>fairest of ten thousand</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:10">Cant. v. 10</A>),

 and altogether glorious. Let us rejoice that he is so, and let him be
 so to us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His gospel shall be embraced. The success of the gospel is the fruit 
 of the branch of the Lord; all the graces and comforts of the gospel 
 spring from Christ. But it is called <I>the fruit of the earth</I> 
 because it sprang up in this world and was calculated for the present 
 state. And Christ compares himself to a <I>grain of wheat,</I> that 
 <I>falls into the ground and dies, and so brings forth much fruit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:24">John xii. 24</A>.

 The success of the gospel is represented by <I>the earth's yielding her
 increase</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+67:6">Ps. lxvii. 6</A>),

 and the planting of the Christian church is God's <I>sowing it to
 himself in the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:23">Hos. ii. 23</A>.

 We may understand it of both the persons and the things that are the
 products of the gospel: they shall be excellent and comely, shall 
 appear very agreeable and be very acceptable to those that have escaped 
 of Israel, to that remnant of the Jews which was saved from perishing 
 with the rest in unbelief, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:5">Rom. xi. 5</A>.

 Note, If Christ be precious to us, his gospel will be so and all its
 truths and promises--his church will be so, and all that belong to it. 
 These are the good fruit of the earth, in comparison with which all 
 other things are but weeds. It will be a good evidence to us that we 
 are of the chosen remnant, distinguished from the rest that are called 
 <I>Israel,</I> and marked for salvation, if we are brought to see a 
 transcendent beauty in Christ, and in holiness, and in the saints, the 
 excellent ones of the earth. As a type of this blessed day, Jerusalem, 
 after Sennacherib's invasion and after the captivity in Babylon, should 
 again flourish as a branch, and be blessed with the fruits of the 
 earth. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:31,32"><I>ch.</I> xxxvii. 31, 32</A>.

 <I>The remnant shall again take root downward and bear fruit
 upward.</I> And if by the fruit of the earth here we understand the 
 good things of this life, we may observe that these have peculiar 
 sweetness in them to the chosen remnant, who, having a covenant--right
 to them, have the most comfortable use of them. If the branch of the 
 Lord be beautiful and glorious in our eyes, even the fruit of the earth 
 also will be excellent and comely, because then we may take it as the 
 fruit of the promise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:16,1Ti+4:8">Ps. xxxvii. 16; 1 Tim. iv. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That God will reserve to himself a holy seed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 When the generality of those that have a place and a name in Zion and
 in Jerusalem shall be cut off as withered branches, by their own 
 unbelief, yet some shall be left. Some shall remain, some shall still 
 cleave to the church, when its property is altered and it has become 
 Christian; for God will not quite <I>cast off his people,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:1">Rom. xi. 1</A>.

 There is here and there one that is left. Now,

 1. This is a remnant <I>according to the election of grace</I> (as the
 apostle speaks,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:5">Rom. xi. 5</A>),

 such as are written among the living, marked in the counsel and
 fore-knowledge of God for life and salvation, <I>written to life</I> 
 (so the word is), designed and determined for it unalterably; for 
 "<I>what I have written I have written.</I>" Those that are kept alive 
 in killing dying times were written for life in the book of divine 
 Providence; and shall we not suppose those who are rescued from a 
 greater death to be such as were <I>written in the Lamb's book of 
 life?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:8">Rev. xiii. 8</A>.

 As many as were <I>ordained unto eternal life believed</I> to <I>the
 salvation of the soul,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Act+13:48">Acts xiii. 48</A>.

 Note, All that were <I>written among the living</I> shall be found
 among the living, every one; for of all that were given to Christ he 
 will lose none.

 2. It is a remnant <I>under the dominion of grace;</I> for every one
 that is <I>written among the living,</I> and is accordingly left, shall 
 be called <I>holy,</I> shall be holy, and shall be accepted of God 
 accordingly. Those only that are holy shall be left when the <I>Son of 
 man shall gather out of his kingdom every thing that offends;</I> and 
 all that are chosen to salvation are chosen to sanctification. See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:13,Eph+1:4">2 Thess. ii. 13; Eph. i. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That God will reform his church and will rectify and amend 
 whatever is amiss in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Then the remnant shall be <I>called holy, when the Lord shall have
 washed away their filth,</I> washed it from among them by cutting off 
 the wicked persons, washed it from within them by purging out the 
 wicked thing. They shall not be called so till they are in some measure 
 made so. Gospel times are times of reformation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:10">Heb. ix. 10</A>),

 typified by the reformation in the days of Hezekiah and that after
 captivity, to which this promise refers. Observe,

 1. The places and persons to be reformed. Jerusalem, though the holy
 city, needed reformation; and, being the holy city, the reformation of 
 that would have a good influence upon the whole kingdom. The daughters
 of Zion also must be reformed, the women in a particular manner, whom 
 he had reproved,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:16"><I>ch.</I> iii. 16</A>.

 When they were decked in their ornaments they thought themselves
 wondrously clean; but, being proud of them, the prophet call them their 
 <I>filth,</I> for no sin is more abominable to God than pride. Or by 
 the daughters of Zion may be meant the country towns and villages, 
 which were related to Jerusalem as the mother-city, and which needed 
 reformation. 

 2. The reformation itself. The filth shall be washed away; for
 wickedness is filthiness, particularly blood-shed, for which Jerusalem 
 was infamous

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:16">2 Kings xxi. 16</A>),

 and which defiles the land more than any other sin. Note, The reforming
 of a city is the cleansing of it. When vicious customs and fashions are 
 suppressed, and the open practice of wickedness is restrained, the 
 place is made clean and sweet which before was a dunghill; and this is 
 not only for its credit and reputation among strangers, but for the 
 comfort and health of the inhabitants themselves. 

 3. The author of the reformation: <I>The Lord shall do it.</I>
 Reformation-work is God's work; if any thing be done to purpose in it, 
 it is his doing. But how? By the judgment of his providence the
 sinners were destroyed and consumed; but it is by the Spirit of his 
 grace that they are reformed and converted. This is the work that is 
 done, not by might, nor by power, but by the <I>Spirit of the Lord of 
 hosts</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:6">Zech. iv. 6</A>),

 working both upon the sinners themselves that are to be reformed and
 upon magistrates, ministers, and others that are to be employed as 
 instruments of reformation. The Spirit herein acts,

 (1.) As a spirit of judgment, enlightening the mind, convincing the
 conscience,--as a spirit of wisdom, guiding us to deal prudently,

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:13">Isa. lii. 13</A>),--

 as a discerning, distinguishing, Spirit, separating between the
 precious and the vile.

 (2.) As a Spirit of burning, quickening and invigorating the
 afflictions, and making men zealously affected in a good work. The 
 Spirit works as fire, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:11">Matt. iii. 11</A>.

 An ardent love to Christ and souls, and a flaming zeal against sin,
 will carry men on with resolution in their endeavours to <I>turn away 
 ungodliness from Jacob.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:15,16">Isa. xxxii. 15, 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That God will protect his church, and all that belong to it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+4:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>);

 when they are purified and reformed they shall no longer lie exposed,
 but God will take a particular care of them. Those that are sanctified 
 are well fortified; for God will be to them a guide and a guard.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Their tabernacles shall be defended, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+4:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) This writ of protection refers to, 

 [1.] Their dwelling places, the tabernacles of their rest, their own
 houses, where they worship God alone, and with their families. That 
 blessing which is upon the <I>habitation of the just</I> shall be a 
 protection to it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:33">Prov. iii. 33</A>.

 In the <I>tabernacles of the righteous</I> shall the <I>voice of
 rejoicing and salvation be,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+118:15">Ps. cxviii. 15</A>.

 Note, God takes particular cognizance and care of the dwelling-places
 of his people, of every one of them, the poorest cottage as well as the 
 statliest palace. When iniquity is <I>put far from the tabernacle</I> 
 the Almighty shall be its defence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:23,26">Job xxiii. 23, 26</A>.

 [2.] Their assemblies or tabernacles of meeting for religious worship.
 No mention is made of the temple, for the promise points at a time when 
 not one stone of that shall be left upon another; but all the 
 congregations of Christians, though but two or three met together in 
 Christ's name, shall be taken under the special protection of heaven; 
 they shall be no more scattered, no more disturbed, nor shall <I>any 
 weapon formed against them prosper.</I> Note, we ought to reckon it a 
 great mercy if we have liberty to worship God in public, free from the 
 alarms of the sword of war or persecution.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) This writ of protection is drawn up, 

 [1.] In a similitude taken from the safety of the camp of Israel when
 they marched through the wilderness. God will give to the Christian 
 church as real proofs, though not so sensible, of his care of them, as 
 he then gave to Israel. The Lord will again <I>create a cloud and
 smoke by day,</I> to screen them from the scorching heat of the sun, 
 and the <I>shining of a flaming fire by night,</I> to enlighten and 
 warm the air, which in the night is cold and dark. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+13:21,Ne+9:19">Exod. xiii. 21; Neh. ix. 19</A>.

 This pillar of cloud and fire interposed between the Israelites and the
 Egyptians, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:20">Exod. xiv. 20</A>.

 Note, Though miracles have ceased, yet God is the same to the
 New-Testament church that he was to Israel of old; the very same 
 yesterday, to-day, and for ever.

 [2.] In a similitude taken from the outside cover of rams' skins and
 badgers' skins that was upon the curtains of the tabernacle, as if 
 every dwelling place of Mount Zion and every assembly were as dear to 
 God as that tabernacle was: <I>Upon all the glory shall be a 
 defense,</I> to save it from wind and weather. Note, The church on
 earth has its glory. Gospel truths and ordinances, the scriptures and 
 the ministry, are the church's glory; and upon all this glory there is 
 a defence, and ever shall be, for the <I>gates of hell shall not 
 prevail against the church.</I> If God himself be the glory in the 
 midst of it, he will himself be a wall of fire around about it, 
 impenetrable and impregnable. Grace in the soul is the glory of it, and 
 those that have it are <I>kept by the power of God</I> as in a 
 strong-hold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:5">1 Pet. i. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Their tabernacle shall be a defence to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 God's tabernacle was a pavilion to the saints

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:5">Ps. xxvii. 5</A>);

 but, when that is taken down, they shall not want a covert: the divine
 power and goodness shall be a tabernacle to all the saints. God himself 
 will be their hiding-place

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:7">Ps. xxxii. 7</A>);

 they shall be at home in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:9">Ps. xci. 9</A>.

 He will himself be to them as the <I>shadow of a great rock</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:2"><I>ch.</I> xxxii. 2</A>)

 and <I>his name a strong tower,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:10">Prov. xviii. 10</A>.

 He will be not only a shadow from the heat in the daytime, but a covert
 from storm and rain. Note, In this world we must expect change of
 weather and all the inconveniences that attend it; we shall meet with 
 storm and rain in this lower region, and at other times the heat of the 
 day no less burdensome; but God is a refuge to his people in all 
 weathers.</P>
