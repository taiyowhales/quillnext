 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have, 

 I. A high charge drawn up against both Israel and Judah for their sins,
 which were the ground of God's controversy with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 Particularly the sin of fraud and injustice, which Ephraim is charged
 with 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:7">ver. 7</A>),

 and justifies himself in,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:8">ver. 8</A>.

 And the sin of idolatry

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:11">ver. 11</A>),

 by which God is provoked to contend with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:14">ver. 14</A>.

 II. The aggravations of the sins they are charged with, taken from the
 honour God put upon their father Jacob 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>),

 the advancement of them into a people from low and mean beginnings 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:12,13">ver. 12, 13</A>),

 and the provision he had made them of helps for their souls by the 
 prophets he sent them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:10">ver. 10</A>.

 III. A call to the unconverted to turn to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:6">ver. 6</A>.

 IV. An intimation of mercy that God had in store for them,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:9">ver. 9</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind:
 he daily increaseth lies and desolation; and they do make a
 covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt.
 &nbsp; 2  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish
 Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he
 recompense him.
 &nbsp; 3  He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his
 strength he had power with God:
 &nbsp; 4  Yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and
 made supplication unto him: he found him <I>in</I> Bethel, and there
 he spake with us;
 &nbsp; 5  Even the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of hosts; the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> his memorial.
 &nbsp; 6  Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment, and
 wait on thy God continually.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Ephraim is convicted of folly, in staying himself upon Egypt and 
 Assyria, when he was in straits 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>Ephraim feeds on wind,</I> that is, feeds himself with vain hopes of 
 assistance from man, when he is at variance with God; and, when he 
 meets with disappointments, he still pursues the same game, and 
 greedily pants and <I>follows after the east wind,</I> which he cannot 
 catch holy of, nor, if he could, would it be nourishing, nay, would be 
 noxious. We say of the <I>wind in the east,</I> It is <I>good neither 
 for man nor beast.</I> It was said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:7"><I>ch.</I> viii. 7</A>),

 He <I>sows the wind;</I> and as he sows so he reaps (He <I>reaps the
 whirlwind</I>); and as he reaps so he feeds--He feeds on the wind, the 
 <I>east wind.</I> Note, Those that make creatures their confidence make 
 fools of themselves, and take a great deal of pains to put a cheat upon 
 their own souls and to prepare vexation for themselves: <I>He daily 
 increaseth lies,</I> that is, multiplies his correspondences and 
 leagues with his neighbours, which will all prove deceitful to him; 
 nay, they will prove desolation to him. Those very nations that he 
 makes his refuge will prove his ruin. Those that stay themselves upon 
 lies will be still coveting to increase them, that they may build their 
 hopes firmly upon them; as if many lies twisted together would make one 
 truth, or many broken reeds and rotten supports one sound one, which is 
 a great delusion and will prove to them a great desolation; for those 
 that <I>observe lying vanities</I> the more they increase them the more 
 disappointments they prepare for themselves and the further they run 
 from <I>their own mercies.</I> The men of Ephraim did so when they 
 thought to secure the Assyrians in their interests by a <I>solemn 
 league,</I> signed, sealed, and sworn to: <I>They make a covenant with 
 the Assyrians,</I> but they will find there is no hold of them; that 
 potent prince will be a slave to his word no longer than he pleases. 
 They thought to secure the Egyptians for their confederates by a rich 
 present of the commodities of their country, not only to purchase their 
 favour, but to show that their friendship was worth having: <I>Oil is
 carried into Egypt.</I> But the Egyptians, when they had got the bribe, 
 dropped the cause, and Ephraim was never the better for them. <I>Oleum 
 perdidit et operam--The oil and the labour are both lost.</I> This was 
 <I>feeding on wind;</I> this was <I>increasing lies and 
 desolation.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Judah is contended with too, and Jacob, which includes both Ephraim 
 and Judah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>The Lord has also a controversy with Judah;</I> for though he had a 
 while ago <I>ruled with God,</I> and been <I>faithful with the 
 saints,</I> yet now he begins to degenerate. Or though, in keeping 
 close to the house of David and the house of Aaron, and in them to the
 covenants of royalty and priesthood, they were so far <I>in the
 right,</I> in the former they <I>ruled with God</I> and in the latter
 were <I>faithful to the saints,</I> yet upon other accounts God <I>had
 a controversy</I> with them, and would punish them. Note, Men's
 being in the right in some things, in the main things, will not exempt
 them from correction, and therefore should not exempt them from
 reproof, for those things wherein they are in the wrong. There were
 those of the seven churches of Asia whom Christ approved and commended,
 and yet he adds, <I>Nevertheless I have something against thee.</I> So
 here; though the seed of Jacob are a people near to God, yet God will
 punish them according to the evil ways they are found in and the evil
 doings they are found guilty of; for God sees sin even in his own
 people, and will reckon with them for it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Both Ephraim and Judah are put in mind of their father Jacob, 
 whose seed they were and whose name they bore (and it was their 
 honour), of the extraordinary things which he did and which God did for 
 him, that they might be the more ashamed of themselves for degenerating 
 from so illustrious a progenitor and staining the lustre of so great a 
 name, and yet that they might be engaged and encouraged to return to 
 God, the God of their father Jacob, in hopes for his sake to find 
 favour with him. He had called this people Jacob 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 threatening to punish them; but <I>how shall I give them up?</I> How 
 shall that dear name be forgotten?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Three glorious things concerning Jacob the person Jacob the people 
 are here put in mind of; but by brief hints only, for it is presumed 
 that they knew the story:--

 (1.) His struggling with Esau in the womb: There <I>he took his brother 
 by the heel,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 We have the story
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:26">Gen. xxv. 26</A>.

 It was an early act of bravery, and an effort for the best precedency, 
 a pious ambition for that birthright in the covenant which Esau is 
 justly branded as profane for despising. But his degenerate seed, by 
 mingling with the nations, and making leagues with them, profaned that 
 crown, and laid that honour in the dust, which he so gloriously put in 
 for. Then it was that the dominion was given to him: <I>The elder shall 
 serve the younger.</I> Then he was owned of God as his beloved: 
 <I>Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.</I> But they had by their 
 sin forfeited both the love of God and dominion over their neighbours. 
 
 (2.) His wrestling with the angel. "Remember how your father Jacob had
 <I>power with God by his</I> own <I>strength,</I> the strength he had 
 by the gift of God, who <I>pleaded</I> not <I>against him by his great 
 power,</I> but <I>put strength into him,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:6">Job xxii. 6</A>.

 The angel he wrestled with is called <I>God,</I> and therefore is
 supposed to be the <I>Son of God,</I> the angel of the covenant. "God 
 was both a combatant with Jacob and an assistant of him, showing, in 
 the latter respect, greater strength than in the former, fighting as it 
 were against him with his left hand and for him with his right, and to 
 that putting greater force." So, Dr. Pocock. The providence of God 
 fought against him when he met with one danger after another, in his 
 return homewards; but the grace of God enabled him to go on cheerfully 
 in his way, and, when his faith acted upon the divine promise that was 
 for him prevailed above his fears that arose from the divine 
 providences that wee against him, then <I>by his strength he had power 
 with God.</I> But it refers especially to his prayer for deliverance 
 from Esau, and for a blessing: <I>He had power over the angel and 
 prevailed,</I> for he <I>wept and made supplication.</I> Here was a 
 mixture of the greatest courage and the greatest tenderness, Jacob 
 wrestling like a champion and yet weeping like a child. Note, Prayers 
 and tears are the weapons with which the saints have obtained the most 
 glorious victories. Thus Jacob commenced <I>Israel--a prince with 
 God;</I> his posterity was called <I>Israel,</I> but they were unworthy 
 the name, for they had forfeited and lost their communion with God, and 
 their interest in him, by revolting from their duty to him.

 (3.) His meeting with God at Bethel: God <I>found him</I> in Bethel, 
 <I>and there he spoke with us.</I> God found him the first time in 
 Bethel, as he went to Padanaram 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+28:10">Gen. xxviii. 10</A>),

 and a second time after his return,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:9">Gen. xxxv. 9</A>,

 &c. It is probable that this refers to both; for in both God spoke to
 Jacob, and renewed the covenant with him, and the prophet might very 
 well say, <I>There he spoke with us</I> who are the seed of Jacob, for 
 both times that God spoke with Jacob at Bethel he spoke with him 
 concerning his seed. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+28:14">Gen. xxviii. 14</A>,

 <I>Thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth;</I> and 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:12">Gen. xxxv. 12</A>,

 <I>This land I will give unto thy seed.</I> Thus God then covenanted 
 with him and his seed after him. Now justly are they upbraided with 
 this; for in that very place which their father Jacob called 
 <I>Bethel--the house of God,</I> in remembrance of the communion he 
 there had with God, did they set up one of the calves, and worship it; 
 thus they turned that Bethel into a <I>Beth-aven</I>--a <I>house of 
 iniquity.</I> There God <I>spoke with them</I> exceedingly great and 
 precious promises, which they had despised and lost the benefit of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Two inferences are here drawn from these stories concerning Jacob, 
 for instruction to his seed:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Here is a use of information. From what passed between God and 
 Jacob we may learn that <I>Jehovah, the Lord God of hosts,</I> is 
 <I>the God of Israel;</I> he was the God of Jacob, and this is <I>his 
 memorial</I> throughout all the generations of the seed of Jacob 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)--

 the more shame for those who forgot the memorial of their church, 
 deserted the God of their fathers, and exchanged a <I>Lord of hosts</I> 
 for Baalim. Note, Those only are accounted the people of God that keep 
 up a memorial of God, such a memorial of him as he himself has 
 instituted, by which he makes himself known and will have us to 
 remember him. Here are two memorials of his, by which he is 
 distinguished from all others, and is to be acknowledged and adored by 
 us.

 [1.] The former denotes his <I>existence of himself.</I> He is Jehovah,
 much the same with <I>I AM,</I> the same that <I>was, and is, and is to 
 come,</I> infinite, eternal, and unchangeable. Jehovah is <I>his 
 memorial,</I> his peculiar name.

 [2.] The latter denotes his dominion over all: He is the <I>God of
 hosts,</I> that has all the hosts of heaven and earth at his beck and 
 command, and makes what use he pleases of them. Jacob saw 
 <I>Mahanaim</I>--God's <I>two hosts,</I> about the time that he 
 <I>wrestled with the angel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:1,2">Gen. xxxii. 1, 2</A>),

 and so learned to call God the <I>God of hosts,</I> and transmitted it
 to us as his memorial. God's names, titles, and attributes, are the
 memorials of him; there is no need for images to be such. And that 
 which was a revelation of God to one is his memorial to many, to all 
 generations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Here is a use of exhortation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 "Is this so, that Jacob thy father had this communion with the Lord God 
 of hosts, and is this still his memorial?" Then,

 [1.] Let those that have gone astray from God be converted to him:
 <I>Therefore turn thou to thy God.</I> He that was the God of Jacob is 
 the God of Israel, is <I>thy God;</I> from him thou hast unjustly and 
 unkindly revolted; therefore turn thou to him by repentance and faith, 
 turn to him as thine, to love him, obey him, and depend upon him.

 [2.] Let those that are converted to him walk with him in all holy
 conversation and godliness: "<I>Keep mercy and judgment,</I> mercy in 
 relieving and succouring the poor and distressed, judgment in rendering 
 to all their due; be kind to all; do wrong to none. <I>Keep piety and 
 judgment</I>" (so it may be read); "live <I>righteously and godly in 
 this present world;</I> be devout and be honest. Do not only practise 
 these occasionally, but be careful, and constant, and conscientious in 
 the practice of them."

 [3.] Let those that walk with God be encouraged to live a life of
 dependence upon him: "<I>Wait on thy God continually,</I> with a 
 believing expectation to receive from him all the succours and supplies 
 thou standest in need of." Those that live a life of conformity to God 
 may live a life of confidence and comfort in him, if it be not their 
 own fault. Let our <I>eyes</I> be <I>ever towards the Lord,</I> and let 
 us preserve a holy security and serenity of mind under the protection 
 of the divine power and the influence of the divine favour, looking, 
 without anxiety, for a dubious event, and by faith keeping our spirits 
 sedate and even; this is waiting on God as our God in covenant, and 
 this we must do continually.</P>

 Lord return unto him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here are intermixed, in these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Reproofs for sin. When God is coming forth to contend with a people, 
 that he may demonstrate his own righteousness, he will demonstrate 
 their unrighteousness. Ephraim was called to turn to his God and 
 <I>keep judgment</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 now, to show that he had need of that call, he is charged with turning 
 from his God by idolatry, and breaking the laws of justice and 
 judgment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He is here charged with injustice against the precepts of the second 
 table, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.
 
 Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What the sin is wherewith he is charged: <I>He is a merchant.</I> 
 The margin reads it as a proper name, <I>He is Canaan,</I> or a 
 Canaanite, unworthy to be denominated from Jacob and Israel, and worthy 
 to be cast out with a curse from this good land, as the Canaanites 
 were. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:7">Amos ix. 7</A>.

 But Canaan sometimes signifies <I>a merchant,</I> and therefore is most
 likely to do so here, where Ephraim is charged with deceit in trade. 
 Though God had given his people a land flowing with milk and honey, yet 
 he did not forbid them to enrich themselves by merchandise, and they 
 succeeded the Canaanites in that as well as in their husbandry; they 
 sucked <I>the abundance of the seas and the treasures hidden in the 
 sand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:19">Deut. xxxiii. 19</A>.

 And, if they had been fair merchants, it would have been no reproach at
 all to them, but an honour and a blessing. But he is such a merchant as 
 the Canaanites were, who were honest only with good looking to, and, if 
 they could, cheated all they dealt with. Ephraim does so; he deceives
 and thereby oppresses. Note, There is oppression by fraud as well as 
 oppression by force. It is not only princes, lords, and masters, that 
 oppress their subjects, tenants, and servants, but merchants and 
 traders are often guilty of oppressing those they deal with, when they 
 impose upon their ignorance, or take advantage of their necessity, to 
 make hard bargains with them, or are rigorous and severe in exacting 
 their debts. Ephraim cheated,

 [1.] With a great deal of art and cunning: <I>The balances of deceit
 are in his hand.</I> He uses balances, and delivers his goods by weight 
 and measure, as if he would be very exact, but they are balances of 
 deceit, false weights and false measures, and thus, under colour of 
 doing right, he does the greatest wrong. Note, God has his eye upon
 merchants and traders, when they are weighing their goods and paying 
 their money, whether they do honestly or deceitfully. He observes what 
 balances they have in their hand, and how they hold them; and, though 
 those they deal with may not be aware of that sleight of hand with 
 which they make them balances of deceit, God sees it, and knows it.
 Trades by the wit of man are made <I>mysteries,</I> but it is a pity 
 that by the sin of man they should ever be made <I>mysteries of 
 iniquity.</I>

 [2.] With a great deal of pleasure and pride: <I>He loves to
 oppress.</I> To oppress is bad enough, but to love to do so is much 
 worse. His conscience does not check and reprove him for it, as it 
 ought to do; if it did, though he committed the sin, he could not 
 delight in it; but his corruptions are so strong, and have so triumphed 
 over his convictions, that he not only loves the gain of oppression, 
 but he loves to oppress, sins for sinning-sake, and takes a pleasure in 
 out-witting and over-reaching those that suspect him not.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How he justifies himself in this sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Wicked men will have something to say for themselves now when they are 
 told of their faults, some frivolous turn-off or other wherewith to 
 evade the convictions of the word. Ephraim stands indicted for a common 
 cheat. Now see what he pleads to the indictment. He does not deny the 
 charge, nor plead, Not guilty, yet does not make a penitent confession 
 of it and ask pardon, but insists upon his own justification. Suppose 
 it were so that he did use balances of deceit, yet,

 [1.] He pleads that he had got a good estate. Let the prophet say what
 he pleased of his deceit, of the sin of it and the curse of God that 
 attended it, he could not be convinced there was any harm or danger in 
 it, for this he was sure of that he had thriven in it: "<I>Yet I have 
 become rich, I have found me out substance.</I> Whatever you make of 
 it, I have made a good hand of it." Note, Carnal hearts are often 
 confirmed in a good opinion of their evil ways by their worldly 
 prosperity and success in those ways. But it is a great mistake. Every 
 word in what Ephraim says here proclaims his folly. <I>First,</I> It is 
 folly to call the riches of this world substance, for they are things 
 that are not, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:5">Prov. xxiii. 5</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> It is folly to think that we have them of ourselves, 
 to say (as some read it), <I>I have made myself rich;</I> what 
 <I>substance</I> I have is owing purely to my ingenuity and 
 industry--<I>I have found it; my might and the power of my hand have 
 gotten me this wealth. Thirdly,</I> It is folly to think that what we
 have is for ourselves. <I>I have found me out substance,</I> as if we 
 had it for our own proper use and behoof, whereas we hold it in trust, 
 only as stewards. <I>Fourthly,</I> It is folly to think that riches are 
 things to be gloried in, and to say with exultation, <I>I have become 
 rich.</I> Riches are not the honours of the soul, are not peculiar to 
 the best men, nor sure to us; and therefore <I>let not the rich man 
 glory in his riches,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:9,10">Jam. i. 9, 10</A>.

 <I>Fifthly,</I> It is folly to think that growing rich in a sinful way
 makes us innocent, or will make us safe, or may make us easy, in that 
 way; for the prosperity of fools deceives and destroys them. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:10,Pr+1:32">Isa. xlvii. 10; Prov. i. 32</A>.

 [2.] He pleads that he had kept a good reputation. It is common for
 sinners, when they are justly reproved by their ministers, to appeal to 
 their neighbours, and because they know no ill of them, or will say 
 none, or think well of what the prophets charge them with as bad, fly 
 in the face of their reprovers: <I>In all my labours</I> (says Ephraim) 
 <I>they shall find no iniquity in me that were sin.</I> Note, Carnal 
 hearts are apt to build a good opinion of themselves upon the fair 
 character they have among their neighbours. Ephraim was very secure; 
 for, <I>First,</I> All his neighbours knew him to be diligent in his 
 business; they had an eye upon <I>all his labours,</I> and commended 
 him for them. <I>Men will praise thee when thou doest well for thyself. 
 Secondly,</I> None of them knew him to be deceitful in his business. He 
 acted with so much policy that nobody could say to the contrary but 
 that he acted with integrity. For either, 

 1. He concealed the fraud, so that none discovered it: "Whatever
 iniquity there is, <I>they shall find</I> none;" as if no iniquity were 
 displeasing to God, and damning to the soul, but that which is open and 
 scandalous before men. What will it avail us that men shall find no 
 iniquity in us, when God finds a great deal, and will bring every 
 secret work, even secret frauds, into judgment? Or, 

 2. He excused the fraud, so that none condemned it: "<I>They shall find
 no iniquity in me that were sin,</I> nothing very bad, nothing but what 
 is very excusable, only some venial sins, sins not worth speaking of," 
 which they think God will make nothing of because they do not. It is a 
 fashionable iniquity; it is customary; it is what every body does; it 
 is pleasant; it is gainful; and this, they think, is no iniquity that 
 is sin; nobody will think the worse of them for it. But God sees not as 
 man sees; he judges not as man judges.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He is here charged with idolatry, against the precepts of the first 
 table, with that iniquity which is in a special manner vanity, the 
 making and worshipping of images, which are vanities 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>Surely they are vanity;</I> they do not profit, but deceive. Now the 
 prophet mentions two places notorious for idolatry:--

 (1.) Gilead on the other side Jordan, which had been branded for it 
 before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:8"><I>ch.</I> vi. 8</A>):

 <I>Is there iniquity in Gilead?</I> It is a thing to be wondered at; it
 is a thing to be sadly lamented. What! iniquity in Gilead? idolatry 
 there? Gilead was a fruitful pleasant country (pleasant to a proverb,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:6">Jer. xxii. 6</A>),

 and does it so ill requite the Lord? It was a frontier-country, and lay
 much exposed to the insults of enemies, and therefore stood in special 
 need of the divine protection; what! and yet by iniquity throw itself 
 out of that protection? <I>Is there iniquity in Gilead?</I> Yea,

 (2.) And in Gilgal too; there they <I>sacrifice bullocks</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9"5"><I>ch.</I> ix. 15</A>),

 and there <I>their altars</I> which they have set up, either to strange
 gods in opposition to his own appointed altar, are as thick <I>as 
 heaps</I> of manure <I>in the furrows of the field</I> that is to be 
 sown,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:11"><I>ch.</I> viii. 11</A>.

 <I>Is there iniquity in Gilead</I> only? so some. Is it only in those
 remote parts of the nation that people are so superstitious, where they 
 border upon other nations? No; they are as bad at Gilgal. In Gilead God 
 protected Jacob their father (of whom he had been speaking) from the 
 rage of Laban; and will you there commit iniquity?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here are threatenings of wrath for sin. Some make that to be so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 <I>I will make thee to dwell in tabernacles as in the days of the 
 appointed time,</I> that is, I will bring thee into such a condition as 
 the Israelites were in when they dwelt in tents and wandered for forty 
 years; that was the <I>time appointed</I> in <I>the wilderness.</I> 
 Ephraim forgot that God brought him out of Egypt and brought him up to 
 be what he was, and was proud of his wealth, and took sinful courses to 
 increase it; and therefore God threatens to bring him to a 
 tabernacle-state again, to a poor, mean, desolate, unsettled condition.
 Note, It is just with God, when men have by their sins turned their 
 tents into houses, by his judgments to turn their houses into tents 
 again. However, that is certainly a threatening 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 <I>Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly.</I> See how men are 
 deceived in their opinion of themselves, and how they will one day be 
 undeceived. Ephraim thought that there was no iniquity in him that
 deserved to be called sin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 but God told him that there was that in him which was sin, and would be 
 found so if he did not repent and reform; for, 

 1. It was extremely offensive to his God: <I>Ephraim provoked him to
 anger most bitterly</I> with his iniquities, which were so distasteful 
 to God, and to him too would be <I>bitterness in the latter end.</I> He 
 was so wilful in sinning against his knowledge and convictions that any 
 one might see, and say, that he designed no other than to provoke God 
 in the highest degree. 

 2. It would certainly be destructive to himself; that cannot be
 otherwise which provokes God against him, and kindles the fire of his 
 wrath. Therefore,

 (1.) He shall take away his forfeited life: <I>He shall leave his blood 
 upon him,</I> that is, he shall not hold him guiltless, but bring upon 
 him that death which is the wages of sin. <I>His blood shall be upon 
 his own head</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:16">2 Sam. i. 16</A>),

 for his own iniquity has testified against him and he alone shall bear
 it. Note, When sinners perish their blood is left upon them.

 (2.) He shall take away his forfeited honour: <I>His reproach shall his 
 Lord return upon him.</I> God is <I>his Lord;</I> he had by idolatry 
 and other sins reproached the Lord, and done dishonour to him, and to 
 his name and family, and had given occasion to others to reproach him; 
 and now God will return the reproach upon him, according to the word he 
 has spoken, that <I>those who despise him shall be lightly 
 esteemed.</I> Note, Shameful sins shall have shameful punishments. If 
 Ephraim put contempt on his God, he shall be so reduced that all his 
 neighbours shall look with contempt upon him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here are memorials of former mercy, which come in to convict them 
 of base ingratitude in revolting from God. Let them blush to 
 remember,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That God had raised them from meanness. When Ephraim had become 
 rich, and was proud of that, he forgot that which God (that he might 
 not forget it) obliged them every year to acknowledge 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+26:5">Deut. xxvi. 5</A>),

 <I>A Syrian ready to perish was my father.</I> But God here puts them
 in mind of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Let them remember, not only the honours of their father Jacob, what a 
 <I>mighty prince</I> he was with God,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>

 (an honour which they had no share in while they were in rebellion
 against God), but what a poor servant he was to Laban, which was 
 sufficient to mortify those that were puffed up with the estates they 
 had raised. <I>Jacob fled into Syria</I> from a malicious brother, and
 there served a covetous uncle <I>for a wife,</I> and <I>for a wife he 
 kept sheep,</I> because he had not estate to endow a wife with. Jacob 
 was poor, and low, and a fugitive; therefore his posterity ought not to 
 be proud. He was a plain man, dwelling in tents, and keeping sheep; 
 therefore <I>balances of deceit</I> ill became them. He <I>served for a 
 wife</I> that was not a Canaanitess, as Esau's wives were; therefore it 
 was a shame for them to degenerate into Canaanites, and mingle with the 
 nations. God wonderfully preserved him in his flight and preserved him 
 in his service, so that he multiplied exceedingly, and from that 
 <I>root</I> in a dry ground sprang an illustrious nation, that bore his 
 name, which magnifies the goodness of God both to him and them and 
 leaves them under the stain of base ingratitude to that God who was 
 their founder and benefactor.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That God had rescued them from misery, had raised them to what they 
 were, not only out of poverty, but out of slavery 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 which laid them under much stronger obligations to serve him and under
 a yet deeper guilt in serving other gods. 

 (1.) God <I>brought Israel out of Egypt</I> on purpose that they might 
 serve him, and by redeeming them out of bondage acquired a special 
 title to them and to their service.

 (2.) He preserved them, as sheep are kept by the shepherd's care. He 
 preserved them from Pharaoh's rage at the sea, even at the Red Sea, 
 protected them from all the perils of the wilderness, and provided for 
 them. 

 (3.) He did this <I>by a prophet,</I> Moses, who, though he is called 
 <I>king in Jeshurun</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:5">Deut. xxxiii. 5</A>),

 yet did what he did for Israel <I>as a prophet,</I> by direction from
 God and by the power of his word. The ensign of his authority was not a 
 royal sceptre, but the <I>rod of God;</I> with that he summoned both 
 Egypt's plagues and Israel's blessings. Moses, as a prophet, was a type 
 of Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:22">Acts iii. 22</A>),

 and it is by Christ as a prophet that we are brought out of the Egypt
 of sin and Satan by the power of his truth. Now this shows how very 
 unworthy and ungrateful this people were,

 [1.] In rejecting their God, who had brought them out of Egypt, which, 
 in the preface to the commandments, is particularly mentioned as a 
 reason for the first, why they should have no other gods before him.

 [2.] In despising and persecuting his prophets, whom they should have 
 loved and valued, and have studied to answer God's end in sending them, 
 for the sake of that prophet by whom God had brought them out of Egypt 
 and preserved them in the wilderness. Note, The benefit we have had by 
 the word of God greatly aggravates our sin and folly if we put any 
 slight upon the word of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That God had taken care of their education as they grew up. This 
 instance of God's goodness we have, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 As by a prophet he delivered them, so <I>by prophets</I> he still 
 continued to speak to them. Man, who is formed out of the earth, is fed 
 out of the earth; so that nation, that was formed by prophecy, by 
 prophecy was fed and taught; <I>beginning at Moses,</I> and so going on 
 <I>to all the prophets</I> through the several ages of that church, we 
 find that divine revelation was all along their tuition. 

 (1.) They had prophets raised up among themselves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:11">Amos ii. 11</A>),

 a succession of them, were scarcely ever without a Spirit of prophecy
 among them more or less, from Moses to Malachi.

 (2.) These prophets were <I>seers;</I> they had <I>visions,</I> and 
 <I>dreams,</I> in which God discovered his mind to them immediately, 
 with a full assurance that it was his mind, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:6">Num. xii. 6</A>.

 (3.) These visions were multiplied; God spoke not only <I>once, yea,
 twice,</I> but many a time; if one vision was not regarded, he sent 
 another. The prophets had variety of visions, and frequent repetitions 
 of the same.

 (4.) God <I>spoke</I> to them <I>by the prophets.</I> What the prophets 
 <I>received from the Lord</I> they plainly and faithfully delivered to 
 them. The people at Mount Sinai begged that God would speak to them by 
 men like themselves, and he did so. 

 (5.) In speaking to them by the prophets he <I>used similitudes,</I> to 
 make the messages he sent by them intelligible, more affecting, and 
 more likely to be remembered. The visions they saw were often
 similitudes, and their discourses were embellished with very apt 
 comparisons. And, as God by his prophets, so by his Son, he <I>used 
 similitudes,</I> for <I>he opened his mouth in parables.</I> Note, God 
 keeps an account, whether we do or no, of the sermons we hear; and 
 those that have long enjoyed the means of grace in purity, plenty, and 
 power, that have been frequently, faithfully, and familiarly, told the 
 mind of God, will have a great deal to answer for another day if they 
 persist in a course of iniquity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Here are intimations of further mercy, and this remembered too in 
 the midst of sin and wrath (as some understand 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>I that am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt,</I> who then and 
 there took thee to be my people, and have approved myself thy God ever 
 since, in a constant series of merciful providences, have yet a 
 kindness for thee, bad as thou art; and I will <I>make thee to dwell in 
 tabernacles,</I> not as in the wilderness, but <I>as in the days of the 
 solemn feast,</I>" the feast of tabernacles, which was celebrated with 
 great joy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:40">Lev. xxiii. 40</A>.

 1. They shall be made to see, by the grace of God, that though they are 
 rich, and have found out substance, yet they are but in a 
 tabernacle-state, and have in their worldly wealth <I>no continuing 
 city.</I> 

 2. They shall yet have cause to rejoice in God, and have opportunity to
 do it in public ordinances. The feast of tabernacles was the first 
 solemn feast the Jews kept after their return out of Babylon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:4">Ezra iii. 4</A>.
 
 3. This, as other promises, was to have its full accomplishment in the
 grace of the gospel, which provides tabernacles for believers in their 
 way to heaven, and furnishes them with matter of joy, holy joy, joy in 
 God, such as was in the feast of tabernacles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:18,19">Zech. xiv. 18, 19</A>.</P>
