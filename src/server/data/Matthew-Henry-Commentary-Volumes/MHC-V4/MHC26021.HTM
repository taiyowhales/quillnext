 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have, 

 I. An explication of the prophecy in the close of the foregoing chapter
 concerning the fire in the forest, which the people complained they 
 could not understand 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>),

 with directions to the prophet to show himself deeply affected with it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>.

 II. A further prediction of the sword that was coming upon the land, by
 which all should be laid waste; and this expressed very emphatically, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:8-17">ver. 8-17</A>.

 III. A prospect given of the king of Babylon's approach to Jerusalem,
 to which he was determined by divination, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:18-24">ver. 18-24</A>.

 IV. Sentence passed upon Zedekiah king of Judah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:25-27">ver. 25-27</A>.

 V. The destruction of the Ammonites by the sword foretold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:28-32">ver. 28-32</A>.
 
 Thus is this chapter all threatenings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop <I>thy
 word</I> toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of
 Israel,
 &nbsp; 3  And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Behold, I
 <I>am</I> against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of his
 sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.
 &nbsp; 4  Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and
 the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath
 against all flesh from the south to the north:
 &nbsp; 5  That all flesh may know that I the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> have drawn forth my
 sword out of his sheath: it shall not return any more.
 &nbsp; 6  Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of <I>thy</I>
 loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes.
 &nbsp; 7  And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest
 thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh:
 and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and
 every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak <I>as</I> water:
 behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord
 G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet had faithfully delivered the message he was entrusted with, 
 in the close of the foregoing chapter, in the terms wherein he received 
 it, not daring to add his own comment upon it; but, when he complained 
 that the people found fault with him for speaking parables, the word of 
 the Lord came to him again, and gave him a key to that figurative 
 discourse, that with it he might let the people into the meaning of it 
 and so silence that objection. For all men shall be rendered 
 inexcusable at God's bar and every mouth shall be stopped. Note, He 
 that <I>speaks with tongues</I> should <I>pray that he may 
 interpret,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:13">1 Cor. xiv. 13</A>.

 When we speak to people about their souls we should study plainness,
 and express ourselves as we may be the best understood. Christ 
 <I>expounded his parables to his disciples,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:34">Mark iv. 34</A>.

 1. The prophet is here more plainly directed against whom to level the
 arrow of this prophecy. He must <I>drop his word towards the holy 
 places</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 towards Canaan the holy land, Jerusalem the holy city, the temple the 
 holy house. These were highly dignified above other places; but, when 
 they polluted them, that word which used to drop in the holy places 
 shall now drop against them: <I>Prophesy against the land of 
 Israel.</I> It was the honour of Israel that it had prophets and 
 prophecy; but these, being despised by them, are turned against them. 
 And justly is Zion battered with her own artillery, which used to be 
 employed against her adversaries, seeing she knew not how to value it. 
 
 2. He is instructed, and is to instruct the people, in the meaning of
 the fire that was threatened to consume the forest of the south: it
 signified a sword drawn, the sword of war which should make the land
 desolate

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Behold, I am against thee, O land of Israel!</I> There needs no more
 to make a people miserable than to have God against them; for as, if he 
 be for us, we need not fear, whoever are against us, so, if he be 
 against us, we cannot hope, whoever are for us. And God's professing 
 people, when they revolt from him, set him against them, who used to be 
 for them. Was the fire there of God's kindling? The sword here is his
 sword, which he has prepared, and which he will give commission to; it 
 is he that will <I>draw it out of its sheath,</I> where it had laid 
 quiet and threatened no harm. Note, When the sword is unsheathed among 
 the nations God's hand must be eyed and owned in it. Did the fire 
 devour <I>every green tree</I> and <I>every dry tree?</I> The sword in 
 like manner shall <I>cut off the righteous and the wicked.</I> Good and 
 bad were involved in the common calamities of the nation; the righteous 
 were <I>cut off from the land of Israel</I> when they were sent 
 captives in Babylon, though perhaps few or none of them were cut off 
 from the land of the living; and it was a threatening omen to the land 
 of Israel that in the beginning of its troubles such excellent men as 
 Daniel and his fellows, and Ezekiel, were cut off from it and conveyed 
 to Babylon. But though the sword <I>cut off the righteous and the 
 wicked</I> (for it <I>devours one as well as another,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:25">2 Sam. xi. 25</A>),
 
 yet far be it from us to think that <I>the righteous are as the
 wicked,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:25">Gen. xviii. 25</A>.

 No; God's graces and comforts make a great difference when his
 providence seems to make none. The <I>good figs</I> are sent into 
 Babylon <I>for their good,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+24:5,6">Jer. xxiv. 5, 6</A>.

 It is only in outward appearance that there is <I>one event to the
 righteous and to the wicked,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:2">Eccl. ix. 2</A>.

 But it speaks the greatness of God's displeasure against the land of
 Israel. Well might it be said, <I>His eye shall not spare,</I> when it 
 shall not spare, no, not the <I>righteous</I> in it. Since there are 
 not righteous men sufficient to save the land, to make the justice of 
 God the more illustrious the few that there are shall suffer with it, 
 and God's mercy shall make it up to them some other way. Did the fire 
 <I>burn up all faces from the south to the north?</I> The sword shall 
 go <I>forth against all flesh from the south to the north,</I> shall go 
 forth, as God's sword, with a commission that cannot be contested, with 
 a force that cannot be resisted. Were all flesh made to know that God 
 kindled the fire? They shall be made to know that he has <I>drawn forth 
 the sword,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 And, <I>lastly,</I> Shall the fire that is <I>kindled never be 
 quenched?</I> So when this sword of the Lord is drawn against Judah and 
 Jerusalem the scabbard is thrown away, and it shall never be sheathed: 
 It <I>shall not return any more,</I> till it has made a full end. 

 3. The prophet is ordered, by expressions of his own grief and concern
 for these calamities that were coming on, to try to make impressions of 
 the like upon the people. When he has delivered his message he must 
 <I>sigh</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 must fetch many deep sighs, <I>with the breaking of his loins;</I> he 
 must sign as if his heart would burst, <I>sigh with bitterness,</I> 
 with other expressions of bitter sorrow, and this publicly, <I>in the 
 sight</I> of those to whom he delivered the foregoing message, that 
 this might be a sermon to their eyes as that was to their ears; and it 
 was well if both would work upon them. The prophet must sign, though it 
 was painful to himself and made his breast sore, and though it is 
 probable that the profane among the people would ridicule him for it 
 and call him a whining canting preacher. But, <I>if we be beside 
 ourselves it is to God;</I> and, if <I>this be to be vile, we will be 
 yet more so.</I> Note, Ministers, if they would affect others with the 
 things they speak of, must show that they are themselves in the 
 greatest sincerity affected with them, and must submit to that which 
 may create uneasiness to themselves, so that it will promote the ends 
 of their ministry. The people, observing the prophet to sigh so much 
 and seeing no visible occasion for it, would ask, "<I>Wherefore sighest 
 thou?</I> These sighs have some mystical meaning; let us know what it 
 is." And he must answer them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "It is <I>for the tidings,</I> the heavy tidings, that we shall hear 
 shortly; the <I>tidings come</I> (the judgments come which we hear the 
 tidings of), they come apace, and then you will all sigh; nay, that 
 will not serve. <I>every heart shall melt</I> and <I>every spirit 
 fail;</I> your courage will all be gone and you will have no animating 
 considerations to support yourselves with. And, when <I>heart</I> and 
 <I>spirit</I> fail, it will follow of course that <I>all hands will be 
 feeble</I> and unable to fight, and all <I>knees will</I> be <I>weak as 
 water</I> and unable to flee or to stand their ground." Those who have 
 God for them when flesh and heart fail have him to be <I>the strength 
 of their heart;</I> but those who have God against them have no cordial 
 for a fainting spirit, but are as Belshazzar when <I>his thoughts 
 troubled him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:6">Dan. v. 6</A>.

 But some people are worse frightened than hurt; may not the case be so
 here and the event prove better than likely? No: <I>Behold it 
 cometh,</I> and <I>shall be brought to pass.</I> It is not a bugbear 
 that they are frightened with, but <I>according to the fear so is the 
 wrath,</I> and more grievous than is feared.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  Again the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 9  Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Say, A
 sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished:
 &nbsp; 10  It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished
 that it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the
 rod of my son, <I>as</I> every tree.
 &nbsp; 11  And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be
 handled: this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it
 into the hand of the slayer.
 &nbsp; 12  Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it
 <I>shall be</I> upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of
 the sword shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon <I>thy</I>
 thigh.
 &nbsp; 13  Because <I>it is</I> a trial, and what if <I>the sword</I> contemn
 even the rod? it shall be no <I>more,</I> saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 14  Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite <I>thine</I>
 hands together, and let the sword be doubled the third time, the
 sword of the slain: it <I>is</I> the sword of the great <I>men that are</I>
 slain, which entereth into their privy chambers.
 &nbsp; 15  I have set the point of the sword against all their gates,
 that <I>their</I> heart may faint, and <I>their</I> ruins be multiplied:
 ah! <I>it is</I> made bright, <I>it is</I> wrapped up for the slaughter.
 &nbsp; 16  Go thee one way or other, <I>either</I> on the right hand, <I>or</I>
 on the left, whithersoever thy face <I>is</I> set.
 &nbsp; 17  I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my
 fury to rest: I the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> have said <I>it.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is another prophecy of the sword, which is delivered in a very 
 affecting manner; the expressions here used are somewhat intricate, and 
 perplex interpreters. The sword was unsheathed in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:1-7">foregoing verses</A>;

 here it is fitted up to do execution, which the prophet is commanded to
 lament. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How the sword is here described. 

 1. It is <I>sharpened,</I> that it may cut and wound, and make <I>a
 sore slaughter.</I> The wrath of God will put an edge upon it; and, 
 whatever instruments God shall please to make use of in executing his 
 judgments, he will fill them with strength, courage, and fury, 
 according to the service they are employed in. Out of the mouth of 
 Christ goes a <I>sharp sword,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:15">Rev. xix. 15</A>.
 
 2. It is <I>furbished,</I> that <I>it may glitter,</I> to the terror of 
 those against whom it is drawn. It shall be a kind of <I>flaming 
 sword.</I> If it have rusted in the scabbard for want of use, it shall 
 be rubbed and brightened; for though the glory of God's justice may 
 seem to have been eclipsed for a while, during the day of his patience 
 and the delay of his judgments, yet it will shine out again and be made 
 to glitter. 
 
 3. It is a victorious sword, nothing shall stand before it
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>It contemneth the rod of my son as every tree. Israel,</I> said God 
 once, <I>is my son, my first-born.</I> The government of that people 
 was called a <I>rod,</I> a <I>strong rod;</I> we read

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+19:11"><I>ch.</I> xix. 11</A>)

 of the <I>strong rods</I> they had <I>for sceptres.</I> But when the
 sword of God's justice is drawn it <I>contemns this rod,</I> makes 
 nothing of it; though it be a <I>strong rod,</I> and the <I>rod of his 
 son,</I> it is no more than <I>any other tree.</I> When God's 
 professing people have revolted from him, and are in rebellion against 
 him, his sword <I>despises</I> them. What are they to him more than 
 another people? The marginal reading gives another notion of this 
 sword: <I>It is the rod of my son;</I> and we know of whom God has said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:7">Ps. ii. 7</A>),
 
 <I>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee,</I> and

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 <I>Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron.</I> This sword is <I>that 
 rod of iron</I> which <I>contemns every tree</I> and will bear it down. 
 Or, This sword is <I>the rod of my son,</I> a correcting rod, for the 
 chastening of the transgression of God's people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:14">2 Sam. vii. 14</A>),

 not to cut them off from being a people. It is a sword to others, a rod
 to my son.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How the sword is here put into the hand of the executioners: "It is 
 <I>the rod of my Son,</I> and he has <I>given it that it may be 
 handled</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 that it may be made use of for the end for which it was drawn. <I>It is 
 given into the hand,</I> not of the fencer to be played with, but <I>of 
 the slayer</I> to do execution with. The sword of war my Son makes use 
 of as a sword of justice, and to him <I>all judgment is committed.</I> 
 It is <I>made bright</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 <I>it is wrapped up,</I> that it may be kept safe, and clean, and sharp 
 <I>for the slaughter,</I> not as Goliath's sword was wrapped <I>up in a 
 cloth</I> only for a memorial," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+21:9">1 Sam. xxi. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. How the sword is directed, and against whom it is sent 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):
 
 <I>It shall be upon my people;</I> they shall fall by this sword. It is 
 repeated again, as that which is scarcely credible, that <I>the 
 sword</I> of the heathen shall be upon God's own people; nay, it shall 
 be <I>upon all the princes of Israel;</I> their dignity and power as 
 princes shall be no more their security than their profession of 
 religion as princes of Israel. But, if the sword be at any time upon 
 God's people, have they not comfort within sufficient to arm them 
 against every thing in it that is frightful? Yes, they have, while they 
 conduct themselves as becomes his people; but these had not done so, 
 and therefore <I>terrors, by reason of the sword,</I> shall be upon 
 those that call themselves <I>my people.</I> Note, While good men are 
 quiet, not only from evil, but from the fear of it, wicked men are 
 disturbed not only with the sword, but with the terrors of it, arising 
 from a consciousness of their own guilt. This sword is directed 
 particularly <I>against the great men,</I> for they had been the 
 greatest sinners among them; they had <I>altogether broken the yoke and 
 burst the bonds</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:5">Jer. v. 5</A>),

 and therefore with them in a special manner God's controversy is, who
 had been the ringleaders in sin. The <I>sword of the slain</I> is 
 <I>the sword of the great men that are slain,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Though they have furnished themselves with places of retirement, places 
 of concealment, where they flatter themselves with hopes that they 
 shall be safe, they will find that the sword will <I>enter into their 
 privy chambers,</I> and find them out there, as the <I>frogs,</I> when 
 they were one of Egypt's plagues, found admission into the <I>chambers 
 of their kings.</I> The sword, the <I>point of this sword,</I> is 
 directed <I>against their gates,</I> against <I>all their gates</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 against all those things with which they thought to keep it out and 
 fortify themselves against it. Note, The strongest gates, though they 
 be <I>gates of brass,</I> ever so well barred, ever so well guarded, 
 are no fence against the point of the sword of God's judgments. But 
 when that is pointed against sinners, 

 1. They are ready to fear the worst; <I>their hearts faint,</I> so
 that they are not able to make any resistance. 

 2. The worst comes; whatever resistance they make, it is to no purpose, 
 but they are ruined, and <I>their ruins are multiplied.</I> But what 
 need have we to observe the particular directions of this sword when it 
 has a general commission, is sent with a running warrant?

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 "<I>Go thee, one way or other,</I> which way thou wilt, turn <I>to the 
 right hand or to the left,</I> thou wilt find those that are obnoxious, 
 for there are none free from guilt; and thou hast authority against 
 them, for there are none exempt from punishment; and therefore, 
 <I>whithersoever thy face is set,</I> that way do thou proceed, and, 
 like Jonathan's sword, <I>from the blood of the slain, from the fat of 
 the mighty, thou shalt never return empty,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:22">2 Sam. i. 22</A>.

 Note, So full is the world of wicked people that, which way soever
 God's judgments go forth, they will find work, will find matter to work 
 upon. That fire will never go out on this earth for want of fuel. And
 such various methods God has of meeting with sinners that the sword of 
 his justice is still as it was at first when it flamed in the hand of 
 the cherubim: it <I>turns every way,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:24">Gen. iii. 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. What is the nature of this sword, and what are the intentions and 
 limitations of it as to the people of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 It is a correction; it is designed to be so; the sword to others is a 
 rod to them. This is a comfortable word which comes in in the midst of 
 these terrible ones, though it be expressed somewhat obscurely. 

 1. The people of God begin to be afraid that <I>the sword will contemn
 even the rod,</I> that the sword will go on with such fury that it will 
 despise its commission to be a rod only, will forget its bounds and 
 become a sword indeed, even to God's own people. They fear lest the 
 Chaldeans' sword, which is the rod of God's anger, contemn its being 
 called a rod, and become as the <I>axe</I> that <I>boasts itself 
 against him that heweth therewith</I> or <I>the staff that lifts up 
 itself as if it were no wood,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:15">Isa. x. 15</A>.

 Or, "<I>What if the sword contemn even the rod?</I> that is, what if
 this sword make the former rods, as that or Sennacherib, to be 
 contemned as nothing to this? What if this should prove not a
 correcting rod, but a destroying sword, to make a full end of our 
 church and nation?" This is that which the thinking, but timorous, few 
 are apprehensive of. Note, When threatening judgments are abroad it is 
 good to suppose the worst that may be the consequences of them, that we 
 may provide accordingly. <I>What if the sword contemn the tribe or
 sceptre?</I> namely, that of Judah and the house of David (so some 
 think <I>Shebet</I> here signifies); what if it should aim at the ruin 
 of our government? If it do, <I>the Lord is righteous</I> and <I>will 
 be gracious</I> notwithstanding. But,

 2. These fears are silenced with an assurance that it is not so; the 
 sword shall not forget itself, nor the errand on which it is sent: 
 <I>It is a trial,</I> and it is <I>no more than a trial.</I> He that 
 sends it makes what use of it, and sets what bounds to it, he pleases. 
 Here shall its proud waves be stayed. Note, It is matter of comfort to
 the people of God, when his judgments are abroad, and they are ready to 
 tremble for fear of them, that, whatever they are to others, to them 
 they are but trials; and, <I>when they are tried, they shall come forth 
 as gold,</I> and the proving of their faith shall be the improving of 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Here the prophet and the people must show themselves affected with 
 these judgments threatened. 

 1. The prophet must be very serious in denouncing these judgments. He
 must say, <I>A sword! a sword!</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Let him not study for fine words, and a variety of quaint expressions; 
 when the town is on fire people do not so give notice of it, but cry, 
 with a frightful doleful voice, <I>Fire! fire!</I> So must the prophet 
 cry, <I>A sword! a sword!</I> and 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 <I>Let the sword be doubled</I> the <I>third time</I> in thy preaching. 
 God speaks once, yea, twice, yea, thrice; it were well if men, after 
 all, would perceive and regard it. It shall be <I>doubled the third 
 time</I> in God's providence; for it was Nebuchadnezzar's third descent 
 upon Jerusalem that <I>made a full end</I> of it. Ruin comes gradually, 
 but at last comes effectually, upon a provoking people. Yet this is not 
 all: the prophet is not only as a herald at arms to proclaim war, and 
 to cry, <I>A sword! a sword!</I> once and again, and a third time, but, 
 as a person nearly concerned, he must <I>cry and howl</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 must sadly lament the desolations that the sword would make, as one 
 that did himself not only sympathize with the sufferers, but feel from 
 the sufferings. Again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 <I>Prophesy, and smite thy hands together,</I> wring <I>thy hands,</I> 
 as lamenting the desolation, or clap thy hands, as by thy prophecy 
 instigating and encouraging those that were to be the instruments of 
 it, or as one standing amazed at the suddenness and severity of the 
 judgment. The prophet must <I>smite his hands together;</I> for (says 
 God) <I>I will also smite my hands together,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 God is in earnest in pronouncing this sentence upon them, and therefore 
 the prophet must show himself in earnest in publishing it. God's 
 <I>smiting his hands together,</I> as well as the prophet's smiting, is 
 in token of a holy indignation at their wickedness, which was really 
 very astonishing. When Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam he 
 <I>smote his hands together,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+24:10">Num. xxiv. 10</A>.

 Note, God and his ministers are justly angry at those who might be
 saved and yet will be ruined. Some make it an expression of triumph and 
 exultation, agreeing with that

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:24">Isa. i. 24</A>),

 <I>Ah! I will ease me of my adversaries;</I> and that

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:26">Prov. i. 26</A>),

 <I>I also will laugh at their calamity.</I> And so it follows here, 
 <I>I will cause my fury to rest,</I> not only it shall be perfected, 
 but it shall be pleased. And observe with what solemnity, with what 
 authority, this sentence is ratified: "<I>I the Lord have said it,</I> 
 who can and will make good what I have said. I have said it, and will 
 never unsay it. I have said it, and who can gainsay it?" 

 2. The people must be very serious in the prospect of these judgments.
 An intimation of this comes in in a parenthesis

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>Should we then make mirth?</I> Seeing God has drawn the sword, and 
 the prophet sighs and cries, <I>Should we then make mirth?</I> The 
 prophet seems to give this as a reason why he sighs; as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:3">Neh. ii. 3</A>,

 <I>Why should not my countenance be sad,</I> when Jerusalem lies waste? 
 Note, Before we allow ourselves to be merry, we ought to consider 
 whether we should be merry or no. Should we make mirth, we who are
 sentenced to the sword, who lie under the wrath and curse of God? Shall 
 we <I>make mirth as other people,</I> who have <I>gone a whoring from 
 our God?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:1">Hos. ix. 1</A>.

 Should we now make mirth, when the hand of God has gone out against us,
 when God's judgments are abroad in the land and he by them <I>calls to 
 weeping and mourning?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:11,13">Isa. xxii. 11, 13</A>.

 Shall we now make mirth as the king and Haman, when the church is in
 perplexity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+3:15">Esther iii. 15</A>),

 when we should be <I>grieving for the affliction of Joseph?</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  The word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me again, saying,
 &nbsp; 19  Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword
 of the king of Babylon may come: both twain shall come forth out
 of one land: and choose thou a place, choose <I>it</I> at the head of
 the way to the city.
 &nbsp; 20  Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the
 Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced.
 &nbsp; 21  For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at
 the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made <I>his</I> arrows
 bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver.
 &nbsp; 22  At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to
 appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up
 the voice with shouting, to appoint <I>battering</I> rams against the
 gates, to cast a mount, <I>and</I> to build a fort.
 &nbsp; 23  And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their
 sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to
 remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.
 &nbsp; 24  Therefore thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Because ye have made your
 iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are
 discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear;
 because, <I>I say,</I> that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be
 taken with the hand.
 &nbsp; 25  And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is
 come, when iniquity <I>shall have</I> an end,
 &nbsp; 26  Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Remove the diadem, and take off the
 crown: this <I>shall</I> not <I>be</I> the same: exalt <I>him that is</I> low,
 and abase <I>him that is</I> high.
 &nbsp; 27  I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no
 <I>more,</I> until he come whose right it is; and I will give it
 <I>him.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet, in the verses before, had shown them the sword coming; he 
 here shows them that sword coming against them, that they might not 
 flatter themselves that by some means or other it should be diverted a 
 contrary way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He must see and show the Chaldean army coming against Jerusalem and 
 determined by a supreme power so to do. The prophet must <I>appoint him 
 two ways,</I> that is, he must upon a paper draw out two roads 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),
 
 as sometimes is done in maps; and he must bring the king of Babylon's 
 army to the place where the roads part, for there they will make a 
 stand. They both <I>come out of the same land;</I> but when they come 
 to the place where one road leads to Rabbath, the head city of the 
 Ammonites, and the other to Jerusalem, he makes a pause; for, though he 
 is resolved to be the ruin of both, yet he is not determined which to 
 attack first; here his politics and his politicians leave him at a 
 loss. The sword must go either to Rabbath or <I>to Judah in 
 Jerusalem.</I> Many of the inhabitants of Judah had now taken shelter 
 in Jerusalem, and all the interests of the country were bound up in the 
 safety of the city, and therefore it is called <I>Judah in Jerusalem 
 the defenced;</I> so strongly fortified was it, both by nature and art, 
 that it was thought impregnable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:12">Lam. iv. 12</A>.

 The prophet must describe this dilemma that the king of Babylon is at

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>);

 for <I>the king of Babylon stood</I> (that is, he shall stand 
 considering what course to take) <I>at the head of the two ways.</I> 
 Though he was a prince of great foresight and great resolution, yet, it 
 seems, he knew neither his own interest nor his own mind. Let not the 
 wise man then glory in his wisdom nor the mighty man in his arbitrary 
 power, for even those that may do what they will seldom know what to do 
 for the best. Now observe, 

 1. The method he took to come to a resolution; he <I>used
 divination,</I> applied to a higher and invisible power, perhaps to the 
 determination of Providence by a lot, in order to which he <I>made his 
 arrows bright,</I> that were to be drawn for the lots, in honour of the 
 solemnity. Perhaps <I>Jerusalem</I> was written on one arrow and 
 <I>Rabbath</I> on the other, and that which was first drawn out of the 
 quiver he determined to attack first. Or he applied to the direction of 
 some pretended oracle: he <I>consulted with images</I> or 
 <I>teraphim,</I> expecting to receive audible answers from them. Or to 
 the observations which the augurs made upon the entrails of the 
 sacrifices: <I>he looked in the liver,</I> whether the position of that 
 portended good or ill luck. Note, It is a mortification to the pride
 of the wise men of the earth that in difficult cases they have been 
 glad to make their court to heaven for direction; as it is an instance 
 of their folly that they have taken such ridiculous ways of doing it, 
 when in cases proper for an appeal to Providence it is sufficient that 
 <I>the lot be cast into the lap,</I> with that prayer, <I>Give a 
 perfect lot,</I> and a firm belief that the <I>disposal thereof</I> is 
 not fortuitous, but <I>of the Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+16:33">Prov. xvi. 33</A>.

 2. The resolution he was hereby brought to. Even by these sinful
 practices God served his own purposes and directed him to go to 
 Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 <I>The divination for Jerusalem</I> happened to be <I>at his right 
 hand,</I> which, according to the rules of divination, determined him 
 <I>that way.</I> Note, What services God designs men for he will be 
 sure in his providence to lead them to, though perhaps they themselves 
 are not aware what guidance they are under. Well, Jerusalem being the 
 mark set up, the campaign is presently opened with the siege of that 
 important place. <I>Captains</I> are appointed for the command of the 
 forces to be employed in the siege, who must <I>open the mouth in the 
 slaughter,</I> must give directions to the soldiers what to do and make 
 speeches to animate them. Orders are given to provide every thing 
 necessary for carrying on the siege with vigour; <I>battering rams</I> 
 must be prepared and <I>forts built.</I> O what pains, what cost, are 
 men at to destroy one another!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He must show both the people and the prince that they bring this 
 destruction upon themselves by their own sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The people do so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.

 They slight the notices that are given them of the judgment coming. 
 Ezekiel's prophecy is to them a <I>false divination;</I> they are not 
 moved or awakened to repentance by it. When they hear that
 Nebuchadnezzar by his divination is directed to Jerusalem, and assured 
 of success in that enterprise, they laugh at it and continue 
 <I>secure,</I> calling it a <I>false divination;</I> because <I>they 
 have sworn oaths,</I> that is, they have joined in a solemn league with 
 the Egyptians, and they depend upon the promise they have made them to 
 <I>raise the siege,</I> or upon the assurances which the false prophets 
 have given them that it shall be raised. Or it may refer to the oaths 
 of allegiance they had sworn to the king of Babylon, but had violated, 
 for which treachery of theirs God had given them up to a judicial 
 blindness, so that the fairest warnings given them were slighted by 
 them as false divinations. Note, It is not strange if those who make a 
 jest of the most sacred oaths can make a jest likewise of the most 
 sacred oracles; for where will a profane mind stop? But shall their 
 unbelief invalidate the counsel of God? Are they safe because they are 
 secure? By no means; nay, the contempt they put upon divine warnings is 
 a sin that brings to remembrance their other sins, and they may thank 
 themselves if they be now remembered against them. 

 (1.) Their present wickedness is discovered. Now that God is contending 
 with them so perverse and obstinate are they that whatever they offer 
 in their own defence does but add to their offence; they never 
 conducted themselves so ill as they did now that they had the loudest 
 call given them to repent and reform: "<I>So that in all your doings 
 your sins do appear.</I> Turn yourselves which way you will, you show a 
 black side." This is too true of every one of us; for not only there is 
 <I>none that lives and sins not,</I> but <I>there is not a must man 
 upon earth that does good and sins not.</I> Our best services have such 
 allays of weakness, and folly, and imperfection, and so much 
 <I>evil</I> is <I>present with us</I> even when we <I>would do 
 good,</I> that we may say, with sorrow and shame, <I>In all our 
 doings,</I> and in all our sayings too, <I>our sins do appear,</I> and 
 witness against us, so that if we were under the law we were undone. 
 
 (2.) This brings to mind their former wickedness: "<I>You have made 
 your iniquity to be remembered,</I> not by yourselves that it might be 
 repented of, but by the justice of God that it might be reckoned for. 
 Your own sins make the sins of your fathers to be remembered against 
 you, which otherwise you should never have smarted for." Note, God 
 remembers former iniquities against those only who by the present 
 discoveries of their wickedness show that they do not repent of them. 
 
 (3.) That they may suffer for all together, they are turned over to the
 destroyed, that they may be taken

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 "<I>You shall be taken with the hand</I> that God had appointed to 
 seize you and to hold you and out of which you cannot escape." Men are 
 said to be <I>God's hand</I> when they are made use of as the ministers 
 of his justice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:14">Ps. xvii. 14</A>.

 Note, Those who will not be taken with the word of God's grace shall at
 last be taken by the hand of his wrath.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The prince likewise brings his ruin upon himself. Zedekiah is the 
 <I>prince of Israel,</I> to whom the prophet here, in God's name, 
 addresses himself; and, if he had not spoken in God's name, he would 
 not have spoken so boldly, so bluntly; for <I>is it fit to say to a 
 king, Thou art wicked?</I> 
 
 (1.) He gives him his character,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 Thou profane and <I>wicked prince of Israel!</I> He was not so bad as 
 some of his predecessors, and yet bad enough to merit his character. He 
 was himself profane, lost to every thing that is virtuous and sacred. 
 And he was wicked, as he promoted sin among his people; he sinned, and 
 <I>made Israel to sin.</I> Note, Profaneness and wickedness are bad in 
 any, but worst of all in a prince, a prince of Israel, who as an 
 Israelite should know better himself, and as a prince should set a 
 better example and have a better influence on those about him. 

 (2.) He reads him his doom. His iniquity <I>has an end;</I> the measure 
 of it is full, and therefore <I>his day has come,</I> the day of his 
 punishment, the day of divine vengeance. Note, Though those who are 
 wicked and profane may flourish awhile, yet <I>their day will come</I> 
 to fall. The sentence here passed is,

 [1.] That Zedekiah shall be deposed. He has forfeited his crown, and he 
 shall no longer wear it; he has by his profaneness profaned his crown, 
 and it shall be <I>cast to the ground</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>Remove the diadem.</I> Crowns and diadems are losable things; it is 
 only in the other world that there is a crown of glory that fades not 
 away, a <I>kingdom that cannot be moved.</I> The Chaldee paraphrase 
 expounds it thus: <I>Take away the diadem from Seraiah the chief 
 priest, and I will take away the crown from Zedekiah the king; neither 
 this nor that shall abide in his place, but shall be removed. This 
 shall not be the same,</I> not the same that he has been; <I>this not 
 this</I> (so the word is); profane and wicked perhaps he is as he has 
 been. Note, Men lose their dignity by their iniquity. Their profaneness 
 and wickedness remove their diadem, and take off their crown, and make 
 them the reverse of what they were. 

 [2.] That great confusion and disorder in the state shall follow 
 hereupon. Every thing shall be turned upside down. The conqueror shall 
 take a pride in <I>exalting him that is low</I> and <I>abasing him that 
 is high,</I> preferring some and degrading others, at his pleasure, 
 without any regard either to right or merit.

 [3.] Attempts to re-establish the government shall be blasted and come 
 to nothing, Gedaliah's particularly, and Ishmael's who was <I>of the 
 seed-royal</I> (to which the Chaldee paraphrase refers this); neither 
 of them shall be able to make any thing of it. <I>I will overturn, 
 overturn, overturn,</I> first one project and then another; for who can 
 build up what God will throw down?

 [4.] This monarchy shall never be restored till it is fixed for 
 perpetuity in the hands of the Messiah. There <I>shall be no more</I> 
 kings of the house of David after Zedekiah, till Christ comes, <I>whose 
 right the kingdom is,</I> who is that seed of David in whom the promise 
 was to have its full accomplishment, and <I>I will give it to him.</I> 
 He shall have <I>the throne of his father David,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:32">Luke i. 32</A>.
 
 Immediately before the coming of Christ there was a long eclipse of the
 royal dignity, as there was also a failing of the spirit of prophecy, 
 that his shining forth in the fulness of time both as king and prophet 
 might appear the more illustrious. Note, Christ has an incontestable 
 title to the dominion and sovereignty both in the church and in the 
 world; the kingdom is his right. And, having the right, he shall in due 
 time have the possession: <I>I will give it to him;</I> and there shall 
 be a general overturning of all rather than he shall come short of his 
 right, and a certain overturning of all the opposition that stands in 
 his way to make room for him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:45,1Co+15:25">Dan. ii. 45; 1 Cor. xv. 25</A>.

 This is mentioned here for the comfort of those who feared that the
 promise made in David would fail for evermore. "No," says God, "that 
 promise is sure, for the Messiah's kingdom shall last for ever."</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>28  And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord

 say thou, The sword, the sword <I>is</I> drawn: for the slaughter <I>it

 &nbsp; 30  Shall I cause <I>it</I> to return into his sheath? I will judge
 thee in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy
 nativity.
 &nbsp; 31  And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow
 against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prediction of the destruction of the Ammonites, which was effected 
 by Nebuchadnezzar about five years after the destruction of Jerusalem, 
 seems to come in here upon occasion of the king of Babylon's diverting 
 his design against Rabbath, when he turned it upon Jerusalem. Upon this 
 the Ammonites grew very insolent, and triumphed over Jerusalem; but the 
 prophet must let them know that forbearance is no acquittance; the 
 reprieve is not a pardon; their day also is at hand; their turn comes 
 next, and it will be but a poor satisfaction to them that they are to 
 be devoured last, to be last executed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The sin of the Ammonites is here intimated; it is <I>their 
 reproach,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 1. The reproach they put upon themselves when they hearkened to their 
 false prophets (for such it seems there were among them as well as 
 among the Jews), who pretended to foretel their perpetual safety in the 
 midst of the desolations that were made of the countries round about 
 them: "They <I>see vanity unto thee and divine a lie,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 They flatter thee with promises of peace, and thou art such a fool as 
 to suffer thyself to be imposed upon by them and to encourage them 
 therein by giving credit to them." Note, Those that feed themselves 
 with a self-conceit in the day of their prosperity prepare matter for a 
 self-reproach in the day of their calamity. 

 2. The reproach they put upon the Israel of God, when they triumphed in 
 their afflictions, and thereby added affliction to them, which was very 
 barbarous and inhuman. Their divines, by puffing them up with a
 conceit that they were a better people than Israel, being spared when 
 they were cut off, and with a confidence that their prosperity should 
 always continue, made them so very haughty and insolent that they did 
 even <I>tread on the necks of the Israelites that were slain, slain by 
 the wicked Chaldeans,</I> who had commission to execute God's judgments 
 upon them when their <I>iniquity had an end,</I> that is, when the 
 measure of it was full. We shall meet with this again,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:3"><I>ch.</I> xxv. 3</A>,

 &c. Note, Those are ripening apace for misery who trample upon the
 people of God in their distress, whereas they ought to tremble when 
 <I>judgment begins at the house of God.</I></P>

 II. The utter destruction of the Ammonites is threatened. For the 
 reproach cast on the church by her neighbours will be returned into 
 their own bosom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:12">Ps. lxxix. 12</A>.

 Let us see how terrible the threatening is and the destruction will be.

 1. It shall come <I>from the wrath of God,</I> who resents the
 indignities and injuries done to his people as done to himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 <I>I will pour out my indignation</I> as a shower of fire and brimstone 
 <I>upon thee.</I> The least drop of divine <I>indignation and wrath</I> 
 will create <I>tribulation and anguish</I> enough to the <I>soul of man 
 that does evil;</I> what then would a full stream of that indignation 
 and wrath do? "<I>I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath;</I> 
 that is, I will blow up the fire of my wrath against thee; it shall 
 burn with the utmost vehemence." <I>Thou shalt be for fuel to this 
 fire,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 Note, Wicked men make themselves fuel to the fire of God's wrath; they 
 are consumed by it, and it is inflamed by them. 

 2. It shall be effected by the sword of war; to them he must cry, as 
 before to Israel, because they had triumphed in Israel's overthrow: 
 <I>The sword, the sword is drawn</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:28,Eze+21:9,10"><I>v.</I> 28,
 compare <I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>);

 it is drawn <I>to consume because of the glittering,</I> because it is 
 brandished and glitters, and is fit to be made use of. God's executions 
 will answer his preparations. This sword, when it is drawn, <I>shall
 not return into its sheath</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>)

 till it has done the work for which it was drawn. When the sword is 
 drawn it does not return till <I>God causes it to return,</I> and <I>he 
 is in one mind and who can turn him?</I> Who can change his purpose? 

 3. The persons employed in it are <I>brutish men, and skilful to
 destroy.</I> Men of such a bad character as this, who have the wit of 
 men to do the work of wild beasts--human reason, which makes them 
 skilful, but no human compassion, which makes them skilful only to 
 destroy--though they are the scandal of mankind, yet sometimes are made 
 use of to serve God's purposes. God <I>delivers the Ammonites into the 
 hands of such,</I> and justly, for they themselves were brutish, and 
 delighted in the destruction of God's Israel. We have reason to pray, 
 as Paul desired to be prayed for, that we may be <I>delivered from 
 wicked and unreasonable men</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:2">2 Thess. iii. 2</A>),

 men that seem made for doing mischief.

 4. The place where they should thus be reckoned with: "<I>I will judge 
 thee where thou wast created,</I> where thou wast first formed into a 
 people, and where thou hast been settled ever since, and therefore 
 where thou seemest to have taken root; <I>the land of thy nativity</I> 
 shall be the land of thy destruction." Note, God can bring ruin upon us 
 even where we are most secure, and turn us out of that land which we 
 thought we had a title to not to be disputed and a possession of not to 
 be disturbed. <I>Thy blood shall be shed</I> not only in thy borders, 
 but <I>in the midst of thy land. Lastly,</I> I shall be an irreparable 
 ruin: "Though thou mayest think to recover thyself, it is in vain to
 think of it; thou <I>shalt be no more remembered</I> with any respect," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:6">Ps. ix. 6</A>.

 Justly is their name blotted out who would have Israel's name for ever
 lost.</P>
