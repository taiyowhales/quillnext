 God, by the prophet, goes on in this chapter, as before, 

 I. To encourage his people with the assurance of great blessings he had
 in store for them at their return out of captivity, and those typical 
 of much greater which the gospel church, his spiritual Israel, should 
 partake of in the days of the Messiah; and hereby he proves himself to 
 be God alone against all pretenders,

 II. To expose the sottishness and amazing folly of idol-makers and
 idol-worshippers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:9-20">ver. 9-20</A>.

 III. To ratify and confirm the assurances he had given to his people of
 those great blessings, and to raise their joyful and believing 
 expectations of them,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have
 chosen:
 &nbsp; 2  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> that made thee, and formed thee from the
 womb, <I>which</I> will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and
 thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.
 &nbsp; 3  For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods
 upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my
 blessing upon thine offspring:
 &nbsp; 4  And they shall spring up <I>as</I> among the grass, as willows by
 the water courses.
 &nbsp; 5  One shall say, I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s; and another shall call
 <I>himself</I> by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe
 <I>with</I> his hand unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and surname <I>himself</I> by the name
 of Israel.
 &nbsp; 6  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> the King of Israel, and his redeemer the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts; I <I>am</I> the first, and I <I>am</I> the last; and beside
 me <I>there is</I> no God.
 &nbsp; 7  And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it
 in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the
 things that are coming, and shall come, let them show unto them.
 &nbsp; 8  Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from
 that time, and have declared <I>it?</I> ye <I>are</I> even my witnesses. Is
 there a God beside me? yea, <I>there is</I> no God; I know not <I>any.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two great truths are abundantly made out in these verses:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That the people of God are a happy people, especially upon account 
 of the covenant that is between them and God. The people of Israel were
 so as a figure of the gospel Israel. Three things complete their 
 happiness:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The covenant-relations wherein they stand to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 Israel is here called <I>Jeshurun--the upright one;</I> for those only, 
 like Nathanael, are Israelites indeed, in whom is no guile, and those 
 only shall have the everlasting benefit of these promises. Jacob and 
 Israel had been represented, in the close of the foregoing chapter, as 
 very provoking and obnoxious to God's wrath, and already given to the 
 curse and to reproaches; but, as if God's bowels yearned towards him 
 and his repentings were kindled together, mercy steps in with a 
 <I>non-obstante--notwithstanding,</I> to all these quarrels: "<I>Yet 
 now, hear, O Jacob my servant!</I> thou and I will be friends again for 
 all this." God had said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:25"><I>ch.</I> xliii. 25</A>),

 <I>I am he that blotteth out thy transgression,</I> which is the only
 thing that creates this distance; and when that is taken away the 
 streams of mercy run again in their former channel. The pardon of sin 
 is the inlet of all the other blessings of the covenant. So and so I 
 will do for them, says God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:12">Heb. viii. 12</A>),

 <I>for I will be merciful to their unrighteousness.</I> Therefore
 <I>hear, O Jacob!</I> hear these comfortable words; therefore <I>fear 
 not, O Jacob!</I> fear not thy troubles, for by the pardon of sin the 
 property of them too is altered. Now the relations wherein they stand
 to him are very encouraging.

 (1.) They are his <I>servants;</I> and those that serve him he will own 
 and stand by and see that they be not wronged. 

 (2.) They are his <I>chosen,</I> and he will abide by his choice; he 
 knows those that are his, and those whom he has chosen he takes under 
 special protection.

 (3.) They are his creatures. He <I>made them,</I> and brought them into 
 being; he <I>formed them,</I> and cast them into shape; he began 
 betimes with them, for he <I>formed them from the womb;</I> and 
 therefore he will help them over their difficulties and help them in 
 their services.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The covenant-blessings which he has secured to them and theirs, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 (1.) Those that are sensible of their spiritual wants, and the 
 insufficiency of the creature to supply them, shall have abundant 
 satisfaction in God: <I>I will pour water upon him that is thirsty,</I> 
 that thirsts after righteousness; he shall be filled. Water shall be 
 poured out to those who truly desire spiritual blessings above all the 
 delights of sense. 

 (2.) Those that are barren as the dry ground shall be watered with the 
 grace of God, with floods of that grace, and God will himself give the 
 increase. If the ground be ever so dry, God has floods of grace to 
 water it with. 

 (3.) The water God will pour out is <I>his Spirit</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:39">John vii. 39</A>),

 which God will pour out without measure upon the seed, that is, Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:16">Gal. iii. 16</A>),

 and by measure upon all the seed of the faithful, upon all the praying
 wrestling seed of Jacob, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:13">Luke xi. 13</A>.

 This is the great New-Testament promise, that God, having sent his
 servant Christ, and upheld him, will send his Spirit to uphold us.

 (4.) This gift of the Holy Ghost is the great blessing God had reserved 
 the plentiful effusion of for the latter days: <I>I will pour my 
 Spirit,</I> that is, <I>my blessing;</I> for where God gives his Spirit 
 he will give all other blessings. 

 (5.) This is reserved for the seed and offspring of the church; for so 
 the covenant of grace runs: <I>I will be a God to thee and to thy 
 seed.</I> To all who are thus made to partake of the privileges of 
 adoption God will give the spirit of adoption. 

 (6.) Hereby there shall be a great increase of the church. Thus it
 shall be spread to distant places. Thus it shall be propagated and 
 perpetuated to after-times: <I>They shall spring up</I> and grow as 
 fast <I>as willows by the watercourses,</I> and in every thing that is 
 virtuous and praiseworthy shall be eminent and excel all about them, as 
 the willows overtop the grass among which they grow,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Note, It is a great happiness to the church, and a great pleasure to 
 good men, to see the rising generation hopeful and promising. And it 
 will be so if God pour his Spirit upon them, that blessing, that 
 blessing of blessings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The consent they cheerfully give to their part of the covenant, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 When the Jews returned out of captivity they renewed their covenant 
 with God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:5">Jer. l. 5</A>),

 particularly that they would have no more to do with idols, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:2,3,8">Hos. xiv. 2, 3, 8</A>.

 Backsliders must thus repent and do their first works. Many of those
 that were without did at that time join themselves to them, invited by 
 that glorious appearance of God for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:23,Es+8:17">Zech. viii. 23; Esth. viii. 17</A>.

 And they say, <I>We are the Lord's</I> and <I>call themselves by the
 name of Jacob;</I> for there was one law, one covenant, <I>for the 
 stranger and for those that were born in the land.</I> And doubtless it 
 looks further yet, to the conversion of the Gentiles, and the 
 multitudes of them who, upon the effusion of the Spirit, after Christ's 
 ascension, should be <I>joined to the Lord</I> and <I>added to the 
 church.</I> These converts are <I>one and another,</I> very many, of 
 different ranks and nations, and all welcome to God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:11">Col. iii. 11</A>.

 When one does it another shall by his example be invited to do it, and
 then another; thus the zeal of one may provoke many.

 (1.) They shall resign themselves to God: not one in the name of the 
 rest, but every one for himself shall say, "<I>I am the Lord's;</I> he 
 has an incontestable right to rule me, and I submit to him, to all his 
 commands, to all his disposal. I am, and will be, his only, his wholly, 
 his for ever, will be for his interests, will be for his praise; living 
 and dying I will be his." 

 (2.) They shall incorporate themselves with the people of God, <I>call 
 themselves by the name of Jacob,</I> forgetting their own people and 
 their fathers' house, and desirous to wear the character and livery of 
 God's family. They shall love all God's people, shall associate with
 them, give them the right hand of fellowship, espouse their cause, seek 
 the good of the church in general and of all the particular members of 
 it, and be willing to take their lot with them in all conditions. 

 (3.) They shall do this very solemnly. Some of them shall <I>subscribe
 with their hand unto the Lord,</I> as, for the confirming of a bargain, 
 a man sets his hand to it, and delivers it as his act and deed. The 
 more express we are in our covenanting with God the better, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+24:7,Jos+24:26,27,Ne+9:38">Exod. xxiv. 7; 
 Jos. xxiv. 26, 27; Neh. ix. 38</A>.

 Fast bind, fast find.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That, as the Israel of God are a happy people, so the God of Israel
 is a great God, and he is God alone. This also, as the former, speaks 
 abundant satisfaction to all that trust in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:6-8"><I>v.</I> 6-8</A>.

 Observe here, to God's glory and our comfort, 

 1. That the God we trust in is a God of incontestable sovereignty and 
 irresistible power. He is <I>the Lord,</I> Jehovah, self-existent and 
 self-sufficient; and he is <I>the Lord of hosts,</I> of all the hosts 
 of heaven and earth, of angels and men. 

 2. That he stands in relation to, and has a particular concern for, his 
 church. He is <I>the King of Israel and his Redeemer; therefore</I> his 
 Redeemer because his King; and those that take God for their King shall 
 have him for their Redeemer. When God would assert himself God alone he 
 proclaims himself Israel's God, that his people may be encouraged both 
 to adhere to him and to triumph in him. 

 3. That he is eternal--<I>the first and the last.</I> He is God from
 everlasting, before the worlds were, and will be so to everlasting, 
 when the world shall be no more. If there were not a God to create,
 nothing would ever have been; and, if there were not a God to uphold, 
 all would soon come to nothing again. He is all in all, is the first 
 cause, from whom are all things, and the last end, to and for whom are 
 all things 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:36">Rom. xi. 36</A>),
 
 the <I>Alpha and the Omega,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:11">Rev. i. 11</A>.

 4. That he is God alone

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Besides me there is no God. Is there a God besides me?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 We will appeal to the greatest scholars. Did they ever in all their 
 reading meet with any other? To those that have had the largest 
 acquaintance with the world. Did they ever meet with any other? There 
 are <I>gods many</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:5,6">1 Cor. viii. 5, 6</A>),

 <I>called gods,</I> and counterfeit gods: but is there any besides our
 God that is infinite and eternal, any besides him that is the creator 
 of the world and the protector and benefactor of the whole creation, 
 any besides him that can do that for their worshippers which he can and 
 will do for his? "<I>You are my witnesses.</I> I have been a nonsuch
 to you. You have tried other gods; have you found any of them 
 all-sufficient to you, or any of them like me? <I>Yea, there is no 
 god," no rock</I> (so the word is), none besides Jehovah that can be a 
 rock for a foundation to build on, a rock for shelter to flee to. God 
 is the rock, and <I>their rock is not as ours,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:4,31">Deut. xxxii. 4, 31</A>.

 <I>I know not any;</I> as if he had said, "I never met with any that
 offered to stand in competition with me, or that durst bring their 
 pretensions to a fair trial; if I did know of any that could befriend 
 you better than I can, I would recommend you to them; but I know not 
 any." There is no God besides Jehovah. He is infinite, and therefore 
 there can be no other; he is all-sufficient, and therefore there needs 
 no other. This is designed for the confirming of the hopes of God's
 people in the promise of their deliverance out of Babylon, and, in 
 order to that, for the curing of them of their idolatry; when the 
 affliction had done its work it should be removed. They are reminded of 
 the first and great article of their creed, that <I>the Lord their God 
 is one Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:4">Deut. vi. 4</A>.
 
 And therefore,

 (1.) They needed not to hope in any other god. Those on whom the sun
 shines need neither moon nor stars, nor the light of their own fire. 
 
 (2.) They needed not to fear any other god. Their own God was more able 
 to do them good than all the false and counterfeit gods of their 
 enemies were to do them hurt. 

 5. That none besides could foretel these things to come, which God now
 by his prophet gave notice of to the world, above 200 years before they 
 came to pass

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "<I>Who, as I, shall call,</I> shall call Cyrus to Babylon? Is there 
 any but God that can call effectually, and has every creature, every 
 heart, at his beck? Who <I>shall declare it,</I> how it shall be, and 
 by whom, as I do?" Nay, God goes further; he not only sees it in order, 
 as having the foreknowledge of it, but <I>sets it in order,</I> as 
 having the sole management and direction of it. Can any other pretend 
 to this? He has always set things in order according to the counsel of 
 his own will, ever <I>since he appointed the ancient people,</I> the 
 people of Israel, who could give a truer and fuller account of the 
 antiquities of their own nation than any other kingdom in the world 
 could give of theirs. Ever since he appointed that people to be his 
 peculiar people his providence was particularly conversant about them, 
 and he told them beforehand the events that should occur respecting 
 them--their bondage in Egypt, their deliverance from it, and their 
 settlement in Canaan. All was set in order in the divine predictions
 as well as in the divine purposes. Could any other have done so? Would 
 any other have been so far concerned for them? He challenges the 
 pretenders to show the things that shall come hereafter: "Let them, if 
 they can, tell us the name of the man that shall destroy Babylon ad 
 deliver Israel? Nay, if they cannot pretend to tell us <I>the things 
 that shall come</I> hereafter, let them tell us the things that <I>are 
 coming,</I> that are nigh at hand and at the door. Let them tell us
 what shall come to pass to-morrow; but they cannot do that; fear them 
 not therefore, nor be afraid of them. What harm can they do you? What 
 hindrance can they give to your deliverance, when I have told thee it 
 shall be accomplished in its season, and I have solemnly declared it?" 
 Note, Those who have the word of God's promise to depend upon need not 
 be afraid of any adverse powers or policies whatsoever.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  They that make a graven image <I>are</I> all of them vanity; and
 their delectable things shall not profit; and they <I>are</I> their

 &nbsp; 10  Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image <I>that</I> is

 according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the

 &nbsp; 14  He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the
 oak, which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the
 forest: he planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish <I>it.</I>

 thereof, and warm himself; yea, he kindleth <I>it,</I> and baketh
 bread; yea, he maketh a god, and worshippeth <I>it;</I> he maketh it a
 graven image, and falleth down thereto.
 &nbsp; 16  He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he
 eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he
 warmeth <I>himself,</I> and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the
 fire:
 &nbsp; 17  And the residue thereof he maketh a god, <I>even</I> his graven
 image: he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth <I>it,</I> and prayeth

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Often before, God, by the prophet, had mentioned the folly and strange 
 sottishness of idolaters; but here he enlarges upon that head, and very 
 fully and particularly exposes them to contempt and ridicule. This 
 discourse is intended, 

 1. To arm the people of Israel against the strong temptation they would
 be in to worship idols when they were captives in Babylon, in 
 compliance with the custom of the country (they being far from the city 
 of their own solemnities) and to humour those who were now their lords 
 and masters. 

 2. To cure them of their inclination to idolatry, which was the sin 
 that did most easily beset them and to reform them from which they were 
 sent into Babylon. As the rod of God is of use to enforce the word, so 
 the word of God is of use to explain the rod, that the voice of both 
 together may be heard and answered. 

 3. To furnish them with something to say to their Chaldean
 task-masters. When they insulted over them, when they asked, <I>Where 
 is your God?</I> they might hence ask them, <I>What are your gods?</I> 

 4. To take off their fear of the gods of their enemies, and to 
 encourage their hope in their own God that he would certainly appear 
 against those who set up such scandalous competitors as these with him 
 for the throne.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now here, for the conviction of idolaters, we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A challenge given to them to clear themselves, if they can, from the 
 imputation of the most shameful folly and senselessness imaginable, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:9-11"><I>v.</I> 9-11</A>.

 They set their wits on work to contrive, and their hands on work to 
 frame, graven images, and they call them <I>their delectable 
 things;</I> extremely fond they are of them, and mighty things they 
 expect from them. Note, Through the corruption of men's nature, those 
 things that should be detestable to them are desirable and delectable; 
 but those are far gone in a distemper to whom that which is the food 
 and fuel of it is most agreeable. Now, 

 1. We tell them that those that do so are all vanity; they deceive
 themselves and one another, and put a great cheat upon those for whom 
 they make these images. 

 2. We tell them that <I>their delectable things shall not profit</I> 
 them, nor make them any return for the pleasure they take in them; they 
 can neither supply them with good nor protect them from evil. The 
 <I>graven images</I> are <I>profitable for nothing</I> at all, nor will 
 they ever get any thing by the devoirs they pay to them. 

 3. We appeal to themselves whether it be not a silly sottish thing to
 expect any good from gods of their own making: <I>They are their own 
 witnesses,</I> witnesses against themselves, if they would but give 
 their own consciences leave to deal faithfully with them, that they are 
 blind and ignorant in doing thus. <I>They see not nor know,</I> and let 
 them own it, <I>that they may be ashamed.</I> If men would but be true 
 to their own convictions, ordinarily we might be sure of their 
 conversion, particularly idolaters; for <I>who has formed a god?</I> 
 Who but a mad-man, or one out of his wits, would think of forming a 
 god, of making that which, if he make it a god, he must suppose to be 
 his maker? 

 4. We challenge them to plead their own cause with any confidence or 
 assurance. If any one has the front to say that he has formed a god, 
 when all his fellows come together to declare what each of them has 
 done towards the making of this god, they will all be ashamed of the 
 cheat they have put upon themselves, and laugh in their sleeves at 
 those whom they have imposed upon; for <I>the workmen</I> that formed 
 this god <I>are of men,</I> weak and impotent, and therefore cannot 
 possibly make a being that shall be omnipotent, nor can they without 
 blushing pretend to do so. <I>Let them all be gathered together,</I> as 
 Demetrius and the craftsmen were, to support their sinking trade; 
 <I>let them stand up</I> to plead their own cause, and make the best 
 they can of it, with hand joined in hand; <I>yet they shall fear</I> to 
 undertake it when it comes to the setting to, as conscious to 
 themselves of the weakness and badness of their cause, <I>and they 
 shall be ashamed</I> of it, not only when they appear singly, but when 
 by appearing together they hope to keep one another in countenance. 
 Note, Idolatry and impiety are things which men may justly both tremble 
 and blush to appear in the defence of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A particular narrative of the whole proceeding in making a god; and 
 there needs no more to expose it than to describe it and tell the story 
 of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The persons employed about it are handicraft tradesmen, the meanest 
 of them, the very same that you would employ in making the common 
 utensils of your husbandry, a cart or a plough. You must have a 
 <I>smith,</I> a blacksmith, who <I>with the tongs works in the 
 coals;</I> and it is hard work, for he <I>works with the strength of 
 his arms,</I> till <I>he is hungry</I> and his strength fails, so eager 
 is he, and so hasty are those who set him at the work to get it 
 despatched. He cannot allow himself time to eat or drink, for <I>he 
 drinks no water, and</I> therefore <I>is faint,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Perhaps it was a piece of superstition among them for the workman not 
 to eat or drink while he was making a god. The plates with which the 
 smith was to cover the image, or whatever iron-work was to be done 
 about it, <I>he fashioned with hammers,</I> and made it all very exact, 
 according to the model given him. Then comes <I>the carpenter,</I> and 
 he takes as much care and pains about the timber-work, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 He brings his box of tools, for he has occasion for them all: <I>He 
 stretches out his rule</I> upon the piece of wood, <I>marks it with a 
 line,</I> where it must be sawed or cut of; <I>he fits it,</I> or 
 polishes it, <I>with planes,</I> the greater first and then the less; 
 <I>he marks out with the compasses</I> what must be the size and shape 
 of it; and it is just what he pleases.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The form in which it is made is that of a man, a poor, weak, dying 
 creature; but it is the noblest form and figure that he is acquainted 
 with, and, being his own, he has a peculiar fondness for it and is 
 willing to put all the reputation he can upon it. He makes it 
 <I>according to the beauty of a man,</I> in comely proportion, with 
 those limbs and lineaments that are the beauty of a man, but are 
 altogether unfit to represent the beauty of the Lord. God put a great 
 honour upon man when, in respect of the powers and faculties of his 
 souls, he made him after the image of God; but man does a great 
 dishonour to God when he makes him, in respect of bodily parts and 
 members, after the image of man. Nor will it at all atone for the 
 affront so far to compliment his god as to take the fairest of the 
 children of men for his original whence to take his copy, and to give 
 him all the beauty of a man that he can think of; for all the <I>beauty 
 of the body of a man,</I> when pretended to be put upon him who is an 
 infinite Spirit, is a deformity and diminution to him. And, when the 
 goodly piece is finished, it must <I>remain in the house,</I> in the 
 temple or shrine prepared for it, or perhaps in the dwelling house if 
 it be one of the <I>lares</I> or <I>penates--the household gods.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The matter of which it is mostly made is sorry stuff to make a god 
 of; it is the stock of a tree.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The tree itself was fetched out <I>of the forest,</I> where it 
 grew among other trees, of no more virtue or value than its neighbours. 
 It was a <I>cedar,</I> it may be, or a <I>cypress,</I> or an 
 <I>oak,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Perhaps he had an eye upon it some time before for this use, and 
 <I>strengthened it for himself,</I> used some art or other to make it 
 stronger and better-grown than other trees were. Or, as some read it, 
 <I>which hath strengthened or lifted up itself among the trees of the 
 forest,</I> the tallest and strongest he can pick out. Or, it may be,
 it pleases his fancy better to take <I>an ash,</I> which is of a 
 quicker growth, and which was of his own planting for this use, and 
 which has been nourished with rain from heaven. See what a fallacy he 
 puts upon himself, in making that his refuge which was of his own 
 planting, and which he not only gave the form to, but prepared the 
 matter for; and what an affront he puts upon the God of heaven in 
 setting up that a rival with him which was nourished by his rain, that 
 rain which falls upon the just and unjust.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The boughs of this tree were good for nothing but for fuel; to 
 that use were they put, and so were the chips that were cut off from it 
 in the working of it; they are <I>for a man to burn,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 To show that that tree has no innate virtue in it for its own 
 protection, it is as capable of being burnt as any other tree; and, to 
 show that he who chose it had no more antecedent value for it than for 
 any other tree, he makes no difficulty of throwing part of it into the 
 fire as common rubbish, asking no question for conscience' sake. 

 [1.] It serves him for his parlour-fire: <I>He will take thereof and 
 warm himself</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 and he finds the comfort of it, and is so far from having any regret in 
 his mind for it that he saith, <I>Aha! I am warm; I have seen the 
 fire;</I> and certainly that part of the tree which served him for 
 fuel, the use for which God and nature designed it, does him a much 
 greater kindness and yields him more satisfaction than ever that will 
 which he makes a god of. 

 [2.] It serves him for his kitchen-fire: <I>He eats flesh</I> with it, 
 that is, he dresses the flesh with it which he is to eat; he 
 <I>roasteth roast, and is satisfied</I> that he has not done amiss to 
 put it to this use. Nay,

 [3.] It serves him to heat the oven with, in which we use that fuel
 which is of least value: <I>He kindles it and bakes bread</I> with the 
 heat of it, and none charges him with doing wrong.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Yet, after all, the stock or body of the tree shall serve to make 
 a god of, when it might as well have served to make a bench, as one of 
 themselves, even a poet of their own, upbraids them, <I>Horat. Sat.</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When the besotted idolater has thus served the meanest purposes with
 part of his tree, and the rest has had time to season (he makes that a
 god in his imagination while that is in the doing, <I>and worships
 it</I>): He <I>makes it a graven image, and falls down thereto</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 that is

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 <I>The residue thereof he makes a god, even his graven image,</I>
 according to his fancy and intention; he <I>falls down to it, and
 worships it,</I> gives divine honours to it, prostrates himself before 
 it in the most humble reverent posture, as a servant, as a suppliant; 
 <I>he prays to it,</I> as having a dependence upon it, and great 
 expectations from it; <I>he saith, Deliver me, for thou art my god.</I>
 There where he pays his homage and allegiance he justly looks for
 protection and deliverance. What a strange infatuation is this, to
 expect help from gods that cannot help themselves! But it is this
 praying to them that makes them gods, not what the smith or the
 carpenter did to them. What we place our confidence in for deliverance
 that we make a god of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is judgment given upon this whole matter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:18-20"><I>v.</I> 18-20</A>.

 In short, it is the effect and evidence of the greatest stupidity and 
 sottishness that one could ever imagine rational beings to be guilty 
 of, and shows that man has become worse than the beasts that perish; 
 for they act according to the dictates of sense, but man acts not 
 according to the dictates of reason

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>They have not known nor understood</I> common sense; men that act 
 rationally in other things in this act most absurdly. Though they have
 some knowledge and understanding, yet they are strangers to, nay, they 
 are rebels against the great law of consideration 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>None considers in his heart,</I> nor has so much application of mind 
 as to reason thus with himself, which one would think he might easily 
 do, though there were none to reason with him: "<I>I have burnt part of 
 this tree in the fire,</I> for baking and roasting; <I>and</I> now 
 <I>shall I make the residue thereof an abomination?</I>" (that is, 
 <I>an idol,</I> for that is an abomination to God and all wise and good 
 men); "shall I ungratefully choose to do, or presumptuously dare to do, 
 what the Lord hates? shall I be such a fool as to fall down to the 
 stock of a tree--a senseless, lifeless, helpless thing? shall I so far 
 disparage myself, and make myself like that I bow down to?" A growing 
 tree may be a beautiful stately thing, but the stock of a tree has lost 
 its glory, and he has lost his that gives glory to it. Upon the whole, 
 the sad character given of these idolaters is, 

 1. That they put a cheat upon themselves

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>They feed on ashes;</I> they feed themselves with hopes of advantage 
 by worshipping these idols, but they will be disappointed as much as a 
 man that would expect nourishment by feeding on ashes. Feeding on ashes 
 is an evidence of a depraved appetite and a distempered body; and it is 
 a sign that the soul is overpowered by very bad habits when men, in 
 their worship, go no further than the sight of their eyes will carry 
 them. They are wretchedly deluded, and it is their own fault: <I>A
 deceived heart</I> of their own, more than the deceiving tongue of 
 others, <I>has turned them aside</I> from the faith and worship of the 
 living God to dumb idols. They are <I>drawn away of their own lusts and 
 enticed.</I> The apostasy of sinners from God is owing entirely to 
 themselves and to the evil heart of unbelief that is in their own 
 bosom. A revolting and rebellious heart is a deceived heart. 

 2. That they wilfully persist in their self-delusion and will not be 
 undeceived. There is none of them that can be persuaded so far to 
 suspect himself as to say, <I>Is there not a lie in my right hand?</I> 
 and so to think of delivering his soul. Note,

 (1.) Idolaters have a lie in their right hand; for an idol is a lie, is 
 not what it pretends, performs not what it promises, and it is a 
 <I>teacher of lies,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:18">Hab. ii. 18</A>.

 (2.) It highly concerns those that are secure in an evil way seriously
 to consider whether there be not a lie in their right hand. Is not
 that a lie which with complacency we hold fast as our chief good? Are 
 our hearts set upon the wealth of the world and the pleasures of sense? 
 They will certainly prove a lie in our right hand. And is not that a 
 lie which with confidence we hold fast by, as the ground on which we 
 build our hopes for heaven? If we trust to our external professions and 
 performances, as if those would save us, we deceive ourselves with a 
 lie in our right hand, with a house built on the sand.

 (3.) Self-suspicion is the first step towards self-deliverance. We 
 cannot be faithful to ourselves unless we are jealous of ourselves. He 
 that would deliver his soul must begin with putting this question to 
 his own conscience. <I>Is there not a lie in my right hand?</I> 

 (4.) Those that are given up to believe in a lie are under the power of 
 strong delusions, which it is hard to get clear of,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou <I>art</I> my
 servant: I have formed thee; thou <I>art</I> my servant: O Israel,
 thou shalt not be forgotten of me.
 &nbsp; 22  I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions,
 and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed
 thee.
 &nbsp; 23  Sing, O ye heavens; for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath done <I>it:</I> shout, ye
 lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains,
 O forest, and every tree therein: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath redeemed
 Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.
 &nbsp; 24  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee
 from the womb, I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> that maketh all <I>things;</I> that
 stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the
 earth by myself;
 &nbsp; 25  That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh
 diviners mad; that turneth wise <I>men</I> backward, and maketh their
 knowledge foolish;
 &nbsp; 26  That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the
 counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be
 inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and I
 will raise up the decayed places thereof:
 &nbsp; 27  That saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy
 rivers:
 &nbsp; 28  That saith of Cyrus, <I>He is</I> my shepherd, and shall perform
 all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built;
 and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The duty which Jacob and Israel, now in captivity, were called to, 
 that they might be qualified and prepared for the deliverance designed 
 them. Our first care must be to get good by our afflictions, and then 
 we may hope to get out of them. The duty is expressed in two words: 
 <I>Remember</I> and <I>return,</I> as in the counsel to Ephesus, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:4,5">Rev. ii. 4, 5</A>.

 1. "<I>Remember these, O Jacob!</I> Remember what thou hast been told
 of the folly of idolatry, and let the convictions thou art now under be 
 ready to thee whenever thou art tempted to that sin. Remember that
 <I>thou art my servant,</I> and therefore must not serve other 
 masters."

 2. <I>Return unto me,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 It is the great concern of those who have backslidden from God to 
 hasten their return to him; and this is that which he calls them to 
 when they are in affliction, and when he is returning to them in a way 
 of mercy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The favours which Jacob and Israel, now in captivity, were assured 
 of; and what is here promised to them upon their remembering and 
 returning to God is in a spiritual sense promised to all that in like 
 manner return to God. It is a very comfortable word, for more is 
 implied in it than is expressed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 "<I>O Israel! thou shalt not be forgotten of me,</I> though for the 
 present thou seemest to be so." When we begin to remember God he will 
 begin to remember us; nay, it is he that remembers us first. Now 
 observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The grounds upon which God's favourable intentions to his people 
 were built and on which they might build their expectations from him. 
 He will deliver them out of captivity; for, 

 (1.) They are his servants, and therefore he has a just quarrel with 
 those that detain them. <I>Let my people go, that they may serve 
 me.</I> The servants of the King of kings are under special protection.

 (2.) He formed them into a people, formed them <I>from the womb,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 From the first beginning of their increase into a nation they were 
 under his particular care and government, more than any other people; 
 their national constitution was of his framing, and his covenant with 
 them was the charter by which they were incorporated. They are his,
 and he will save them.

 (3.) He has redeemed them formerly, has many a time redeemed them out 
 of great distress, and he is still the same, in the same relation to 
 them, has the same concern for them. "Therefore <I>return unto me, for 
 I have redeemed thee,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Whither wilt thou go, but to me?" Having redeemed them, as well as 
 formed them, he has acquired a further title to them and propriety in 
 them, which is a good reason why they should dutifully return to him 
 and why he will graciously return to them. The <I>Lord has redeemed 
 Jacob;</I> he is about to do it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>);

 he has determined to do it; for he is the Lord their Redeemer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.
 
 Note, The work of redemption which God has by his Son wrought for us 
 encourages us to hope for all promised blessings from him. He that has 
 redeemed us at so vast an expense will not lose his purchase. 

 (4.) He has <I>glorified himself in them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 and therefore will do so still, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:28">John xii. 28</A>.

 It is matter of comfort to us to see God's glory interested in the
 deliverances of the church; for <I>therefore</I> he will certainly 
 redeem Jacob, because thus he will glorify himself. And <I>this</I> 
 assures us that he will perfect the redemption of his saints by Jesus 
 Christ, because there is a day set when he will be glorified and 
 admired in them all.

 (5.) He has pardoned their sins, which were the cause of their calamity 
 and the only obstruction to their deliverance,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 <I>Therefore</I> he will break the yoke of captivity from off their 
 necks, because he has <I>blotted out, as a thick cloud, their 
 transgressions.</I> Note, 

 [1.] Our transgressions and our sins are as a cloud, a thick cloud; 
 they interpose between heaven and earth, and for a time suspend and 
 intercept the correspondence between the upper and lower world (sin 
 <I>separates between us and God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:2"><I>ch.</I> lix. 2</A>);

 they threaten a storm, a deluge of wrath, as thick clouds do, which God
 will rain upon sinners.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+11:6">Ps. xi. 6</A>.

 [2.] When God pardons sin he blots out this cloud, this thick cloud, so
 that the intercourse with heaven is laid open again. God looks down 
 upon the soul with favour; the soul looks up to him with pleasure. The 
 cloud is scattered by the influence of the Sun of righteousness. It is 
 only through Christ that sin is pardoned. When sin is pardoned, like a 
 cloud that is scattered, it appears no more, it is quite gone. The 
 <I>iniquity of Jacob shall be sought for, and not found,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:20">Jer. l. 20</A>.

 And the comforts that flow into the soul when sin is pardoned are like
 the <I>clear shining after clouds and rain.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The universal joy which the deliverance of God's people should bring 
 along with it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>Sing, O you heavens!</I> This intimates, 

 (1.) That the whole creation shall have cause for joy and rejoicing in 
 the redemption of God's people; to that it is owing that it subsists 
 (that it is rescued from the curse which the sin of man brought upon 
 the ground) and that it is again put into a capacity of answering the 
 ends of its being, and is assured that though now it groans, being 
 burdened, it shall at last be delivered from the bondage of corruption. 
 The greatest establishment of the world is the kingdom of God in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+96:11-13,98:7-9">Ps. xcvi. 11-13; xcviii. 7-9</A>.

 (2.) That the angels shall rejoice in it, and the inhabitants of the
 upper world. The heavens shall sing, for the Lord has done it. And 
 there is joy in heaven when God and man are reconciled 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:7">Luke xv. 7</A>),

 joy when Babylon falls, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:20">Rev. xviii. 20</A>.

 (3.) That those who lay at the greatest distance, even the inhabitants 
 of the Gentile world, should join in these praises, as sharing in these 
 joys. The <I>lower parts of the earth,</I> the forest and the trees
 there, shall bring in the tribute of thanksgiving for the redemption of 
 Israel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The encouragement we have to hope that though great difficulties, 
 and such as have been thought insuperable, lie in the way of the 
 church's deliverance, yet, when the time for it shall come, they shall 
 all be got over with ease; for <I>thus saith Israel's Redeemer, I am 
 the Lord that maketh all things,</I> did make them at first and am 
 still making them; for providence is a continued creation. All being, 
 power, life, emotion, and perfection, are from God. He <I>stretches 
 forth the heavens alone,</I> has no help nor needs any; and the earth 
 too he <I>spreads abroad by himself,</I> and by his own power. Man was 
 not by him when he did it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:4">Job xxxviii. 4</A>),

 nor did any creature advise or assist; only his own eternal wisdom and
 Word was by him then as <I>one brought up with him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:30">Prov. viii. 30</A>.

 His stretching out the heavens by himself denotes the boundless extent
 of his power. The strongest man, if he has to stretch a thing out, must 
 get somebody or other to lend a hand; but God stretched out the vast 
 expanse and keeps it still upon the stretch, himself, by his own power.
 Let not Israel be discouraged then; nothing is too hard for him to do 
 that made the world,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+124:8">Ps. cxxiv. 8</A>.

 And, having made all things, he can make what use he pleases of all,
 and has it in his power to serve his own purposes by them.</P>

 4. The confusion which this would put upon the oracles of Babylon, by 
 the confutation it would give them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 God, by delivering his people out of Babylon, would <I>frustrate the 
 tokens of the liars,</I> of all the lying prophets, that said the 
 Babylonian monarchy had many ages yet to live, and pretended to ground 
 their predictions upon some token, some sign or other, which, according 
 to the rules of their arts, foreboded its prosperity. How mad will 
 these conjurors grow with vexation when they see that their skill fails 
 them, and that the contrary happens to that which they so coveted and 
 were so confident of. Nor would it only baffle their pretended 
 prophets, but their celebrated politicians too: He <I>turns the wise 
 men backward.</I> Finding they cannot go on with their projects, they 
 are forced to quit them; and so he makes the judges fools, <I>and makes 
 their knowledge foolish.</I> Those that are made acquainted with Christ 
 see all the knowledge they had before to be foolishness in comparison 
 with the knowledge of him. And those that are adversaries to him will 
 find all their counsels, like Ahitophel's, turned into foolishness, and 
 themselves <I>taken in their own craftiness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:19">1 Cor. iii. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The confirmation which this would give to the oracles of God, which 
 the Jews had distrusted and their enemies despised: God <I>confirms the 
 word of his servant</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>);

 he confirms it by accomplishing it in its season; and <I>performs the 
 counsel of the messengers</I> whom he hath many a time sent to his 
 people, to tell them what great blessings he had in store for them. 
 Note, The exact fulfilling of the prophecies of scripture is a 
 confirmation of the truth of the whole book and an incontestable 
 evidence of its divine origin and authority.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. The particular favours God designed for his people, that were now in 
 captivity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:26-28"><I>v.</I> 26-28</A>.

 These were foretold long before they went into captivity, that they 
 might see reason to expect a correction, but no reason to fear a final 
 destruction. 

 (1.) It is here supposed that Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, 
 should for a time lie in ruins, dispeopled and uninhabited; but it is 
 promised that they shall be rebuilt and repeopled. When Isaiah lived, 
 Jerusalem and the cities of Judah were full of inhabitants; but they 
 will be emptied, burnt, and destroyed. It was then hard to believe that 
 concerning such strong and populous cities. But the justice of God will 
 do that; and, when that is done, it will be hard to believe that ever 
 they will recover themselves again, and yet the zeal of the Lord of 
 hosts will do that to. God has said to Jerusalem, <I>Thou shalt be 
 inhabited;</I> for, while the world stands, God will have a church in 
 it, and therefore he will raise up those who <I>shall say to Jerusalem, 
 Thou shalt be built;</I> for, if it be not built, it cannot be 
 inhabited, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:35,36">Ps. lxix. 35, 36</A>.

 When God's time shall have come for the building up of his church, let
 him alone to find both houses for his people (for they shall not lie 
 exposed) and people for his houses, for they shall not stand empty. The 
 cities of Judah too shall again be built. The Assyrian army under 
 Sennacherib only took them, and then, upon the defeat of that army, 
 they returned undamaged to the right owners; but the Chaldean army 
 demolished them, and by carrying away the inhabitants left them to go 
 to decay of themselves; for, if less judgments prevail not to humble 
 and reform men, God will send greater. Yet these desolations shall not
 be perpetual. God will <I>raise up the</I> wastes and <I>decayed places 
 thereof;</I> for he will not contend for ever. The city of strangers, 
 when it is ruined, shall never be built

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:2"><I>ch.</I> xxv. 2</A>),

 but the city of God's own children is but discontinued for a time. 

 (2.) It is here supposed that the temple too should be destroyed, and
 lie for a time rased to the foundations; but it is promised that the 
 foundation of it shall again be laid, and no doubt built upon. As the 
 desolation of the sanctuary was to all the pious Jews the most mournful 
 part of the destruction, so the restoration and re-establishment of it 
 would be the most joyful part of the deliverance. What joy can they 
 have in the rebuilding of Jerusalem if the temple there be not rebuilt?
 for it is that which makes it a holy city and truly beautiful. This 
 therefore was the chief thing that the Jews had at heart and had in 
 view in their return; therefore they would go back to Jerusalem, to 
 <I>build the house of the Lord God of Israel there,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:3">Ezra i. 3</A>.

 (3.) It is here supposed that very great difficulties would lie in the 
 way of this deliverance, which it would be impossible for them to wade 
 through; but it is promised that by a divine power they shall all be 
 removed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>God saith to the deep, Be dry;</I> so he did when he brought Israel 
 out of Egypt, and so he will again when he brings them out of Babylon, 
 if there be occasion. <I>Who art thou, O great mountain?</I> Dost thou 
 stand in the way? Before Zerubbabel, the commander-in-chief of the 
 returning captives, <I>thou shalt become a plain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:7">Zech. iv. 7</A>.

 So, <I>Who art thou, O great deep?</I> Dost thou retard their passage
 and think to block it up? Thou shalt be dry, and thy rivers that supply 
 thee shall be dried up. When Cyrus took Babylon by draining the river 
 Euphrates into many channels, and so making it passable for his army, 
 this was fulfilled. Note, Whatever obstructions lie in the way of 
 Israel's redemption, God can remove them with a word's speaking.

 (4.) It is here supposed that none of the Jews themselves would be able 
 by might and power to force their way out of Babylon but it is promised 
 that God will raise up a stranger from afar off, that shall fairly open 
 the way for them, and now at length he names the very man, many scores 
 of years before he was born or thought of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 <I>That saith of Cyrus, He is my shepherd.</I> Israel is his people, 
 and the sheep of his pasture. These sheep are now in the midst of 
 wolves, in the hands of the thief and robber; they are impounded for 
 trespass. Now Cyrus shall be his shepherd, employed by him to release 
 these sheep, and to take care of their return to their own green 
 pasture again. "In this <I>he shall perform all my pleasure,</I> shall 
 bring about what is purposed by me and will be highly pleasing to me." 
 Note, 

 [1.] The most contingent things are certain to the divine prescience. 
 He knew who was the person, and what was his name, that should be the 
 deliverer of his people, and, when he pleased, he could let his church 
 know it, that, when they heard of such a name beginning to be talked of 
 in the world, they might <I>lift up their heads with joy, knowing that 
 their redemption drew nigh.</I>

 [2.] It is the greatest honour of the greatest men to be employed for 
 God as instruments of his favour to his people. It was more the praise 
 of Cyrus to be God's shepherd than to be emperor of Persia.

 [3.] God makes what use he pleases of men, of mighty men, of those that 
 act with the greatest freedom; and, when they think to do as they 
 please, he can overrule them, and make them do as he pleases. Nay, in 
 those very things wherein they are serving themselves, and look no 
 further than that, God is serving his own purposes by them and making 
 them to perform all his pleasure. Rich princes shall do what poor
 prophets have foretold.</P>
