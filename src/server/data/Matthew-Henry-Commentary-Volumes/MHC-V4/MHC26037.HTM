 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The threatenings of the destruction of Judah and Jerusalem for their 
 sins, which we had in the former part of this book, were not so 
 terrible, but the promises of their restoration and deliverance for the 
 glory of God, which we have here in the latter part of the book, are as 
 comfortable; and as those were illustrated with many visions and 
 similitudes, for the awakening of a holy fear, so are these, for the 
 encouraging of a humble faith. God had assured them, in the foregoing 
 chapter, that he would gather the house of Israel, even all of it, and 
 would bring them out of their captivity, and return them to their own 
 land; but there were two things that rendered this very unlikely:--

 I. That they were so dispersed among their enemies, so destitute of
 all helps and advantages which might favour or further their return, 
 and so dispirited likewise in their own minds; upon all these accounts 
 they are here, in vision, compared to a valley full of the dry bones of 
 dead men, which should be brought together and raised to life. The 
 vision of this we have 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:1-10">ver. 1-10</A>)

 and the explication of it, with its application to the present case,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:11-14">ver. 11-14</A>.

 II. That they were so divided among themselves, too much of the old
 enmity between Judah and Ephraim remaining even in their captivity.
 But, as to this, by a sign of two sticks made one in the hand of the
 prophet is foreshown the happy coalition that should be, at their
 return, between the two nations of Israel and Judah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:15-22">ver. 15-22</A>.

 In this there was a type of the uniting of Jews and Gentiles, Jews and
 Samaritans, in Christ and his church. And so the prophet slides into a 
 prediction of the kingdom of Christ, which should be set up in the 
 world with God's tabernacle in it, and of the glories and graces of 
 that kingdom,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The hand of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was upon me, and carried me out in the
 spirit of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and set me down in the midst of the valley
 which <I>was</I> full of bones,
 &nbsp; 2  And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold,
 <I>there were</I> very many in the open valley; and, lo, <I>they were</I>
 very dry.
 &nbsp; 3  And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I
 answered, O Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, thou knowest.
 &nbsp; 4  Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say
 unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 5  Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> unto these bones; Behold, I will
 cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live:
 &nbsp; 6  And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon
 you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall
 live; and ye shall know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 7  So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied,
 there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came
 together, bone to his bone.
 &nbsp; 8  And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon
 them, and the skin covered them above: but <I>there was</I> no breath
 in them.
 &nbsp; 9  Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son
 of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Come from
 the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they
 may live.
 &nbsp; 10  So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into
 them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding
 great army.
 &nbsp; 11  Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole
 house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our
 hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.
 &nbsp; 12  Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord
 G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you
 to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of
 Israel.
 &nbsp; 13  And ye shall know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, when I have opened
 your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves,
 &nbsp; 14  And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I
 shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> have spoken <I>it,</I> and performed <I>it,</I> saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.

 Here is, 

 I. The vision of a resurrection from death to life, and it is a 
 glorious resurrection. This is a thing so utterly unknown to nature, 
 and so contrary to its principles (<I>a privatione ad habitum non datur 
 regressus--from privation to possession there is no return</I>), that 
 we could have no thought of it but <I>by the word of the Lord;</I> and 
 that it is certain by that word that there shall be a general 
 resurrection of the dead some have urged from this vision, "For" (say 
 they) "otherwise it would not properly be made a sign for the 
 confirming of their faith in the promise of their deliverance out of 
 Babylon, as the coming of the Messiah is mentioned for the confirming 
 of their faith touching a former deliverance," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:14">Isa. vii. 14</A>.
 
 But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Whether it be a confirmation or no, it is without doubt a most 
 lively representation of a threefold resurrection, besides that which 
 it is primarily intended to be the sign of. 

 (1.) The resurrection of souls from the death of sin to the life or 
 righteousness, to a holy, heavenly, spiritual, and divine life, by the 
 power of divine grace going along with the word of Christ, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:24,25">John v. 24, 25</A>.

 (2.) The resurrection of the gospel church, or any part of it, from an 
 afflicted persecuted state, especially under the yoke of the 
 New-Testament Babylon, to liberty and peace. 

 (3.) The resurrection of the body at the great day, especially the 
 bodies of believers that shall rise to life eternal.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Let us observe the particulars of this vision.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The deplorable condition of these dead bones. The prophet was 
 made, 

 [1.] to take an exact view of them. By a prophetic impulse and a divine 
 power he was, in vision, carried out and set <I>in the midst of a 
 valley,</I> probably that plain spoken of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:22"><I>ch.</I> iii. 22</A>,

 where God then <I>talked with him;</I> and it was <I>full of bones,</I>
 of dead men's bones, not piled up on a heap, as in a charnel-house, but 
 scattered upon the face of the ground, as if some bloody battle had 
 been fought here, and the slain left unburied till all the flesh was 
 devoured or putrefied, and nothing left but the bones, and those 
 disjointed from one another and dispersed. He <I>passed by them round 
 about,</I> and he observed not only that they were very many (for there 
 are multitudes gone to the congregation of the dead), but that, <I>lo, 
 they were very dry,</I> having been long exposed to the sun and wind. 
 The bones that have been <I>moistened with marrow</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:24">Job xxi. 24</A>),

 when they have been any while dead, lose all their moisture, and are
 dry as dust. The body is now fenced with bones

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+10:11">Job x. 11</A>),

 but then they will themselves be defenceless. The Jews in Babylon were
 like those dead and dry bones, unlikely ever to come together, to be so 
 much as a skeleton, less likely to be formed into a body, and least of 
 all to be a living body. However, they lay <I>unburied</I> in the
 <I>open valley,</I> which encouraged the hopes of their resurrection, 
 as of the two witnesses,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:8,9">Rev. xi. 8, 9</A>.
 
 The bones of Gog and Magog shall be buried

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:12,15"><I>ch.</I> xxxix. 12, 15</A>),

 for their destruction is final; but the bones of Israel are in the
 <I>open valley,</I> under the eye of Heaven, for there is <I>hope in 
 their end.</I> 

 [2.] He was made to own their case deplorable, and not to be helped by 
 any power less than that of God himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "Son of man, <I>can these bones live?</I> Is it a thing likely? Cast 
 thou devise how it should be done? Can thy philosophy reach to put life 
 into dry bones, or thy politics to restore a captive nation?" "No," 
 says the prophet, "I know not how it should be done, but <I>thou 
 knowest.</I>" He does not say, "They cannot live," lest he should seem 
 to limit the Holy One of Israel; but, "Lord, thou knowest whether they 
 can and whether they shall; if thou dost not put life into them, it is 
 certain that they cannot life." Note, God is perfectly acquainted with 
 his own power and his own purposes, and will have us to refer all to 
 them, and to see and own that his wondrous works are such as could not 
 be effected by any counsel or power but his own.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The means used for the bringing of these dispersed bones together 
 and these dead and dry bones to life. It must be done by prophecy. 
 Ezekiel is ordered to <I>prophesy upon these bones</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:4,9"><I>v.</I> 4 and again <I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 to <I>prophesy to the wind.</I> So he <I>prophesied as he was 
 commanded,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:7,10"><I>v.</I> 7, 10</A>.

 [1.] He must preach, and he did so; and the dead bones lived by a power 
 that went along with the word of God which he preached. 

 [2.] He must pray, and he did so; and the dead bones were made to live 
 in answer to prayer; for <I>a spirit of life</I> entered into them. See 
 the efficacy of the word and prayer, and the necessity of both, for the 
 raising of dead souls. God bids his ministers <I>prophesy upon the dry 
 bones.</I> Say unto them, <I>Live;</I> yea, say unto them, <I>Live;</I> 
 and they do as they are commanded, calling to them again and again, 
 <I>O you dry bones! hear the word of the Lord.</I> But we call in vain, 
 still they are dead, still they are very dry; we must therefore be 
 earnest with God in prayer for the working of the Spirit with the word: 
 <I>Come, O breath!</I> and breathe upon them. God's grace can save
 souls without our preaching, but our preaching cannot save them without 
 God's grace, and that grace must be sought by prayer. Note, Ministers 
 must faithfully and diligently use the means of grace, even with those 
 that there seems little probability of gaining upon. To prophesy upon 
 dry bones seems as great a penance as to water a dry stick; and yet, 
 whether they will hear or forbear, we must discharge our trust, must 
 <I>prophesy as we are commanded,</I> in the name of him who raises the 
 dead and is the fountain of life.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The wonderful effect of these means. Those that do as they are 
 commanded, as they are commissioned, in the face of the greatest 
 discouragements, need not doubt of success, for God will own and enrich 
 his own appointments. 

 [1.] Ezekiel looked down and prophesied upon the bones in the valley, 
 and they became human bodies. <I>First,</I> That which he had to <I>say 
 to them</I> was that God would infallibly raise them to life: <I>Thus 
 saith the Lord God unto these bones, You shall live,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5 and again <I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 And he that speaks the word will thereby do the work; he that says, 
 They <I>shall live,</I> will make them alive: He will <I>clothe them 
 with skin and flesh</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),
 
 as he did at first, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+10:11">Job x. 11</A>.

 He that made us so fearfully and wonderfully, and curiously wrought us, 
 can in like manner new-make us, for <I>his arm is not shortened. 
 Secondly,</I> That which was immediately done for them was that they 
 were moulded anew into shape. We may well suppose it was with great 
 liveliness and vigour that the prophet prophesied, especially when he 
 found what he said begin to take effect. Note, The opening, sealing, 
 and applying of the promises, are the ordinary means of our 
 participation of a new and divine nature. As Ezekiel prophesied in this 
 vision <I>there was a noise,</I> a word of command, from heaven, 
 seconding what he said; or it signified the motion of the angels that 
 were to be employed as the ministers of the divine Providence in the 
 deliverance of the Jews, and we read of the <I>noise of their wings</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:24">Ezek. i. 24</A>)
 
 and the <I>sound of their going,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:24">2 Sam. v. 24</A>.

 <I>And, behold, a shaking,</I> or commotion, among the bones. Even
 dead and dry bones begin to move when they are called to hear the word 
 of the Lord. This was fulfilled when, upon Cyrus's proclamation of 
 liberty, those whose spirits God had stirred up began to think of 
 making use of that liberty, and getting ready to be gone. When <I>there 
 was a noise, behold, a shaking;</I> when David heard <I>the sound of 
 the going on the tops of the mulberry-trees</I> then he <I>bestirred 
 himself;</I> then there was <I>a shaking.</I> When Paul heard the voice 
 saying, <I>Why persecutest thou me?</I> behold, a shaking of the dry 
 bones; he <I>trembled</I> and was <I>astonished.</I> But this was not 
 all: <I>The bones came together bone to his bone,</I> under a divine 
 direction; and, though there is in man a multitude of bones, yet of all 
 the bones of those numerous slain not one was missing, not one missed 
 its way, not one missed its place, but, as it were by instinct, each 
 knew and found its fellow. The dispersed bones came together and the 
 displaced bones were knit together, the divine power supplying that to 
 these dry bones which in a living body <I>every joint supplies.</I> 
 Thus shall it be in the resurrection of the dead; the scattered atoms 
 shall be ranged and marshalled in their proper place and order, and 
 <I>every bone come to his bone,</I> by the same wisdom and power by 
 which the bones were first <I>formed in the womb of her that is with 
 child.</I> Thus it was in the return of the Jews; those that were 
 scattered in several parts of the province of Babylon came to their 
 respective families, and all as it were by consent to the general 
 rendezvous, in order to their return. By degrees <I>sinews</I> and 
 <I>flesh</I> came upon these bones, and the <I>skin covered them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 This was fulfilled when the captives got their effects about them, and 
 the <I>men of their place helped them</I> with <I>silver,</I> and 
 <I>gold,</I> and whatever they needed for their remove, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:4">Ezra i. 4</A>.

 But still there was <I>no breath in them;</I> they wanted spirit and
 courage for such a difficult and hazardous enterprise as this was of 
 returning to their own land.

 [2.] Ezekiel then looked up and prophesied to the <I>wind,</I> or 
 <I>breath,</I> or <I>spirit,</I> and said, <I>Come, O breath! and 
 breathe upon these slain.</I> As good have been still dry bones as dead 
 bodies: but as for God <I>his work is perfect;</I> he is not the God of 
 the dead, but of the living; therefore <I>breathe upon them that they 
 may live.</I> In answer to this request, <I>the breath</I> immediately 
 came <I>into them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Note, the spirit of life is from God; he at first in the creation 
 breathed into man the breath of life, and so he will at last in the 
 resurrection. The dispirited despairing captives were wonderfully 
 animated with resolution to break through all the discouragements that 
 lay in the way of their return and applied themselves to it with all 
 imaginable vigour. And then they <I>stood upon their feet, an 
 exceedingly great army;</I> not only living men, but effective men, fit 
 for service in the wars and formidable to all that gave them any 
 opposition. Note, With God nothing is impossible. He can <I>out of 
 stones raise up children unto Abraham</I> and out of dead and dry bones 
 levy an exceedingly great army to fight his battles and plead his 
 cause.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The application of this vision to the present calamitous condition 
 of the Jews in captivity: <I>These bones are the whole house of 
 Israel,</I> both the ten tribes and the two. See in this what they are 
 and what they shall be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The depth of despair to which they are now reduced, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 They all give up themselves for lost and gone; they say, "<I>Our bones 
 are dried,</I> our strength is exhausted, our spirits are gone, <I>our 
 hope is</I> all <I>lost;</I> every thing we looked for succour and 
 relief from fails us, and <I>we are cut off for our parts.</I> Let who 
 will cherish some hope, we see no ground for any." Note, When troubles 
 continue long, hopes have been often frustrated, and all 
 creature-confidences fail, it is not strange if the spirits sink; and 
 nothing but an active faith in the power, promise, and providence of 
 God will keep them from quite dying away. 

 2. The height of prosperity to which, notwithstanding this, they shall 
 be advanced: "<I>therefore,</I> because things have come thus to the 
 last extremity, <I>prophesy to them,</I> and tell them, now is God's 
 time to appear for them. <I>Jehovah-jireh--in the mount of the Lord it 
 shall be seen,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:12-14"><I>v.</I> 12-14</A>.
 
 Tell them," 

 (1.) "That they shall be brought out of the land of their enemies,
 where they are as it were buried alive: <I>I will open your 
 graves.</I>" Those shall be restored, not only whose <I>bones</I> are 
 <I>scattered at the grave's mouth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:7">Ps. cxli. 7</A>),

 but who are buried in the grave; though the power of the enemy is like
 the <I>bars of the pit,</I> which one would think it impossible to 
 break through, strong as death and cruel as the grave, yet it shall be 
 conquered. God can <I>bring</I> his people <I>up from the depths of the 
 earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:20">Ps. lxxi. 20</A>.

 (2.) "That they shall be brought into their own land, where they shall 
 live in prosperity: <I>I will bring you into the land of Israel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>)

 and <I>place you there</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 and will <I>put my spirit in you</I> and then <I>you shall live.</I>" 
 Note, <I>Then</I> God puts spirit in us to good purpose, and so that we 
 shall indeed live, when he puts his Spirit in us. And (<I>lastly</I>) 
 in all this God will be glorified: <I>You shall know that I am the 
 Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),
 
 and that I have <I>spoken it and performed it,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Note, God's quickening the dead redounds more than any thing to his 
 honour, and to the honour of his word, which he has magnified above all 
 his name, and will magnify more and more by the punctual accomplishment 
 of every tittle of it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  The word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came again unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 16  Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write
 upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his
 companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For
 Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and <I>for</I> all the house of Israel
 his companions:
 &nbsp; 17  And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall
 become one in thine hand.
 &nbsp; 18  And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee,
 saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou <I>meanest</I> by these?
 &nbsp; 19  Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Behold, I will take
 the stick of Joseph, which <I>is</I> in the hand of Ephraim, and the
 tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, <I>even</I>
 with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall
 be one in mine hand.
 &nbsp; 20  And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand
 before their eyes.
 &nbsp; 21  And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Behold, I will
 take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they
 be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into
 their own land:
 &nbsp; 22  And I will make them one nation in the land upon the
 mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and
 they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided
 into two kingdoms any more at all:
 &nbsp; 23  Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their
 idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their
 transgressions: but I will save them out of all their
 dwelling-places, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them:
 so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.
 &nbsp; 24  And David my servant <I>shall be</I> king over them; and they all
 shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments,
 and observe my statutes, and do them.
 &nbsp; 25  And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto
 Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall
 dwell therein, <I>even</I> they, and their children, and their
 children's children for ever: and my servant David <I>shall be</I>
 their prince for ever.
 &nbsp; 26  Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall
 be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and
 multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for
 evermore.
 &nbsp; 27  My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their
 God, and they shall be my people.
 &nbsp; 28  And the heathen shall know that I the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> do sanctify
 Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for
 evermore.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here are more exceedingly great and precious promises made of the happy 
 state of the Jews after their return to their own land; but they have a 
 further reference to the kingdom of the Messiah and the glories of 
 gospel-times.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It is here promised that Ephraim and Judah shall be happily united 
 in brotherly love and mutual serviceableness; so that whereas, ever 
 since the desertion of the ten tribes from the house of David under 
 Jeroboam, there had been continual feuds and animosities between the 
 two kingdoms of Israel and Judah, and it is to be feared there had been 
 some clashings between them even in the land of their captivity 
 (Ephraim upon all occasions envying Judah and Judah vexing Ephraim), 
 now it should be no longer, but there should be a coalition between 
 them, and, notwithstanding the old differences that had been between 
 them, they should agree to love one another and to do one another all 
 good offices. This is here illustrated by a sign. The prophet was to 
 take <I>two sticks,</I> and write upon one, <I>For Judah</I> (including 
 Benjamin, those of the <I>children of Israel</I> that were <I>his 
 companions</I>), upon the other, <I>For Joseph,</I> including the rest 
 of the tribes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 These two sticks must be so framed as to fall into <I>one in his 
 hand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 The people took notice of this, and desired him to <I>tell them the 
 meaning of it,</I> for they knew he did not play with sticks for his 
 diversion, as children do. Those that would know the meaning should ask 
 the meaning of the word of God which they read and hear, and of the 
 instituted signs by which spiritual and divine things are represented 
 to us; the ministers' <I>lips</I> should <I>keep the knowledge</I> 
 hereof and the people should <I>ask it at their mouth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:7">Mal. ii. 7</A>.

 It is a necessary question for grown people, as well as children, to
 ask, <I>What mean you by this service,</I> by this sign?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:26">Exod. xii. 26</A>.

 The meaning was that Judah and Israel should become <I>one in the hand
 of God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 1. They shall be one, one nation,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 They shall have no separate interests, and, consequently, no divided 
 affections. There shall be no mutual jealousies and animosities, no
 remembrance, no remains, of their former discord. But there shall be a 
 perfect harmony between them, a good understanding one of another, a 
 good disposition one to another, and a readiness to all good offices 
 and services for one another's credit and comfort. They had been two 
 sticks crossing and thwarting one another, nay, beating and bruising 
 one another; but now they shall become one, supporting and 
 strengthening one another. <I>Vix unita fortior--Force added to force 
 is proportionally more efficient. Behold, how good and how pleasant a
 thing it is</I> to see Judah and Israel, that had long been at 
 variance, now <I>dwelling together in unity.</I> Then they shall become 
 acceptable to their God, amiable to their friends, and formidable to 
 their enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:13,14">Isa. xi. 13, 14</A>.

 2. They shall be one in <I>God's hand;</I> by his power they shall be 
 united, and, being by his hand brought together, his hand shall keep 
 them together, so that they shall not fly off, to be separated again. 
 They shall be one in his hand, for his glory shall be the centre of 
 their unity and his grace the cement of it. In him, in a regard to him
 and in his service and worship, they shall unite, and so shall become 
 one. Both sides shall agree to put themselves into his hand, and so
 they shall be one. <I>Qui conveniunt in aliquo tertio inter se 
 conveniunt--Those who agree in a third agree with each other.</I> Note, 
 Those are best united that are one in God's hand, whose union with each 
 other results from their union with Christ and their communion with God 
 through him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:10">Eph. i. 10</A>.
 
 <I>One in us,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:21">John xvii. 21</A>.

 3. They shall be one in their return out of captivity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>I will take them from among the heathen,</I> and <I>gather them on 
 every side,</I> and <I>bring them</I> together incorporated into one 
 body <I>to their own land.</I> They shall be one in their separation 
 from the heathen with whom they had mingled themselves: they shall both 
 agree to part from them, and take their affections off from them, and 
 no longer to comply with their usages, and then they will soon agree to 
 join together in walking according to the rule of God's word. Their 
 having been joint-sufferers will contribute to this blessed 
 comprehension, when they begin to come to themselves and to consider 
 things. Put many pieces of metal together into the furnace, and, when 
 they are melted, they will run all together. It was time for them to 
 strengthen one another when their oppressors were so busy to weaken and 
 ruin them all. Likewise their being joint-sharers in the favour of
 God, and the great and common deliverance wrought out for them all, 
 should help to unite them. God's loving them all was a good reason why 
 they should love one another. Times of common joy, as well as times of
 common suffering, should be healing loving times. 

 4. They shall all be the subjects of one king, and so they shall become 
 one. The Jews, after their return, were under one government, and not 
 divided as formerly. But this certainly looks further, to the kingdom
 of Christ; he is that one King in allegiance to whom all God's 
 spiritual Israel shall cheerfully unite, and under whose protection 
 they shall all be gathered. All believers unite in <I>one Lord, one 
 faith,</I> and <I>one baptism.</I> And the uniting of Jews and Gentiles 
 in the gospel church, their becoming one fold under Christ the one 
 great Shepherd, is doubtless the union that is chiefly looked at in 
 this prophecy. By Christ and partition-wall between them was taken 
 down, and the enmity slain, and of them <I>twain</I> was made <I>one 
 new man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:14,15">Eph. ii. 14, 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It is here promised that the Jews shall by their captivity be cured 
 of their inclination to idolatry; this shall be the happy fruit of that 
 affliction, even the taking away of their sin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols,</I> 
 those detestable defiling things, no, nor <I>with any of their</I> 
 former <I>transgressions.</I> Note, When one sin is sincerely parted 
 with all sin is abandoned too, for he that hates sin, as sin, will hate 
 all sin. And those that are cured of their spiritual idolatry, their
 inordinate affection to the world and the flesh, that no longer make a 
 god of their money or their belly, have a happy blow given to the root 
 of all their transgressions. Two ways God will take to cure them of 
 their idolatry:--

 1. By bringing them out of the way of temptation to it: "<I>I will save
 them out of all their dwelling-places wherein they have sinned,</I> 
 because there they met with the occasion of sin and allurements to it." 
 Note, It is our wisdom to avoid the places where we have been overcome 
 by temptations to sin, not to remain in them, or return to them, but to 
 <I>save ourselves</I> out of them, as we would out of infected places; 
 see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:7,Re+18:4">Zech. ii. 7; Rev. xviii. 4</A>.

 And it is a great mercy when God, in his providence, <I>saves us out of 
 the dwelling-places where we have sinned,</I> and keeps us from harm by 
 keeping us out of harm's way, in answer to our prayer, <I>Lead us not 
 into temptation, but deliver us from evil.</I> 

 2. By changing the disposition of their mind: "<I>I will cleanse 
 them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>);

 that is, I will sanctify them, will work in them an aversion to the 
 pollutions of sin and a complacency in the pleasures of holiness, and 
 then you may be sure they will not defile themselves any more with 
 their idols." Those whom God has cleansed he will keep clean.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. It is here promised that they shall be the people of God, as 
 <I>their God,</I> and the subjects and sheep of Christ their King and 
 Shepherd. These promises we had before, and they are here repeated 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>)

 for the encouragement of the faith of Israel: <I>They shall be my 
 people,</I> to serve me, and <I>I will be their God,</I> to save them 
 and to make them happy. <I>David, my servant, shall be king over 
 them,</I> to fight their battles, to protect them from injury, and to 
 rule them, and overrule all things that concern them for their good.
 He shall be <I>their shepherd,</I> to guide them and provide for them.
 Christ is this David, Israel's King of old; and those whom he subdues 
 to himself, and makes willing in the day of his power, he makes to 
 <I>walk in his judgments and to keep his statutes.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. It is here promised that they shall dwell comfortably, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>.
 
 They shall dwell in the land of Israel; for where else should 
 Israelites dwell? And many things will concur to make their dwelling 
 agreeable. 

 1. They shall have it by covenant; they shall come in again upon their
 old title, by virtue of the grant made unto <I>Jacob,</I> God's 
 <I>servant.</I> As Christ was David, God's servant, so the church is 
 Jacob, his servant too; and the members of the church shall come in for 
 a share, as born in God's house. He will make a <I>covenant of 
 peace</I> with them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 and in pursuance of that covenant he will <I>place them, and multiply 
 them.</I> Note, Temporal mercies are doubly sweet when they come from 
 the promise of the covenant, and not merely from common providence. 

 2. They shall come to it by prescription: "It is <I>the land wherein
 your fathers have dwelt,</I> and for that reason you cannot but have a 
 special kindness for it, which God will graciously gratify." It was the 
 inheritance of their ancestors, and therefore shall be theirs. They are 
 <I>beloved for their fathers' sakes.</I> 

 3. They shall have it entailed upon them and the heirs of their body,
 and shall have their families built up, so that it shall not be lost 
 for want of heirs. <I>They shall dwell therein</I> all their time, and
 never be turned out of possession, and they shall leave it for an 
 inheritance <I>to their children and their children's children for 
 ever,</I> who shall enjoy it when they are gone, the prospect of which 
 will be a satisfaction to them. 

 4. They shall live under a good government, which will contribute very 
 much to the comfort of their lives: <I>My servant David shall be their 
 prince for ever.</I> This can be no other than Christ, of whom it was 
 said, when he was brought into the world, <I>He shall reign over the 
 house of Jacob for ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:33">Luke i. 33</A>.

 Note, It is the unspeakable comfort of all Christ's faithful subjects
 that, as his <I>kingdom</I> is <I>everlasting,</I> so he is an 
 <I>everlasting King,</I> he lives to reign for ever; and, as sure and 
 as long as he lives and reigns, they shall live and reign also.

 5. The charter by which they hold all their privileges is indefeasible.
 God's covenant with them shall be an <I>everlasting covenant;</I> so 
 the covenant of grace is, for it secures to us an everlasting 
 happiness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. It is here promised that God will dwell among them; and this will 
 make them dwell comfortably indeed: <I>I will set my sanctuary in the 
 midst of them for evermore; my tabernacle also shall be with them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>.

 1. They shall have the tokens of God's special presence with them and 
 his gracious residence among them. God will <I>in very deed dwell with 
 them upon the earth,</I> for where his sanctuary is he is; when they 
 profaned his sanctuary he took it from them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:11">Isa. lxiv. 11</A>),

 but now that they are purified God will dwell with them again.

 2. They shall have opportunity of conversing with God, of hearing from 
 him, speaking to him, and so keeping up communion with him, which will 
 be the comfort of their lives. 

 3. They shall have the means of grace. By the oracles of God in his
 tabernacle they shall be made wiser and better, and all their children 
 shall be taught of the Lord. 

 4. Thus their covenant relation to God shall be improved and the bond 
 of it strengthened: "<I>I will be their God and they shall be my 
 people,</I> and they shall know it by having my sanctuary among them, 
 and shall have the comfort of it."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Both God and Israel shall have the honour of this among the 
 heathen, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 "Now the heathen observe how Israel have profaned their own crown by 
 their sins, and God has profaned it by his judgments; but then, when 
 Israel is reformed and God has returned in mercy to them, the very 
 heathen shall be made to know that <I>the Lord sanctifies</I> Israel, 
 has a title to them and an interest in them more than other people, 
 because his sanctuary is, and shall be, in the midst of them." Note, 
 God designs the sanctification of those among whom he sets up his 
 sanctuary. And blessed and holy are those who, enjoying the privileges 
 of the sanctuary, give such proofs and evidences of their 
 sanctification that the heathen may know it is no less than the 
 almighty grace of God that sanctifies them. Such have God's sanctuary 
 in the midst of them, the kingdom of God within them, in the principles 
 of the spiritual life, and shall have it so for evermore in the 
 enjoyments of an eternal life.</P>
