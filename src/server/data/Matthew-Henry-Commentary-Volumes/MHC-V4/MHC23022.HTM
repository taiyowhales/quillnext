 We have now come nearer home, for this chapter is "the burden of the 
 valley of vision," Jerusalem; other places had their burden for the 
 sake of their being concerned in some way or other with Jerusalem, and 
 were reckoned with either as spiteful enemies or deceitful friends to 
 the people of God; but now let Jerusalem hear her own doom. This 
 chapter concerns, 

 I. The city of Jerusalem itself and the neighbourhood depending upon
 it. Here is, 

 1. A prophecy of the grievous distress they should shortly be brought
 into by Sennacherib's invasion of the country and laying siege to the
 city, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 2. A reproof given them for their misconduct in that distress, in two
 things:--

 (1.) Not having an eye to God in the use of the means of their
 preservation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:8-11">ver. 8-11</A>.

 (2.) Not humbling themselves under his mighty hand, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:12-14">ver. 12-14</A>.

 II. The court of Hezekiah, and the officers of that court. 

 1. The displacing of Shebna, a bad man, and turning him out of the 
 treasury, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:15-19,25">ver. 15-19, 25</A>.

 2. The preferring of Eliakim, who should do his country better service, 
 to his place, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:20-24">ver. 20-24</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The burden of the valley of vision. What aileth thee now,
 that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops?
 &nbsp; 2  Thou that art full of stirs, a tumultuous city, a joyous
 city: thy slain <I>men are</I> not slain with the sword, nor dead in
 battle.
 &nbsp; 3  All thy rulers are fled together, they are bound by the
 archers: all that are found in thee are bound together, <I>which</I>
 have fled from far.
 &nbsp; 4  Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly,
 labour not to comfort me, because of the spoiling of the daughter
 of my people.
 &nbsp; 5  For <I>it is</I> a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of
 perplexity by the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> of hosts in the valley of vision,
 breaking down the walls, and of crying to the mountains.
 &nbsp; 6  And Elam bare the quiver with chariots of men <I>and</I> horsemen,
 and Kir uncovered the shield.
 &nbsp; 7  And it shall come to pass, <I>that</I> thy choicest valleys shall
 be full of chariots, and the horsemen shall set themselves in
 array at the gate.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The title of this prophecy is very observable. It is <I>the burden of 
 the valley of vision,</I> of Judah and Jerusalem; so all agree. Fitly 
 enough is Jerusalem called a valley, for the mountains were round about 
 it, and the land of Judah abounded with fruitful valleys; and by the 
 judgments of God, though they had been as a towering mountain, they 
 should be brought low, sunk and depressed, and become dark and dirty, 
 as a valley. But most emphatically is it called a <I>valley of 
 vision</I> because there God was known and his name was great, there 
 the prophets were made acquainted with his mind by visions, and there 
 the people saw the goings of their God and King in his sanctuary. 
 Babylon, being a stranger to God, though rich and great, was called 
 <I>the desert of the sea;</I> but Jerusalem, being entrusted with his 
 oracles, is <I>a valley of vision. Blessed are their eyes, for they 
 see,</I> and they have seers by office among them. Where Bibles and 
 ministers are there is a valley of vision, from which is expected fruit 
 accordingly; but here is a <I>burden of the valley of vision,</I> and a 
 heavy burden it is. Note, Church privileges, if they be not improved, 
 will not secure men from the judgments of God. <I>You only have I known 
 of all the families of the earth; therefore will I punish you.</I> The 
 valley of vision has a particular burden. <I>Thou Capernaum,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:23">Matt. xi. 23</A>.

 The higher any are lifted up in means and mercies the heavier will
 their doom be if they abuse them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now the <I>burden of the valley of vision</I> here is that which will 
 not quite ruin it, but only frighten it; for it refers not to the 
 destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, but to the attempt made 
 upon it by Sennacherib, which we had the prophecy of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:1-34"><I>ch.</I> x.</A>,

 and shall meet with the history of,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+36:1-22"><I>ch.</I> xxxvi.</A>.

 It is here again prophesied of, because the desolations of many of the
 neighbouring countries, which were foretold in the foregoing chapters, 
 were to be brought to pass by the Assyrian army. Now let Jerusalem know 
 that when the cup is going round it will be put into her hand; and, 
 although it will not be to her a fatal cup, yet it will be a cup of 
 trembling. Here is foretold,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The consternation that the city should be in upon the approach of 
 Sennacherib's army. It used to be full of stirs, a city of great trade, 
 people hurrying to and fro about their business, a tumultuous city, 
 populous and noisy. Where there is great trade there is great tumult. 
 It used to be a joyous revelling city. What with the busy part and what 
 with the merry part of mankind, places of concourse are places of 
 noise. "But what ails thee now, that the shops are quitted, and there 
 is no more walking in the streets and exchange, <I>but thou hast wholly 
 gone up to the house-tops</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 to bemoan thyself in silence and solitude, or to secure thyself from 
 the enemy, or to look abroad and see if any succours come to thy 
 relief, or which way the enemies' motions are." Let both men of 
 business and sportsmen <I>rejoice as though they rejoiced not,</I> for 
 something may happen quickly, which they little think of, that will be 
 a damp to their mirth and a stop to their business, and send them to 
 <I>watch as a sparrow alone upon the house-top,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:7">Ps. cii. 7</A>.

 But why is Jerusalem in such a fright? <I>Her slain men are not slain
 with the sword</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),
 
 but, 

 1. Slain with famine (so some); for Sennacherib's army having laid the 
 country waste, and destroyed the fruits of the earth, provisions must 
 needs be very scarce and dear in the city, which would be the death of 
 many of the poorer sort of people, who would be constrained to feed on 
 that which was unwholesome.

 2. Slain with fear. They were put into this fright though they had not 
 a man killed, but so disheartened themselves that they seemed as 
 effectually stabbed with fear as if they had been run through with a 
 sword.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The inglorious flight of the rulers of Judah, who fled from far, 
 from all parts of the country, to Jerusalem 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 fled together, as it were by consent, and were found in Jerusalem, 
 having left their respective cities, which they should have taken care 
 of, to be a prey to the Assyrian army, which, meeting with no 
 opposition, when it <I>came up against all the defenced cities of 
 Judah</I> easily <I>took them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+36:1"><I>ch.</I> xxxvi. 1</A>.

 These rulers <I>were bound from the bow</I> (so the word is); they not
 only quitted their own cities like cowards, but, when they came to 
 Jerusalem, were of no service there, but were as if their hands were 
 tied from the use of the bow, by the extreme distraction and confusion 
 they were in; they trembled, so that they could not draw a bow. See how 
 easily God can dispirit men, and how certainly fear will dispirit them, 
 when the tyranny of it is yielded to.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The great grief which this should occasion to all serious sensible 
 people among them, which is represented by the prophet's laying the 
 thing to heart himself; he lived to see it, and was resolved to share 
 with the children of his people in their sorrows, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 He is not willing to proclaim his sorrow, and therefore bids those
 about him to look away from him; he will abandon himself to grief, and 
 indulge himself in it, will weep secretly, but weep bitterly, and will 
 have none go about to comfort him, for his grief is obstinate and he is 
 pleased with his pain. But what is the occasion of his grief? A poor 
 prophet had little to lose, and had been inured to hardship, when he 
 walked naked and barefoot; but it is for <I>the spoiling of the 
 daughter of his people.</I> It is <I>a day of trouble, and of treading 
 down, and of perplexity.</I> Our enemies trouble us and tread us down, 
 and our friends are perplexed and know not what course to take to do us 
 a kindness. The Lord God of hosts is now contending with the valley of 
 vision; the enemies with their battering rams are breaking down the 
 walls, and we are in vain crying to the mountains (to keep off the 
 enemy, or to fall on us and cover us) or looking for help to come to us 
 over the mountains, or appealing, as God does, to the mountains, to 
 hear our controversy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:1">Mic. vi. 1</A>)

 and to judge between us and our injurious neighbours.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The great numbers and strength of the enemy, that should invade 
 their country and besiege their city, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 Elam (that is, the Persians) come with their quiver full of arrows, and
 with chariots of fighting men, and horsemen. Kir (that is, the Medes) 
 muster up their arms, unsheath the sword, and uncover the shield, and 
 get every thing ready for battle, every thing ready for the besieging 
 of Jerusalem. Then the choice valleys about Jerusalem, that used to be
 clothed with flocks and covered over with corn, shall be full of 
 chariots of war, and at the gate of the city <I>the horsemen shall set 
 themselves in array,</I> to cut off all provisions from going in, and 
 to force their way in. What a condition must the city be in that was 
 beset on all sides with such an army!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  And he discovered the covering of Judah, and thou didst look
 in that day to the armour of the house of the forest.
 &nbsp; 9  Ye have seen also the breaches of the city of David, that
 they are many: and ye gathered together the waters of the lower
 pool.
 &nbsp; 10  And ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses
 have ye broken down to fortify the wall.
 &nbsp; 11  Ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of
 the old pool: but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof,
 neither had respect unto him that fashioned it long ago.
 &nbsp; 12  And in that day did the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> of hosts call to weeping,
 and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth:
 &nbsp; 13  And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing
 sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine: let us eat and drink; for
 to morrow we shall die.
 &nbsp; 14  And it was revealed in mine ears by the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts,
 Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die,
 saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> of hosts.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 What is meant by <I>the covering of Judah,</I> which in the beginning 
 of this paragraph is said to be <I>discovered,</I> is not agreed. The 
 fenced cities of Judah were a covering to the country; but these, being 
 taken by the army of the Assyrians, ceased to be a shelter, so that the 
 whole country lay exposed to be plundered. The weakness of Judah, its 
 nakedness, and inability to keep itself, now appeared more than ever; 
 and thus the covering of Judah was discovered. Its magazines and 
 stores, which had been locked up, were now laid open for the public 
 use. Dr. Lightfoot gives another sense of it, that by this distress 
 into which Judah should be brought God would discover their covering 
 (that is, uncloak their hypocrisy), would show all that was in their 
 heart, as is said of Hezekiah upon another occasion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:31">2 Chron. xxxii. 31</A>.
 
 Thus, by one means or other, <I>the iniquity of Ephraim will be
 discovered and the sin of Samaria,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:1">Hos. vii. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 They were now in a great fright, and in this fright they manifested two 
 things much amiss:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A great contempt of God's goodness, and his power to help them. They 
 made use of all the means they could think of for their own 
 preservation; and it is not for doing this that they are blamed, but, 
 in doing this, they did not acknowledge God. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How careful they were to improve all advantages that might 
 contribute to their safety. When Sennacherib had made himself master of 
 all the defenced cities of Judah, and Jerusalem was left as a cottage 
 in a vineyard, they thought it was time to look about them. A council 
 was immediately called, a council of war; and it was resolved to stand 
 upon their defence, and not tamely to surrender. Pursuant to this 
 resolve, they took all the prudent measures they could for their own 
 security. We tempt God if, in times of danger, we do not the best we 
 can for ourselves. 

 (1.) They inspected the magazines and stores, to see if they were well
 stocked with arms and ammunition: <I>They looked to the armour of the 
 house of the forest,</I> which Solomon built in Jerusalem for an 
 armoury

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:17">1 Kings x. 17</A>),

 and thence they delivered out what they had occasion for. It is the
 wisdom of princes, in time of peace, to provide for war, that they may 
 not have arms to seek when they should use them, and perhaps upon a 
 sudden emergency.

 (2.) They viewed the fortifications, the <I>breaches of the city of 
 David;</I> they walked round the walls, and observed where they had 
 gone to decay for want of seasonable repairs, or were broken by some 
 former attempts made upon them. These breaches were many; the more 
 shame for the house of David that they suffered the city of David to 
 lie neglected. They had probably often seen those breaches; but now 
 they saw them to consider what course to take about them. This good we 
 should get by public distresses, we should be awakened by them to 
 <I>repair our breaches,</I> and amend what is amiss.

 (3.) They made sure of water for the city, and did what they could to 
 deprive the besiegers of it: <I>You gathered together the water of the 
 lower pool,</I> of which there was probably no great store, and of 
 which therefore they were the more concerned to be good husbands. See 
 what a mercy it is that, as nothing is more necessary to the support of 
 human life than water, so nothing is more cheap and common; but it is 
 bad indeed when that, as here, is a scarce commodity.

 (4.) They <I>numbered the houses of Jerusalem,</I> that every house 
 might send in its quota of men for the public service, or contribute in 
 money to it, which they raised by a poll, so much a head or so much a 
 house.

 (5.) Because private property ought to give way to the public safety, 
 those houses that stood in their way, when the wall was to be 
 fortified, were broken down, which, in such a case of necessity, is no 
 more an injury to the owner than blowing up houses in case of fire.

 (6.) They made a ditch between the outer and inner wall, for the 
 greater security of the city; and they contrived to draw the water of 
 the old pool to it, that they might have plenty of water themselves and 
 might deprive the besiegers of it; for it seems that was the project, 
 lest the Assyrian army <I>should come and find much water</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:4">2 Chron. xxxii. 4</A>)

 and so should be the better able to prolong the siege. If it be lawful
 to destroy the forage of a country, much more to divert the streams of 
 its waters, for the straitening and starving of an enemy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How regardless they were of God in all these preparations: <I>But 
 you have not looked unto the Maker thereof</I> (that is, of Jerusalem, 
 the city you are so solicitous for the defence of) and of all the 
 advantages which nature has furnished it with for its defence--the
 <I>mountains round about it</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+125:2">Ps. cxxv. 2</A>),

 and the rivers, which were such as the inhabitants might turn which way
 soever they pleased for their convenience. Note,

 (1.) It is God that made his Jerusalem, and fashioned it long ago, in
 his counsels. The Jewish writers, upon this place, say, There were 
 seven things which God made before the world (meaning which he had in 
 his eye when he made the world): <I>the garden of Eden, the law, the 
 just ones, Israel, the throne of glory, Jerusalem, and Messiah the 
 Prince.</I> The gospel church has God for its Maker.

 (2.) Whatever service we do, or endeavour to do, at any time to God's
 Jerusalem, must be done with an eye to him as the Maker of it; and he 
 takes it ill if it be done otherwise. It is here charged upon them that 
 they did not look to God. 

 [1.] They did not design his glory in what they did. They fortified 
 Jerusalem because it was a rich city and their own houses were in it, 
 not because it was the holy city and God's house was in it. In all our
 cares for the defence of the church we must look more at God's interest 
 in it than at our own. 

 [2.] They did not depend upon him for a blessing upon their endeavours,
 saw no need of it, and therefore sought not to him for it, but thought 
 their own powers and policies sufficient for them. Of Hezekiah himself 
 it is said that <I>he trusted in God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:5">2 Kings xviii. 5</A>),

 and particularly upon this occasion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:8">2 Chron. xxxii. 8</A>);

 but there were those about him, it seems, who were great statesmen and
 soldiers, but had little religion in them.

 [3.] They did not give him thanks for the advantages they had, in
 fortifying their city, from <I>the waters of the old pool,</I> which 
 were fashioned long ago, as Kishon is called <I>an ancient river,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:21">Judg. v. 21</A>.

 Whatever in nature is at any time serviceable to us, we must therein 
 acknowledge the goodness of the God of nature, who, when he fashioned 
 it long ago, fitted it to be so, and <I>according to whose ordinance it 
 continues to this day.</I> Every creature is that to us which God makes 
 it to be; and therefore, whatever use it is of to us, we must <I>look 
 at him that fashioned it,</I> bless him for it, and use it for him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A great contempt of God's wrath and justice in contending with 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:12-14"><I>v.</I> 12-14</A>.
 
 Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What was God's design in bringing this calamity upon them: it was to 
 humble them, bring them to repentance, and make them serious. In that 
 day of trouble, and treading down, and perplexity, the Lord did thereby 
 <I>call to weeping and mourning,</I> and all the expressions of sorrow, 
 even <I>to baldness and girding with sackcloth;</I> and all this to 
 lament their sins (by which they had brought those judgments upon their 
 land), to enforce their prayers (by which they might hope to avert the 
 judgments that were breaking in), and to dispose themselves to a 
 reformation of their lives by a holy seriousness and a tenderness of 
 heart under the word of God. To this God called them by his prophet's 
 explaining his providences, and by his providences awakening them to 
 regard what his prophets said. Note, When God threatens us with his 
 judgments he expects and requires that we humble ourselves under his 
 mighty hand, that we tremble when the lion roars, and in a day of 
 adversity consider.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How contrary they walked to this design of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Behold, joy and gladness,</I> mirth and feasting, all the gaiety and 
 all the jollity imaginable. They were as secure and cheerful as they 
 used to be, as if they had had no enemy in their borders or were in no 
 danger of falling into his hands. When they had taken the necessary 
 precautions for their security, then they set all deaths and dangers at 
 defiance, and resolved to be merry, let come on them what would. Those 
 that should have been among the mourners were among the 
 <I>wine-bibbers, the riotous eaters of flesh;</I> and observe what they 
 said, <I>Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we shall die.</I> This may 
 refer either to the particular danger they were now in, and the fair 
 warning which the prophet gave them of it, or to the general shortness 
 and uncertainty of human life, and the nearness of death at all times.
 This was the language of the profane scoffers who <I>mocked the 
 messengers of the Lord and misused his prophets.</I> 

 (1.) They made a jest of dying. "The prophet tells us we must die
 shortly, perhaps to-morrow, and therefore we should mourn and repent 
 to-day; no, rather <I>let us eat and drink,</I> that we may be fattened 
 for the slaughter, and may be in good heart to meet our doom; if we 
 must have a short life, let it be a merry one."

 (2.) They ridiculed the doctrine of a future state on the other side
 death; for, if there were no such state, the apostle grants there would 
 be something of reason in what they said, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:32">1 Cor. xv. 32</A>.

 If, when we die, there were an end of us, it were good to make
 ourselves as easy and merry as we could while we live; but, if <I>for 
 all these things God shall bring us into judgment,</I> it is at our 
 peril if we walk <I>in the way of our heart and the sight of our 
 eyes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+11:9">Eccl. xi. 9</A>.

 Note, A practical disbelief of another life after this is at the bottom
 of the carnal security and brutish sensuality which are the sin, and 
 shame, and ruin of so great a part of mankind, as of the old world, who 
 were <I>eating and drinking till the flood came.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. How much God was displeased at it. He signified his resentment of it 
 to the prophet, <I>revealed it in his ears,</I> to be by him proclaimed 
 upon the house-top: <I>Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from 
 you till you die,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 It shall never be expiated with sacrifice and offering, any more than
 the iniquity of the house of Eli, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:14">1 Sam. iii. 14</A>.

 It is a sin against the remedy, a baffling of the utmost means of
 conviction and rendering them ineffectual; and therefore it is not 
 likely they should ever repent of it or have it pardoned. The Chaldee

 death.</I> Those that walk contrary to them; with the froward he will 
 show himself froward.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> of hosts, Go, get thee unto this
 treasurer, <I>even</I> unto Shebna, which <I>is</I> over the house, <I>and
 say,</I>
 &nbsp; 16  What hast thou here? and whom hast thou here, that thou hast
 hewed thee out a sepulchre here, <I>as</I> he that heweth him out a
 sepulchre on high, <I>and</I> that graveth a habitation for himself
 in a rock?
 &nbsp; 17  Behold, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will carry thee away with a mighty
 captivity, and will surely cover thee.
 &nbsp; 18  He will surely violently turn and toss thee <I>like</I> a ball
 into a large country: there shalt thou die, and there the
 chariots of thy glory <I>shall be</I> the shame of thy lord's house.
 &nbsp; 19  And I will drive thee from thy station, and from thy state
 shall he pull thee down.
 &nbsp; 20  And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my
 servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah:
 &nbsp; 21  And I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with
 thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand: and
 he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the
 house of Judah.
 &nbsp; 22  And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his
 shoulder; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall
 shut, and none shall open.
 &nbsp; 23  And I will fasten him <I>as</I> a nail in a sure place; and he
 shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house.
 &nbsp; 24  And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's
 house, the offspring and the issue, all vessels of small
 quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of
 flagons.
 &nbsp; 25  In that day, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, shall the nail that is
 fastened in the sure place be removed, and be cut down, and fall;
 and the burden that <I>was</I> upon it shall be cut off: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 hath spoken <I>it.</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a prophecy concerning the displacing of Shebna, a great 
 officer at court, and the preferring of Eliakim to the post of honour 
 and trust that he was in. Such changes are common in the courts of 
 princes; it is therefore strange that so much notice should be taken of 
 it by the prophet here; but by the accomplishment of what was foretold 
 concerning these particular persons God designed to confirm his word in 
 the mouth of Isaiah concerning other and greater events; and it is 
 likewise to show that, as God has burdens in store for those nations 
 and kingdoms abroad that are open enemies to his church and people, so 
 he has for those particular persons at home that are false friends to 
 them and betray them. It is likewise a confirmation in general of the 
 hand of divine Providence in all events of this kind, which to us seem 
 contingent and to depend upon the wills and fancies of princes. 
 <I>Promotion comes not from the east, nor from the west, nor from the 
 south; but God is the Judge,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+25:6,7">Ps. xxv. 6, 7</A>.

 It is probable that this prophecy was delivered at the same time with
 that in the former part of the chapter, and began to be fulfilled 
 before Sennacherib's invasion; for now Shebna was <I>over the 
 house,</I> but then Eliakim was

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+36:3"><I>ch.</I> xxxvi. 3</A>);

 and Shebna, coming down gradually, was only scribe. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The prophecy of Shebna's disgrace. He is called <I>this 
 treasurer,</I> being entrusted with the management of the revenue; and 
 he is likewise said to be <I>over the house,</I> for such was his 
 boundless ambition and covetousness that less than two places, and 
 those two of the greatest importance at court, would not satisfy him. 
 It is common for self-seeking men thus to grasp at more than they can 
 manage, and so the business of their places is neglected, while the 
 pomp and profit of them wholly engage the mind. It does not appear what 
 were the particular instances of Shebna's mal-administration, for which 
 Isaiah is here sent to prophesy against him; but the Jews say, "He kept 
 up a traitorous correspondence with the king of Assyria, and was in 
 treaty with him to deliver the city into his hands." However this was, 
 it should seem that he was a foreigner (for we never read of the name 
 of his father) and that he was an enemy to the true interests of Judah 
 and Jerusalem: it is probable that he was first preferred by Ahaz. 
 Hezekiah was himself an excellent prince; but the best masters cannot 
 always be sure of good servants. We have need to pray for princes, that 
 they may be wise and happy in the choice of those they trust. These 
 were times of reformation, yet Shebna, a bad man, complied so far as to 
 keep his places at court; and it is probable that many others did like 
 him, for which reason Sennacherib is said to have been <I>sent against 
 a hypocritical nation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:6"><I>ch.</I> x. 6</A>.

 In this message to Shebna we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A reproof of his pride, vanity, and security 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 "<I>What hast thou here, and whom hast thou here?</I> What a mighty 
 noise and bustle dost thou make! What estate has thou here, that thou 
 was born to? <I>Whom hast thou here,</I> what relations, that thou art
 allied to? Art thou not of mean and obscure original, <I>filius
 populi--a mere plebeian,</I> that comest we know not whence? What is 
 the meaning of this then, that thou hast built thyself a fine house, 
 <I>hast graved thyself a habitation?</I>" So very nice and curious was 
 it that it seemed rather to be the work of an engraver than of a mason 
 or carpenter; and it seemed engraven in a rock, so firmly was it 
 founded and so impregnable was it. "Nay, <I>thou hast hewed thee out a 
 sepulchre,</I>" as if he designed that his pomp should survive his 
 funeral. Though Jerusalem was not <I>the place of his father's 
 sepulchres</I> (as Nehemiah called it with a great deal of tenderness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:3">Neh. ii. 3</A>),

 he designed it should be the place of his own, and therefore set up a
 monument for himself in his life-time, set it up on high. Those that
 make stately monuments for their pride forget that, how beautiful 
 soever they appear outwardly, within <I>they are full of dead men's 
 bones.</I> But it is a pity that the grave-stone should forget the 
 grave.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. A prophecy of his fall and the sullying of his glory. 

 (1.) That he should not quickly be displaced and degraded

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>I will drive thee from thy station.</I> High places are slippery 
 places; and those are justly deprived of their honour that are proud of 
 it and puffed up with it, and deprived of their power that do hurt with 
 it. God will do it, who shows himself to be God by <I>looking upon 
 proud men and abasing them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:11,12">Job xl. 11, 12</A>.
 
 To this
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>

 refers. "The nail that is <I>now fastened in the sure place</I> (that
 is, Shebna, who thinks himself immovably fixed in his office) <I>shall 
 be removed, and cut down, and fall.</I>" Those are mistaken who think 
 any place in this world a sure place, or themselves as nails fastened 
 in it; for there is nothing here but uncertainty. When the nail falls 
 the burden that was upon it is cut off; when Shebna was disgraced all 
 that had a dependence upon him fell into contempt too. Those that are 
 in high places will have many hanging upon them as favourites whom they 
 are proud of and trust to; but they are burdens upon them, and perhaps 
 with their weight break the nail, and both fall together, and by 
 deceiving ruin one another--the common fate of great men and their 
 flatterers, who expect more from each other than either performs. 

 (2.) That after a while he should not only be driven from his station,
 but driven from his country: <I>The Lord will carry thee away with the 
 captivity of a mighty man,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.

 Some think the Assyrians seized him, and took him away, because he had
 promised to assist them and did not, but appeared against them: or 
 perhaps Hezekiah, finding out his treachery, banished him, and forbade 
 him ever to return; or he himself, finding that he had become obnoxious 
 to the people, withdrew into some other country, and there spent the 
 rest of his days in meanness and obscurity. Grotius thinks he was 
 stricken with a leprosy, which was a disease commonly supposed to come 
 from the immediate hand of God's displeasure, particularly for the 
 punishment of the proud, as in the case of Miriam and Uzziah; and by 
 reason of this disease he was <I>tossed like a ball</I> out of 
 Jerusalem. Those who, when they are in power, turn and toss others, 
 will be justly turned and tossed themselves when their day shall come 
 to fall. Many who have thought themselves fastened like a nail may come 
 to be tossed like a ball; for here have we <I>no continuing city.</I> 
 Shebna thought his place too strait for him, he had no room to thrive; 
 God will therefore send him <I>into a large country,</I> where he shall 
 have room to wander, but never find the way back again; for <I>there he 
 shall die,</I> and lay his bones there, and not in the sepulchre he had 
 hewn out for himself. And <I>there the chariots</I> which had been the
 chariots of his glory, in which he had rattled about the streets of 
 Jerusalem, and which he took into banishment with him, should but serve 
 to upbraid him with his former grandeur, <I>to the shame of his lord's 
 house,</I> of the court of Ahaz, who had advanced him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The prophecy of Eliakim's advancement, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>,

 &c. He is God's servant, has approved himself faithfully so in other
 employments, and therefore God will call him to this high station. 
 Those that are diligent in doing the duty of a low sphere stand fairest 
 for preferment in God's books. Eliakim does not undermine Shebna, nor 
 make an interest against him, nor does he intrude into his office; but 
 God calls him to it: and what God calls us to we may expect he will own 
 us in. It is here foretold, 

 1. That Eliakim should be put into Shebna's place of lord-chamberlain
 of the household, lord-treasurer, and prime-minister of state. The 
 prophet must tell Shebna this,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 
 "He shall have <I>thy robe,</I> the badge of honour, and <I>thy
 girdle,</I> the badge of power; for he shall have <I>thy 
 government.</I>" To hear of it would be a great mortification to 
 Shebna, much more to see it. Great men, especially if proud men, cannot 
 endure their successors. God undertakes the doing of it, not only 
 because he would put it into the heart of Hezekiah to do it, and his 
 hand must be acknowledged guiding the hearts of princes in placing and 
 displacing men 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+21:1">Prov. xxi. 1</A>),

 but because the powers that are, subordinate as well as supreme, are
 ordained of God. It is God that clothes princes with their robes, and
 therefore we must submit ourselves to them for the Lord's sake and with 
 an eye to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:13">1 Pet. ii. 13</A>.

 And, since it is he that <I>commits the government into their hand,</I>
 they must administer it according to his will, for his glory; they must 
 judge for him by whom they judge and <I>decree justice,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:15">Prov. viii. 15</A>.
 
 And they may depend upon him to furnish them for what he calls them to,
 according to this promise: <I>I will clothe him;</I> and then it 
 follows, <I>I will strengthen him.</I> Those that are called to places 
 of trust and power should seek unto God for grace to enable them to do 
 the duty of their places; for that ought to be their chief care.
 Eliakim's advancement is further described by the laying of the <I>key 
 of the house of David upon his shoulders,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Probably he carried a golden key upon his shoulder as a badge of his
 office, or had one embroidered upon his cloak or robe, to which this 
 alludes. Being over the house, and having the key delivered to him, as 
 the seals are to the lord-keeper, <I>he shall open and none shall shut, 
 shut and none shall open.</I> He had access to <I>the house of the 
 precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices;</I> and to 
 the <I>house of the armour</I> and the <I>treasures</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+39:2"><I>ch.</I> xxxix. 2</A>),

 and disposed of the stores there as he thought fit for the public
 service. He put whom he pleased into the inferior offices and turned 
 out whom he pleased. Our Lord Jesus describes his own power as Mediator 
 by an allusion to this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:7">Rev. iii. 7</A>),

 that <I>he has the key of David,</I> wherewith he <I>opens and no man
 shuts,</I> he <I>shuts and no man opens.</I> His power in the kingdom 
 of heaven, and in the ordering of all the affairs of that kingdom, is 
 absolute, irresistible, and uncontrollable. 

 2. That he should be fixed and confirmed in that office. He shall have
 it for life, and not <I>durante bene placito--during pleasure</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place,</I> not to be removed 
 or cut down. Thus lasting shall the honour be that comes from God to 
 all those who use it for him. Our Lord Jesus is <I>as a nail in a sure 
 place:</I> his kingdom cannot be shaken, and he himself is still the
 same. 

 3. That he should be a great blessing in his office; and it is this
 that crowns the favours here conferred upon him. God <I>makes his name 
 great,</I> for he shall be a blessing,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:2">Gen. xii. 2</A>.

 (1.) He shall be a blessing to his country

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>He shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the 
 house of Judah.</I> he shall take care not only of the affairs of the 
 king's household, but of all the public interests in Jerusalem and 
 Judah. Note, Rulers should be fathers to those that are under their 
 government, to teach them with wisdom, rule them with love, and correct 
 what is amiss with tenderness, to protect them and provide for them, 
 and be solicitous about them as a man is for his own children and 
 family. It is happy with a people when the court, the city, and the 
 country, have no separate interests, but all centre in the same, so 
 that the courtiers are true patriots, and whom the court blesses the 
 country has reason to bless too; and when those who are fathers to 
 Jerusalem, the royal city, are no less so to the house of Judah. 

 (2.) He shall be a blessing to his family

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>):

 <I>He shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house.</I> The 
 consummate wisdom and virtue which recommended him to this great trust 
 made him the honour of his family, which probably was very considerable 
 before, but now became much more so. Children should aim to be a credit 
 to their parents and relations. The honour men reflect upon their 
 families by their piety and usefulness is more to be valued than that 
 which they derive from their families by their names and titles. 
 Eliakim being preferred, <I>all the glory of his father's house</I> was 
 hung upon him; they all made their court to him, and his brethren's 
 sheaves bowed to his. Observe, The glory of this world gives a man no
 intrinsic worth or excellency; it is but hung upon him as an 
 appurtenance, and it will soon drop from him. Eliakim was compared to 
 <I>a nail in a sure place,</I> in pursuance of which comparison all the 
 relations of his family (which, it is likely, were numerous, and that 
 was the glory of it) are said to have a dependence upon him, as in a 
 house the vessels that have handles to them are hung up upon nails and 
 pins. It intimates likewise that he shall generously take care of them 
 all, and bear the weight of that care: <I>All the vessels,</I> not only 
 <I>the flagons,</I> but <I>the cups, the vessels of small quantity,</I> 
 the meanest that belong to his family, shall be provided for by him. 
 See what a burden those bring upon themselves that undertake great 
 trusts; they little think how many and how much will hand upon them if 
 they resolve to be faithful in the discharge of their trust. Our Lord 
 Jesus, having the key of the house of David, is as a <I>nail in a sure 
 place,</I> and all <I>the glory of his father's house hangs</I> upon 
 him, is derived from him, and depends upon him; even the meanest that 
 belong to his church are welcome to him, and he is able to bear the 
 stress of them all. That soul cannot perish, nor that concern fall to 
 the ground, though ever so weighty, that is by faith hung upon
 Christ.</P>
