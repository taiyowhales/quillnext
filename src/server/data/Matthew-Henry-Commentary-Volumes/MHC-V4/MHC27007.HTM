 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The six former chapters of this book were historical; we now enter with 
 fear and trembling upon the six latter, which are prophetical, wherein 
 are many things dark and hard to be understood, which we dare not 
 positively determine the sense of, and yet many things plain and 
 profitable, which I trust God will enable us to make a good use of. In 
 this chapter we have, 

 I. Daniel's vision of the four beasts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>.

 II. His vision of God's throne of government and judgment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:9-14">ver. 9-14</A>.

 III. The interpretation of these visions, given him by an angel that
 stood by, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:15-28">ver. 15-28</A>.

 Whether those visions look as far forward as the end of time, or 
 whether they were to have a speedy accomplishment, is hard to say, nor 
 are the most judicious interpreters agreed concerning it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a
 dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the
 dream, <I>and</I> told the sum of the matters.
 &nbsp; 2  Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and,
 behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.
 &nbsp; 3  And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from
 another.
 &nbsp; 4  The first <I>was</I> like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld
 till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from
 the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's
 heart was given to it.
 &nbsp; 5  And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it
 raised up itself on one side, and <I>it had</I> three ribs in the
 mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it,
 Arise, devour much flesh.
 &nbsp; 6  After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which
 had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also
 four heads; and dominion was given to it.
 &nbsp; 7  After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth
 beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had
 great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped
 the residue with the feet of it: and it <I>was</I> diverse from all
 the beasts that <I>were</I> before it; and it had ten horns.
 &nbsp; 8  I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them
 another little horn, before whom there were three of the first
 horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn <I>were</I>
 eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The date of this chapter places it before 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:1-31"><I>ch.</I> v.</A>,

 which was in the last year of Belshazzar, and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:1-28"><I>ch.</I> iv.</A>,

 which was in the first of Darius; for Daniel had those visions in the
 first year of Belshazzar, when the captivity of the Jews in Babylon was 
 drawing near a period. Belshazzar's name here is, in the original,
 spelt differently from what it used to be; before it was 
 <I>Bel-she-azar--Bel is he that treasures up riches.</I> But this is 
 <I>Bel-eshe-zar--Bel is on fire by the enemy.</I> Bel was the god of 
 the Chaldeans; he had prospered, but is now to be consumed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have, in these verses, Daniel's vision of the four monarchies that 
 were oppressive to the Jews. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The circumstances of this vision. Daniel had interpreted 
 Nebuchadnezzar's dream, and now he is himself honoured with similar 
 divine discoveries 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 He <I>had visions of his head upon his bed,</I> when he was asleep; so 
 God sometimes revealed himself and his mind to the children of men, 
 when deep sleep fell upon them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:15">Job xxxiii. 15</A>);

 for when we are most retired from the world, and taken off from the
 things of sense, we are most fit for communion with God. But when he 
 was awake he <I>wrote the dream</I> for his own use, lest he should 
 forget it as a dream which passes away; and he <I>told the sum of the 
 matters</I> to his brethren the Jews for their use, and gave it to them 
 in writing, that it might be communicated to those at a distance and 
 preserved for their children after them, who shall see these things 
 accomplished. The Jews, misunderstanding some of the prophecies of 
 Jeremiah and Ezekiel, flattered themselves with hopes that, after their 
 return to their own land, they should enjoy a complete and 
 uninterrupted tranquility; but that they might not so deceive 
 themselves, and their calamities be made doubly grievous by the 
 disappointment, God by this prophet lets them know that they shall have 
 tribulation: those promises of their prosperity were to be accomplished 
 in the spiritual blessings of the kingdom of grace; as Christ has told 
 his disciples they must expect persecution, and the promises they 
 depend upon will be accomplished in the eternal blessings of the 
 kingdom of glory. Daniel both wrote these things and spoke them, to 
 intimate that the church should be taught both by the scriptures and by 
 ministers' preaching, both by the written word and by word of mouth; 
 and ministers in their preaching are to <I>tell the sum of the 
 matters</I> that are written.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The vision itself, which foretels the revolutions of government in 
 those nations which the church of the Jews, for the following ages, was 
 to be under the influence of. 

 1. He observed the <I>four winds to strive upon the great sea,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 They strove which should blow strongest, and, at length, blow alone. 
 This represents the contests among princes for empire, and the shakings 
 of the nations by these contests, to which those mighty monarchies, 
 which he was now to have a prospect of, owed their rise. One wind from 
 any point of the compass, if it blow hard, will cause a great commotion 
 in the sea; but what a tumult must needs be raised when the four winds 
 strive for mastery! This is it which the kings of the nations are
 contending for in their wars, which are as noisy and violent as the 
 battle of the winds; but how is the poor sea tossed and torn, how 
 terrible are its concussions, and how violent its convulsions, while 
 the winds are at strife which shall have the sole power of troubling 
 it! Note, This world is like a stormy tempestuous sea; thanks to the 
 proud ambitious winds that vex it. 

 2. He saw <I>four great beasts come up from the sea,</I> from the
 <I>troubled waters,</I> in which aspiring minds love to fish. The 
 monarchs and monarchies are represented by <I>beasts,</I> because too 
 often it is by brutish rage and tyranny that they are raised and 
 supported. These beasts were <I>diverse one from another</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 of different shapes, to denote the different genius and complexion of 
 the nations in whose hands they were lodged. 

 (1.) <I>The first</I> beast <I>was like a lion,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 This was the Chaldean monarchy, that was fierce and strong, and made 
 the kings absolute. This lion had <I>eagle's wings,</I> with which to 
 fly upon the prey, denoting the wonderful speed that Nebuchadnezzar 
 made in his conquest of kingdoms. But Daniel soon sees the <I>wings
 plucked,</I> a full stop put to the career of their victorious arms. 
 Divers countries that had been tributaries to them revolt from them, 
 and make head against them; so that this monstrous animal, this winged 
 lion, is made to <I>stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart is 
 given to it.</I> It has lost the heart of a lion, which it had been 
 famous for (one of our English kings was called <I>C&oelig;ur de 
 Lion--Lion-heart</I>), has lost its courage and become feeble and 
 faint, dreading every thing and daring nothing; they are put in fear, 
 and made to know themselves to be but men. Sometimes the valour of a 
 nation strangely sinks, and it becomes cowardly and effeminate, so that 
 what was the head of the nations in an age or two becomes the tail.
 
 (2.) The <I>second</I> beast was <I>like a bear,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 This was the Persian monarchy, less strong and generous than the 
 former, but no less ravenous. This bear <I>raised up itself on one
 side</I> against the lion, and soon mastered it. It <I>raised up one 
 dominion;</I> so some read it. Persia and Media, which in 
 Nebuchadnezzar's image were the <I>two arms</I> in one breast, now set 
 up a joint government. This bear had <I>three ribs in the mouth of it 
 between the teeth,</I> the remains of those nations it had devoured, 
 which were the marks of its voraciousness, and yet an indication that 
 though it had devoured much it could not devour all; some ribs still 
 stuck in the teeth of it, which it could not conquer. Whereupon it was 
 said to it, "<I>Arise, devour much flesh;</I> let alone the bones, the 
 ribs, that cannot be conquered, and set upon that which will be an 
 easier prey." The princes will stir up both the kings and the people to 
 push on their conquests, and let nothing stand before them. Note, 
 Conquests, unjustly made, are but like those of the beasts of prey, and 
 in <I>this</I> much worse, that the beasts prey not upon those of their 
 own kind, as wicked and unreasonable men do. 

 (3.) The third beast was <I>like a leopard,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 This was the Grecian monarchy, founded by <I>Alexander the Great,</I> 
 active, crafty, and cruel, like a <I>leopard.</I> He had <I>four wings 
 of a fowl;</I> the lion seems to have had but two wings; but the 
 leopard had four, for though Nebuchadnezzar made great despatch in his 
 conquests Alexander made much greater. In six years' time he gained the 
 whole empire of Persia, a great part besides of Asia, made himself 
 master of Syria, Egypt, India, and other nations. This beast had 
 <I>four heads;</I> upon Alexander's death his conquests were divided 
 among his four chief captains; Seleucus Nicanor had Asia the Great; 
 Perdiccas, and after him Antigonus, had Asia the Less; Cassander had 
 Macedonia; and Ptolemeus had Egypt. <I>Dominion</I> was <I>given</I> to 
 this <I>beast;</I> it was given of God, from whom alone promotion 
 comes. 

 (4.) The fourth beast was more fierce, and formidable, and mischievous,
 than any of them, unlike any of the other, nor is there any among the 
 beasts of prey to which it might be compared,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The learned are not agreed concerning this anonymous beast; some make 
 it to be the Roman empire, which, when it was in its glory, 
 comprehended ten kingdoms, Italy, France, Spain, Germany, Britain, 
 Sarmatia, Pannonia, Asia, Greece, and Egypt; and then the little horn 
 which rose by the fall of three of the other horns 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>)

 they make to be the Turkish empire, which rose in the room of Asia, 
 Greece, and Egypt. Others make this fourth beast to be the kingdom of 
 Syria, the family of the Seleucid&aelig;, which was very cruel and 
 oppressive to the people of the Jews, as we find in Josephus and the 
 history of the Maccabees. And herein that empire was diverse from those 
 which went before, that none of the preceding powers compelled the Jews 
 to renounce their religion, but the kings of Syria did, and used them 
 barbarously. Their armies and commanders were the <I>great iron 
 teeth</I> with which they <I>devoured and broke in pieces</I> the 
 people of God, and they <I>trampled upon the residue</I> of them. The 
 <I>ten horns</I> are then supposed to be ten kings that reigned 
 successively in Syria; and then the <I>little horn</I> is Antiochus 
 Epiphanes, the last of the ten, who by one means or other undermined 
 three of the kings, and got the government. He was a man of great 
 ingenuity, and therefore is said to have eyes <I>like the eyes of a 
 man;</I> and he was very bold and daring, had a <I>mouth speaking great 
 things.</I> We shall meet with him again in these prophecies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of
 days did sit, whose garment <I>was</I> white as snow, and the hair of
 his head like the pure wool: his throne <I>was like</I> the fiery
 flame, <I>and</I> his wheels <I>as</I> burning fire.
 &nbsp; 10  A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him:
 thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times
 ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the
 books were opened.
 &nbsp; 11  I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which
 the horn spake: I beheld <I>even</I> till the beast was slain, and his
 body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.
 &nbsp; 12  As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their
 dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season
 and time.
 &nbsp; 13  I saw in the night visions, and, behold, <I>one</I> like the Son
 of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of
 days, and they brought him near before him.
 &nbsp; 14  And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom,
 that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his
 dominion <I>is</I> an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away,
 and his kingdom <I>that</I> which shall not be destroyed.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Whether we understand the fourth beast to signify the Syrian empire, or 
 the Roman, or the former as the figure of the latter, it is plain that 
 these verses are intended for the comfort and support of the people of 
 God in reference to the persecutions they were likely to sustain both 
 from the one and from the other, and from all their proud enemies in 
 every age; for it is written for their learning on whom the ends of the 
 world have come, that they also, through patience and comfort of this 
 scripture, might have hope. Three things are here discovered that are 
 very encouraging:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That there is a judgment to come, and God is the Judge. Now men have 
 their day, and every pretender thinks he should have his day, and 
 struggles for it. But <I>he that sits in heaven laughs at them,</I> for 
 he sees that <I>his day is coming,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:13">Ps. xxxvii. 13</A>.
 
 <I>I beheld</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 <I>till the thrones were cast down,</I> not only the thrones of these 
 beasts, but <I>all rule, authority, power,</I> that are set up in 
 opposition to the kingdom of God among men 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:24">1 Cor. xv. 24</A>):

 such are the thrones of the kingdoms of the world, in comparison with
 God's kingdom; those that see them set up need but wait awhile, and 
 they will see them cast down. <I>I beheld till thrones were set up</I> 
 (so it may as well be read), Christ's throne and the throne of his 
 Father. One of the rabbin confesses that these thrones are <I>set
 up,</I> one for <I>God,</I> another for the <I>Son of David.</I> It is 
 the <I>judgment</I> that is here <I>set,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 Now, 

 1. This is intended to proclaim God's wise and righteous government of 
 the world by his providence; and an unspeakable satisfaction it gives 
 to all good men, in the midst of the convulsions and revolutions of 
 states and kingdoms, that <I>the Lord has prepared his throne in the 
 heavens and his kingdom rules over all</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:19">Ps. ciii. 19</A>),

 <I>that verily there is a God that judges in the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:11">Ps. lviii. 11</A>.
 
 2. Perhaps it points at the destruction brought by the providence of
 God upon the empire of Syria, or that of Rome, for their tyrannizing 
 over the people of God. But,

 3. It seems principally designed to describe the last judgment, for
 though it follow not immediately upon the dominion of the fourth beast, 
 nay, though it be yet to come, perhaps many ages to come, yet it was 
 intended that in every age the people of God should encourage 
 themselves, under their troubles, with the belief and prospect of it.
 Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:14">Jude 14</A>.

 Does the mouth of the enemy <I>speak great things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Here are far greater things which the mouth of the Lord has spoken. 
 Many of the New-Testament predictions of the judgment to come have a 
 plain allusion to this vision, especially St John's vision of it, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:11,12">Rev. xx. 11, 12</A>.

 (1.) The Judge is <I>the Ancient of days</I> himself, <I>God the 
 Father,</I> the glory of whose presence is here described. He is
 called <I>the Ancient of days,</I> because he is God <I>from 
 everlasting to everlasting.</I> Among men we reckon that <I>with the 
 ancient is wisdom,</I> and <I>days shall speak;</I> shall not all flesh 
 then be silent before him who is <I>the Ancient of days?</I> The glory 
 of the Judge is here set forth by his garment, which was <I>white as 
 snow,</I> denoting his splendour and purity in all the administrations 
 of his justice; and the <I>hair of his head</I> clean and white, <I>as 
 the pure wool,</I> that, as the white and hoary head, he may appear 
 venerable. 

 (2.) The throne is very formidable. It is <I>like the fiery flame,</I>
 dreadful to the wicked that shall be summoned before it. And the throne 
 being movable upon wheels, or at least the chariot in which he rode the 
 circuit, the <I>wheels</I> thereof are <I>as burning fire,</I> to 
 devour the adversaries; for <I>our God is a consuming fire,</I> and 
 with him are <I>everlasting burnings,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:14">Isa. xxxiii. 14</A>.

 This is enlarged upon,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 As to all his faithful friends there <I>proceeds out of the throne of 
 God and the Lamb a pure river of water of life</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:1">Rev. xxii. 1</A>),

 so to all his implacable enemies there <I>issues and comes forth 
 from</I> his throne a <I>fiery stream, a stream of brimstone</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:33">Isa. xxx. 33</A>),

 a <I>fire</I> that shall <I>devour before him.</I> He is a swift
 witness, and his word a word upon the wheels.

 (3.) The attendants are numerous and very splendid. The Shechinah is
 always attended with angels; it is so here

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>Thousand thousands minister to him,</I> and <I>ten thousand times 
 ten thousand stand before him.</I> It is his glory that he has such 
 attendants, but much more his glory that he neither needs them nor can 
 be benefited by them. See how numerous the heavenly hosts are (there 
 are <I>thousands of angels</I>), and how obsequious they are--they 
 <I>stand before God,</I> ready to go on his errands and to take the 
 first intimation of his will and pleasure. They will particularly be 
 employed as ministers of his justice in the last judgment day, when the 
 <I>Son of man shall come, and all the holy angels with him.</I> Enoch 
 prophesied that the Lord should come <I>with his holy myriads.</I> 

 (4.) The process is fair and unexceptionable: <I>The judgment is
 set,</I> publicly and openly, that all may have recourse to it; and 
 <I>the books are opened.</I> As in courts of judgment among men the 
 proceedings are in writing and upon record, which is laid open when the 
 cause comes to a hearing, the examination of witnesses is produced, and 
 affidavits are read, to clear the matter of fact, and the statute and 
 common-law books are consulted to find out what is the law, so, in the 
 judgment of the great day, the equity of the sentence will be as 
 incontestably evident as if there were books opened to justify it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That the proud and cruel enemies of the church of God will 
 certainly be reckoned with and brought down in due time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.
 
 This is here represented to us, 

 1. In the destroying of the fourth beast. God's quarrel with this beast 
 is <I>because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke,</I> 
 bidding defiance to Heaven, and triumphing over all that is sacred; 
 this provokes God more than any thing, for the <I>enemy to behave 
 himself proudly,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:27">Deut. xxxii. 27</A>.

 <I>Therefore</I> Pharaoh must be humbled, because he has said, <I>Who
 is the Lord?</I> and has said, <I>I will pursue, I will overtake.</I> 
 Enoch foretold that <I>therefore</I> the Lord would come to <I>judge 
 the world,</I> that he might <I>convince all that are ungodly of their 
 hard speeches,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:15">Jude 15</A>.

 Note, Great words are but idle words, for which men must give account
 in the great day. And see what becomes of this beast that talks so big: 
 He <I>is slain,</I> and <I>his body destroyed and given to the burning 
 flame.</I> The Syrian empire, after Antiochus, was destroyed. He 
 himself died of a miserable disease, his family was rooted out, the 
 kingdom wasted by the Parthians and Armenians, and at length made a 
 province of the Roman empire by Pompey. And the Roman empire itself
 (if we take that for the fourth beast), after it began to persecute 
 Christianity, declined and wasted away, and the body of it was 
 destroyed. <I>So shall all thy enemies perish, O Lord!</I> and be 
 <I>slain before thee.</I> 

 2. In the diminishing and weakening of the other three beasts

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 They had <I>their dominion taken away,</I> and so were disabled from
 doing the mischiefs they had done to the church and people of God; but 
 <I>a prolonging in life was given them, for a time and a season,</I> a 
 set time, the bounds of which they could not pass. The power of the 
 foregoing kingdoms was quite broken, but the people of them still 
 remained in a mean, weak, and low condition. We may allude to this in 
 describing the remainders of sin in the hearts of good people; they 
 have corruptions in them, the lives of which are prolonged, so that 
 they are not perfectly free from sin, but the dominion of them is taken 
 away, so that sin does not <I>reign in their mortal bodies.</I> And 
 thus God deals with his church's enemies; sometimes he breaks the teeth 
 of them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+3:7">Ps. iii. 7</A>),

 when he does not break the neck of them, crushes the persecution, but
 reprieves the persecutors, that they may have space to repent. And it 
 is fit that God, in doing his own work, should take his own time and 
 way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That the kingdom of the Messiah shall be set up, and kept up, in 
 the world, in spite of all the opposition of the powers of darkness. 
 Let the heathen rage and fret as long as they please, God will <I>set 
 his King upon his holy hill of Zion.</I> Daniel sees this in vision, 
 and comforts himself and his friends with the prospect of it. This is 
 the same with Nebuchadnezzar's foresight of the <I>stone cut out of the 
 mountain without hands,</I> which broke in pieces the image; but in 
 this vision there is much more of pure gospel than in that. 

 1. The Messiah is here called the Son of man--<I>one like unto the Son
 of man;</I> for he was <I>made in the likeness of sinful flesh,</I> was 
 <I>found in fashion as a man. I saw one like unto the Son of man,</I> 
 one exactly agreeing with the idea formed in the divine counsels of him 
 that in the fulness of time was to be the Mediator between God and man.
 He is <I>like unto the son of man,</I> but is indeed the Son of God.
 Our Savior seems plainly to refer to this vision when he says

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:27">John v. 27</A>)

 that the <I>Father</I> has therefore <I>given him authority to execute
 judgment</I> because he is <I>the Son of man,</I> and because he is the 
 person whom Daniel saw in vision, to whom a kingdom and dominion were 
 to be given.

 2. He is said to <I>come with the clouds of heaven.</I> Some refer this
 to his incarnation; he descended <I>in the clouds of heaven,</I> came 
 into the world unseen, as the glory of the Lord took possession of the 
 temple in a cloud. The empires of the world were beasts that <I>rose 
 out of the sea;</I> but Christ's kingdom is from above: he is the 
 <I>Lord from heaven.</I> I think it is rather to be referred to his 
 ascension; when he returned to the Father the eye of his disciples 
 followed him, till <I>a cloud received him out of their sight,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:9">Acts i. 9</A>.

 He made that cloud his chariot, wherein he rode triumphantly to the
 upper world. He comes swiftly, irresistibly, and comes in state, for he 
 <I>comes with the clouds of heaven.</I>

 3. He is here represented as having a mighty interest in Heaven. When
 the cloud received him out of the sight of his disciples, it is worth 
 while to enquire (as the sons of the prophets concerning Elijah in a 
 like case) whither it carried him, where it lodged him; and here we are 
 told, abundantly to our satisfaction, that <I>he came to the Ancient of 
 days;</I> for he ascended to <I>his Father and our Father,</I> to 
 <I>his God and our God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:17">John xx. 17</A>);

 from him he came forth, and to him he returns, to be glorified with
 him, and to sit down at his right hand. It was with a great deal of 
 pleasure that he said, <I>Now I go to him that sent me.</I> But was he 
 welcome? Yes, not doubt, he was, for <I>they brought him near before 
 him;</I> he was introduced into his Father's presence, with the 
 attendance and adorations of <I>all the angels of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:6">Heb. i. 6</A>.
 
 God <I>caused him to draw near and approach to him,</I> as an advocate
 and undertaker for us

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:21">Jer. xxx. 21</A>),
 
 that we through him might be <I>made nigh.</I> By this solemn near
 approach which he made to the Ancient of days it appears that the 
 Father accepted the sacrifice he offered, and the satisfaction he made, 
 and was entirely well pleased with all he had done. He was <I>brought 
 near,</I> as our high priest, who for us enters within the veil, and as 
 our forerunner, 

 4. He is here represented as having a mighty influence upon this earth,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 When he went to be glorified with his Father he had a <I>power given 
 him over all flesh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:2,5">John xvii. 2, 5</A>.

 With the prospect of this Daniel and his friends are here comforted,
 that not only the dominion of the church's enemies shall be taken away

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 but the church's head and best friend shall have <I>the dominion given 
 him;</I> to him <I>every knee shall bow</I> and <I>every tongue 
 confess.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:9,10">Phil. ii. 9, 10</A>.

 To him are given <I>glory and a kingdom,</I> and they are given by him
 who has an unquestionable right to give them, which, some think with an 
 eye to these words, our Savior teaches us to acknowledge in the close 
 of the Lord's prayer, <I>For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the 
 glory.</I> It is here foretold that the kingdom of the exalted Redeemer 
 shall be,

 (1.) A universal kingdom, the only universal monarchy, whatever others
 have pretended to, or aimed at: <I>All people, nations, and 
 languages,</I> shall <I>fear him,</I> and be under his jurisdiction, 
 either as his willing subjects or as his conquered captives, to be 
 either ruled or overruled by him. One way or other, the kingdoms of the 
 world shall all become his kingdoms.

 (2.) An everlasting kingdom. His <I>dominion</I> shall not <I>pass
 away</I> to any successor, much less to any invader, and his kingdom is 
 <I>that</I> which <I>shall not be destroyed.</I> Even the gates of 
 hell, or the infernal powers and policies, shall not prevail against 
 it. The church shall continue militant to the end of time, and 
 triumphant to the endless ages of eternity.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of <I>my</I> body,
 and the visions of my head troubled me.
 &nbsp; 16  I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him
 the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the
 interpretation of the things.
 &nbsp; 17  These great beasts, which are four, <I>are</I> four kings,
 <I>which</I> shall arise out of the earth.
 &nbsp; 18  But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and
 possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.
 &nbsp; 19  Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was
 diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth
 <I>were of</I> iron, and his nails <I>of</I> brass; <I>which</I> devoured, brake
 in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;
 &nbsp; 20  And of the ten horns that <I>were</I> in his head, and <I>of</I> the
 other which came up, and before whom three fell; even <I>of</I> that
 horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things,
 whose look <I>was</I> more stout than his fellows.
 &nbsp; 21  I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and
 prevailed against them;
 &nbsp; 22  Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to
 the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints
 possessed the kingdom.
 &nbsp; 23  Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom
 upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall
 devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in
 pieces.
 &nbsp; 24  And the ten horns out of this kingdom <I>are</I> ten kings <I>that</I>
 shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be
 diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.
 &nbsp; 25  And he shall speak <I>great</I> words against the most High, and
 shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change
 times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a
 time and times and the dividing of time.
 &nbsp; 26  But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his
 dominion, to consume and to destroy <I>it</I> unto the end.
 &nbsp; 27  And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the
 kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of
 the saints of the most High, whose kingdom <I>is</I> an everlasting
 kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.
 &nbsp; 28  Hitherto <I>is</I> the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my
 cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me:
 but I kept the matter in my heart.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have, 

 I. The deep impressions which these visions made upon the prophet. God 
 in them put honour upon him, and gave him satisfaction, yet not without 
 a great allay of pain and perplexity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>I Daniel was grieved in my spirit, in the midst of my body.</I> The 
 word here used for the <I>body</I> properly signifies a <I>sheath</I> 
 or <I>scabbard,</I> for the body is no more to the soul; that is the 
 weapon; it is that which we are principally to take care of. The 
 <I>visions of my head troubled me,</I> an again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 <I>my cogitations much troubled me.</I> The manner in which these 
 things were discovered to him quite overwhelmed him, and put his 
 thoughts so much to the stretch that his spirits failed him, and the 
 trance he was in tired him and made him faint. The things themselves 
 that were discovered amazed and astonished him, and put him into a 
 confusion, till by degrees he recollected and conquered himself, and 
 set the comforts of the vision over against the terrors of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His earnest desire to understand the meaning of them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>I came near to one of those that stood by, to</I> one of the angels 
 that appeared attending the <I>Son of man</I> in his glory, and 
 <I>asked him the truth</I> (the true intent and meaning) <I>of all 
 this.</I> Note, It is a very desirable thing to take the right and full 
 sense of what we see and hear from God; and those that would know must 
 ask by faithful and fervent prayer and by <I>accomplishing a diligent 
 search.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The key that was given him, to let him into the understanding of 
 this vision. The angel <I>told him,</I> and told him so plainly that he 
 made him <I>know the interpretation of the thing,</I> and so made him 
 somewhat more easy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>The great beasts</I> are great <I>kings</I> and their kingdoms, 
 great monarchs and their monarchies, <I>which shall arise out of the 
 earth,</I> as those beasts did <I>out of the sea,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 They are but <I>terr&aelig;filii--from beneath;</I> they savour of the 
 earth, and their foundation is <I>in the dust;</I> they are of the 
 earth earthy, and they are written in the dust, and to the dust they 
 shall return.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Daniel pretty well understands the first three beasts, but 
 concerning the fourth he desires to be better informed, because it 
 differed so much from the rest, and was <I>exceedingly dreadful,</I> 
 and not only so, but very mischievous, or it <I>devoured and broke in 
 pieces,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Perhaps it was this that put Daniel into such a fright, and this part 
 of the visions of his head troubled him more than any of the rest. But 
 especially he desired to know what the <I>little horn</I> was, that 
 <I>had eyes,</I> and a <I>mouth that spoke very great things,</I> and 
 whose countenance was more fearless and formidable than that of <I>any 
 of his fellows,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 And this he was most inquisitive about because it was this horn that 
 <I>made war with the saints, and prevailed against them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 
 While no more is intimated than that the children of men make war with 
 one another, and prevail against one another, the prophet does not show 
 himself so much concerned (<I>let the potsherds strive with the 
 potsherds of the earth,</I> and be dashed in pieces one against 
 another); but when they <I>make war with the saints,</I> when the 
 <I>precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold,</I> are broken as 
 <I>earthen pitchers,</I> it is time to ask, "What is the meaning of 
 this? Will the Lord cast off his people? Will he suffer their enemies 
 to trample upon them and triumph over them? What is this same horn
 that shall prevail so far against the saints?" To this his interpreter 
 answers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:23-25"><I>v.</I> 23-25</A>)

 that this <I>fourth beast</I> is a <I>fourth kingdom,</I> that <I>shall 
 devour the whole earth,</I> or (as it may be read) <I>the whole 
 land.</I> That the <I>ten horns are ten kings,</I> and the <I>little 
 horn</I> is another king that shall subdue three kings, and shall be 
 very abusive to God and his people, shall act, 

 (1.) Very impiously towards God. He shall <I>speak great words against
 the Most High,</I> setting him, and his authority and justice, at 
 defiance.

 (2.) Very imperiously towards the people of God. He shall <I>wear out
 the saints of the Most High;</I> he will not cut them off at once, but 
 wear them out by long oppressions and a constant course of hardships 
 put upon them, ruining their estates and weakening their families. The 
 design of Satan has been to <I>wear out the saints of the Most 
 High,</I> that they may be no more in remembrance; but the attempt is 
 vain, for while the world stands God will have a church in it. He shall 
 <I>think to change times and laws,</I> to abolish all the ordinances 
 and institutions of religion, and to bring every body to say and do 
 just as he would have them. He shall trample upon laws and customs, 
 human and divine. <I>Diruit, &aelig;dificut, mutat quadrata 
 rotundis--He pulls down, he builds, he changes square into round,</I> 
 as if he meant to alter even the ordinances of heaven themselves. And 
 in these daring attempts he shall for a time prosper and have success; 
 they shall be given into his hand <I>until time, times, and half a 
 time</I> (that is, for three years and a half), that famous prophetical 
 measure of time which we meet with in the Revelation, which is 
 sometimes called forty-two months, sometimes 1260 days, which come all 
 to one. But at the end of that time the <I>judgment shall sit and take 
 away his dominion</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),
 
 which he expounds 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)

 of the beast being <I>slain and his body destroyed.</I> And (as Mr. 
 Mede reads 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>)

 <I>as to the rest of the beast,</I> the ten horns, especially the 
 little <I>ruffling</I> horn (as he calls it), they had their dominion 
 taken away. Now the question is, Who is this enemy, whose rise, reign, 
 and ruin, are foretold? Interpreters are not agreed. Some will have
 the fourth kingdom to be that of the Seleucid&aelig;, and the little 
 horn to be Antiochus, and show the accomplishment of all this in the 
 history of the Maccabees; so Junius, Piscator, Polanus, Broughton, and 
 many others: but others will have the fourth kingdom to be that of the 
 Romans, and the <I>little horn</I> to be Julius C&aelig;sar, and the 
 succeeding emperors (says Calvin), the antichrist, the papal kingdom 
 (says Mr. Joseph Mede), that <I>wicked one,</I> which, as this 
 <I>little horn,</I> is to be consumed by the <I>brightness of Christ's 
 second coming.</I> The pope assumes a power to <I>change times and 
 laws, potestas</I> <B><I>autokratorike</I></B>--<I>an absolute and 
 despotic power,</I> as he calls it. Others make the <I>little horn</I> 
 to be the <I>Turkish empire;</I> so Luther, Vatablus, and others. Now I 
 cannot prove either side to be wrong; and therefore, since prophecies 
 sometimes have many fulfillings, and we ought to give scripture its 
 full latitude (in this as in many other controversies), I am willing to 
 allow that they are both in the right, and that this prophecy has 
 primary reference to the Syrian empire, and was intended for the 
 encouragement of the Jews who suffered under Antiochus, that they might 
 see even these melancholy times foretold, but might foresee a glorious 
 issue of them at last, and the final overthrow of their proud 
 oppressors; and, which is best of all, might foresee, not long after, 
 the setting up of the kingdom of the Messiah in the world, with the 
 hopes of which it was usual with the former prophets to comfort the 
 people of God in their distresses. But yet it has a further reference, 
 and foretels the like persecuting power and rage in Rome heathen, and 
 no less in Rome papal, against the Christian religion, that was in 
 Antiochus against the pious Jews and their religion. And St. John, in 
 his visions and prophecies, which point primarily at Rome, has plain 
 reference, in many particulars, to these visions of Daniel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He has a joyful prospect given him of the prevalency of God's 
 kingdom among men, and its victory over all opposition at last. And it 
 is very observable that in the midst of the predictions of the force 
 and fury of the enemies this is brought in abruptly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:18,22"><I>v.</I> 18 and again <I>v.</I> 22</A>),
 
 before it comes, in the course of the vision, to be interpreted,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>.
 
 And this also refers, 

 (1.) To the prosperous days of the Jewish church, after it had 
 weathered the storm under Antiochus, and the power which the Maccabees 
 obtained over their enemies. 

 (2.) To the setting up of the kingdom of the Messiah in the world by
 the preaching of his gospel. <I>For judgment Christ comes into this 
 world,</I> to rule by his Spirit, and to make all his saints <I>kings 
 and priests to their God.</I>

 (3.) To the second coming of Jesus Christ, when the saints shall judge
 the world, shall sit down with him on his throne and triumph in the 
 complete downfall of the devil's kingdom. Let us see what is here 
 foretold.

 [1.] <I>The Ancient of days shall come,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 God shall judge the world by his Son, to whom he has <I>committed all 
 judgment,</I> and, as an earnest of that, he <I>comes</I> for the 
 deliverance of his oppressed people, comes for the setting up of his 
 kingdom in the world.
 
 [2.] <I>The judgment shall sit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 God will make it appear that he <I>judges in the earth,</I> and will, 
 both in wisdom and in equity, plead his people's righteous cause. At 
 the great day he will <I>judge the world in righteousness by that man 
 whom he has ordained.</I> 

 [3.] The <I>dominion</I> of the enemy shall be <I>taken away,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 All Christ's enemies shall be made his footstool, and shall be 
 <I>consumed and destroyed</I> to the end: these were the apostle uses 
 concerning the man of sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:8">2 Thess. ii. 8</A>.

 He shall be <I>consumed</I> with the <I>spirit of Christ's mouth</I>
 and <I>destroyed with the brightness of his coming.</I>

 [4.] <I>Judgment is given to the saints of the Most High.</I> The 
 apostles are entrusted with the preaching of a gospel by which the 
 <I>world shall be judged.</I> All the saints by their faith and 
 obedience condemn an unbelieving disobedient world; in Christ their 
 head they shall judge the world, shall <I>judge the twelve tribes of 
 Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:28">Matt. xix. 28</A>.

 See what reason we have to honour those that fear the Lord; how mean
 and despicable soever the saints now appear in the eye of the world, 
 and how much contempt soever is poured upon them; they are the 
 <I>saints of the Most High;</I> they are near and dear to God, and he 
 owns them for his, and <I>judgment</I> is <I>given to them.</I>

 [5.] That which is most insisted upon is that <I>the saints of the Most 
 High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.
 
 And again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 The <I>time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.</I> And again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 The <I>kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the 
 whole heavens, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most 
 High.</I> Far be it from us to infer hence that dominion is founded on 
 grace, or that this will warrant any, under pretence of saintship, to 
 usurp kingship. No; <I>Christ's kingdom is not of this world;</I> but
 this intimates the spiritual dominion of the saints over their own 
 lusts and corruptions, their victories over Satan and his temptations, 
 and the triumphs of the martyrs over death and its terrors. It likewise 
 promises that the gospel kingdom shall be set up, a kingdom of grace, 
 the privileges and comforts of which now, <I>under the heavens,</I> 
 shall be the earnest and first-fruits of the kingdom of <I>glory in the 
 heavens.</I> When the empire became Christian, and princes used their 
 power for the defence and advancement of Christianity, then the 
 <I>saints possessed the kingdom.</I> The saints rule by the Spirit's 
 ruling in them (and <I>this is the victory overcoming the world, even 
 their faith</I>) and by making the kingdoms of this world to become 
 Christ's kingdom. But the full accomplishment of this will be in the 
 everlasting happiness of the saints, the kingdom that cannot be moved, 
 which we, according to his promise, look for (that is the <I>greatness 
 of the kingdom</I>), the crown of glory that fades not away--that is 
 the <I>everlasting kingdom.</I> See what an emphasis is laid upon this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 The saints shall possess the kingdom <I>for ever, even for ever and 
 ever;</I> and the reason is because he whose saints they are is the 
 <I>Most High</I> and <I>his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 He is so, and therefore theirs shall be so. <I>Because I live, you
 shall live also,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:19">John xiv. 19</A>.

 His kingdom is theirs; they reckon themselves exalted in his
 exaltation, and desire no greater honour and satisfaction to themselves 
 than that <I>all dominions</I> should <I>serve and obey him,</I> as 
 they shall do,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7: ">
 <I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 They shall either be brought into subjection to his golden sceptre or 
 brought to destruction by his iron rod.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Daniel, in the close, when he ends that matter, tells us what 
 impressions this vision made upon him; it overwhelmed his spirits to 
 such a degree that his <I>countenance</I> was <I>changed,</I> and it 
 made him look pale; but he <I>kept the matter in his heart.</I> Note, 
 The heart must be the treasury and store-house of divine things; there 
 we must hide God's word, as the Virgin Mary kept the sayings of Christ,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:51">Luke ii. 51</A>.

 Daniel kept <I>the matter in his heart,</I> with a design, not to keep
 it from the church, but to keep it for the church, that what he had 
 received from the Lord he might fully and faithfully deliver to the 
 people. Note, It concerns God's prophets and ministers to treasure up 
 the things of God in their minds, and there to digest them well. If we 
 would have God's word ready in our mouths when we have occasion for it, 
 we must keep it in our hearts at all times.</P>
