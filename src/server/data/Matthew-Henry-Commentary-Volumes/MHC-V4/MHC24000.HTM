 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE</FONT> Prophecies of the Old Testament, as the
 Epistles of the New, are placed rather according to their bulk than
 their seniority--the longest first, not the oldest. There were several
 prophets, and writing ones, that were contemporaries with Isaiah, as
 Micah, or a little before him, as Hosea, and Joel, and Amos, or soon
 after him, as Habakkuk and Nahum are supposed to have been; and yet the
 prophecy of Jeremiah, who began many years after Isaiah finished, is
 placed next to his, because there is so much in it. Where we meet with
 most of God's word, there let the preference be given; and yet those of
 less gifts are not to be despised nor excluded. Nothing now occurs to
 be observed further concerning prophecy in general; but concerning this
 prophet Jeremiah we may observe,

 I. That he was betimes a prophet; he began young, and therefore could
 say, from his own experience, that it is good for a man to <I>bear the
 yoke in his youth,</I> the yoke both of service and of affliction, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:27">Lam. iii. 27</A>.

 Jerome observes that Isaiah, who had more years over his head, had his
 tongue touched with a coal of fire, to purge away his iniquity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:7"><I>ch.</I> vi. 7</A>),

 but that when God touched Jeremiah's mouth, who was yet but young, 
 nothing was said of the purging of his iniquity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:9"><I>ch.</I> i. 9</A>),

 because, by reason of his tender years, he had not so much sin to 
 answer for.

 II. That he continued long a prophet, some reckon fifty years, others
 above forty. He began in the thirteenth year of Josiah, when things 
 went well under that good king, but he continued through all the wicked 
 reigns that followed; for when we set out for the service of God, 
 though the wind may then be fair and favourable, we know not how soon 
 it may turn and be tempestuous. 

 III. That he was a reproving prophet, was sent in God's name to tell
 Jacob of their sins and to warn them of the judgments of God that were 
 coming upon them; and the critics observe that therefore his style or 
 manner of speaking is more plain and rough, and less polite, than that 
 of Isaiah and some others of the prophets. Those that are sent to 
 discover sin ought to lay aside the enticing words of man's wisdom.
 Plain-dealing is best when we are dealing with sinners to bring them to 
 repentance. 

 IV. That he was a weeping prophet; so he is commonly called, not only
 because he penned the Lamentations, but because he was all along a
 mournful spectator of the sins of his people and of the desolating
 judgments that were coming upon them. And for this reason, perhaps,
 those who imagined our Saviour to be one of the prophets thought him of
 any of them to be most like to Jeremiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:14">Matt. xvi. 14</A>),

 because he was <I>a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.</I>

 V. That he was a suffering prophet. He was persecuted by his own
 people more than any of them, as we shall find in the story of this 
 book; for he lived and preached just before the Jews' destruction by 
 the Chaldeans, when their character seems to have been the same as it 
 was just before their destruction by the Romans, when they <I>killed 
 the Lord Jesus, and persecuted</I> his <I>disciples, pleased not God, 
 and were contrary to all men, for wrath had come upon them to the 
 uttermost,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:15,16">1 Thess. ii. 15, 16</A>.

 The last account we have of him in his history is that the remaining
 Jews forced him to go down with them into Egypt; whereas the current 
 tradition is, among Jews and Christians, that he suffered martyrdom. 
 Hottinger, out of Elmakin, an Arabic historian, relates that, 
 continuing to prophesy in Egypt against the Egyptians and other 
 nations, he was stoned to death; and that long after, when Alexander 
 entered Egypt, he took up the bones of Jeremiah where they were buried 
 in obscurity, and carried them to Alexandria, and buried them there. 
 The prophecies of this book which we have in the first nineteen 
 chapters seem to be the heads of the sermons he preached in a way of 
 general reproof for sin and denunciation of judgment; afterwards they 
 are more particular and occasional, and mixed with the history of his 
 day, but not placed in due order of time. With the threatenings are 
 intermixed many gracious promises of mercy to the penitent, of the 
 deliverance of the Jews out of their captivity, and some that have a 
 plain reference to the kingdom of the Messiah. Among the Apocryphal 
 writings an epistle is extant said to be written by Jeremiah to the 
 captives in Babylon, warning them against the worship of idols, by 
 exposing the vanity of idols and the folly of idolaters. It is in
 Baruch,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:1-30"><I>ch.</I> vi.</A>

 But it is supposed not to be authentic; nor has it, I think, any thing
 like the life and spirit of Jeremiah's writings. It is also related
 concerning Jeremiah 
 
 (<U>2 Mac. ii. 4</U>)

 that, when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Chaldeans, he, by direction 
 from God, took the ark and the altar of incense, and, carrying them to 
 Mount Nebo lodged them in a hollow cave there and stopped the door; but 
 some that followed him, and thought that they had marked the place, 
 could not find it. He blamed them for seeking it, telling them that the 
 place should be unknown till the time that God should gather his people 
 together again. But I know not what credit is to be given to that 
 story, though it is there said to be found in the records. We cannot 
 but be concerned, in the reading of Jeremiah's prophecies, to find that 
 they were so little regarded by the men of that generation; but let us 
 make use of that as a reason why we should regard them the more; for 
 they are written for our learning too, and for warning to us and to our 
 land.</P>
