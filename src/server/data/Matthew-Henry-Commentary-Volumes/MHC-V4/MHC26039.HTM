 This chapter continues and concludes the prophecy against Gog and 
 Magog, in whose destruction God crowns his favour to his people Israel,
 which shines very brightly after the scattering of that black cloud in 
 the close of this chapter. Here is, 

 I. An express prediction of the utter destruction of Gog and Magog,
 agreeing with what we had before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 II. An illustration of the vastness of that destruction, in three
 consequences of it: the burning of their weapons

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:8-10">ver. 8-10</A>),

 the burning of their slain

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:11-16">ver. 11-16</A>),

 and the feasting of the fowls with the dead bodies of those that were
 unburied, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:17-22">ver. 17-22</A>.

 III. A declaration of God's gracious purposes concerning his people 
 Israel, in this and his other providences concerning them, and a 
 promise of further mercy that he had yet in store for them, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:23-29">ver. 23-29</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Therefore, thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say,
 Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Behold, I <I>am</I> against thee, O Gog, the
 chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:
 &nbsp; 2  And I will turn thee back, and leave but the sixth part of
 thee, and will cause thee to come up from the north parts, and
 will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel:
 &nbsp; 3  And I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause
 thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand.
 &nbsp; 4  Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all
 thy bands, and the people that <I>is</I> with thee: I will give thee
 unto the ravenous birds of every sort, and <I>to</I> the beasts of the
 field to be devoured.
 &nbsp; 5  Thou shalt fall upon the open field: for I have spoken <I>it,</I>
 saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 6  And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell
 carelessly in the isles: and they shall know that I <I>am</I> the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 7  So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people
 Israel; and I will not <I>let them</I> pollute my holy name any more:
 and the heathen shall know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the Holy One in
 Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This prophecy begins as that before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:38:3"><I>ch.</I> xxxviii. 3, 4</A>,

 <I>I am against thee, and I will turn thee back</I>); for there is need
 of line upon line, both for the conviction of Israel's enemies and the 
 comfort of Israel's friends. Here, as there, it is foretold that God 
 will bring this enemy <I>from the north parts,</I> as formerly the 
 Chaldeans were fetched from the north, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:14">Jer. i. 14</A>

 (<I>Omne malum ab aquilone--Every evil comes from the north</I>), and,
 long after, the Roman empire was overrun by the northern nations, that 
 he will bring him <I>upon the mountains of Israel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 first as a place of temptation, where the measures of his iniquity 
 shall be filled up, and then as a place of execution, where his ruin 
 shall be completed. And that is it which is here enlarged upon. 

 1. His soldiers shall be disarmed and so disabled to carry on their
 enterprise. Though the men of might may <I>find their hands,</I> yet to 
 what purpose, when they find it is put out of their power to do 
 mischief, when God shall smite their <I>bow out of their left hand</I> 
 and their <I>arrow out of their right?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Note, The weapons formed against Zion shall not prosper. 

 2. He and the greatest part of his army shall be slain in the field of 
 battle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):
 
 <I>Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel;</I> there they sinned, 
 and there they shall perish, even upon the holy <I>mountains of 
 Israel,</I> for <I>there broke he the arrows of the bow,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:3">Ps. lxxvi. 3</A>.

 The mountains of Israel shall be moistened, and fattened, and made 
 fruitful, with the blood of the enemies. "Thou shalt <I>fall upon the 
 open field</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 and shalt not be able even there to make thy escape." Even upon the 
 mountains he shall not find a pass that he shall be able to maintain, 
 and upon the open field he shall not find a road that he shall be able 
 to make his escape by. He and <I>his bands;</I> his regular troops, and 
 the people that are <I>with him</I> that follow the camp to share in 
 the plunder, shall all <I>fall with him.</I> Note, Those that <I>cast 
 in their lot</I> among wicked people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:14">Prov. i. 14</A>),

 that they <I>may have one purse</I> with them, must expect to <I>take 
 their lot with them,</I> and fare as they fare, taking the worse with 
 the better. There shall be such a general slaughter made that but <I>a
 sixth part shall be left</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 the other five shall all be cut off. Never was army so totally routed 
 as this. And, for its greater infamy and reproach, their bodies shall 
 be a feast to the birds of prey, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 Compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>,

 <I>Thou shalt fall,</I> for <I>I have spoken it.</I> Note, Rather shall 
 the most illustrious princes (Antiochus was called <I>Epiphanes--the 
 illustrious</I>) and the most numerous armies <I>fall to the ground</I> 
 than any word of God; for he that has spoken will <I>make it good.</I> 
 
 3. His country also shall be made desolate: <I>I will send a fire on
 Magog</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 and <I>among those that dwell carelessly,</I> or confidently, <I>in the 
 isles,</I> that is, the nations of the Gentiles. He designed to
 destroy the land of Israel, but shall not only be defeated in that 
 design, but shall have his own destroyed by some fire, some consuming 
 judgment or other. Note, Those who invade other people's rights justly
 lose their own. 

 4. God will by all this advance the honour of his own name,

 (1.) Among his people Israel; they shall hereby know more of God's 
 name, of his power and goodness, his care of them, his faithfulness to 
 them. His providence concerning them shall lead them into a better 
 acquaintance with him; every providence should do so, as well as every 
 ordinance: <I>I will make my holy name known in the midst of my 
 people.</I> In Judah is God known; but those that know much of God 
 should know more of him; we should especially increase in the knowledge 
 of his name as a holy name. They shall know him as a God of perfect
 purity and rectitude and that hates all sin, and then it follows, <I>I 
 will not let them pollute my holy name any more.</I> Note, Those that 
 rightly know God's holy name will not dare to profane it; for it is 
 through ignorance of it that men make light of it and make bold with 
 it. And this is God's method of dealing with men, first to enlighten 
 their understandings, and by that means to influence the whole man; he 
 first makes us to know his holy name, and so keeps us from polluting it 
 and engages us to honour it. And this is here the blessed effect of
 God's glorious appearances on the behalf of his people. Thus he 
 completes his favours, thus he sanctifies them, thus he makes them 
 blessings indeed; by them he instructs his people and reforms them. 
 <I>When the Almighty scattered kings for her she was white as snow in 
 Salmon,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:14">Ps. lxviii. 14</A>.

 (2.) Among the heathen; those that never knew it, or would not own it,
 shall <I>know that I am the Lord, the Holy One in Israel.</I> They 
 shall be made to know by dearbought experience that he is a God of 
 power, and his people's God and Saviour; and it is in vain for the 
 greatest potentates to contend with him; none ever hardened their heart 
 against him and prospered.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; this
 <I>is</I> the day whereof I have spoken.
 &nbsp; 9  And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth,
 and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and
 the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves, and
 the spears, and they shall burn them with fire seven years:
 &nbsp; 10  So that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither
 cut down <I>any</I> out of the forests; for they shall burn the
 weapons with fire: and they shall spoil those that spoiled them,
 and rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 11  And it shall come to pass in that day, <I>that</I> I will give
 unto Gog a place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the
 passengers on the east of the sea: and it shall stop the <I>noses</I>
 of the passengers: and there shall they bury Gog and all his
 multitude: and they shall call <I>it</I> The valley of Hamongog.
 &nbsp; 12  And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of
 them, that they may cleanse the land.
 &nbsp; 13  Yea, all the people of the land shall bury <I>them;</I> and it
 shall be to them a renown the day that I shall be glorified,
 saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 14  And they shall sever out men of continual employment,
 passing through the land to bury with the passengers those that
 remain upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it: after the end
 of seven months shall they search.
 &nbsp; 15  And the passengers <I>that</I> pass through the land, when <I>any</I>
 seeth a man's bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the
 buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamongog.
 &nbsp; 16  And also the name of the city <I>shall be</I> Hamonah. Thus shall
 they cleanse the land.
 &nbsp; 17  And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Speak unto
 every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field, Assemble
 yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my
 sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, <I>even</I> a great sacrifice
 upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh, and drink
 blood.
 &nbsp; 18  Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of
 the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of
 bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan.
 &nbsp; 19  And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till
 ye be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.
 &nbsp; 20  Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and
 chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the
 Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 21  And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the
 heathen shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand
 that I have laid upon them.
 &nbsp; 22  So the house of Israel shall know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> their
 God from that day and forward.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Though this prophecy was to have its accomplishment in the latter days, 
 yet it is here spoken of as if it were already accomplished, because it 
 is certain 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>Behold it has come, and it is done;</I> it is as sure to be done 
 when the time shall come as if it were done already; <I>this is the day 
 whereof I have</I> long and often <I>spoken,</I> and, though it has 
 been long in coming, yet at length <I>it has come.</I>" Thus it was 
 said unto John 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:6">Rev. xxi. 6</A>),

 <I>It is done.</I> To represent the routing of the army of Gog as very 
 great, here are three things specified as the consequences of it. It 
 was God himself that gave the defeat; we do not find that the people of 
 Israel drew a sword or struck a stroke: but,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They shall <I>burn their weapons,</I> their <I>bows and arrows,</I> 
 which <I>fell out of their hands</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 <I>their shields and bucklers,</I> their <I>javelins, spears, leading 
 staves, truncheons,</I> and <I>half-pikes,</I> every thing that is 
 combustible. They shall not lay them up in their armouries, nor
 reserve them for their own use, lest they should be tempted to put a 
 confidence in them, but they shall burn them; not all at once, for a 
 bonfire (to what purpose would be that waste?) but as they had occasion 
 to use them for fuel in their houses, instead of other fire-wood, so 
 that they should have no occasion to <I>take wood out of the field or 
 forests</I> for <I>seven years</I> together 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 such vast quantities of weapons shall there be left upon the open field 
 where the enemy fell, and in the roads which they passed in their 
 flight. The weapons were dry and fitter for fuel than green wood; and, 
 by saving the wood in their coppices and forests, they gave it time to 
 grow. Though the mountains of Israel produce plenty of all good
 things, yet it becomes the people of Israel to be good husbands of 
 their plenty and to save what they can for the benefit of those that 
 come after them, as Providence shall give them opportunity to do so. We 
 may suppose that when those who dwelt in the cities of Israel came 
 forth to <I>spoil those who spoiled them,</I> and make reprisals upon 
 them, they found upon them silver, and gold, and ornaments; yet no 
 mention is made of any thing particularly that they converted to their 
 own use but the wood of the weapons for fuel, which is one of the 
 necessaries of human life, to teach us to think it enough if we be well 
 supplied with those, though we have but little of the delights and 
 gaieties of it and of those things which we may very well live without. 
 And every time they put fuel to the fire, and warmed themselves at it, 
 they would be put in mind of the number and strength of their enemies, 
 and the imminent peril they were in of falling into their hands, which 
 would help to enlarge their hearts in thankfulness to that God who had 
 so wonderfully, so seasonably, delivered them. As they sat by <I>the 
 fire</I> with their children about them (their fire-side), they might 
 from it take occasion to tell them what great things God had done for 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They shall bury their dead. Usually, after a battle, when many are 
 slain, the enemy desire time to bury their own dead. But here the 
 slaughter shall be so general that there shall not be a sufficient 
 number of the enemies left alive to bury the dead. And, besides, the 
 slain lie so dispersed on the mountains of Israel that it would be a 
 work of time to find them out; and therefore it is left to the house of 
 Israel to bury them as a piece of triumph in their overthrow. 

 1. A place shall be appointed on purpose for the burying of them,
 <I>the valley of the passengers, on the east of the sea,</I> either the 
 salt sea or the sea of Tiberias, a valley through which there was great 
 passing and repassing of travellers between Egypt and Chaldea. There 
 shall be such a multitude of dead bodies, putrefying above ground, with 
 such a loathsome stench, that the travellers who go that way shall be 
 forced to <I>stop their noses.</I> See what vile bodies ours are; when 
 the soul has been a little while from them the smell of them becomes 
 offensive, no smell more nauseous or more noxious. There therefore 
 where the greatest number lay slain shall the burying-place be 
 appointed. In the place where the tree falls there let it lie. And it 
 shall be called, <I>The valley of Hamon-gog,</I> that is, <I>of the 
 multitude of Gog;</I> for that was the thing which was in a particular 
 manner to be had in remembrance. How numerous the forces of the enemy 
 were which God defeated and destroyed for the defence of his people 
 Israel! 

 2. A considerable time shall be spent in burying them, no less than 
 <I>seven months</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 which is a further intimation that the <I>slain of the Lord</I> in this 
 action should be many and that great care should be taken by the house 
 of Israel to leave none unburied, that so <I>they might cleanse the 
 land</I> from the ceremonial pollution it contracted by the lying of so 
 many dead corpses unburied in it, for the prevention of which it was 
 appointed that those who were <I>hanged on a tree</I> should be 
 speedily <I>taken down and buried,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:23">Deut. xxi. 23</A>.

 This is an intimation that times of eminent deliverances should be
 times of reformation. The more God has done for the saving of a land 
 from ruin the more the inhabitants should do for the cleansing of the 
 land from sin.

 3. Great numbers shall be employed in this work: <I>All the people of
 the land</I> shall be ready to lend a helping hand to it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 Note, Every one should contribute the utmost he can in his place 
 towards the cleansing of the land from the pollutions of it, and from 
 every thing that is a reproach to it. Sin is a common enemy, which 
 every man should take up arms against. <I>In publico discrimine 
 unusquisque homo miles est--In the season of public danger every man 
 becomes a soldier.</I> And whoever shall assist in this work <I>it 
 shall be to them a renown;</I> though the office of grave-makers, or 
 common scavengers of the country, seem but mean, yet, when it is for 
 the cleansing and purifying of the land from dead works, it shall be 
 mentioned to their honour. Note, Acts of humanity add much to the 
 renown of God's Israel; it is a credit to religion when those that 
 profess it are ready to every good work; and a good work it is to bury 
 the dead, yea, though they be strangers and enemies to the commonwealth 
 of Israel, for even they shall rise again. <I>It shall be a renown</I> 
 to them in <I>the day when God will be glorified.</I> Note, It is for 
 the glory of God when his Israel do that which adorns their profession; 
 others <I>will see their good works and glorify their Father,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:16">Matt. v. 16</A>.

 And when God is honoured he will put honour upon his people. His glory
 is their renown.

 4. Some particular persons shall make it their business to search out 
 the dead bodies, or any part of them that should remain unburied. The 
 <I>people of the land</I> will soon grow weary of burying the 
 pollutions of the country, and therefore they shall appoint <I>men of 
 continual employment,</I> that shall apply themselves to it and do 
 nothing else till the land be thoroughly cleansed; for, otherwise, that 
 which is every one's work would soon become nobody's work. Note, Those 
 that are engaged in public work, especially for the cleansing and 
 reforming of a land, ought to be <I>men of continual employments,</I> 
 men that will stick to what they undertake and go through with it, men 
 that will apply themselves to it; and those that will do good according 
 to their opportunities will find themselves <I>continually 
 employed.</I> 

 5. Even the passengers shall be ready to give information to those
 whose business it is to cleanse the land of what public nuisances they 
 meet with, which call for their assistance. Those that <I>pass through
 the land,</I> though they will not stay to bury the dead themselves, 
 lest they should contract a ceremonial pollution, will yet give notice 
 of those that they find unburied. If they but discover a bone, they 
 will <I>set up a sign,</I> that <I>the buriers may come and bury 
 it,</I> and that, till it is buried, others may take need of touching 
 it, for which reason their sepulchres among the Jews were whitened, 
 that people might keep at a distance from them. Note, When good work
 is to be done every one should lend a hand to further it, even the 
 passengers themselves, who must not think themselves unconcerned, in a 
 common calamity, or a common iniquity, to put a stop to it. Those whose 
 work it is to cleanse the land must not countenance any thing in it 
 that is defiling; though it were not the body, but only <I>the bone, of 
 a man,</I> that was found unburied, they must encourage those who will 
 give information of it (private information, by a sign, concealing the 
 informer), that they may take it away, and bury it out of sight. Nay, 
 <I>after the end of seven months,</I> which was allowed them for this 
 work, when all is taken away that appeared at first view, <I>they shall 
 search</I> for more, that what is hidden may be brought to light; they 
 shall <I>search out iniquity till they find none.</I> In memory of this 
 they shall give a new name to their city. It shall be called
 <I>Hamonah--The multitude.</I> O what a multitude of our enemies have 
 we of this city buried! <I>Thus shall they cleanse the land,</I> with 
 all this care, with all this pains,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Note, After conquering there must be cleansing. Moses appointed those 
 Israelites that had been employed in the war with the Midianites to 
 <I>purify themselves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+31:24">Num. xxxi. 24</A>.

 Having received special favours from God, <I>let us cleanse ourselves
 from all filthiness.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The birds and beasts of prey shall rest upon the carcases of the 
 slain while they remain unburied and it shall be impossible to prevent 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>,

 &c. We find a great slaughter represented by this figure,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:17">Rev. xix. 17</A>,

 &c., which is borrowed from this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. There is a general invitation given, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 It is <I>to the fowl of every wing</I> and to <I>every beast of the 
 field,</I> from the greatest to the least, that preys upon carcases, 
 from the eagle to the raven, from the lion to the dog; let them all 
 gather themselves on every side; here is meat enough for them, and they 
 are all welcome. Let them come to God's <I>sacrifice,</I> to his 
 <I>feast;</I> so the margin reads it. Note, The judgments of God, 
 executed upon sin and sinners, are both a sacrifice and a feast, a 
 sacrifice to the justice of God and a feast to the faith and hope of 
 God's people. When God <I>broke the head of leviathan,</I> he gave him 
 to be <I>meat to Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:14">Ps. lxxiv. 14</A>.

 <I>The righteous shall rejoice</I> as at a feast <I>when he sees the
 vengeance,</I> and shall <I>wash his foot,</I> as at a feast, <I>in the 
 blood of the wicked.</I> This sacrifice is <I>upon the mountains of 
 Israel;</I> these are the high places, the altars, where God has been 
 dishonoured by the idolatries of the people, but where he will now 
 glorify himself in the destruction of his enemies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. There is great preparation made: They shall <I>eat the flesh of the 
 mighty</I> and <I>drink the blood of the princes of the earth,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 (1.) It is the flesh and blood of men that they shall be treated with. 
 This has sometimes been an instance of the rebellion of the inferior 
 creatures against man their master, which is an effect of his rebellion 
 against God his Maker. 

 (2.) It is the flesh and blood of great men, here called <I>rams,</I> 
 and <I>bullocks,</I> and <I>great goats, all of them fatlings of 
 Bashan.</I> It is the blood of <I>the princes of the earth</I> that 
 they shall regale themselves with. What a mortification is this to the 
 princes of the blood, as they call themselves, that God can make that 
 blood, that royal blood, which swells their veins, a feast for the 
 birds and beasts of prey! 

 (3.) It is the flesh and blood of wicked men, the enemies of God's 
 church and people, that they are invited to. They had accounted the 
 Israel of God as <I>sheep for the slaughter,</I> and now they shall 
 themselves be so accounted; they had thus used the <I>dead bodies of 
 Gods' servants</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:2">Ps. lxxix. 2</A>),

 or would have done, and now it shall come upon themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They shall all be fed, they shall all be feasted to the full 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:19"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>):

 "<I>You shall eat fat, and drink blood,</I> which are satiating 
 surfeiting things. The sacrifice is great and the feast upon the 
 sacrifice is accordingly: <I>You shall be filled at my table.</I>" 
 Note, God keeps a table for the inferior creatures; he <I>provides food 
 for all flesh.</I> The <I>eyes of all wait upon him,</I> and he 
 <I>satisfies their desires,</I> for he keeps a plentiful table. And if 
 the birds and beasts shall be filled at God's table, which he has 
 prepared for them, much more shall his children be abundantly satisfied 
 with the goodness of his house, even of his holy temple. They shall be 
 filled <I>with horses and chariots;</I> that is, those who ride in the 
 chariots, <I>mighty men and men of war,</I> who triumphed over nations, 
 are now themselves triumphed over by the <I>ravens of the valley</I> 
 and the <I>young eagles,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:17">Prov. xxx. 17</A>.

 They thought to make an easy prey of God's Israel, and now they are 
 themselves an easy prey to the birds and beasts. See how <I>evil 
 pursues sinners</I> even after death. This exposing of their bodies to
 be a prey is but a type and sign of those terrors which, after death, 
 shall prey upon their consciences (which the poetical fictions 
 represented by a vulture continually pecking at the heart), and this 
 shame is but an earnest of the everlasting shame and contempt they 
 shall rise to.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. This shall redound very much both to the glory of God and to the 
 comfort and satisfaction of his people. 

 1. It shall be much for the honour of God, for the heathen shall hereby
 be made to know that he is the Lord

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>All the heathen shall see</I> and observe <I>my judgments that I 
 have executed,</I> and thereby my <I>glory shall be set among them.</I> 
 This principle shall be admitted and established among them more than 
 ever, that the God of Israel is a great and glorious God. He is known 
 to be so even among the heathen, that have not, or read not, his 
 written word, by <I>the judgments which he executes.</I> 

 2. It shall be much for the satisfaction of his people; for they shall 
 hereby be made to know that he is their God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>The house of Israel shall know,</I> abundantly to their comfort, 
 that <I>I am the Lord their God from that day and forward.</I> 

 (1.) He will be so from that day and forward. God's present mercies are 
 pledges and assurances of further mercies. If God evidence to us that 
 he is our God he assures us that he will never leave us. <I>This God is 
 our God for ever and ever.</I> 

 (2.) They shall know it with more satisfaction from that day and 
 forward. They had sometimes been ready to question whether the Lord
 was with them or no; but the events of this day shall silence their 
 doubts, and, the matter being thus settled and made clear, it shall not 
 be doubted of for the future. As boasting in themselves is hereby for 
 ever excluded, so boasting in God is hereby for ever secured.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>23  And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went
 into captivity for their iniquity: because they trespassed
 against me, therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into
 the hand of their enemies: so fell they all by the sword.
 &nbsp; 24  According to their uncleanness and according to their
 transgressions have I done unto them, and hid my face from them.
 &nbsp; 25  Therefore thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Now will I bring again
 the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of
 Israel, and will be jealous for my holy name;
 &nbsp; 26  After that they have borne their shame, and all their
 trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they
 dwelt safely in their land, and none made <I>them</I> afraid.
 &nbsp; 27  When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered
 them out of their enemies' lands, and am sanctified in them in
 the sight of many nations;
 &nbsp; 28  Then shall they know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> their God, which
 caused them to be led into captivity among the heathen: but I
 have gathered them unto their own land, and have left none of
 them any more there.
 &nbsp; 29  Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have
 poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord
 G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is the conclusion of the whole matter going before, and has 
 reference not only to the predictions concerning Gog and Magog, but to 
 all the prophecies of this book concerning the captivity of the house 
 of Israel, and then concerning their restoration and return out of 
 their captivity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God will let the heathen know the meaning of his people's troubles, 
 and rectify the mistake of those concerning them who took occasion from 
 the troubles of Israel to reproach the God of Israel, as unable to
 protect them and untrue to his covenant with them. When God, upon their 
 reformation and return to him, turned again their captivity, and 
 brought them back to their own land, and, upon their perseverance in 
 their reformation, wrought such great salvations for them as that from 
 the attempts of Gog upon them, then it would be made to appear, even to 
 the heathen that would but consider and compare things, that there was 
 no ground at all for their reflection, that Israel went into captivity, 
 not because God could not protect them, but because they had by sin 
 forfeited his favour and thrown themselves out of his protection 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>):

 <I>The heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity 
 for their iniquity,</I> that iniquity which they learned from the 
 heathen their neighbours, <I>because they trespassed against God.</I> 
 That was the true reason why God <I>hid his face from them</I> and 
 <I>gave them into the hand of their enemies.</I> It was <I>according to 
 their uncleanness</I> and <I>according to their transgressions.</I> Now 
 the evincing of this will not only silence their reflections on God, 
 but will redound greatly to his honour; when the troubles of God's 
 people are over, and we see the end of them, we shall better understand 
 them than we did at first. And it will appear much for the glory of God 
 when the world is made to know, 

 1. That God punishes sin even in his own people, because he hates it
 most in those that are nearest and dearest to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:2">Amos iii. 2</A>.

 It is the praise of justice to be impartial.

 2. That, when God gives up his people for a prey, it is to correct them
 and reform them, not to gratify their enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:7,42:24">Isa. x. 7; xlii. 24</A>.

 Let not them therefore exalt themselves.

 3. That no sooner do God's people humble themselves under the rod than
 he returns in mercy to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God will give his own people to know what great favour he has in 
 store for them notwithstanding the troubles he had brought them into 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>):
 
 <I>Now will I bring again the captivity of Jacob.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Why now? Now God will <I>have mercy upon the whole house of
 Israel,</I> 

 (1.) Because it is time for him to stand up for his own glory, which 
 suffers in their sufferings: <I>Now will I be jealous for my holy 
 name,</I> that that may no longer be reproached. 

 (2.) Because now they repent of their sins: They <I>have borne their 
 shame, and all their trespasses.</I> When sinners repent, and take 
 shame to themselves, God will be reconciled and put honour upon them. 
 It is particularly pleasing to God that these penitents look a great 
 way back in their penitential reflections, and are ashamed of all their 
 trespasses which they were guilty of <I>when they dwelt safely in their 
 land and none made them afraid.</I> The remembrance of the mercies they 
 enjoyed in their own land, and the divine protection they were under 
 there, shall be improved as an aggravation of the sins they committed 
 in that land; they dwelt safely, and might have continued to dwell so, 
 and none should have given them any disquiet or disturbance if they had 
 continued in the way of their duty. Nay, <I>therefore</I> they 
 trespassed because <I>they dwelt safely.</I> Outward safety is often a 
 cause of inward security, and that is an inlet to all sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:1-28">Ps. lxxiii.</A>

 Now this they are willing to bear the shame of, and acknowledge that
 God has justly brought them into a land of trouble, where every one 
 makes them afraid, because they had trespassed against him in a land of 
 peace, where none made them afraid. And, when they thus humble 
 themselves under humbling providences, God will bring again their 
 captivity: and,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What then? When God has gathered them out of their enemies' hands, 
 and brought them home again, 

 (1.) Then God will have the praise of it: I will be <I>sanctified in 
 them in the sight of many nations,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 As God was reproached in the reproach they were under during their 
 captivity, so he will be sanctified in their reformation and the making 
 of them a holy people again, and will be glorified in their restoration 
 and the making of them a happy glorious people again. 

 (2.) Then they shall have the benefit of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 <I>They shall know that I am the Lord their God.</I> Note, The 
 providences of God concerning his people, that are designed for their 
 good, have the grace of God going along with them to teach them to eye 
 God as the Lord, and their God, in all; and then they do them good. 
 They shall eye him as the Lord and their God,

 [1.] In their calamities, that it was he who <I>caused them to be led 
 into captivity;</I> and therefore they must not only submit to his 
 will, but endeavour to answer his end in it. 

 [2.] In their comfort, that it is he who has <I>gathered them to their 
 own land,</I> and left none of them among the heathen. Note, By the 
 variety of events that befal us, if we look up to God in all, we may 
 come to acquaint ourselves better with his various attributes and 
 designs. 
 
 (3.) Then God and they will never part,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 [1.] God will <I>pour out his Spirit</I> upon them, to prevent their 
 departures from him and returns to folly again, and to keep them close 
 to their duty. And then,

 [2.] He will <I>never hide his face any more from them,</I> will never 
 suspend his favour as he had done; he will never turn from doing them 
 good, and, in order to that, he will effectually provide that they 
 shall never turn from doing him service. Note, The indwelling of the
 Spirit is an infallible pledge of the continuance of God's favour. He 
 will hide his face no more from those on whom he has <I>poured out his 
 Spirit.</I> When therefore we pray that God would never <I>cast us away 
 from his presence</I> we must as earnestly pray that, in order to that, 
 he would <I>never take his Holy Spirit away from us,</I>
