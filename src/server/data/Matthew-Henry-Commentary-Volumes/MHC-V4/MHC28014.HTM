 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The strain of this chapter differs from that of the foregoing chapters. 
 Those were generally made up of reproofs for sin and threatenings of 
 wrath; but this is made up of exhortations to repentance and promises 
 of mercy, and with these the prophet closes; for all the foregoing 
 convictions and terrors he had spoken were designed to prepare and make 
 way for these. He wounds that he may heal. The Spirit convinces that he 
 may comfort. This chapter is a lesson for penitents; and some such 
 there were in Israel at this day, bad as things were. We have here, 

 I. Directions in repenting, what to do and what to say,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. Encouragements to repent taken from God's readiness to receive
 returning sinners 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:4,8">ver. 4, 8</A>)

 and the comforts he has treasured up for them,

 III. A solemn recommendation of these things to our serious thoughts,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  O Israel, return unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God; for thou hast fallen
 by thine iniquity.
 &nbsp; 2  Take with you words, and turn to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: say unto him, Take
 away all iniquity, and receive <I>us</I> graciously: so will we render
 the calves of our lips.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A kind invitation given to sinners to repent, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 It is directed to Israel, God's professing people. They are called to 
 <I>return.</I> Note, Conversion must be preached even to those that are 
 within the pale of the church as well as to heathen. "Thou are Israel,
 and therefore art bound to thy God in duty, gratitude, and interest; 
 thy revolt from him is so much the more heinous, and thy return to him 
 so much the more necessary." Let Israel see, 

 1. What work he has made for repentance: "<I>Thou has fallen by thy
 iniquity." Thou has stumbled;</I> so some read it. Their idols were 
 their <I>stumbling-blocks.</I> "Thou has fallen from God into sin, 
 fallen off from all good, fallen down under the load of guilt and the 
 curse." Note, Sin is a fall; and it concerns those that have fallen by 
 sin to get up again by repentance. 

 2. What work he has to do in his repentance: "<I>Return to the Lord thy 
 God;</I> return to him as <I>the Lord</I> whom thou has a dependence 
 upon, as <I>thy God,</I> thine in covenant, whom thou has an interest 
 in." Note, It is the great concern of those that have revolted from God 
 to <I>return to God,</I> and so to do their <I>first works.</I> "Return 
 to him from whom thou has fallen, and who alone is able to raise thee 
 up. Return <I>even to the Lord,</I> or <I>quite home</I> to the Lord; 
 do not only look to him, or take some steps towards him, but make 
 thorough work of it." The ancient Jews had a saying grounded on this, 
 <I>Repentance is a great thing, for it brings men quite up to the 
 throne of glory.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Necessary instructions given them how to repent. 

 1. They must bethink themselves what to say to God when they come to
 him: <I>Take with you words.</I> They are required to bring, not 
 sacrifices and offerings, but penitential prayers and supplications, 
 the <I>fruit of thy lips,</I> yet not of the lips only, but of the 
 heart, else words are but wind. One of the rabbin says, They must be 
 such words as proceed <I>from what is spoken first in the inner 
 man;</I> the heart must dictate to the tongue. We must take good words 
 with us, by taking good thoughts and good affections with us. 
 <I>Verbaque pr&aelig;visam rem non invita sequentur--Those who master a 
 subject are seldom at a loss for language.</I> Note, When we come to 
 God we should consider what we have to say to him; for, if we come 
 without an errand, we are likely to go without an answer. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr_9:10">Ezra ix. 10</A>,

 <I>What shall we say?</I> We must take with us words from the 
 scripture, take them from the Spirit of grace and supplication, who 
 teaches us to cry, Abba, Father, and makes intercession in us. 

 2. They must bethink themselves what to do. They must not only take 
 with them words, but must <I>turn to the Lord;</I> inwardly in their 
 hearts, outwardly in their lives.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. For their assistance herein, and encouragement, God is pleased to 
 put words into their mouths, to teach them what they shall say. Surely 
 we may hope to speed with God, when he himself has ordered our address 
 to be drawn up ready to our hands, and his own Spirit has indited it 
 for us; and no doubt we shall speed if the workings of our souls agree 
 with the words here recommended to us. They are,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Petitioning words. Two things we are here directed to petition 
 for:--

 (1.) To be acquitted from guilt. When we return to the Lord we must say 
 to him, Lord, <I>take away all iniquity.</I> They were now smarting for 
 sin, under the load of affliction, but are taught to pray, not as 
 Pharaoh, Take away <I>this death,</I> but, <I>Take away this</I> sin. 
 Note, When we are in affliction we should be more concerned for the 
 forgiveness of our sins than for the removal of our trouble. "<I>Take
 away iniquity,</I> lift it off as a <I>burden</I> we are ready to sink 
 under or as the stumbling-block which we have often fallen over. Lord, 
 take it away, that it may not appear against us, to our confusion and 
 condemnation. Take it all away by a free and full remission, for we 
 cannot pretend to strike any of it off by a satisfaction of our own." 
 When God pardons sin he pardons <I>all,</I> that <I>great debt;</I> and 
 when we pray against sin we must pray against it all and not except 
 any. 

 (2.) To be accepted as righteous in God's sight: "<I>Receive us 
 graciously.</I> Let us have thy favour and love, and have thou respect 
 to us and to our performances. Receive our prayer graciously; be well 
 pleased with that good which by thy grace we are enabled to do." 
 <I>Take good</I> (so the word is); take it to bestow upon us, so the 
 margin reads it--<I>Give good.</I> This follows upon the petition for 
 the taking away of iniquity; for, till iniquity is taken away, we have 
 no reason to expect any good from God, but the taking away of iniquity 
 makes way for the conferring of good <I>removendo prohibens--by taking 
 that out of the way which hindered. Give good;</I> they do not say
 what good, but refer themselves to God; it is not good of the world's 
 showing 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:6">Ps. iv. 6</A>),

 but good of God's giving. "<I>Give good,</I> that good which we have
 forfeited, and which thou has promised, and which the necessity of our 
 case calls for." Note, God's gracious acceptance, and the blessed 
 fruits and tokens of that acceptance, are to be earnestly desired and 
 prayed for by us in our returning to God. "<I>Give good,</I> that good
 which will make us good and keep us from returning to iniquity 
 again."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Promising words. These also are put into their mouths, not to move 
 God, or to oblige him to show them mercy, but to move themselves, and 
 oblige themselves to returns of duty. Note, Our prayers for pardon and 
 acceptance with God should be always accompanied with sincere purposes 
 and vows of new obedience. Two things they are to promise and vow:--

 (1.) Thanksgiving. "Pardon our sins, and accept of us, so <I>will we 
 render the calves of our lips.</I>" The <I>fruit of our lips</I> (so 
 the LXX.), a word they used for <I>burnt-offerings,</I> and so it 
 agrees with the Hebrew. The apostle quotes this phrase 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:15">Heb. xiii. 15</A>),
 
 and by the <I>fruit of our lips</I> understands the <I>sacrifice of
 praise to God, giving thanks to his name.</I> Note, Praise and 
 thanksgiving are our spiritual sacrifice, and, if they come from an 
 upright heart, shall please the Lord <I>better than an ox or 
 bullock,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:30,32">Ps. lxxix. 30, 32</A>.

 And the sense of our pardon and acceptance with God will enlarge our
 hearts in praise and thankfulness. Those that are <I>received 
 graciously</I> may, and must, <I>render the calves of their 
 lips</I>--poor returns for rich receivings, yet, if sincere, more 
 acceptable than the calves of the stall.

 (2.) Amendment of life. They are taught to promise, not only verbal 
 acknowledgements, but a real reformation. And we are taught here,

 [1.] In our returns to God to covenant against sin. We cannot expect 
 that God should take it away by forgiving it if we do not put it away 
 by forsaking it.

 [2.] To be particular in our covenants and resolutions against sin, as 
 we ought to be in our confession, because deceit lies in generals.

 [3.] To covenant especially and expressly against those sins which we 
 have been most subject to, which have most easily beset us, and which 
 we have been most frequently overcome by. We must keep ourselves from, 
 and therefore must thus fortify ourselves against, <I>our own 
 iniquity,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:23">Ps. xviii. 23</A>.

 The sin they here covenant against, owning thereby that they had been
 guilty of it, is giving that glory to another which is due to God only; 
 this they promise they will never do, <I>First,</I> By putting that 
 confidence in creatures which should be put in God only. They will not 
 trust to their alliances abroad: <I>Asshur</I> (that is, Assyria) 
 <I>shall not save us.</I> "We will not court the help of the Assyrians 
 when we are in distress, as we have done

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:13,7:11,8:9"><I>ch.</I> v. 13; vii. 11; viii. 9</A>);

 we will not contract for it, nor will we confide in it, or depend upon
 it. Having a God to go to, a God all-sufficient to trust to, we scorn
 to be beholden to the Assyrians for help." They will not trust to their 
 warlike preparations at home, especially not those which they were 
 forbidden to multiply: "<I>We will not ride upon horses,</I> that is, 
 we will not make court to Egypt," for thence they fetched their horses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:16,Isa+30:16,31:1,3">Deut. xvii. 16; Isa. xxx. 16; xxxi. 1, 3</A>.

 "When our enemies invade us we will depend upon our God to succour our
 infantry, and will be in no care to remount our cavalry." Or, "We will 
 not <I>post on horseback,</I> for haste, from one creature to another, 
 to seek relief, but will take the nearest way, and the only sure way, 
 by addressing ourselves to God," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+20:5">Isa. xx. 5</A>.

 Note, True repentance takes us off from trusting to an arm of flesh,
 and brings us to rely on God only for all the good we stand in need of. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> Nor will they do it by paying that homage to creatures 
 which is due to God only. We <I>will not say any more to the works of
 our hands, You are our gods.</I> They must promise never to worship 
 idols again, and for a good reason, because it is the most absurd and 
 senseless thing in the world to pray to that as a god which is the work 
 of our hands. We must promise that we will not set our hearts upon the 
 gains of this world, nor pride ourselves in our external performances 
 in religion, for that is, in effect, to say to the work of our hands, 
 <I>You are our gods.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Pleading words are here put into their mouths: For <I>in thee the 
 fatherless find mercy.</I> We must take our encouragement in prayer, 
 not from any merit God finds in us, but purely from the mercy we hope 
 to find in God. This contains in itself a great truth, that God takes 
 special care of fatherless children, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:4,5">Ps. lxviii. 4, 5</A>.
 
 So he did in his law,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:22">Exod. xxii. 22</A>.

 So he does in his providence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:10">Ps. xxvii. 10</A>.

 It is God's prerogative to help the helpless. In him there is mercy for
 such, for they are proper objects of mercy. In him they find it; there 
 it is laid up for them, and there they must seek it; <I>seek and you 
 shall find.</I> It comes in here as a good plea for mercy and grace and 
 an encouraging one to their faith.

 (1.) They plead the distress of their state and condition: "We are 
 fatherless orphans, destitute of help." Those may expect to find help 
 in God that are truly sensible of their helplessness in themselves and 
 are willing to acknowledge it. This is a good step towards comfort. "If 
 we have not yet boldness to call God <I>Father,</I> yet we look upon 
 ourselves as fatherless without him, and therefore lay ourselves at his 
 feet, to be looked upon by him with compassion." 

 (2.) They plead God's wonted lovingkindness to such as were in that 
 condition: <I>With thee the fatherless</I> not only may find, but 
 <I>does find,</I> and shall find, <I>mercy.</I> It is a great 
 encouragement to our faith and hope, in returning to God, that it is 
 his glory to father the fatherless and help the helpless.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for

 &nbsp; 7  They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall

 <I>shall be</I> as the wine of Lebanon.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an answer of peace to the prayers of returning Israel. 
 They seek God's face, and they shall not <I>seek in vain.</I> God will 
 be sure to meet those in a way of mercy who return to him in a way of 
 duty. If we speak to God in good prayers, God will speak to us in good 
 promises, as he <I>answered the angel with good words and comfortable 
 words,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:13">Zech. i. 13</A>.

 If we take with us the foregoing words in our coming to God, we may
 take home with us these following words for our faith to feast upon; 
 and see how these answer those.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Do they dread and deprecate God's displeasure, and therefore return 
 to him? He assures them that, upon their submission, his <I>anger is 
 turned away from them.</I> This is laid as the ground of all the other 
 favours here promised. I will do so and so, for my <I>anger is turned 
 away,</I> and thereby a door is opened for all good to flow to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+12:1">Isa. xii. 1</A>.

 Note, Though God is justly and greatly angry with sinners, yet he is
 not implacable in his anger; it may be turned away; it shall be turned 
 away, from those that turn away from their iniquity. God will be 
 reconciled to those that are reconciled to him and to his whole 
 will.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Do they pray for the <I>taking away of iniquity?</I> He assures 
 them that he will <I>heal their backslidings;</I> so he promised, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:22">Jer. iii. 22</A>.

 Note, Though backslidings from God are the dangerous diseases and
 wounds of the soul, yet they are not incurable, for God has graciously 
 promised that if backsliding sinners will apply to him as their 
 physician, and comply with his methods, he will heal their 
 backslidings. He will heal the guilt of their backslidings by pardoning 
 mercy and their <I>bent to backslide</I> by renewing grace. Their 
 <I>iniquity</I> shall <I>not be their ruin.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Do they pray that God will receive them graciously? In answer to 
 that, behold, it is promised, <I>I will love them freely.</I> God had 
 hated them while they went on sin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:15"><I>ch.</I> ix. 15</A>);

 but now that they return and repent he loves them, not only ceases to
 be <I>angry</I> with them, but takes complacency in them and designs 
 their good. He <I>loves them freely,</I> with an <I>absolute entire</I> 
 love (so some), so that there are no remains of his former displeasure, 
 with a <I>liberal bountiful</I> love (so others); he will be 
 open-handed in his love to them, and will think nothing too much to 
 bestow upon them or to do for them. Or with a <I>cheerful willing</I> 
 love; he will love them without reluctancy or renitency. He will not 
 say in the day of thy repentance, <I>How shall I receive thee 
 again?</I> as he said in the day of thy apostasy, <I>How shall I give 
 thee up?</I> Or with an <I>unmerited preventing</I> love. Whom God 
 loves he loves <I>freely,</I> not because they deserve it, but of his 
 own good pleasure. He loves because he <I>will</I> love, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:7,8">Deut. vii. 7, 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Do they pray that God will <I>give good,</I> will make them good? 
 In answer to that, behold, it is promised, <I>I will be as the dew unto 
 Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What shall be the favour God will bestow upon them. It is the 
 blessing of their father Jacob, <I>God give thee the dew of heaven,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:28">Gen. xxvii. 28</A>.

 Nay, what they need God will not only give them, but he will himself be
 <I>that</I> to them, all that which they need: I <I>will be as the dew 
 unto Israel.</I> This ensures <I>spiritual blessings in heavenly 
 things;</I> and it follows upon the healing of their backslidings, for 
 pardoning mercy is always accompanied with renewing grace. Note, To 
 Israelites indeed God himself will be <I>as the dew.</I> He will 
 instruct them; his doctrine shall drop upon them as the dew,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:2">Deut. xxxii. 2</A>.

 They shall know more and more of him, for he will come to them <I>as
 the rain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hos+6:3">Hos. vi. 3</A>.

 He will refresh them with his comforts, so that their souls shall be as
 a <I>watered garden,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:11">Isa. lviii. 11</A>.

 He will be to true penitents <I>as the dew to Israel</I> when they were 
 in the wilderness, dew that had manna in it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:14,Nu+11:9">Exod. xvi. 14; Num. xi. 9</A>.

 The graces of the Spirit are the hidden manna, hidden in the dew; God
 will give them bread from heaven, as he did to Israel in the dew in
 abundance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:16">John i. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What shall be the fruit of that favour which shall be produced in 
 them. The grace thus freely bestowed on them <I>shall not be in 
 vain.</I> Those souls, those Israelites, to whom God is as the dew, on 
 whom his grace distils,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Shall be growing. The bad being by the grace of God made good, 
 they shall by the same grace be made better; for grace, wherever it is 
 true, is growing. 

 [1.] They shall grow upwards, and be more flourishing, <I>shall grow as 
 the lily,</I> or (as some read it) shall <I>blossom as the rose.</I> 
 The growth of the lily, as that of all bulbous roots, is very quick and 
 speedy. The root of the lily seems lost in the ground all winter, but, 
 when it is refreshed with the dews of the spring, it starts up in a 
 little time; so the grace of God improves young converts sometimes very 
 fast. The lily, when it has come to its height, is a lovely flower 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:29">Matt. vi. 29</A>),
 
 so grace is the comeliness of the soul, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:14">Ezek. xvi. 14</A>.

 It is the <I>beauty of holiness</I> that is produced by the <I>dew of
 the morning,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:3">Ps. cx. 3</A>.

 [2.] They shall grow downwards, and be more firm. The lily indeed grows 
 fast, and grows fine, but it soon fades and is easily plucked up; and 
 therefore it is here promised to Israel that with the flower of the 
 lily he shall have the root of the cedar: He shall <I>cast forth his 
 roots as Lebanon,</I> as the <I>trees of Lebanon,</I> which, having 
 taken deep root, cannot be plucked up, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:15">Amos ix. 15</A>.

 Note, Spiritual growth consists most in the growth of the root, which
 is out of sight. The more we depend upon Christ and draw sap and
 virtue from him, the more we act in religion from a principle and the 
 more steadfast and resolved we are in it, the more we <I>cast forth our 
 roots.</I>

 [3.] They shall grow round about

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>His branches shall spread</I> on all sides. And 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>)

 he shall <I>grow as the vine,</I> whose branches extend furthest of any 
 tree. Joseph was to be <I>a fruitful bough,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:22">Gen. xlix. 22</A>.

 When many are added to the church from without, when a hopeful
 generation rises up, then Israel's branches spread. When particular 
 believers abound in good works, and increase in the knowledge of God 
 and in every good gift, then their branches may be said to spread. The 
 <I>inward man is renewed day by day.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They shall be graceful and acceptable both to God and man. Grace 
 is the amiable thing, and makes those that have it truly amiable. They 
 are here compared to such trees as are pleasant, 

 [1.] To the sight: <I>His beauty shall be as the olive-tree,</I> which 
 is always green. <I>The Lord called thy name a green olive-tree,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:16">Jer. xi. 16</A>.

 Ordinances are the beauty of the church, and in them it is, and shall
 be, ever green. Holiness is the beauty of a soul; when those that 
 believe with the heart make profession with the mouth, and justify and 
 adorn that profession with an agreeable conversation, then their beauty 
 is as the olive-tree, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+52:8">Ps. lii. 8</A>.

 It is a promise to the trees of righteousness that their leaf shall not
 wither.

 [2.] To the smell: <I>His smell</I> shall be <I>as Lebanon</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 and his <I>scent as the wine of Lebanon,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 This was the praise of their father Jacob, <I>The smell of my son is as 
 the smell of a field which the Lord has blessed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:27">Gen. xxvii. 27</A>.

 The church is compared to a <I>garden of spices</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:12,14">Cant. iv. 12, 14</A>),

 which <I>all her garments smell of.</I> True believers are
 <I>acceptable to God</I> and <I>approved of men.</I> God <I>smells a 
 sweet savour</I> from their <I>spiritual sacrifices</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:21">Gen. viii. 21</A>),

 and they are <I>accepted of the multitude of the brethren.</I> Grace is
 the perfume of the soul, the perfume of the name, makes it like a 
 precious ointment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:1">Eccl. vii. 1</A>.

 <I>The memorial thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon</I> (so the
 margin reads it), not only their reviving comforts now, but their 
 surviving honours when they are gone, shall be as <I>the wine of 
 Lebanon,</I> that has a delicate flavour. Flourishing churches have 
 <I>their faith spoken of throughout the world</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:8">Rom. i. 8</A>)

 and <I>leave their name to be remembered</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:17">Ps. xlv. 17</A>);

 and <I>the memory of</I> flourishing saints is <I>blessed,</I> and
 shall be so, as theirs who <I>by faith obtained a good report.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) They shall be fruitful and useful. The church is compared here to 
 the vine and the olive, which brings forth useful fruits, to the honour 
 of God and man. Nay, the very shadow of the church shall be agreeable 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Those that dwell under his shadow shall return</I>--under God's 
 <I>shadow</I> (so some), under the shadow of the Messias, so the 
 Chaldee. Believers <I>dwell under God's shadow</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:1">Ps. xci. 1</A>),

 and there they are and may be safe and easy. But it is rather <I>under
 the shadow of Israel,</I> under the shadow of the church. Note, God's 
 promises pertain to those, and those only, that dwell under the 
 church's shadow, that attend on God's ordinances and adhere to his 
 people, not those that flee to that shadow only for shelter in a hot 
 gleam, but those that <I>dwell under it.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:4">Ps. xxvii. 4</A>.

 We may apply it to particular believers; when a man is effectually
 brought home to God all that <I>dwell under his shadow</I>--children, 
 servants, subjects, friends. <I>This day has salvation come to this 
 house.</I> Those that dwell under the shadow of the church shall 
 return; their drooping spirits shall return, and they shall be 
 refreshed and comforted. He <I>restores my soul,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+23:3">Ps. xxiii. 3</A>.

 <I>They shall revive as the corn,</I> which, when it is sown, dies
 first, and then revives, and <I>brings forth much fruit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:24">John xii. 24</A>.
 
 It is promised that God's people shall be blessings to the world, as
 corn and wine are. And a very great and valuable mercy it is to be 
 serviceable to our generation. Comfort and honour attend it.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Let us now hear the conclusion of the whole matter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Concerning Ephraim; he is spoken of and spoken to, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His repentance and reformation: <I>Ephraim shall say, What have I to 
 do any more with idols?</I> As some read it, God here reasons and 
 argues with him, why he should renounce idolatry: "<I>O Ephraim! what 
 to me and idols? What concord</I> or agreement can there be <I>between 
 me and idols? What communion between light and darkness, between Christ 
 and Belial?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:14,15">2 Cor. vi. 14, 15</A>.

 Therefore thou must break off thy league with them if thou wilt come
 into covenant with me." As we read it, God promises to bring Ephraim 
 and keep him to this: <I>Ephraim shall say,</I> God will put it into 
 his heart to say it, <I>What have I to do any more with idols?</I> He 
 has promised

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 not to <I>say any more to the works of his hands, You are my gods.</I> 
 But God's promises to us are much more our security and our strength 
 for the mortifying of sin than our promises to God; and therefore God 
 himself is here <I>surety for his servant to good,</I> will put in into 
 his heart and into his mouth. And, whatever good we say or do at any 
 time, it is he that works it in us. Ephraim had solemnly engaged not to 
 call his idols <I>his gods;</I> but God here engages further for him 
 that he shall resolve to have <I>no more to do with them.</I> He shall 
 abolish them, he shall abandon them, and that with the utmost 
 detestation; for it is necessary not only that in our lives we be 
 turned from sin, but that in our hearts we be turned against sin. See 
 here, 

 (1.) The power of divine grace. Ephraim had been <I>joined to his 
 idols</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:17"><I>ch.</I> iv. 17</A>),

 was so fond of them that one would have thought he could never fall out
 with them; and yet God will work such a change in him that he shall 
 loathe them as much as ever he loved them. 

 (2.) See the benefit of sanctified afflictions. Ephraim had smarted for 
 his idolatry; it had brought one judgment after another upon him, and 
 this at length is the fruit, even the <I>taking away of his sin,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:9">Isa. xxvii. 9</A>.

 (3.) See the nature of repentance; it is a firm and fixed resolution to 
 have no more to do with sin. This is the language of the penitent: "I 
 am ashamed that ever I had to do with sin; but I have had enough of it; 
 I hate it, and by the grace of God I will never have any thing to do 
 with it again, no, not with the occasions of it." Thou shalt say to thy 
 idol, <I>Get thee hence</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:22">Isa. xxx. 22</A>),

 shalt say to the tempter, <I>Get thee behind me, Satan.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The gracious notice God is pleased to take of it: <I>I have heard 
 him, and observed him. I have heard, and will look upon him;</I> so 
 some read it. Note, The God of heaven takes cognizance of the penitent 
 reflections and resolutions of returning sinners. He expects and 
 desires the repentance of sinners, because he has no pleasure in their 
 ruin. <I>He looks upon men</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:27">Job xxxiii. 27</A>),
 
 <I>hearkens and hears,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:6">Jer. viii. 6</A>.

 And, if there be any disposition to repent, he is well pleased with it.
 When <I>Ephraim bemoans himself</I> before God, he is a <I>dear 
 son,</I> he is a <I>pleasant child,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:20">Jer. xxxi. 20</A>.

 He meets penitents with mercy, as the father of the prodigal met his
 returning son. God <I>observed</I> Ephraim, to see whether he would 
 bring forth fruits meet for this profession of repentance that he made, 
 and whether he would continue in this good mind. He observed him to do 
 him good, and comfort him, according to the exigencies of his case.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The mercy of God designed for him, in order to his comfort and 
 perseverance in his resolutions; still God will be all in all to him. 
 Before, Israel was compared to a tree, now God compares himself to one. 
 He will be to his people, 

 (1.) As the branches of a tree: "<I>I am like a green fir-tree,</I> and 
 will be so to thee." The fir-trees, in those countries, were 
 exceedingly large and thick, and a shelter against sun and rain. God 
 will be to all true converts both a delight and a defence; under his 
 protection and influence they shall both dwell in safety and dwell in 
 ease. He with be either <I>a sun and a shield</I> or a <I>shade and a 
 shield,</I> according as their case requires. They shall sit down 
 <I>under his shadow with delight,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:3">Cant. ii. 3</A>.

 He will be so all weathers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+4:6">Isa. iv. 6</A>.

 (2.) As the root of a tree: <I>From me is thy fruit found,</I> which 
 may be understood either of the fruit brought forth to us (to him we 
 owe all our comforts) or of the fruit brought forth by us--from him we 
 receive grace and strength to enable us to do our duty. Whatever
 fruits of righteousness we brought forth, all the praise of them is due 
 to God; for he works in us both to will and to do that which is 
 good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Concerning every one that hears and reads the words of the prophecy 
 of this book 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Who is wise? and he shall understand these things.</I> Perhaps the 
 prophet was wont to conclude that sermons he preached with these words, 
 and now he closes with them the whole book, in which he has committed 
 to writing some fragments of the many sermons he had preached. Observe, 
 
 1. The character of those that do profit by the truths he delivered:
 <I>Who is wise</I> and <I>prudent? He shall understand these things, he 
 shall know them.</I> Those that set themselves to understand and know 
 these things thereby make it to appear that they are truly wise and 
 prudent, and will thereby be made more so; and, if any do not 
 understand and know them, it is because they are foolish and unwise. 
 Those that are wise in the doing of their duty, that are prudent in 
 practical religion, are most likely to know and understand both the 
 truths and providences of God, which are a mystery to others, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:17">John vii. 17</A>.
 
 <I>The secret of the Lord is with those that fear him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+25:14">Ps. xxv. 14</A>.

 <I>Who is wise?</I> This intimates a desire that those who read and
 hear these things would understand them (<I>O that they were wise!</I>) 
 and a complaint that few were so--<I>Who has believed our report?</I> 
 
 2. The excellency of these things concerning which we are here
 instructed: <I>The ways of the Lord are right;</I> and therefore it is 
 our wisdom and duty to know and understand them. The way of God's 
 precepts, in which he requires us to walk, is right, agreeing with the 
 rules of eternal reason and equity and having a direct tendency to our 
 eternal felicity. The ways of God's providence, in which he walks 
 toward us, are all right; no fault is to be found with any thing that 
 God does, for it is all well done. His judgments upon the impenitent, 
 his favours to the penitent, are all right; however they may be 
 perverted and misinterpreted, God will at last be justified and 
 glorified in them all. His <I>ways are equal.</I> 

 3. The different use which men make of them.

 (1.) The right ways of God to those that are good are, and will be, a 
 savour of life unto life: <I>The just shall walk in them;</I> they 
 shall conform to the will of God both in his precepts and in his 
 providences, and shall have the comfort of so doing. They shall well 
 understand the mind of God both in his word and in his works; they 
 shall be well reconciled to both, and shall accommodate themselves to 
 God's intention in both. <I>The just shall walk</I> in <I>those 
 ways</I> towards their great end, and shall not come short of it. 

 (2.) The right ways of God will be to those that are wicked a savour of 
 death unto death: <I>The transgressors shall fall</I> not only in their 
 own wrong ways, but even <I>in the right ways of the Lord.</I> Christ, 
 who is a foundation stone to some, is to others a <I>stone of 
 stumbling</I> and a <I>rock of offence.</I> That which was <I>ordained 
 to life</I> becomes through their abuse of it, death to them. God's 
 providences, being not duly improved by them, harden them in sin and 
 contribute to their ruin. God's discovery of himself both in the 
 judgments of his mouth and in the judgments of his hand is to us 
 according as we are affected under it. <I>Recipitur ad modum 
 recipientis--What is received influences according to the qualities of 
 the receiver.</I> The same sun softens wax and hardens clay. But of all 
 transgressors those certainly have the most dangerous fatal falls that 
 fall <I>in the ways of God,</I> that split on the rock of ages, and 
 suck poison out of the balm of Gilead. <I>Let the sinners in Zion be 
 afraid</I> of this.</P>
