 In this chapter we have, 

 I. A general charge drawn up against Israel for those high crimes and
 misdemeanors by which they had obstructed the course of God's favours 
 to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. A particular accusation, 

 1. Of the court--the king, princes, and judges,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:3-7">ver. 3-7</A>.

 2. Of the country. Ephraim is here charged with conforming to the
 nations 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:8">ver. 8</A>),

 senselessness and stupidity under the judgments of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:9-11">ver. 9-11</A>),
 
 ingratitude to God for his mercies 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:13">ver. 13</A>),

 incorrigibleness under his judgments 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:14">ver. 14</A>),
 
 contempt of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:15">ver. 15</A>),
 
 and hypocrisy in their pretences to return to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:16">ver. 16</A>.

 They are also threatened with a severe chastisement, which shall humble
 them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:12">ver. 12</A>),

 and, if that prevail not, then with an utter destruction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:13">ver. 13</A>),
 
 particularly their princes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:16">ver. 16</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim
 was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit
 falsehood; and the thief cometh in, <I>and</I> the troop of robbers
 spoileth without.
 &nbsp; 2  And they consider not in their hearts <I>that</I> I remember all
 their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about;
 they are before my face.
 &nbsp; 3  They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the
 princes with their lies.
 &nbsp; 4  They <I>are</I> all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker,
 <I>who</I> ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until
 it be leavened.
 &nbsp; 5  In the day of our king the princes have made <I>him</I> sick with
 bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.
 &nbsp; 6  For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles
 they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the
 morning it burneth as a flaming fire.
 &nbsp; 7  They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges;
 all their kings are fallen: <I>there is</I> none among them that
 calleth unto me.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Some take away the last words of the foregoing chapter, and make them 
 the beginning of this: "<I>When I returned,</I> or <I>would have 
 returned, the captivity of my people,</I> when I was about to come 
 towards them in ways of mercy, even <I>when I would have healed Israel, 
 then the iniquity of Ephraim</I> (the country and common people) <I>was
 discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria,</I> the court and the chief 
 city." Now, in these verses, we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A general idea given of the present state of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 See how the case now stood with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God graciously designed to do well for them: <I>I would have healed 
 Israel.</I> Israel were sick and wounded; their disease was dangerous
 and malignant, and likely to be fatal, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:6">Isa. i. 6</A>.

 But God offered to be their physician, to undertake the cure, and there
 was balm in Gilead sufficient to recover the health of the daughter of 
 his people; their case was bad, but it was not desperate, nay, it was 
 hopeful, when God <I>would have healed Israel.</I>

 (1.) He would have reformed them, would have separated between them and 
 their sins, would have purged out the corruptions that were among them, 
 by his laws and prophets. 

 (2.) He would have delivered them out of their troubles, and restored 
 to them their peace and prosperity. Several healing attempts were
 made, and their declining state seemed sometimes to be in a hopeful way 
 of recovery; but their own folly put them back again. Note, If sinful 
 miserable souls be not healed and helped, but perish in their sin and 
 misery, they cannot lay the blame on God, for he both could and 
 <I>would have healed them;</I> he offered to take the ruin under his 
 hand. And there are some special seasons when God manifests his 
 readiness to heal a distempered church and nation, now and then a 
 hopeful crisis, which, if carefully watched and improved, might, even 
 when the case is very bad, turn the scale for life and health.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They stood in their own light and put a bar in their own door. When 
 God <I>would have healed them,</I> when they bade fair for reformation 
 and peace, then their <I>iniquity</I> was <I>discovered</I> and their 
 <I>wickedness,</I> which stopped that current of God's favours, and 
 undid all again. 

 (1.) <I>Then,</I> when their case came to be examined and enquired 
 into, in order to their cure, that wickedness which had been concealed 
 and palliated was <I>found out;</I> not that it was ever hid from God, 
 but he speaks after the manner of men; as a surgeon, when he probes a 
 wound in order to the cure of it and finds that it touches the vitals 
 and is incurable, goes no further in his endeavour to cure it, so, when 
 God <I>came down to see</I> the case of Israel (as the expression is, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:21">Gen. xviii. 21</A>),

 with kind intentions towards them, he found their wickedness so very
 flagrant, and them so hardened in it, so impudent and impenitent, that 
 he could not in honour show them the favour he designed them. Note, 
 Sinners are not healed because they would not be healed. Christ 
 <I>would have gathered</I> them, and they <I>would not.</I>

 (2.) <I>Then,</I> when some endeavours were used to reform and reclaim 
 them, that wickedness which had been restrained and kept under <I>broke 
 out;</I> and from God's steps towards the healing of them they took 
 occasion to be so much the more provoking. When endeavours were used to 
 reform them vice grew more impetuous, more outrageous, and swelled so 
 much the higher, as a stream when it is damned up. When they began to 
 prosper they grew more proud, wanton, and secure, and so stopped the 
 progress of their cure. Note, It is sin that turns away good things 
 from us when they are coming towards us; and it is the folly and ruin 
 of multitudes that, when God would do well for them, they do ill for 
 themselves. And what was it that did them this mischief? In one word, 
 <I>they commit falsehood;</I> they worship idols (so some), defraud one 
 another (so others), or, rather, they dissemble with God in their 
 professions of repentance and regard to him. They say that they are 
 desirous to be healed by him, and, in order to that, willing to be 
 ruled by him; but they <I>lie unto him with their mouth and flatter him 
 with their tongue.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. A practical disbelief of God's omniscience and government was at the 
 bottom of all their wickedness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>They consider not in their hearts,</I> they never say it to their 
 own hearts, never think of this, <I>that I remember all their 
 wickedness.</I>" As if God could not see it, though he is all eye, or 
 did not heed it, though his name is Jealous, or had forgotten it, 
 though he is an eternal mind that can never be unmindful, or would not 
 reckon for it, though he is the <I>Judge of heaven and earth.</I> This 
 is the sinner's atheism; as good say that there is <I>no God</I> as say 
 that he is either ignorant or forgetful, that there is <I>none that 
 judges in the earth</I> as that he remembers not the things he is to 
 give judgment upon. It is a high affront they put upon God; it is a 
 damning cheat they put upon themselves; they say, <I>The Lord shall not 
 see,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+94:7">Ps. xciv. 7</A>.

 They cannot but know that <I>God remembers all their works;</I> they
 have been told it many a time; nay, if you ask them, they cannot but 
 own it, and yet they do not <I>consider it;</I> they do not think of it 
 when they should, and with application to themselves and their own 
 works, else they would not, they durst not, do as they do. But the time 
 will come when those who thus deceive themselves shall be undeceived: 
 "<I>Now their own doings have beset them about,</I> that is, they have 
 come at length to such a pitch of wickedness that their sins appear on 
 every side of them; all their neighbours see how bad they are, and can 
 they think that God does not see it?" Or, rather, "The punishment of 
 their doings besets them about; they are surrounded and embarrassed 
 with troubles, so that they cannot get out, by which it appears that 
 the sins they smart for are <I>before my face,</I> not only that I have 
 seen them, but that I am displeased at them;" for, till God by 
 pardoning our sins has cast them behind his back, they are still before 
 his face. Note, Sooner or later, God will convince those who do not now 
 consider it that he <I>remembers all their works.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. God had begun to contend with them by his judgments, in earnest of 
 what was further coming: <I>The thief comes in, and the troop of 
 robbers spoils without.</I> Some take this as an instance of their 
 wickedness, that they robbed and spoiled one another. <I>Nec hospes ab 
 hospite tutus--The host and the guest stand in fear of each other.</I>
 It seems rather to be a punishment of their sin; they were infested 
 with secret thieves among themselves, that robbed their houses and 
 shops and picked their pockets, and <I>troops of robbers,</I> foreign 
 invaders, that with open violence <I>spoiled abroad;</I> so far was 
 Israel from being healed that they had fresh wounds given them daily by 
 robbers and spoilers; and all this the effect of sin, all to punish 
 them for robbing God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:24,Mal+3:8,11">Isa. xlii. 24; Mal. iii. 8, 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A particular account of the sins of the court, of the king and 
 princes, and those about them, and the tokens of God's displeasure that 
 they were under for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Their king and princes were pleased with the wickedness and 
 profaneness of their subjects, who were emboldened thereby to be so 
 much them ore wicked 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>They make the king and princes glad with their wickedness.</I> It 
 pleased them to see the people conform to their wicked laws and 
 examples, in the worship of their idols, and other instances of impiety 
 and immorality, and to hear them flatter and applaud them in their 
 wicked ways. When Herod saw that his wickedness pleased the people he 
 proceeded further in it, much more will the people do so when they see 
 that it pleases the prince, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:3">Acts xii. 3</A>.

 Particularly, they made them glad <I>with their lies,</I> with the
 lying praises with which they crowned the favourites of the prince and 
 the lying calumnies and censures with which they blackened those whom 
 they knew the princes had a dislike to. Those who show themselves 
 pleased with slanders and ill-natured stories shall never want those 
 about them who will fill their ears with such stories.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+29:12">Prov. xxix. 12</A>,

 <I>If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked,</I> and 
 will make him glad with their lies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Drunkenness and revelling abound much at the court, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The <I>day of our king</I> was a merry day with them, either his 
 birth-day or his inauguration-day, of which it is probable that they 
 had an anniversary observation, or perhaps it was some holiday of his 
 appointing, which was therefore called <I>his day;</I> on that day the 
 princes met to drink the king's health, and got him among them, to be 
 merry, and <I>made him sick with bottles of wine.</I> It should seem 
 the king did not ordinarily drink to excess, but he was not upon a high 
 day brought to it by the artifices of the princes, tempted by the 
 goodness of the wine, the gaiety of the company, or the healths they 
 urged; and so little was he used to it that it <I>made him sick;</I> 
 and it is justly charged as a crime, as <I>crimen l&aelig;s&aelig; 
 majestatis--treason,</I> upon those who thus imposed upon him and 
 <I>made him sick;</I> nor would it serve for an excuse that it was 
 <I>the day of their king,</I> but was rather an aggravation of the 
 crime, that, whey they pretended to do him honour, they dishonoured him 
 to the highest degree. If it is a great affront and injury to a common 
 person to make him drunk, and there is a woe to those that do it 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:15">Hab. ii. 15</A>),

 much more to a crowned head; for the greater any man's dignity is the
 greater disgrace it is to him to be drunk. <I>It is not for kings, O 
 Lemuel! it is not for kings, to drink wine,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:4,5">Prov. xxxi. 4, 5</A>.
 
 See what a prejudice the sin of drunkenness is to a man, to a king. 
 
 (1.) In his health; it <I>made him sick.</I> It is a force upon nature; 
 and strange it is by what charms men, otherwise rational enough, can be 
 drawn to that which besides the offence it gives to God, and the damage 
 it does to their spiritual and eternal welfare, is a present disorder 
 and distemper to their own bodies. 

 (2.) In his honour; for, when he was thus intoxicated, he <I>stretched 
 out his hand with scorners;</I> then he that was entrusted with the 
 government of a kingdom lost the government of himself, and so far 
 forgot,

 [1.] The dignity of a king that he made himself familiar with players
 and buffoons, and those whose company was a scandal. 

 [2.] The duty of a king that he joined in confederacy with atheists, 
 and the profane scoffers at religion, whom he ought to have silenced 
 and put to shame; he <I>sat in the seat of the scornful,</I> of those 
 that had arrived at the highest pitch of impiety; he struck in with 
 them, said as they said, did as they did, and exerted his power, and 
 <I>stretched forth the hand</I> of his government, in concurrence with 
 them. Goodness and good men are often made <I>the song of the
 drunkards</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:12,Ps+35:16">Ps. lxix. 12; xxxv. 16</A>);

 but <I>woe unto thee, O land!</I> when <I>thy king is such a child</I>
 as to <I>stretch forth his hand</I> with those that make them so, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:16">Eccl. x. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Adultery and uncleanness prevailed much among the courtiers. This is 
 spoken of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:4,6,7"><I>v.</I> 4, 6, 7</A>,

 and the charge of drunkenness comes in in the midst of this article; 
 for wine is oil to the fire of lust, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:33">Prov. xxiii. 33</A>.

 Those that are inflamed with fleshly lusts, that are <I>adulterers</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 are here again and again compared to an oven heated by the baker 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):
 
 <I>They have made ready their heart like an oven</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);
 
 <I>they are all hot as an oven,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 Note,

 (1.) An unclean heart is like an oven heated; and the unclean lusts and
 affections of it are as the fuel that makes it hot. It is an inward 
 fire, it keeps the heat within itself; so adulterers and fornicators 
 secretly <I>burn in lust,</I> as the expression is, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:27">Rom. i. 27</A>.

 The heat of the oven is an intense heat, especially as it is here
 described; he that heats it <I>stirs up</I> the fire, and <I>ceases not 
 from raising</I> it up, till the bread is ready to be put in, being 
 <I>kneaded</I> and <I>leavened,</I> all which only signifies that they 
 are like an oven when it is at the hottest; nay, when it is <I>too hot 
 for the baker</I> (so the learned Dr. Pocock), when it is <I>hotter 
 than he would have it,</I> so that the raiser up of the fire ceases as 
 long as while the dough that is kneaded is in the fermenting, that the 
 heat may abate a little. Thus fiery hot are the lusts of an unclean 
 heart.

 (2.) The unclean wait for an opportunity to compass their wicked 
 desires; having made ready their heart like an oven, they lie in wait 
 to catch their prey. <I>The eye of the adulterer waits for the 
 twilight,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:15">Job xxiv. 15</A>.

 <I>Their baker sleeps all the night, but in the morning it burns as a
 flaming fire.</I> As the baker, having kindled a fire in his oven and 
 laid sufficient fuel to it, goes to bed, and sleeps all night, and in 
 the morning finds his oven well heated, and ready for his purpose, so 
 these wicked people, when they have laid some wicked plot, and formed a 
 design for the gratifying of some covetous, ambitious, revengeful, or 
 unclean lusts, have their hearts so fully set in them to do evil that, 
 though they may stifle them for a while, yet the fire of corrupt 
 affections is still glowing within, and, as soon as ever there is an 
 opportunity for it, their purposes which they have compassed and 
 imagined break out into overt acts, as a fire flames out when it has 
 vent given it. Thus <I>they are all hot as an oven.</I> Note, Lust in 
 the heart is like fire in an oven, puts it into a heat; but the day is 
 coming when those who thus make themselves like a fiery oven with their 
 own vile affections, if that fire be not extinguished by divine grace, 
 shall be made as a fiery oven by divine wrath

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:9">Ps. xxi. 9</A>),

 when <I>the day comes</I> that shall <I>burn as an oven,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:1">Mal. iv. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They resist the proper methods of reformation and redress: <I>They 
 have devoured their judges,</I> those few good judges that were among 
 them, that would have put out these fires with which they were heated; 
 they fell foul upon them, and would not suffer them to do justice, but 
 were ready to stone them, and perhaps did so; or, as some think, they 
 provoked God to deprive them of the blessing of magistracy and to leave 
 all in confusion: <I>All their kings</I> have <I>fallen</I> one after 
 another, and their families with them, which could not but put the 
 kingdom into confusion, crumble it into contending parties, and 
 occasion a great deal of bloodshed. There are heart-burnings among 
 them; they are <I>hot as an oven</I> with rage and malice at one 
 another, and this occasions the <I>devouring of their judges,</I> the 
 <I>falling</I> of their <I>kings. For the transgressions of a land many 
 are the princes thereof,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:2">Prov. xxviii. 2</A>.

 But in the midst of all this trouble and disorder <I>there is none 
 among them that calls unto God,</I> that sees his hand stretched out 
 against them in these judgments, and deprecates the strokes of it, 
 none, or next to none, that stir up themselves to take hold on God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:7">Isa. lxiv. 7</A>.

 Note, Those are not only heated with sin, but hardened in sin, that
 continue to live without prayer even when they are in trouble and 
 distress.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a

 &nbsp; 9  Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth <I>it</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Having seen how vicious and corrupt the court was, we now come to 
 enquire how it is with the country, and we find that to be no better; 
 and no marvel if the distemper that has so seized the head affect the 
 whole body, so that there is <I>no soundness</I> in it; the <I>iniquity 
 of Ephraim is discovered,</I> as well as <I>the sin of Samaria,</I> of 
 the people as well as the princes, of which here are divers 
 instances.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They were not peculiar and entire for God, as they should have been, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 1. They did not distinguish themselves from the heathen, as God had 
 distinguished them: <I>Ephraim, he has mingled himself among the 
 people,</I> has associated with them, and conformed himself to them, 
 and has in a manner confounded himself with them and lost his character 
 among them. God had said, <I>The people shall dwell alone;</I> but they 
 <I>mingled themselves with the heathen and learned their works,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:35">Ps. xvi. 35</A>.

 They went up and down among the heathen, to beg help of one of them
 against another (so some); whereas, if they had kept close to God, they 
 would not have needed the help of any of them.

 2. They were not entirely devoted to God: <I>Ephraim is a cake not 
 turned,</I> and so is burnt on one side and dough on the other side, 
 but good for nothing on either side. As in Ahab's time, so now, they 
 <I>halted between God and Baal;</I> sometimes they seemed zealous for 
 God, but at other times as hot for Baal. Note, It is sad to think how 
 many, who, after a sort, profess religion, are made up of contraries 
 and inconsistencies, <I>as a cake not turned,</I> a constant 
 self-contradiction, and always in one extreme or the other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They were strangely insensible of the judgments of God, which they 
 were under, and which threatened their ruin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. The condition they were in. God was not to them, in his judgments, 
 as <I>a moth</I> and as <I>rottenness;</I> they were silently and 
 slowly drawing towards the ruin of their state partly by the 
 encroachments of foreigners upon them: <I>Strangers have devoured his 
 strength,</I> and eaten him up; they have wasted his wealth and 
 treasure, lessened his numbers, and consumed the fruits of the earth. 
 Some devoured them by open wars (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:7">2 Kings xiii. 7</A>,

 when the king of Syria made them <I>like the dust by threshing</I>),
 others by pretending treaties of peace and amity, in which they 
 extorted abundance of wealth from them, and made them pay dearly for 
 that which did them no good, but which afterwards they paid more dearly 
 for, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:9">2 Kings xvi. 9</A>.

 This Ephraim got by mingling with the heathen, and suffering them to
 mingle with him; they devoured that which he rested upon and supported 
 himself with. Note, Those that make not God their strength

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+52:7">Ps. lii. 7</A>)

 make that their strength which will soon be devoured by strangers. They
 were thus reduced partly by their own mal-administrations among 
 themselves: <I>Yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him</I> (are 
 <I>sprinkled</I> upon him, so the word is), that is, the sad symptoms 
 of a decaying declining state, which is <I>waxing old</I> and <I>ready 
 to vanish away,</I> and the effects of trouble and vexation. <I>Cura 
 facit canos--Care turns gray.</I> The <I>almond-tree</I> does not as 
 yet <I>flourish,</I> but it begins to turn colour, which speaks aloud 
 to him that the <I>evil days</I> are coming, and the <I>years of which 
 he shall say, I have no pleasure in them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:1,5">Eccl. xii. 1, 5</A>.

 2. Their regardlessness of these warnings: <I>He knows it not;</I> he 
 is not aware of the hand of God gone out against him; it is lifted up, 
 but he <I>will not see,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:11">Isa. xxvi. 11</A>.

 He does not know how near his ruin is, and takes no care to prevent it.
 Note, Stupidity under less judgments is a presage of greater 
 coming.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They went on frowardly in their wicked ways, and were not 
 reclaimed by the rebukes they were under 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>The pride of Israel</I> still <I>testifies to his face,</I> as it 
 had done before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:5"><I>ch.</I> v. 5</A>);

 under humbling providences their hearts were still unhumbled, their
 lusts unmortified; and it is <I>through the pride of their 
 countenance</I> that they <I>will not seek after God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:4">Ps. x. 4</A>);
 
 they <I>do not return to the Lord their God</I> by repentance and
 reformation, <I>nor do they seek him</I> by faith and prayer <I>for all 
 this;</I> though they suffer for going astray from him, though it can 
 never be well with them till they come back to him, and though they 
 have in vain sought to others for relief, yet they think not of 
 applying to God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. They were infatuated in their counsels, and took very wrong methods 
 when they were in distress 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>):

 <I>Ephraim is like a silly dove without heart.</I> To be harmless as a 
 dove, without gall, and not to hurt or injure others, is commendable; 
 but to be sottish as a dove, without heart, that knows not how to 
 defend herself and provide for her own safety, is a shame.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The silliness of this dove is, 

 (1.) That she laments not the loss of her young that are taken from 
 her, but will make her nest again in the same place; so they have their 
 people carried away by the enemy, and are not affected with it, but 
 continue their dealings with those that deal barbarously with them. 
 
 (2.) That she is easily enticed by the bait into the net, and has <I>no 
 heart,</I> no understanding, to discern her danger, as many other fowls 
 do,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:17">Prov. i. 17</A>.

 She <I>hastes to the snare, and knows not that it is for her life</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+7:23">Prov. vii. 23</A>);

 so they were drawn into leagues with neighbouring nations that were 
 their ruin. 

 (3.) That, when she is frightened, she has not courage to stay in the 
 dove-house, where she is safe, and under the careful protection of her 
 owner, but flutters and hovers, seeking shelter first in one place, 
 then in another, and thereby exposes herself so much the more; so this 
 people, when they were in distress, sought not to God, did not fly 
 <I>like the doves to their windows</I> where they might have been 
 secured from all the birds of prey that struck at them, but threw 
 themselves out of God's protection, and then <I>called to Egypt</I> to 
 help them, and went in all haste <I>to Assyria,</I> to seek for that 
 aid in vain which they might, by repentance and prayer, have found 
 nearer home, in their God. Note, It is a silly senseless thing for 
 those who have a God in heaven to trust to creatures for the refuge and 
 relief which are to be had in him only; and those that do so are a 
 <I>people of no understanding,</I> they are <I>without heart.</I> 
 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. See what becomes of this <I>silly dove</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>When they shall go</I> to Egypt and Assyria, <I>I will spread my net 
 upon them.</I> Note, Those that will not abide by the mercy of God must 
 expect to be pursued by the justice of God. Here, 

 (1.) They are ensnared: "<I>I will spread my net upon them,</I> bring 
 them into straits, that they may see their folly and think of 
 returning." Note, It is common for those that go away from God to find 
 snares where they expected shelters. 

 (2.) They are humbled; they soar upward, proud of their foreign 
 alliances and confiding in them; but <I>I will bring them down,</I> let 
 them fly ever so high, <I>as the fowls of heaven,</I> that are shot 
 flying. Note, God can and will <I>bring those down</I> that <I>exalt 
 themselves as the eagle,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:3,4">Obad. 3, 4</A>.

 (3.) They are made to smart for their folly: <I>I will chastise 
 them.</I> Note, The disappointments we meet with in the creature, when 
 we put a confidence in it, are a necessary chastisement, or discipline, 
 that we may learn to be wiser another time. 

 (4.) In all this the scripture is fulfilled. It is <I>as their
 congregation has heard;</I> they have been many a time told by the word 
 of God, read, and preached, and sung, in their religious assemblies, 
 that "<I>vain is the help of man,</I> that <I>in the son of man there 
 is no help;</I> they have heard both from the law and from the prophets 
 what judgments God would bring upon them for their wickedness; and 
 <I>as they have heard</I> now <I>they shall see,</I> they shall feel." 
 Note, It concerns us to take notice of the word of God which we hear 
 from time to time <I>in the congregation,</I> and to be governed by it, 
 for we must shortly be judged by it; and it will justify God in the 
 condemnation of sinners, and aggravate it to them, that they have had 
 plain public warning given them of it; it is what their congregation 
 has heard many a time, but they would not take warning. "<I>Son, 
 remember</I> thou wast told what would come of it; and now thou seest 
 they were not vain words." See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:6">Zech. i. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. They revolted from God and rebelled against him, notwithstanding the 
 various methods he took to retain them in their allegiance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:13-15"><I>v.</I> 13-15</A>.
 
 Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How kindly and tenderly God had dealt with them, as a gracious 
 sovereign towards a people dear unto him, and whose prosperity he had 
 much at heart. He had <I>redeemed them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 brought them, at first, out of the land of Egypt, and, since, delivered 
 them out of many a distress. He had <I>bound and strengthened their 
 arms,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 When their power was weakened, like an arm broken or out of joint, God 
 set it again, and bound it, as a surgeon does a broken bone, to make it 
 knit. God had given Israel victories over the Syrians 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:16,17">2 Kings xiii. 16, 17</A>),
 
 had <I>restored their coast</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:25,26">2 Kings xiv. 25, 26</A>),

 had <I>girded them with strength for battle.</I> "Though <I>I have
 chastened</I> them" (so the margin reads it), "sometimes corrected them 
 for their faults and thereby taught them, at other times 
 <I>strengthened their arms</I> and relieved them, though I have used 
 both fair means and foul to work upon them, it was all to no purpose; 
 they were mercy-proof and judgment-proof."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How impudent their conduct had been towards him notwithstanding, 
 which is described here for the conviction and humiliation of all those 
 who have gone on in any way of wickedness, that they may see how 
 exceedingly sinful their sin is, how heinous, how the God of heaven 
 interprets it, how he resents it. 

 (1.) He had courted them to him, and taken them into covenant with 
 himself; but <I>they fled from him,</I> as if he had been their 
 dangerous enemy who had always approved himself their faithful friend. 
 They wandered from him, as the silly dove from her nest, for those who 
 forsake God will find no rest nor settlement in the creature, but 
 wander endlessly. They fled from God when they forsook the worship of 
 him, and ran away from his service, and withdrew themselves from their 
 allegiance to him. 

 (2.) He had given them his laws, which were all holy, just, and good, 
 by which he designed to keep them in the right way; but they 
 <I>transgressed against him;</I> they sinned with a high hand and a 
 stiff neck, wilfully and presumptuously (so the words signifies); they 
 broke through the fence of the divine law, and therein thwarted the 
 design of the divine love. 

 (3.) He had made known his truths to them, and given them all possible 
 proofs of the sincerity of his good-will to them; and yet they <I>spoke 
 lies against him.</I> They set up false gods in competition with him; 
 they denied his providence and power; thus they <I>belied the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:12">Jer. v. 12</A>.

 They rejected his messages sent them by his prophets, and said that
 they should have peace, though they went on in sin, directly against 
 what he said. In their hypocritical professions of religion, shows of 
 devotion, and promises of amendment, they lied to the Lord, which he 
 took as lying against him.

 (4.) He was their rightful Lord and King, and had always ruled in Jacob 
 with equity, and for the public good; and yet they <I>rebelled against 
 him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 They not only went off from him, but took up arms against him, would 
 have deposed him if they could and set up another. 

 (5.) He designed well for them, but they <I>imagined mischief against 
 him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 Sin is a mischievous thin; it is mischief against God, for it is 
 treason against his crown and dignity; not that the sinners can do any 
 thing to hurt their Creator (as one of the ancients observes on these 
 words), but <I>what they can they do;</I> and it is so much the worse 
 when it is not done by surprise, or through inadvertency, but 
 designedly and with contrivance. The Jews have a saying, which Dr. 
 Pocock quotes here, <I>The thoughts of transgression are worse than the 
 transgression.</I> The designing of mischief is doing it, in God's 
 account. <I>Compassing and imagining</I> the death of the king is 
 treason by our law. Those that imagine an evil thing, though it prove a 
 vain thing 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1">Ps. ii. 1</A>),

 will be reckoned with for the imagination.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. How they shall be punished for this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Woe unto them! for they have fled from me.</I> Note, Those who flee 
 from God have woes sent after them, and are, without doubt, in a woeful 
 case. The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against them; the word 
 of God says, <I>Woe to them!</I> And observe what follows immediately, 
 <I>Destruction unto them!</I> Note, The woes of God's word have real 
 effects; destruction makes them good. The judgments of his hand shall 
 verify the judgments of his mouth. Those whom he curses, and
 pronounces woeful, they are cursed, they are woeful indeed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Their shows of devotion and reformation were but shows, and in them 
 they did but mock God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They pretended devotion, but it was not sincere, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 When the hand of God had gone forth against them they made some sort of 
 application to him. <I>When he slew them, then they sought him. Lord, 
 in trouble have they visited thee.</I> But it was all in hypocrisy.
 
 (1.) When they were under personal troubles, and called upon God in 
 secret, they were not sincere in that: <I>They have not cried unto me 
 with their heart, when they howled upon their beds.</I> When they were 
 <I>chastened with pain upon their beds,</I> and the <I>multitude of 
 their bones with strong pains,</I> perhaps ill of the wounds they 
 received in war, they cried, and groaned, and complained in the forms 
 of devotion, and, it may be, they used many good words, proper enough 
 for the circumstances they were in; they cried, <I>God help us,</I> 
 and, <I>Lord, look upon us.</I> But they did not <I>cry with their 
 heart,</I> and therefore God reckons it as no crying to him. Moses is 
 said to <I>cry unto God</I> when he spoke not a word, only his heart 
 prayed with faith and fervency, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:15">Exod. xiv. 15</A>.

 These made a great noise, and said a great deal, and yet did not <I>cry
 to God,</I> because their hearts were not <I>right with him,</I> not 
 subjected to his will, devoted to his honour, nor employed in his 
 service. To pray is to <I>lift up the soul</I> to God, this is the 
 essence of prayer. If this be not done, <I>words,</I> though ever so 
 well chosen, <I>are but wind;</I> but, if it be, it is an acceptable 
 prayer, though the <I>groanings cannot be uttered.</I> Note, Those do 
 not pray to God at all that do not pray <I>in the spirit.</I> Nay, God 
 is so far from approving their prayer and accepting it that he calls it 
 <I>howling.</I> Some think it intimates the <I>noisiness</I> of their 
 prayers (they cried to God as they used to cry to Baal, when they 
 thought he must be awakened), or the brutish violent passions which 
 they vented in their prayers; they snarled at the stone, and howled 
 under the whip, but regarded not the hand. Or it denotes that their 
 hypocritical prayers were so far from being pleasing to God that they 
 were offensive to him; he <I>was angry at their prayers.</I> The 
 <I>songs of the temple shall be howlings,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+8:3">Amos viii. 3</A>.

 God will be so far from pitying them that he will justly <I>laugh at
 their calamity,</I> who have so often laughed at his authority.

 (2.) When they were under public troubles, and met together to implore 
 God's favour, in that also they were hypocritical; they <I>assembled 
 themselves,</I> for fashion-sake, because it was usual to <I>call a 
 solemn assembly</I> in times of general mourning, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+2:1">Zeph. ii. 1</A>.

 But it was only to pray <I>for corn and wine</I> that they came
 together, which were the things they wanted, and feared being deprived 
 of by the want of rain, the judgment they now laboured under. They did 
 not pray for the favour or grace of God, that God would give them 
 repentance, pardon their sins, and turn away his wrath, but only that 
 he would not take away from them <I>their corn and wine.</I> Note, 
 Carnal hearts, in their prayers to God, covet temporal mercies only, 
 and dread and deprecate no other but temporal judgments, for they have 
 no sense of any other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They pretended reformation, but neither was that sincere, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 Here is, 

 (1.) The sin of Israel: <I>They return,</I> that is, they make as if
 they would return; they pretend to repent and amend their doings, but 
 they make nothing of it; they do not come home to God nor return to 
 their allegiance, whereas God says 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:1">Jer. iv. 1</A>),

 <I>If thou wilt return, O Israel! return to me;</I> do not only <I>turn
 towards me,</I> but <I>return to me.</I> This dissimulation of theirs 
 makes them like a <I>deceitful bow,</I> which looks as if it were fit 
 for business, and is bent and drawn accordingly, but, when strength 
 comes to be laid to it, either the bow or the string breaks, and the 
 arrow, instead of flying to the mark, drops at the archer's foot. Such 
 were their essays towards repentance and reformation.

 (2.) The sin of the princes of Israel. That which is charged upon them 
 is <I>the rage of their tongue,</I> quarrelling with God and his 
 providence and with all about them when they are crossed. Princes think 
 they may say what they will, and that it is their prerogative to huff 
 and bluster, to curse and rail, and to call names at their pleasure, 
 but let them know there is a God above them that will call them to an 
 account for the <I>rage of their tongues</I> and make <I>their own 
 tongues to fall upon them.</I> 

 (3.) The punishment of Israel and their princes for their sin. As for 
 the princes, they shall <I>fall by the sword</I> either of their 
 enemies or of their own people, some by one and some by the other; and 
 <I>this shall be their derision,</I> this is that for which they shall 
 be derided <I>in the land of Egypt,</I> when they flee to the Egyptians 
 for succour,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Their sin and punishment shall make them a laughing-stock to all about 
 them. Note, Those that are treacherous and deceitful in their dealings 
 with God, and passionate and outrageous in their conduct towards men, 
 will justly be made a derision to their neighbours, for they make 
 themselves ridiculous.</P>
