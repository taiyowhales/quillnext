 God was, in the foregoing chapter, reckoning with the people of Judah, 
 and bringing ruin upon them for their treachery in breaking covenant 
 with him; in this chapter he is reckoning with the king of Judah for 
 his treachery in breaking covenant with the king of Babylon; for when 
 God came to contend with them he found many grounds of his controversy. 
 The thing was now in doing: Zedekiah was practising with the king of
 Egypt underhand for assistance in a treacherous project he had formed
 to shake off the yoke of the king of Babylon, and violate the homage 
 and fealty he had sworn to him. For this God by the prophet here, 

 I. Threatens the ruin of him and his kingdom, by a parable of two
 eagles and a vine 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:1-10">ver. 1-10</A>),

 and the explanation of that parable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:11-21">ver. 11-21</A>.
 
 But, in the close,
 
 II. He promises hereafter to raise the royal family of Judah again, the
 house of David, in the Messiah and his kingdom,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the
 house of Israel;
 &nbsp; 3  And say, Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; A great eagle with great
 wings, long-winged, full of feathers, which had divers colours,
 came unto Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar:
 &nbsp; 4  He cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it
 into a land of traffick; he set it in a city of merchants.
 &nbsp; 5  He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a
 fruitful field; he placed <I>it</I> by great waters, <I>and</I> set it <I>as</I>
 a willow tree.
 &nbsp; 6  And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature,
 whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were
 under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and
 shot forth sprigs.
 &nbsp; 7  There was also another great eagle with great wings and many
 feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend her roots toward him,
 and shot forth her branches toward him, that he might water it by
 the furrows of her plantation.
 &nbsp; 8  It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might
 bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might
 be a goodly vine.
 &nbsp; 9  Say thou, Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Shall it prosper? shall he
 not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof,
 that it wither? it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring,
 even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the
 roots thereof.
 &nbsp; 10  Yea, behold, <I>being</I> planted, shall it prosper? shall it not
 utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? it shall wither
 in the furrows where it grew.
 &nbsp; 11  Moreover the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 12  Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these
 <I>things mean?</I> tell <I>them,</I> Behold, the king of Babylon is come
 to Jerusalem, and hath taken the king thereof, and the princes
 thereof, and led them with him to Babylon;
 &nbsp; 13  And hath taken of the king's seed, and made a covenant with
 him, and hath taken an oath of him: he hath also taken the mighty
 of the land:
 &nbsp; 14  That the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift
 itself up, <I>but</I> that by keeping of his covenant it might stand.
 &nbsp; 15  But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into
 Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he
 prosper? shall he escape that doeth such <I>things?</I> or shall he
 break the covenant, and be delivered?
 &nbsp; 16  <I>As</I> I live, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, surely in the place <I>where</I>
 the king <I>dwelleth</I> that made him king, whose oath he despised,
 and whose covenant he brake, <I>even</I> with him in the midst of
 Babylon he shall die.
 &nbsp; 17  Neither shall Pharaoh with <I>his</I> mighty army and great
 company make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and
 building forts, to cut off many persons:
 &nbsp; 18  Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when,
 lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these <I>things,</I> he
 shall not escape.
 &nbsp; 19  Therefore thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; <I>As</I> I live, surely mine
 oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken,
 even it will I recompense upon his own head.
 &nbsp; 20  And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in
 my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with
 him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me.
 &nbsp; 21  And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the
 sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds:
 and ye shall know that I the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> have spoken <I>it.</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We must take all these verses together, that we may have the parable 
 and the explanation of it at one view before us, because they will 
 illustrate one another. 

 1. The prophet is appointed to <I>put forth a riddle</I> to the
 <I>house of Israel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 not to puzzle them, as Samson's riddle was put forth to the 
 Philistines, not to hide the mind of God from them in obscurity, or to 
 leave them in uncertainty about it, one advancing one conjecture and 
 another another, as is usual in expounding riddles; no, he is 
 immediately to tell them the meaning of it. <I>Let him that speaks in 
 an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:13">1 Cor. xiv. 13</A>.

 But he must deliver this message in a riddle or parable that they might 
 take the more notice of it, might be the more affected with it 
 themselves, and might the better remember it and tell it to others. For 
 these reasons God often used similitudes by his servants the prophets, 
 and Christ himself <I>opened his mouth in parables.</I> Riddles and 
 parables are used for an amusement to ourselves and an entertainment to 
 our friends. The prophet must make use of these to see if in this dress 
 the things of God might find acceptance, and insinuate themselves into 
 the minds of a careless people. Note, Ministers should study to find 
 out acceptable words, and try various methods to do good; and, as far 
 as they have reason to think will be for edification, should both bring 
 that which is familiar into their preaching and their preaching too 
 into their familiar discourse, that there may not be so vast a 
 dissimilitude as with some there is between what they say in the pulpit 
 and what they say out.

 2. He is appointed to expound this riddle to <I>the rebellious
 house,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Though being <I>rebellious</I> they might justly have been left in 
 ignorance, to see and hear and not perceive, yet the thing shall be 
 explained to them: <I>Know you not what these things mean?</I> Those 
 that knew the story, and what was now in agitation, might make a shrewd 
 guess at the meaning of this riddle, but, that they might be left 
 without excuse, he is to give it to them in plain terms, stripped of 
 the metaphor. But the enigma was first propounded for them to study on 
 awhile, and to send to their friends at Jerusalem, that they might 
 enquire after and expect the solution of it some time after.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Let us now see what the matter of this message is.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Nebuchadnezzar had some time ago carried off Jehoiachin, the same 
 that was called <I>Jeconiah,</I> when he was but eighteen years of age 
 and had reigned in Jerusalem but <I>three months,</I> him and his 
 princes and great men, and had brought them captives to Babylon, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:12">2 Kings xxiv. 12</A>.

 This in the parable is represented by an eagle's cropping the top and
 tender branch of <I>a cedar,</I> and carrying it into <I>a land of 
 traffic,</I> a <I>city of merchants</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>),

 which is explained 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 The <I>king of Babylon</I> took the <I>king of Jerusalem,</I> who was 
 no more able to resist him than a young twig of a tree is to contend 
 with the strongest bird of prey, that easily crops it off, perhaps 
 towards the making of <I>her nest.</I> Nebuchadnezzar, in Daniel's 
 vision, is <I>a lion,</I> the king of beasts 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:4">Dan. vii. 4</A>);

 there he has <I>eagle's wings,</I> so swift were his motions, so speedy
 were his conquests. Here, in this parable, he is <I>an eagle,</I> the 
 king of birds, a <I>great eagle,</I> that lives upon spoil and rapine, 
 whose young ones <I>suck up blood,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:30">Job xxxix. 30</A>.

 His dominion extends itself far and wide, like the great and long wings
 of an eagle; the people are numerous, for it is <I>full of 
 feathers;</I> the court is splendid, for it has <I>divers colours,</I> 
 which look like <I>embroidering,</I> as the word is. Jerusalem is 
 Lebanon, a forest of houses, and very pleasant. The royal family is 
 <I>the cedar;</I> Jehoiachin is the <I>top branch,</I> the <I>top of 
 the young twigs,</I> which he crops off. Babylon is the <I>land of 
 traffic</I> and <I>city of merchants</I> where it is set. And the king 
 of Judah, being of the house of David, will think himself much degraded 
 and disgraced to be lodged among tradesmen; but he must make the best 
 of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. When he carried him to Babylon he made his uncle Zedekiah king in 
 his room, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 His name was <I>Mattaniah--the gift of the Lord,</I> which 
 Nebuchadnezzar changed into <I>Zedekiah--the justice of the Lord,</I> 
 to remind him to be just like the God he called his, for fear of his 
 justice. This was <I>one of the seed of the land,</I> a native, not a 
 foreigner, not one of his Babylonian princes; he was <I>planted in a 
 fruitful field,</I> for so Jerusalem as yet was; he <I>placed it by 
 great waters,</I> where it would be likely to grow, like <I>a 
 willow-tree,</I> which grows quickly, and grows best in moist ground, 
 but is never designed nor expected to be a stately tree. He <I>set it 
 with</I> care and <I>circumspection</I> (so some read it); he wisely 
 provided that it might grow, but that it might not grow too big. <I>He 
 took of the king's seed</I> (so it is explained, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)

 and <I>made a covenant with him</I> that he should have the kingdom, 
 and enjoy the regal power and dignity, provided he held it as his 
 vassal, dependent on him and accountable to him. He <I>took an oath of 
 him,</I> made him swear allegiance to him, swear by his own God, the 
 God of Israel, that he would be a faithful tributary to him, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:13">2 Chron. xxxvi. 13</A>.

 He also <I>took away the mighty of the land,</I> the chief of the men
 of war, partly as hostages for the performance of the covenant, and 
 partly that, the land being thereby weakened, the king might be the 
 less able, and therefore the less in temptation, to break his league.
 What he designed we are told

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>That the kingdom might be base,</I> in respect both of honour and 
 strength, might neither be a rival with its powerful neighbours, nor a 
 terror to its feeble ones, as it had been, that <I>it might not left up 
 itself</I> to vie with the kingdom of Babylon, or to bear down any of 
 the petty states that were in subjection to it. But yet he designed 
 that by <I>the keeping of this covenant it might stand,</I> and 
 continue a kingdom. Hereby the pride and ambition of that haughty 
 potentate would be gratified, who aimed to be <I>like the Most High</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:14">Isa. xiv. 14</A>),
 
 to have all about him subject to him. Now see here,

 1. How sad a change sin made with the royal family of Judah. Time was
 when all the nations about were tributaries to that; now that has not 
 only lost its dominion over other nations, but has itself become a 
 tributary. <I>How has the gold become dim!</I> Nations by sin sell 
 their liberty, and princes their dignity, and <I>profane their crowns 
 by casting them to the ground.</I> 

 2. How wisely Zedekiah did for himself in accepting these terms, though 
 they were dishonourable, when necessity brought him to it. A man may 
 live very comfortably and contentedly, though he cannot bear a part, 
 and make a figure, as formerly. A kingdom may stand firmly and safely, 
 though it do not stand so high as it has sometimes done; and so may a 
 family.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Zedekiah, while he continued faithful to the king of Babylon, did 
 very well, and, if he would but have reformed his kingdom, and returned 
 to God and his duty, he would have done better, and by that means might 
 soon have recovered his former dignity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 This plant grew, and though it was <I>set as a willow-tree,</I> and 
 little account was made of it, yet it became <I>a spreading vine of low 
 stature,</I> a great blessing to his own country, and his fruits 
 <I>made glad their hearts;</I> and it is better to be a spreading vine 
 of low stature than a lofty cedar of no use. Nebuchadnezzar was 
 pleased, for <I>the branches turned towards him,</I> and rested on him 
 as the vine on the wall, and he had his share of the fruits of this 
 vine; <I>the roots thereof</I> too were <I>under him,</I> and at his 
 disposal. The Jews had reason to be pleased, for they sat under their 
 own vine, which <I>brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs,</I> 
 and looked pleasant and promising. See how gradually the judgments of 
 God came upon this provoking people, how God gave them respite and so 
 gave them space to repent. He made <I>their kingdom base,</I> to try if 
 that would humble them, before he made it no kingdom; yet left it easy 
 for them, to try if that would win upon them to return to him, that the 
 troubles threatened might be prevented.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Zedekiah knew not when he was well off, but grew impatient of the 
 disgrace of being a tributary to the king of Babylon, and, to get clear 
 of it, entered into a private league with the king of Egypt. He had no 
 reason to complain that the king of Babylon put any new hardships upon 
 him or improved his advantages against him, that he oppressed or 
 impoverished his country, for, as the prophet had said before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 to aggravate his treachery, he shows again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>)

 what a fair way he was in to be considerable: <I>He was planted in a 
 good soil by great waters;</I> his family was likely enough to be built 
 up, and his exchequer to be filled, in a little time, so that, if he 
 had dealt faithfully, he might have been <I>a goodly vine.</I> But 
 there was <I>another great eagle</I> that he had an affection for, and 
 put a confidence in, and that was the <I>king of Egypt,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Those two great potentates, the kings of Babylon and Egypt, were but 
 two great eagles, <I>birds of prey.</I> This great eagle of Egypt is 
 said to have <I>great wings,</I> but not to be <I>long-winged</I> as 
 the king of Babylon, because, though the kingdom of Egypt was strong, 
 yet it was not of such a vast extent as that of Babylon was. The great 
 eagle is said to have <I>many feathers,</I> much wealth and many 
 soldiers, which he depended upon as a substantial defence, but which 
 really were no more than so <I>may feathers.</I> Zedekiah, promising 
 himself liberty, made himself a vassal to the king of Egypt, foolishly 
 expecting ease by changing his master. Now <I>this vine</I> did 
 secretly and under-hand <I>bend her roots towards</I> the king of 
 Egypt, that great eagle, and after awhile did openly <I>shoot forth her 
 branches towards him,</I> give him an intimation how much she coveted 
 an alliance with him, <I>that he might water it by the furrows of her 
 plantation,</I> whereas it was <I>planted by great waters,</I> and did 
 not need any assistance from him. This is expounded, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon in <I>sending his 
 ambassadors into Egypt,</I> that they might <I>give him horses and much 
 people,</I> to enable him to contend with the king of Babylon. See what 
 a change sin had made with the people of God! God promised that they 
 should be a numerous people, as the sand of the sea; yet now, if their 
 king had occasion for <I>much people,</I> he must send to Egypt for 
 them, they being for sin <I>diminished and brought low,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:39">Ps. cvii. 39</A>.

 See also the folly of fretful discontented spirits, that ruin
 themselves by striving to better themselves, whereas they might be easy 
 and happy enough if they would but <I>make the best of that which 
 is.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. God here threatens Zedekiah with the utter destruction of him and 
 his kingdom, and, in displeasure against him, passes that doom upon him 
 for his treacherous revolt from the king of Babylon. This is 
 represented in the parable 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:9,19"><I>v.</I> 9, 19</A>)

 by the <I>plucking up of this vine by the roots, the cutting off of the 
 fruit,</I> and <I>the withering of the leaves,</I> the leaves <I>of her 
 spring,</I> when they are in their greenness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:12">Job viii. 12</A>),

 before they begin in autumn to wither of themselves. The project shall
 be blasted; it shall <I>utterly wither.</I> The affairs of this 
 perfidious prince shall be ruined past retrieve; as a vine when the 
 east wind blasts it, so that it shall be fit for nothing but the fire 
 (as we had it in that parable,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+15:4"><I>ch.</I> xv. 4</A>),

 it shall wither even <I>in the furrows where it grew,</I> though they
 were ever so well watered. It shall be destroyed <I>without great power 
 or many people to pluck it up;</I> for what need is there of raising 
 the militia to pluck up a vine? Note, God can bring great things to 
 pass without much ado. He needs not great power and many people to 
 effect his purposes; a handful will serve if he pleases. He can without 
 any difficulty ruin a sinful king and kingdom, and make no more of it 
 than we do of rooting up a tree that cumbers the ground. In the 
 explanation of the parable the sentence is very largely recorded: 
 <I>Shall be prosper?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Can he expect to do ill and fare well? Nay, shall he that does such
 wicked things <I>escape?</I> Shall he <I>break the covenant, and be 
 delivered</I> from that vengeance which is the just punishment of his 
 treachery? No; can he expect to do ill and not suffer ill? Let him hear 
 his doom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is ratified by the oath of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>As I live, saith the Lord God, he shall die</I> for it. This 
 intimates how highly God resented the crime, and how sure and severe 
 the punishment of it would be. God <I>swears in his wrath,</I> as he 
 did 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:11">Ps. xcv. 11</A>.

 Note, As God's promises are confirmed with an oath, for comfort to the
 saints, so are his threatenings, for terror to the wicked. As sure as 
 God lives and is happy (I may add, and as long), so sure, so long, 
 shall impenitent sinners die and be miserable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It is justified by the heinousness of the crime he had been guilty 
 of. 

 (1.) He had been very ungrateful to his benefactor, who had <I>made him 
 king,</I> and undertook to protect him, had made him a prince when he 
 might as easily have made him a prisoner. Note, It is a sin against God 
 to be unkind to our friends and to lift up the heel against those that 
 have helped to raise us. 

 (2.) He had been very false to him whom he had covenanted with. This is 
 mostly insisted on: He <I>despised the oath.</I> When his conscience or 
 friends reminded him of it he made a jest of it, put on a daring 
 resolution, and <I>broke it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:15,16,18,19"><I>v.</I> 15, 16, 18, 19</A>.

 He broke through it, and took a pride in making nothing of it, as a 
 great tyrant in our own day, whose maxim (they say) it is, <I>That 
 princes ought not to be slaves to their word any further than it is for 
 their interest.</I> That which aggravated Zedekiah's perfidiousness was 
 that the oath by which he had bound himself to the king of Babylon was, 
 
 [1.] A solemn oath. An emphasis is laid upon this

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>When, lo, he had given his hand,</I> as a confederate with the king 
 of Babylon, not only as his subject, but as his friend, the joining of 
 hands being a token of the joining of hearts. 

 [2.] As sacred oath. God says

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 It is <I>my oath</I> that he has despised and <I>my covenant that he 
 has broken.</I> In every solemn oath God is appealed to as a witness of 
 the sincerity of him that swears, and invocated as a judge and revenger 
 of his treachery if he now swear falsely or at any time hereafter break 
 his oath. But the oath of allegiance to a prince is particularly called 
 <I>the oath of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:2">Eccl. viii. 2</A>),

 as if that had something in it more sacred than another oath; for
 princes are <I>ministers of God to us for good,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:4">Rom. xiii. 4</A>.

 Now Zedekiah's breaking this oath and covenant is the sin which God
 will <I>recompense upon his own head</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 the <I>trespass which he has trespassed against God,</I> for which God 
 will <I>plead with him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Note, Perjury is a heinous sin and highly provoking to the God of 
 heaven. It would not serve for an excuse, <I>First,</I> That he who 
 took this oath was a king, a king of the house of David, whose liberty 
 and dignity might surely set him above the obligation of oaths. No; 
 though kings are gods to us, they are men to God, and not exempt from 
 his law and judgment. The prince is doubtless as firmly bound before 
 God to the people by his coronation-oath as the people are to the 
 princes by the oath of allegiance. <I>Secondly,</I> Nor that this oath
 was sworn to the king of Babylon, a heathen prince, worse than a 
 heretic, with whom the church of Rome says, <I>No faith is to be 
 kept.</I> No; though Nebuchadnezzar was a worshipper of false gods, yet 
 the true God will avenge this quarrel when one of his worshippers 
 breaks his league with him; for truth is a debt due to all men; and, if 
 the professors of the true religion deal perfidiously with those of a 
 false religion, their profession will be so far from excusing, much 
 less justifying them, that it aggravates their sin, and God will the 
 more surely and severely punish it, because by it they give occasion to 
 the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme; as that Mahometan prince, who, 
 when the Christians broke their league with him, cried out, <I>O Jesus! 
 are these thy Christians? Thirdly,</I> Nor would it justify him that
 the oath was extorted from him by a conqueror, for the covenant was 
 made upon a valuable consideration. He held his life and crown upon 
 this condition, that he should be faithful and bear true allegiance to 
 the king of Babylon; and, if he enjoy the benefit of his bargain, it is 
 very unjust if he do not observe the terms. Let him know then that, 
 having <I>despised the oath,</I> and <I>broken the covenant,</I> he 
 <I>shall not escape.</I> And if the contempt and violation of such an 
 oath, such a covenant as this, would be so punished, of how much sorer 
 punishment shall those be thought worthy who break covenant with God 
 (when, <I>lo, they had given their hand</I> upon it that they would be 
 faithful), who <I>tread under foot the blood</I> of that 
 <I>covenant</I> as an unholy thing? Between the covenants there is no 
 comparison.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. It is particularized in divers instances, wherein the punishment is 
 made to answer the sin. 

 (1.) He had rebelled against the king of Babylon, and the king of 
 Babylon should be his effectual conqueror. In the place where that king 
 <I>dwells</I> whose <I>covenant he broke,</I> even <I>with him in the 
 midst of Babylon he shall die,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 He thinks to get out of his hands, but he shall fall, more than before, 
 into his hands. God himself will now take part with the king of Babylon 
 against him: <I>I will spread my net upon him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 God has a net for those who deal perfidiously and think to escape his 
 righteous judgments, in which those shall be taken and held who would 
 not be held by the bond of an oath and covenant. Zedekiah dreaded 
 Babylon: "Thither I will bring him," says God, "and <I>plead with him 
 there.</I>" Men will justly be forced upon that calamity which they 
 endeavour by sin to flee from. 

 (2.) He had <I>relied upon the king of Egypt,</I> and the king of Egypt 
 should be his ineffectual helper: <I>Pharaoh with his mighty army shall 
 not make for him in the war</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 shall to him no service, nor give any check to the progress of the 
 Chaldean forces; he shall not assist him in the <I>siege</I> by 
 <I>casting up mounts and building forts,</I> nor in battle by 
 <I>cutting off many person.</I> Note, Every creature is that to us 
 which God makes it to be; and he commonly weakens and withers that 
 <I>arm of flesh</I> which we trust in and stay ourselves upon. Now was 
 again fulfilled what was spoken on a former similar occasion 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:7">Isa. xxx. 7</A>),

 <I>The Egyptians shall help in vain.</I> They did so; for though, upon
 the approach of the Egyptian army, the Chaldeans withdrew from the 
 siege of Jerusalem, upon their retreat they returned to it again and 
 took it. It should seem, the Egyptians were not hearty, had strength 
 enough, but no good-will, to help Zedekiah. Note, Those who deal 
 treacherously with those who put a confidence in them will justly be 
 dealt treacherously with by those they put a confidence in. Yet the
 Egyptians were not the only states Zedekiah stayed himself upon; he had 
 bands of his own to stand by him, but those bands, though we may 
 suppose they were veteran troops and the best soldiers his kingdom 
 afforded, shall become <I>fugitives,</I> shall quit their posts, and 
 make the best of their way, and shall <I>fall by the sword</I> of the 
 enemy, and the <I>remains of them shall be scattered,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 This was fulfilled <I>when the city was broken up and all the men of
 war fled,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:7">Jer. lii. 7</A>.

 This <I>you shall now that I the Lord have spoken it.</I> Note, Sooner 
 or later God's word will prove itself; and those who will not believe 
 shall find by experience the reality and weight of it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>22  Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; I will also take of the highest
 branch of the high cedar, and will set <I>it;</I> I will crop off from
 the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant <I>it</I> upon
 a high mountain and eminent:
 &nbsp; 23  In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and
 it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly
 cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the
 shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.
 &nbsp; 24  And all the trees of the field shall know that I the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have
 dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish:
 I the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> have spoken and have done <I>it.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When the royal family of Judah was brought to desolation by the 
 captivity of Jehoiachin and Zedekiah it might be asked, "What has now 
 become of the covenant of royalty made with David, that <I>his children 
 should sit upon his throne for evermore?</I> Do the <I>sure mercies of 
 David</I> prove thus unsure?" To this it is sufficient for the 
 silencing of the objectors to answer that the promise was conditional. 
 If <I>they will keep my covenant,</I> then they shall continue, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:12">Ps. cxxxii. 12</A>.

 But David's posterity broke the condition, and so forfeited the
 promise. But the unbelief of man shall not invalidate the promise of 
 God. He will find out another <I>seed of David</I> in which it shall be 
 accomplished; and that is promised in these verses.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The house of David shall again be magnified, and out of its ashes 
 another phoenix shall arise. The metaphor of a tree, which was made us 
 of in the threatening, is here presented in the promise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>.
 
 This promise had its accomplishment in part when Zerubbabel, a branch 
 of the house of David, was raised up to head the Jews in their return 
 out of captivity, and to rebuild the city and temple and re-establish 
 their church and state; but it was to have its full accomplishment in 
 the kingdom of the Messiah, who was a root out of a dry ground, and to 
 whom God, according to promise, gave <I>the throne of his father 
 David,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:32">Luke i. 32</A>.

 1. God himself undertakes the reviving and restoring of the house of
 David. Nebuchadnezzar was the <I>great eagle</I> that had attempted the 
 re-establishing of the house of David in a dependence upon him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 But the attempt miscarried; his plantation withered and was plucked up. 
 "Well," says God, "the next shall be of my planting: <I>I will also 
 take of the highest branch of the high cedar and I will set it.</I>" 
 Note, As men have their designs, God also has his designs; but his will 
 prosper when theirs are blasted. Nebuchadnezzar prided himself in
 setting up kingdoms at his pleasure, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:19">Dan. v. 19</A>.

 But those kingdoms soon had an end, whereas the <I>God of heaven sets
 up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:44">Dan. ii. 44</A>.

 2. The house of David is revived in a <I>tender one cropped from the 
 top of his young twigs.</I> Zerubbabel was so; that which was hopeful 
 in him was but the <I>day of small things</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:10">Zech. iv. 10</A>),

 yet before him <I>great mountains</I> were <I>made plain.</I> Our Lord
 Jesus was <I>the highest branch of the high cedar,</I> the furthest of 
 all from <I>the root</I> (for soon after he appeared the <I>house of 
 David</I> was all cut off and extinguished), but the nearest of all to 
 heaven, for his kingdom was not of this world. He was <I>taken from the 
 top of the young twigs,</I> for he is <I>the man, the branch, a 
 tender</I> plant, and a <I>root out of a dry ground</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:2">Isa. liii. 2</A>),

 but a <I>branch of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he may
 be glorified.</I>

 3. This branch is planted <I>in a high mountain</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 in the <I>mountain of the height of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Thither he brought Zerubbabel in triumph; there he raised up his son 
 Jesus, sent him to gather the <I>lost sheep of the house of Israel</I> 
 that were <I>scattered upon the mountains,</I> set him <I>his king</I> 
 upon <I>his holy hill of Zion,</I> sent forth the gospel from <I>Mount 
 Zion, the word of the Lord from Jerusalem;</I> there, in the <I>height 
 of Israel,</I> a nation which all its neighbours had an eye upon as 
 conspicuous and illustrious, was the Christian church first planted.
 The churches of Judea were the most primitive churches. The unbelieving 
 Jews did what they could to prevent its being planted there; but who 
 can pluck up what God will plant? 

 4. Thence it spreads far and wide. The Jewish state, though it began
 very low in Zerubbabel's time, was set as a tender branch, which might 
 easily be plucked up, yet took root, spread strangely, and after some 
 time became very considerable; those of other nations, <I>fowl of every 
 wing,</I> put themselves under the protection of it. The Christian 
 church was at first like a grain of mustard-seed, but became, like this 
 tender branch, a great tree, its beginning small, but its latter end 
 increasing to admiration. When the Gentiles flocked into the church 
 then did the <I>fowl of every wing</I> (even the birds of prey, which 
 those preyed upon, as the <I>wolf and the lamb</I> feeding together, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:6">Isa. xi. 6</A>)

 come and <I>dwell under the shadow of this goodly cedar.</I> See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:21">Dan. iv. 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God himself will herein be glorified, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 The setting up of the Messiah's kingdom in the world shall discover 
 more clearly than ever to the children of men that <I>God is the King 
 of all the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+47:7">Ps. xlvii. 7</A>.

 Never was there a more full conviction given of this truth, that all
 things are governed by an infinitely wise and mighty Providence, than 
 that which was given by the exaltation of Christ and the establishment 
 of his kingdom among men; for by that it appeared that God has all 
 hearts in his hand, and the sovereign disposal of all affairs. <I>All 
 the trees of the field shall know,</I>

 1. That the tree which God will have to be <I>brought down,</I> and
 <I>dried up,</I> shall be so, though it be ever so high and stately, 
 ever so green and flourishing. Neither honour nor wealth, neither 
 external advancements nor internal endowments, will secure men from 
 humbling withering providence. 

 2. That the tree which God will have to be exalted, and to flourish, 
 shall so be, shall so do, though ever so low, and ever so dry. The 
 house of Nebuchadnezzar, that now makes so great a figure, shall be 
 extirpated, and the house of David, that now makes so mean a figure, 
 shall become famous again; and the Jewish nation, that is now 
 despicable, shall be considerable. The kingdom of Satan, that has borne 
 so long, so large, a sway, shall be broken, and the kingdom of Christ, 
 that was looked upon with contempt, shall be established. The Jews,
 who, in respect of church-privileges, had been high and green, shall be 
 thrown out, and the Gentiles, who had been low and dry trees, shall be 
 taken in their room, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:1">Isa. liv. 1</A>.

 All the enemies of Christ shall be abased and made his footstool, and
 his interests shall be confirmed and advanced: <I>I the Lord have 
 spoken</I> (it is the decree, the declared decree, that Christ must be 
 exalted, must be the headstone of the corner), and <I>I have done 
 it,</I> that is, I will do it in due time, but it is as sure to be done 
 as if it were done already. With men <I>saying and doing are two 
 things,</I> but they are not so with God. What he has spoken we may be
 sure that he will do, nor shall one iota or tittle of his word fall to 
 the ground, for <I>he is not a man, that he should lie, or the son of 
 man, that he should repent</I> either of his threatenings or of his 
 promises.</P>
