 The angel Gabriel, in this chapter, performs his promise made to Daniel 
 in the foregoing chapter, that he would "show him what should befal his 
 people in the latter days," according to that which was "written in the 
 scriptures of truth:" very particularly does he here foretel the
 succession of the kings of Persia and Grecia, and the affairs of their 
 kingdoms, especially the mischief which Antiochus Epiphanes did in his 
 time to the church, which was foretold before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:11-12"><I>ch.</I> viii. 11-12</A>).

 Here is, 

 I. A brief prediction of the setting up of the Grecian monarchy upon
 the ruins of the Persian monarchy, which was now newly begun, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.
 
 II. A prediction of the affairs of the two kingdoms of Egypt and Syria,
 with reference to each other, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:5-20">ver. 5-20</A>.

 III. Of the rise of Antiochus Epiphanes, and his actions and successes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:21-29">ver. 21-29</A>.

 IV. Of the great mischief that he should do to the Jewish nation and 
 religion, and his contempt of all religion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:30-39">ver. 30-39</A>.

 V. Of his fall and ruin at last, when he is in the heat of his pursuit,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, <I>even</I> I, stood
 to confirm and to strengthen him.
 &nbsp; 2  And now will I show thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand
 up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer
 than <I>they</I> all: and by his strength through his riches he shall
 stir up all against the realm of Grecia.
 &nbsp; 3  And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great
 dominion, and do according to his will.
 &nbsp; 4  And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and
 shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his
 posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his
 kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 1. The angel Gabriel lets Daniel know the good service he has done to
 the Jewish nation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 "<I>In the first year of Darius the Mede,</I> who destroyed Babylon and 
 released the Jews out of that house of bondage, <I>I stood a strength 
 and fortress to him,</I> that is, I was instrumental to protect him, 
 and give him success in his ward, and, after he had conquered Babylon, 
 to confirm him in his resolution to release the Jews," which, it is 
 likely, met with much opposition. Thus by the angel, and at the request 
 of <I>the watcher,</I> the golden head was broken, and the axe laid to 
 the root of the tree. Note, We must acknowledge the hand of God in the 
 strengthening of those that are friends to the church for the service 
 they are to do it, and confirming them in their good resolutions; 
 herein he uses the ministry of angels more than we are aware of. And 
 the many instances we have known of God's care of his church formerly 
 encourage us to depend upon him in further straits and difficulties. 

 2. He foretels the reign of four Persian kings

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>Now I will tell thee the truth,</I> that is, the true meaning of the 
 visions of the great image, and of the four beasts, and expound in 
 plain terms what was before represented by dark types. 

 (1.) There shall stand up <I>three kings in Persia,</I> besides Darius, 
 in whose reign this prophecy is dated,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:1"><I>ch.</I> ix. 1</A>.

 Mr. Broughton makes these three to be Cyrus, Artaxasta or Artaxerxes,
 called by the Greeks <I>Cambyses,</I> and Ahasuerus that married 
 Esther, called <I>Darius son of Hystaspes.</I> To these three the 
 Persians gave these attributes--Cyrus was a father, Cambyses a master, 
 and Darius a hoarder up. So Herodotus. 

 (2.) There shall be a fourth, <I>far richer than they all,</I> that is, 
 Xerxes, of whose wealth the Greek authors take notice. By <I>his 
 strength</I> (his vast army, consisting of 800,000 men at least) and 
 <I>his riches,</I> with which he maintained and paid that vast army, he 
 <I>stirred up all</I> against <I>the realm of Greece.</I> Xerxes's 
 expedition against Greece is famous in history, and the shameful defeat 
 that he met with. He who when he went out was the terror of Greece in 
 his return was the scorn of Greece. Daniel needed not to be told what 
 disappointment he would meet with, for he was a hinderer of the 
 building of the temple; but soon after, about thirty years after the 
 first return from captivity, Darius, a young king, revived the building 
 of the temple, owning the hand of God against his predecessors for 
 hindering it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:7">Ezra vi. 7</A>.

 3. He foretels Alexander's conquests and the partition of his kingdom,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 He is that <I>mighty king</I> that shall <I>stand up</I> against the 
 kings of Persia, and he shall <I>rule with great dominion,</I> over 
 many kingdoms, and with a despotic power, for he shall <I>do according 
 to his will,</I> and undo likewise, which, by the law of the Medes and 
 Persians, their kings could not. When Alexander, after he had conquered 
 Asia, would be worshipped as a god, then this was fulfilled, that he 
 shall <I>do according to his will.</I> That is God's prerogative, but 
 was his pretension. But 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)

 his <I>kingdom</I> shall soon be <I>broken,</I> and <I>divided</I> into 
 four parts, <I>but not to his posterity,</I> nor shall any of his 
 successors reign <I>according to his dominion;</I> none of them shall 
 have such large territories nor such an absolute power. His <I>kingdom 
 was plucked up for others besides those</I> of his own family. Arideus, 
 his brother, was made king in Macedonia; Olympias, Alexander's mother, 
 killed him, and poisoned Alexander's two sons, Hercules and Alexander. 
 Thus was his family rooted out by its own hands. See what decaying 
 perishing things worldly pomp and possessions are, and the powers by 
 which they are got. Never was the vanity of the world and its greatest
 things shown more evidently than in the story of Alexander. <I>All is 
 vanity and vexation of spirit.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  And the king of the south shall be strong, and <I>one</I> of his
 princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his
 dominion <I>shall be</I> a great dominion.
 &nbsp; 6  And in the end of years they shall join themselves together;
 for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of
 the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the
 power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she
 shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat
 her, and he that strengthened her in <I>these</I> times.
 &nbsp; 7  But out of a branch of her roots shall <I>one</I> stand up in his
 estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the
 fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them,
 and shall prevail:
 &nbsp; 8  And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with
 their princes, <I>and</I> with their precious vessels of silver and of
 gold; and he shall continue <I>more</I> years than the king of the
 north.
 &nbsp; 9  So the king of the south shall come into <I>his</I> kingdom, and
 shall return into his own land.
 &nbsp; 10  But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a
 multitude of great forces: and <I>one</I> shall certainly come, and
 overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred
 up, <I>even</I> to his fortress.
 &nbsp; 11  And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and
 shall come forth and fight with him, <I>even</I> with the king of the
 north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the
 multitude shall be given into his hand.
 &nbsp; 12  <I>And</I> when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall
 be lifted up; and he shall cast down <I>many</I> ten thousands: but he
 shall not be strengthened <I>by it.</I>
 &nbsp; 13  For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth
 a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come
 after certain years with a great army and with much riches.
 &nbsp; 14  And in those times there shall many stand up against the
 king of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt
 themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall.
 &nbsp; 15  So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount,
 and take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall
 not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither <I>shall there be
 any</I> strength to withstand.
 &nbsp; 16  But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own
 will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the
 glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.
 &nbsp; 17  He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his
 whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and
 he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she
 shall not stand <I>on his side,</I> neither be for him.
 &nbsp; 18  After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall
 take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the
 reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he
 shall cause <I>it</I> to turn upon him.
 &nbsp; 19  Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land:
 but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.
 &nbsp; 20  Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes <I>in</I> the
 glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed,
 neither in anger, nor in battle.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here are foretold,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The rise and power of two great kingdoms out of the remains of 
 Alexander's conquests, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 1. The kingdom of Egypt, which was made considerable by Ptolem&aelig;us 
 Lagus, one of Alexander's captains, whose successors were, from him, 
 called the <I>Lagid&aelig;.</I> He is called the king of the 
 <I>south,</I> that is, Egypt, named here, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:8,42,43"><I>v.</I> 8, 42, 43</A>.

 The countries that at first belonged to Ptolemy are reckoned to be 
 Egypt, Ph&oelig;nicia, Arabia, Libya, Ethiopia, &c. Theocr. Idyl. 17.

 2. The kingdom of Syria, which was set up by Seleucus Nicanor, or the 
 <I>conqueror;</I> he was one of Alexander's princes, and became 
 stronger than the other, and <I>had the greatest dominion of all,</I> 
 was the most powerful of all Alexander's successors. It was said that 
 he had no fewer than seven-two kingdoms under him. Both these were 
 strong against Judah (the affairs of which are particularly eyed in 
 this prediction); Ptolemy, soon after he gained Egypt, invaded Judea, 
 and took Jerusalem <I>on a sabbath,</I> pretending a friendly visit.
 Seleucus also gave disturbance to Judea.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The fruitless attempt to unite these two kingdoms as iron and clay 
 in Nebuchadnezzar's image 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>At the end of certain years,</I> about seventy after Alexander's 
 death, the Lagid&aelig; and the Seleucid&aelig; shall associate, but 
 not in sincerity. Ptolemy Philadelphus, king of Egypt, shall marry his
 daughter Berenice to Antiochus Theos, king of Syria," who had already a 
 wife called <I>Laodice.</I> "Berenice shall come to the <I>king of the 
 north,</I> to make an agreement, but it shall not hold: <I>She shall 
 not retain the power of the arm;</I> neither she nor her posterity 
 shall establish themselves in the kingdom of the north, neither shall 
 Ptolemy her father, nor Antiochus her husband (between whom there was 
 to be a great alliance), <I>stand,</I> nor their arm, but <I>she shall 
 be given up and those that brought her,</I>" all that projected that 
 unhappy marriage between her and Antiochus, which occasioned so much 
 mischief, instead of producing a coalition between the northern and 
 southern crowns, as was hoped. Antiochus divorced Berenice, took his
 former wife Laodice again, who soon after poisoned him, procured 
 Berenice and her son to be murdered, and set up her own son by 
 Antiochus to be king, who was called <I>Seleucus Callinicus.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A war between the two kingdoms, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 A branch from the same root with Berenice <I>shall stand up in his 
 estate.</I> Ptolem&aelig;us Euergetes, the son and successor of 
 Ptolem&aelig;us Philadelphus, shall come with an army against Seleucus 
 Callinicus, king of Syria, to avenge his sister's quarrel, and shall 
 prevail; and he shall carry away a rich booty both of persons and goods 
 into Egypt, and shall <I>continue more years than the king of the 
 north.</I> This Ptolemy reigned forty-six years; and Justin says that 
 if his own affairs had not called him home he would, in this war, have 
 made himself master of the whole kingdom of Syria. But 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 he shall be forced to <I>come into his kingdom</I> and <I>return into 
 his own land,</I> to keep peace there, so that he can no longer carry 
 on the war abroad. Note, It is very common for a treacherous peace to 
 end in a bloody war.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The long and busy reign of <I>Antiochus the Great,</I> king of 
 Syria. Seleucus Callinicus, that king of the north that was overcome 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>)

 and died miserably, left two sons, Seleucus and Antiochus; these are 
 his sons, the sons of the <I>king of the north,</I> that shall be 
 <I>stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces,</I> to 
 recover what their father had lost, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 But Seleucus the elder, being weak, and unable to rule his army, was 
 poisoned by his friends, and reigned only two years; and his brother 
 Antiochus succeeded him, who reigned thirty-seven years, and was called 
 <I>the Great.</I> And therefore the angel, though he speaks of 
 <I>sons</I> at first, goes on with the account of <I>one only,</I> who 
 was but fifteen years old when he began to reign, and he shall 
 <I>certainly come, and overflow,</I> and <I>over-run,</I> and shall 
 <I>be restored</I> at length to what his father lost. 

 1. The <I>king of the south,</I> in this war, shall at first have very
 great success. Ptolem&aelig;us Philopater, moved with indignation at
 the indignities done by <I>Antiochus the Great,</I> shall (though 
 otherwise a slothful prince) <I>come forth, and fight with him,</I> and 
 shall bring a vast army into the field of 70,000 foot, and 5000 horse, 
 and seventy-three elephants. And the <I>other multitude</I> (the army 
 of Antiochus, consisting of 62,000 foot, and 6000 horse, and 102 
 elephants) shall <I>be given into his hand.</I> Polybius, who lived 
 with Scipio, has given a particular account of this battle of Raphia. 
 Ptolem&aelig;us Philopater, having gained this victory, grew very 
 insolent; <I>his heart was lifted up;</I> then he went into the temple 
 of God at Jerusalem, and, in defiance of the law, entered the most holy 
 place, for which God has a controversy with him, so that, though he 
 shall <I>cast down many myriads,</I> yet he shall <I>not be 
 strengthened by it,</I> so as to secure his interest. For, 

 2. The <I>king of the north, Antiochus the Great,</I> shall
 <I>return</I> with a <I>greater army</I> than <I>the former;</I> and, 
 at the <I>end of times (that is, years</I>) he shall <I>come with a 
 mighty army, and great riches,</I> against the <I>king of the 
 south,</I> that is, Ptolem&aelig;us Epiphanes, who succeeded 
 Ptolem&aelig;us Philopater his father, when he was a child, which gave 
 advantage to Antiochus the Great. In this expedition he had some 
 powerful allies

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>Many shall stand up against the king of the south.</I> Philip of 
 Macedon was confederate with Antiochus against the king of Egypt, and 
 Scopas his general, whom he sent into Syria; Antiochus routed him, 
 destroyed a great part of his army; whereupon the Jews willingly 
 yielded to Antiochus, joined with him, helped him to besiege 
 Ptolem&aelig;us's garrisons. They <I>the robbers of thy people shall 
 exalt themselves to establish the vision,</I> to help forward the 
 accomplishment of this prophecy; but <I>they shall fall, and shall come 
 to nothing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 
 Hereupon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 the <I>king of the north,</I> this same Antiochus Magnus, shall carry 
 on his design against the king of the south another way. 

 (1.) He shall surprise his strong-holds; all that he has got in Syria 
 and Samaria, and the arms of the south, all the power of the king of 
 Egypt, shall not be able to withstand him. See how dubious and variable 
 the turns of the scale of war are; like buying and selling, it is 
 winning and losing; sometimes one side gets the better and sometimes 
 the other; yet neither by chance; it is not, as they call it, the 
 <I>fortune of war,</I> but according to the will and counsel of God, 
 who brings some low and raises others up. 

 (2.) He shall make himself master of the land of Judea

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>He that comes against him</I> (that is, the king of the north) shall 
 carry all before him and do what he pleases, and <I>he shall stand</I> 
 and get footing <I>in the glorious land;</I> so the land of Israel was, 
 and <I>by his hand</I> it was wasted and consumed, for with the spoil 
 of that good land he victualled his vast army. The land of Judea lay 
 between these two potent kingdoms of Egypt and Syria, so that in all 
 the struggles between them that was sure to suffer, for to it they both 
 bore <I>ill will.</I> Yet some read this, <I>By his hand it shall be 
 perfected;</I> as if it intimated that the land of Judea, being taken 
 under the protection of this Antiochus, shall flourish, and be in 
 better condition than it had been. 

 (3.) He shall still push on his war against the king of Egypt, and 
 <I>set his face</I> to <I>enter with the strength of his whole 
 kingdom,</I> taking advantage of the infancy of Ptolemy Epiphanes, and 
 the <I>upright ones,</I> many of the pious Israelites, siding with him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 In prosecution of his design, he shall give him his daughter Cleopatra 
 to wife, designing, as Saul in giving his daughter Cleopatra to David, 
 that she should be a <I>snare to him,</I> and do him a mischief; but 
 she <I>shall not stand on her father's</I> side, nor be <I>for him,</I> 
 but for her husband, and so that plot failed him. 

 (4.) His war with the Romans is here foretold

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 He shall <I>turn his face to the isles</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 the isles of the Gentiles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:5">Gen. x. 5</A>),

 Greece and Italy. He took many of the isles about the
 Hellespont-Rhodes, Samos, Delos, &c., which by war or treaty he made 
 himself master of; but a <I>prince,</I> or <I>state</I> (so some), even 
 the Roman senate, or a <I>leader,</I> even the Roman general, shall 
 <I>return his reproach</I> with which he abused the Romans <I>upon 
 himself,</I> or shall <I>make his shame rest on himself,</I> and 
 <I>without his own shame,</I> or any disgrace to himself, shall <I>pay 
 him again.</I> This was fulfilled when the two Scipios were sent with 
 an army against Antiochus. Hannibal was then with him, and advised him 
 to invade Italy and waste it as he had done; but he did not take hid 
 advice; and Scipio joined battle with him, and gave him a total defeat, 
 though Antiochus had 70,000 men and the Romans but 30,000. Thus he 
 caused the <I>reproach offered by him to cease.</I>

 (5.) His fall. When he was totally routed by the Romans, and was
 forced to abandon to them all he had in Europe, and had a very heavy 
 tribute exacted from him, he <I>turned to his own land,</I> and, not 
 knowing which way to raise money to pay his tribute, he plundered a 
 temple of Jupiter, which so incensed his own subjects against him that 
 they set upon him, and killed him; so he was overthrown, and 
 <I>fell,</I> and <I>was no more found,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 (6.) His next successor, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 There rose up one in his place, a <I>raiser of taxes,</I> a <I>sender 
 forth of the extortioner,</I> or extorter. This character was 
 remarkably answered in Seleucus Philopater, the elder son of Antiochus 
 the Great, who was a great oppressor of his own subjects, and exacted 
 abundance of money from them; and, when he was told he would thereby 
 lose his friends, he said he knew no better friend he had then 
 <I>money.</I> He likewise attempted to rob the temple at Jerusalem, 
 which this seems especially to refer to. But <I>within a few days he 
 shall be destroyed, neither in anger nor in battle,</I> but poisoned by 
 Heliodorus, one of his own servants, when he had reigned but twelve 
 years, and done nothing remarkable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. From all this let us learn, 

 1. That God in his providence sets up one, and pulls down another, as
 he pleases, advances some from low beginnings and depresses others that 
 were very high. Some have called great men the <I>foot-balls of 
 fortune;</I> or, rather, they are the <I>tools of Providence.</I> 

 2. This world is full of <I>wars and fightings,</I> which come <I>from
 men's lusts,</I> and make it a theatre of sin and misery. 

 3. All the changes and revolutions of states and kingdoms, and every
 event, even the most minute and contingent, were plainly and perfectly 
 foreseen by the God of heaven, and to him nothing is <I>new.</I> 

 4. No word of God shall fall to the ground; but what he has designed,
 what he has declared, shall infallibly come to pass; and even the sins 
 of men shall be made to serve his purpose, and contribute to the b 
 ringing of his counsels to birth in their season; and yet <I>God is not 
 the author of sin.</I> 

 5. That, for the right understanding of some parts of scripture, it is
 necessary that heathen authors be consulted, which give light to the 
 scripture, and show the accomplishment of what is there foretold; we 
 have therefore reason to bless God for the human learning with which 
 many have done great service to divine truths.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they
 shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in
 peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.
 &nbsp; 22  And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from
 before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the
 covenant.
 &nbsp; 23  And after the league <I>made</I> with him he shall work
 deceitfully: for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a
 small people.
 &nbsp; 24  He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the
 province; and he shall do <I>that</I> which his fathers have not done,
 nor his fathers' fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey,
 and spoil, and riches: <I>yea,</I> and he shall forecast his devices
 against the strong holds, even for a time.
 &nbsp; 25  And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the
 king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south
 shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army;
 but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against
 him.
 &nbsp; 26  Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy
 him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain.
 &nbsp; 27  And both these kings' hearts <I>shall be</I> to do mischief, and
 they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for
 yet the end <I>shall be</I> at the time appointed.
 &nbsp; 28  Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and
 his heart <I>shall be</I> against the holy covenant; and he shall do
 <I>exploits,</I> and return to his own land.
 &nbsp; 29  At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the
 south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.
 &nbsp; 30  For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore
 he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the
 holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have
 intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.
 &nbsp; 31  And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the
 sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily <I>sacrifice,</I>
 and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.
 &nbsp; 32  And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he
 corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God
 shall be strong, and do <I>exploits.</I>
 &nbsp; 33  And they that understand among the people shall instruct
 many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by
 captivity, and by spoil, <I>many</I> days.
 &nbsp; 34  Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little
 help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.
 &nbsp; 35  And <I>some</I> of them of understanding shall fall, to try them,
 and to purge, and to make <I>them</I> white, <I>even</I> to the time of the
 end: because <I>it is</I> yet for a time appointed.
 &nbsp; 36  And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall
 exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall
 speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall
 prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is
 determined shall be done.
 &nbsp; 37  Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the
 desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself
 above all.
 &nbsp; 38  But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a
 god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and
 silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.
 &nbsp; 39  Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange
 god, whom he shall acknowledge <I>and</I> increase with glory: and he
 shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for
 gain.
 &nbsp; 40  And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push
 at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a
 whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships;
 and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and
 pass over.
 &nbsp; 41  He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many
 <I>countries</I> shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of
 his hand, <I>even</I> Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of
 Ammon.
 &nbsp; 42  He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and
 the land of Egypt shall not escape.
 &nbsp; 43  But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of
 silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the
 Libyans and the Ethiopians <I>shall be</I> at his steps.
 &nbsp; 44  But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall
 trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to
 destroy, and utterly to make away many.
 &nbsp; 45  And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the
 seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end,
 and none shall help him.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 All this is a prophecy of the reign of Antiochus Epiphanes, the 
 <I>little horn</I> spoken of before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:9"><I>ch.</I> viii. 9</A>)

 a sworn enemy to the Jewish religion, and a bitter persecutor of those
 that adhered to it. What troubles the Jews met with in the reigns of
 the Persian kings were not so particularly foretold to Daniel as these, 
 because then they had living prophets with them, Haggai and Zechariah, 
 to encourage them; but these troubles in the days of Antiochus were 
 foretold, because, before that time, prophecy would cease, and they 
 would find it necessary to have recourse to the written word. Some 
 things in this prediction concerning Antiochus are alluded to in the 
 New-Testament predictions of the antichrist, especially 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:36,37"><I>v.</I> 36, 37</A>.

 And as it is usual with the prophets, when they foretel the prosperity 
 of the Jewish church, to make use of such expressions as were 
 applicable to the <I>kingdom of Christ,</I> and insensibly to slide 
 into a prophecy of that, so, when they foretel the troubles of the 
 church, they make use of such expressions as have a further reference 
 to the kingdom of the antichrist, the rise and ruin of that. Now 
 concerning Antiochus, the angel foretels here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His character: He shall be a <I>vile person.</I> He called himself 
 <I>Epiphanes--the illustrious,</I> but his character was the reverse of
 his surname. The heathen writers describe him to be an 
 <I>odd-humoured</I> man, rude and boisterous, base and sordid. He would 
 sometimes steal out of the court into the city, and herd with any 
 infamous company <I>incognito--in disguise</I> he made himself a
 companion of the common sort, and of the basest strangers that came to 
 town. He had the most unaccountable whims, so that some took him to be 
 silly, others to be mad. Hence he was called <I>Epimanes--the
 madman.</I> He is called a <I>vile person,</I> for he had been a long 
 time a hostage at Rome for the fidelity of his father when the Romans 
 had subdued him; and it was agreed that, when the other hostages were 
 exchanged, he should continue a prisoner at large.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His accession to the crown. By a trick he got his elder brother's 
 son, Demetrius, to be sent a hostage to Rome, in exchange for him, 
 contrary to the cartel; and, his elder brother being made away with by 
 Heliodorus 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 he took the kingdom. The states of Syria did not <I>give it</I> to
 <I>him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 because they knew it belonged to his elder brother's son, nor did he 
 get it by the sword, but <I>came in peaceably,</I> pretending to reign 
 for his brother's son, Demetrius, then a hostage at Rome. But with the 
 help of Eumenes and Attalus, neighbouring princes, he gained an 
 interest in the people, and <I>by flatteries obtained the kingdom,</I> 
 established himself in it, and crushed Heliodorus, who made head 
 against him <I>with the arms of a flood;</I> those that opposed him 
 were <I>overflown</I> and <I>broken before him,</I> even <I>the prince 
 of the covenant,</I> his nephew, the rightful heir, whom he pretended 
 to covenant with that he would resign to him whenever he should return, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 But 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>)

 <I>after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully,</I> as one 
 whose avowed maxim it is that princes ought not to be bound by their 
 word any longer than it is for their interest. And <I>with a small 
 people,</I> that at first cleave to him, he shall <I>become strong,</I> 
 and 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>)

 <I>he shall enter peaceably upon the fattest places</I> of the kingdom 
 of Syria, and, very unlike his predecessors, shall <I>scatter</I> among 
 the people the <I>prey, and the spoil, and riches,</I> to insinuate 
 himself into their affections; but, at the same time, he shall 
 <I>forecast his devices against the strong-holds,</I> to make himself 
 master of them, so that his generosity shall last but for a time; when 
 he has got the garrisons into his hands he will scatter his spoil no 
 more, but rule by force, as those commonly do that come in by fraud. He 
 that comes in like a fox reigns like a lion. Some understand

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:21-35 ">
 these verses</A>

 of his first expedition into Egypt, when he came not as an enemy, but
 as a friend and guardian to the young king Ptolem&aelig;us Philometer, 
 and therefore brought with him but few followers, yet those stout men, 
 and faithful to his interest, whom he placed in divers of the 
 strong-holds in Egypt, thereby making himself master of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His war with Egypt, which was his second expedition thither. This 
 is described, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:25,27"><I>v.</I> 25, 27</A>.

 Antiochus shall <I>stir up his power and courage</I> against 
 Ptolem&aelig;us Philometer king of Egypt. Ptolemy, thereupon, shall 
 <I>be stirred up to battle</I> against him, shall come against him 
 <I>with a very great and mighty army;</I> but Ptolemy, though he has 
 such a vast army, shall not be able to stand before him; for 
 Antiochus's army shall <I>overthrow</I> his, and overpower it, and 
 great multitudes of the Egyptian army shall <I>fall down slain.</I> And 
 no marvel, for the king of Egypt shall be betrayed by his own 
 counsellors; those that <I>feed of the portion of his meat,</I> that 
 eat of his bread and live upon him, being bribed by Antiochus, shall 
 <I>forecast devices against him,</I> and even <I>they shall destroy 
 him;</I> and what fence is there against such treachery? After the 
 battle, a treaty of peace shall be set on foot, and these two kings 
 shall meet <I>at one council-board,</I> to adjust the articles of peace 
 between them; but they shall neither of them be sincere in it, for they 
 shall, in their pretences and promises of amity and friendship, <I>lie 
 to one another,</I> for their hearts shall be at the same time to do 
 one another all the mischief they can. And then no marvel that <I>it 
 shall not prosper.</I> The peace shall not last; but <I>the end</I> of 
 it shall be <I>at the time appointed</I> in the divine Providence, and 
 then the war shall break out again, as a sore that is only skinned 
 over.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Another expedition against Egypt. From the former he <I>returned 
 with great riches</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 and therefore took the first occasion to invade Egypt again, <I>at the 
 time appointed</I> by the divine Providence, two years after, in the 
 eighth year of his reign, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 He shall come <I>towards the south.</I> But this attempt shall not 
 succeed, as the two former did, nor shall he gain his point, as he had 
 done before once and again; for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>)

 <I>the ships of Chittim shall come against him,</I> that is, the navy 
 of the Romans, or only ambassadors from the Roman senate, who came in 
 ships. Ptolem&aelig;us Philometer, king of Egypt, being now in a strict 
 alliance with the Romans, craved their aid against Antiochus, who had 
 besieged him and his mother Cleopatra in the city of Alexandria. The 
 Roman senate thereupon sent an embassy to Antiochus, to command him to 
 raise the siege, and, when he desired some time to consider of it and 
 consult with his friends about it, Popilius, one of the ambassadors, 
 with his staff drew a circle about him, and told him, as one having 
 authority, he should give a positive answer before he came out of that 
 circle; whereupon, fearing the Roman power, he was forced immediately 
 to give orders for the raising of the siege and the retreat of his army 
 out of Egypt. So Livy and others relate the story which this prophecy 
 refers to. <I>He shall be grieved, and return;</I> for it was a great 
 vexation to him to be forced to yield thus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. His rage and cruel practices against the Jews. This is that part of 
 his government, or mis-government rather, which is most enlarged upon 
 in this prediction. In his return from his expedition into Egypt (which 
 is prophesied of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>)

 he <I>did exploits</I> against the Jews, in the sixth year of his 
 reign; then he spoiled the city and temple. But the most terrible storm 
 was in his return from Egypt, two years after, prophesied of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.
 
 Then he took Judea in his way home; and, because he could not gain his 
 point in Egypt by reason of the Romans interposing, he wreaked his 
 revenge upon the poor Jews, who gave him no provocation, but had 
 greatly provoked God to permit him to do it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:23">Dan. viii. 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He had a rooted antipathy to the Jews' religion: <I>His heart</I> 
 was <I>against the holy covenant,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.
 
 And 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>)

 <I>he had indignation against the holy covenant,</I> that covenant of 
 peculiarity by which the Jews were incorporated a people distinct from 
 all other nations, and dignified above them. He hated the law of Moses 
 and the worship of the true God, and was vexed at the privileges of the 
 Jewish nation and the promises made to them. Note, That which is the 
 hope and joy of the people of God is the envy of their neighbours, and 
 that is <I>the holy covenant.</I> Esau hated Jacob because he had got 
 the blessing. Those that are strangers to the covenant are often 
 enemies to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He carried on his malicious designs against the Jews by the 
 assistance of some perfidious apostate Jews. He kept up <I>intelligence 
 with those that forsook the holy covenant</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 some of the Jews that were false to their religion, and introduced the 
 customs of the heathen, with whom they made a covenant. See the 
 fulfilling of this,

 <U>1 Mac. i. 11-15</U>,

 where it is expressly said, concerning those renegado Jews, that they 
 <I>made themselves uncircumcised and forsook the holy covenant.</I> We 
 read 
 
 (<U>2 Mac. iv. 9</U>)

 of Jason, the brother of Onias the high priest, who by the appointment 
 of Antiochus set up a school at Jerusalem, <I>for the training up of 
 youth in the fashions of the heathen;</I> and 
 
 (<U>2 Mac. iv. 23</U>,

 &c.) of Menelaus, who fell in with the interests of Antiochus, and was 
 the man that helped him into Jerusalem, now in his last return from 
 Egypt. We read much in the book of the Maccabees of the mischief done 
 to the Jews by these treacherous men of their own nation, Jason and 
 Menelaus, and their party. These upon all occasions he made use of. 
 "<I>Such as do wickedly against the covenant,</I> such as throw up 
 their religion, and comply with the heathen, he shall <I>corrupt with 
 flatteries,</I> to harden them in their apostasy, and to make use of 
 them as decoys to draw in others," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 Note, It is not strange if those who do not live up to their religion, 
 but in their conversations <I>do wickedly against the covenant,</I> are 
 easily <I>corrupted by flatteries</I> to quit their religion. Those 
 that make shipwreck of a good conscience will soon <I>make shipwreck of 
 the faith.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He profaned the temple. <I>Arms stand on his part</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),

 not only his own army which he now brought from Egypt, but a great 
 party of deserters from the Jewish religion that joined with them; and 
 they <I>polluted the sanctuary of strength,</I> not only the holy city, 
 but the temple. The story of this we have,

 <U>1 Mac. i. 21</U>,

 &c. He <I>entered proudly into the sanctuary,</I> took <I>away the 
 golden altar, and the candlestick,</I> &c. And therefore 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>)
 
 <I>there was a great mourning in Israel; the princes and elders 
 mourned,</I> &c. And 
 
 (<U>2 Mac. v. 15</U>,

 &c.) <I>Antiochus went into the most holy temple, Menelaus, that 
 traitor to the laws and to his own country, being his guide.</I> 
 Antiochus, having resolved to bring all about him to be of his 
 religion, <I>took away the daily sacrifice,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 Some observe that the word <I>Tammidh,</I> which signifies no more than 
 <I>daily,</I> is only here, and in the parallel place, used for the 
 <I>daily sacrifice,</I> as if there were a designed liberty left to 
 supply it either with <I>sacrifice,</I> which was suppressed by 
 Antiochus, or with <I>gospel-worship,</I> which was suppressed by the 
 Antichrist. Then he <I>set up the abomination of desolation upon the 
 altar</I>

 (<U>1 Mac. i. 54</U>),

 even an <I>idol altar</I>

 (<U><I>v.</I> 59</U>),

 and called the temple the temple of <I>Jupiter Olympius,</I>

 <U>2 Mac. vi. 2</U>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He persecuted those who retained their integrity. Though there are 
 many who <I>forsake the covenant</I> and <I>do wickedly</I> against it, 
 yet there is a people who do <I>know their God</I> and retain the 
 knowledge of him, and <I>they shall be strong and do exploits,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 When others yield to the tyrant's demands, and surrender their 
 consciences to his impositions, they bravely keep their ground, resist 
 the temptation, and make the tyrant himself ashamed of his attempt upon 
 them. Good old Eleazar, one of the <I>principal scribes,</I> when he 
 had swine's flesh thrust into his mouth, did bravely spit it out again, 
 though he knew he must be tormented to death for so doing, and was so,

 <U>2 Mac. vi. 19</U>.

 The mother and her seven sons were put to death for adhering to their
 religion,

 <U>2 Mac. vii</U>.

 This might well be called <I>doing exploits;</I> for to choose 
 suffering rather than sin is a great exploit. And it was <I>by 
 faith,</I> by being <I>strong in faith,</I> that they did those 
 exploits, that <I>they were tortured, not accepting deliverance,</I> as 
 the apostle speaks, probably with reference to that story, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:35">Heb. xi. 35</A>.
 
 Or it may refer to the military courage and achievements of Judas
 Maccab&aelig;us and others in opposition to Antiochus. Note, The right
 knowledge of God is, and will be, the strength of the soul, and, in the 
 strength of that, gracious souls do exploits. <I>Those that know his 
 name will put their trust in him,</I> and by that trust will do great 
 things. Now, concerning this people that knew their God, we are here 
 told, 
 
 (1.) That <I>they shall instruct many,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 They shall make it their business to show others what they have learned 
 themselves of the difference between truth and falsehood, good and 
 evil. Note, Those that have the knowledge of God themselves should 
 communicate their knowledge to those about them, and this spiritual 
 charity must be extensive: they must <I>instruct many.</I> Some 
 understand this of a society newly erected for the propagating of 
 divine knowledge, called <I>Assideans,</I> godly men, <I>pietists</I> 
 (so the name signifies), that were both knowing and zealous in the law; 
 these instructed many. Note, In times of persecution and apostasy,
 which are trying times, those that have knowledge ought to make use of 
 it for the strengthening and establishing of others. Those that 
 understand aright themselves ought to do what they can to bring others 
 to understand; for knowledge is a talent that must be traded with. Or, 
 They shall instruct many by their perseverance in their duty and their 
 patient suffering for it. Good examples instruct many, and with many
 are the most powerful instructions. 

 (2.) <I>They shall fall</I> by the cruelty of Antiochus, shall be put 
 to the torture, and put to death, by his rage. Though they are so 
 excellent and intelligent themselves, and so useful and serviceable to 
 others, yet Antiochus shall show them no mercy, but <I>they shall fall 
 for some days;</I> so it may be read,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:10">Rev. ii. 10</A>,

 <I>Thou shalt have tribulation ten days.</I> We read much, in the books 
 of the Maccabees, of Antiochus's barbarous usage of the pious Jews, how 
 many he slew in wars and how many he murdered in cold blood. Women were 
 <I>put to death</I> for having their children <I>circumcised,</I> and 
 their <I>infants were hanged about their necks,</I>

 <U>1 Mac. i. 60, 61</U>.

 But why did God suffer this? How can this be reconciled with the 
 justice and goodness of God? I answer, Very well, if we consider what 
 it was that God aimed at in this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>):

 <I>Some of those of understanding shall fall,</I> but it shall be for 
 the good of the church and for their own spiritual benefit. <I>It 
 shall</I> be to <I>try them, and to purge, and to make them white.</I> 
 They <I>needed</I> these afflictions themselves. The best have their 
 spots, which must be washed off, their dross, which must be purged out; 
 and their troubles, particularly their <I>share in the public 
 troubles,</I> help to do this; being sanctified to them by the grace of 
 God, they are means of mortifying their corruptions, weaning them from 
 the world, and awakening them to greater seriousness and diligence in 
 religion. They try them, as silver in the furnace is refined from its 
 dross; they purge them, as wheat in the barn is winnowed from the 
 chaff; and they <I>make them white,</I> as cloth by the fuller is 
 cleared from its spots. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:7">1 Pet. i. 7</A>.

 Their sufferings <I>for righteousness' sake</I> would try and purge the
 nation of the Jews, would convince them of the truth, excellency, and 
 power of that holy religion which these <I>understanding</I> men died 
 for their adherence to. The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the 
 church; it is precious blood, and not a drop of it should be shed but 
 upon such a valuable consideration.

 (3.) The cause of religion, though it be thus run upon, shall not be 
 run down. <I>When they shall fall</I> they shall not be utterly cast
 down, but <I>they shall be holpen with a little help,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 Judas Maccab&aelig;us, and his brethren, and a few with them, shall 
 <I>make head</I> against the tyrant, and assert the injured cause of 
 their religion; they <I>pulled down the</I> idolatrous <I>altars, 
 circumcised the children that they found uncircumcised, recovered the 
 law out of the hand of the Gentiles, and the work prospered in their 
 hands,</I>

 <U>1 Mac. ii. 45</U>,

 &c. Note, Those that stand by the cause of religion when it is
 threatened and struck at, though they may not immediately be delivered 
 and made victorious, shall yet have <I>present help.</I> And a 
 <I>little help</I> must not be despised; but, when times are very bad, 
 we must be thankful for <I>some reviving.</I> It is likewise foretold 
 that <I>many shall cleave to them with flatteries;</I> when they see 
 the Maccabees prosper some Jews shall join with them that are no true 
 friends to religion, but will only pretend friendship either with 
 design to <I>betray them</I> or in hope to <I>rise with them;</I> but 
 the <I>fiery trial</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>)

 will separate between the <I>precious and the vile,</I> and by it 
 <I>those that are perfect will be made manifest</I> and those that are 
 not. 

 (4.) Though these troubles may continue long, yet they will have <I>an 
 end.</I> They are <I>for a time appointed,</I> a limited time, fixed in 
 the divine counsels. This warfare shall be accomplished.
 <I>Hitherto</I> the power of the enemy shall come, and <I>no 
 further;</I> here shall its <I>proud waves</I> be <I>stayed.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He grew very proud, insolent, and profane, and, being puffed up with 
 his conquests, bade defiance to Heaven, and trampled upon every thing 
 that was sacred, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>,

 &c. And here some think begins a prophecy of the antichrist, the papal
 kingdom. It is plain that St. Paul, in his prophecy of the rise and 
 reign of the man of sin, alludes to this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:4">2 Thess. ii. 4</A>),

 which shows that Antiochus was a type and figure of that enemy, as
 Babylon also was; but, this being joined in a continued discourse with 
 the foregoing prophecies concerning Antiochus, to me it seems probably 
 that it principally refers to him, and in him had its primary 
 accomplishment, and has reference to the other only by way of 
 accommodation.

 (1.) He shall impiously dishonour the God of Israel, the only living 
 and true God, called here the <I>God of gods.</I> He shall, in defiance 
 of him and his authority, <I>do according to his will</I> against his 
 people and his holy religion; he shall <I>exalt himself</I> above him, 
 as Sennacherib did, and shall <I>speak marvellous things against 
 him</I> and against his laws and institutions. This was fulfilled when 
 Antiochus forbade <I>sacrifices</I> to be <I>offered</I> in God's 
 temple, and ordered the <I>sabbaths</I> to be <I>profaned,</I> the 
 <I>sanctuary</I> and the <I>holy people</I> to be <I>polluted,</I> &c., 
 to <I>the end that they might forget the law and change all the 
 ordinances,</I> and this upon pain of death,

 <U>1 Mac. i. 45</U>.

 (2.) He shall proudly put contempt upon <I>all other gods,</I> shall
 <I>magnify himself above every god,</I> even the gods of the nations. 
 Antiochus wrote to his own kingdom that every one should leave the gods 
 he had worshipped, and worship such as he ordered, contrary to the 
 practice of all the conquerors that went before him, 
 
 <U>1 Mac. i. 41, 42.</U>

 And <I>all the heathen agreed according to the commandment of the 
 king;</I> fond as they were of their gods, they did not think them 
 worth suffering for, but, their gods being idols, it was all alike to 
 them what gods they worshipped. Antiochus did not <I>regard any
 god,</I> but <I>magnified himself above all,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 He was so proud that he thought himself above the condition of a mortal 
 man, that he could <I>command the waves of the sea, and reach to the 
 stars of heaven,</I> as his insolence and haughtiness are expressed,

 <U>2 Mac. ix. 8, 10</U>.

 Thus he carried all before him, <I>till the indignation was 
 accomplished</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>),

 till he had run his length, and filled up the measure of his iniquity; 
 for <I>that which is determined shall be done,</I> and nothing more, 
 nothing short. 

 (3.) He shall, contrary to the way of the heathen, disregard the god of 
 his fathers,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 Though an affection to the religion of their ancestors was, among the 
 heathen, almost as natural to them as <I>the desire of women</I> (for, 
 if you search through <I>the isles of Chittim,</I> you will not find an 
 instance of a nation that has <I>changed its gods,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:10,11">Jer. ii. 10, 11</A>),
 
 yet Antiochus shall not <I>regard the god of his fathers;</I> he made
 laws to abolish the religion of his country, and to bring in the idols 
 of the Greeks. And though his predecessors had honoured the God of
 Israel, and given great gifts to the temple at Jerusalem

 (<U>2 Mac. iii. 2, 3</U>),

 he offered the greatest indignities to God and his temple. His not
 regarding the <I>desire of women</I> may denote his barbarous cruelty 
 (he shall spare no age or sex, no, not the tender ones) or his 
 unnatural lusts, or, in general, his contempt of every thing which men 
 of honour have a concern for, or it might be accomplished in something 
 we meet not with in history. Its being joined to his not <I>regarding 
 the god of his fathers</I> intimates that the idolatries of his country 
 had in them more of the gratifications of the flesh than those of other 
 countries (Lucian has written of the Syrian goddesses), and yet that 
 would not prevail to keep him to them. 

 (4.) He shall set up an unknown god, a new god,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 <I>In his estate,</I> in the room of the god of his fathers (Apollo and 
 Diana, deities of pleasure), he shall <I>honour the god of forces,</I> 
 a supposed deity of power, a <I>god whom his fathers knew not,</I> nor 
 worshipped; because he will be thought in wisdom and strength to excel 
 his fathers, he shall <I>honour this god with gold, and silver, and 
 precious stones,</I> thinking nothing too good for the god he has taken 
 a fancy to. This seems to be Jupiter Olympius, known among the 
 Ph&oelig;nicians by the name of <I>Baal-Semen, the lord of heaven,</I> but 
 never introduced among the Syrians till Antiochus introduced it. Thus 
 shall he do <I>in the most strong holds,</I> in the temple of 
 Jerusalem, which is called <I>the sanctuary of strength</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),
 
 and here the <I>fortresses of munitions; there</I> he shall set up the 
 image of this <I>strange god.</I> Some read it, <I>He shall commit the 
 munitions of strength,</I> or of the most strong God (that is, the city 
 Jerusalem), to <I>a strange god;</I> he put it under the protection and 
 government of Jupiter Olympius. This god he shall not only acknowledge, 
 but shall <I>increase with glory,</I> by setting his image even upon 
 God's altar. And he shall <I>cause those</I> that minister to this
 idol <I>to rule over many,</I> shall put them into places of power and 
 trust, and they shall <I>divide the land for gain,</I> shall be 
 maintained richly out of the profits of the country. Some by the
 <I>Mahuzzim,</I> or <I>god of forces,</I> that Antiochus shall worship, 
 understand <I>money,</I> which is said to <I>answer all things,</I> and 
 which is the great idol of worldly people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now here is very much that is applicable to the <I>man of sin;</I> he 
 <I>exalts himself above all that is called god or that is worshipped; 
 magnifies himself above all;</I> his flatterers call him <I>our lord 
 god the pope.</I> By forbidding marriage, and magnifying the single 
 life, he pretends not to regard the desire of women; and honours the 
 <I>god of forces,</I> the god <I>Mahuzzim,</I> or <I>strong holds,</I> 
 saints and angels, whom his followers take for their protectors, as the 
 heathen did of old their demons; these they make presidents of several 
 countries, &c. These they honour with vast treasures dedicated to them, 
 and therein the learned Mr. Mede thinks that this prophecy was 
 fulfilled, and that it is referred to 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:1,2">1 Tim. iv. 1, 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Here seems to be another expedition into Egypt, or, at least, a 
 struggle with Egypt. The Romans had tied him up from invading Ptolemy, 
 but now that <I>king of the south pushes at him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>),

 makes an attempt upon some of his territories, where upon Antiochus, 
 the <I>king of the north, comes against him like a whirlwind,</I> with 
 incredible swiftness and fury, <I>with chariots, and horses, and many 
 ships,</I> a great force. He shall <I>come trough countries, and shall 
 overflow and pass over.</I> In this flying march <I>many countries 
 shall be overthrown by him;</I> and he shall enter into <I>the glorious 
 land,</I> the land of Israel; it is the same word that is translated 
 <I>the pleasant land,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:9"><I>ch.</I> viii. 9</A>.

 He shall make dreadful work among the nations thereabout; yet some
 shall escape his fury, particularly Edom and Moab, and <I>the chief of 
 the children of Ammon,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>.

 He did not put these countries under contribution, because they had 
 joined with him against the Jews. But especially the land of Egypt 
 <I>shall not escape,</I> but he will quite beggar that, so bare will he 
 strip it. This some reckon his fourth and last expedition against 
 Egypt, in the tenth or eleventh year of his reign, under pretence of 
 assisting the younger brother of Ptolem&aelig;us Philometer against 
 him. We read not of any great slaughter made in this expedition, but 
 great plunder; for, it should seem, that was what he came for: <I>He 
 shall have power over the treasures of gold and silver, and all the 
 precious things of Egypt,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>.

 Polybius, in Athen&aelig;us, relates that Antiochus, having got 
 together abundance of wealth, by spoiling young Philometer, and 
 breaking league with him, and by the contributions of his friends, 
 bestowed a vast deal upon a triumph, in imitation of Paulus 
 &AElig;milius, and describes the extravagance of it; here we are told 
 how he got that money which he spent so profusely. Notice is here
 taken likewise of the use he made of the Lybians and Ethiopians, who 
 bordered upon Egypt; they <I>were at his steps;</I> he had them at his 
 foot, had them at his beck, and they made inroads upon Egypt to serve 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. Here is a prediction of the fall and ruin of Antiochus, as before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:25"><I>ch.</I> viii. 25</A>),

 when he is in the height of his honour, flushed with victory, and laden
 with spoils, tidings <I>out of the east</I> and <I>out of the north</I> 
 (out of the north-east) shall trouble him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>.

 Or, He shall have intelligence, both from the eastern and northern 
 parts, that the king of Parthia is invading his kingdom. This obliged 
 him to drop the enterprises he had in hand, and to go against the 
 Persians and Parthians that were revolting from him; and this 
 <I>vexed</I> him, for now he thought utterly to ruin and extirpate the 
 Jewish nation, when that expedition called him off, in which he 
 perished. This is explained by a passage in Tacitus (though an impious 
 one) where he commends Antiochus for his attempt to <I>take away the 
 superstition of the Jews,</I> and <I>bring in the manners of the 
 Greeks,</I> among them (<I>ut teterrimam gentem in melius mutaret--to 
 meliorate an odious nation</I>), and laments that he was hindered from 
 accomplishing it by the Parthian war. Now here is, 

 1. The last effort of his rage against the Jews. When he finds himself
 perplexed and embarrassed in his affairs he shall <I>go forth with 
 great fury to destroy and utterly to make away many,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>.

 The story of this we have

 <U>1 Mac. iii. 27</U>,

 &c., what a rage Antiochus was in when he heard of the successes of 
 Judas Maccab&aelig;us, and the orders he gave to Lysias to destroy
 Jerusalem. Then <I>he planted the tabernacles of his palace,</I> or 
 <I>tents of his court, between the seas,</I> between the Great Sea and 
 the Dead Sea. He set up his royal pavilion at Emmaus near Jerusalem, in 
 token that, though he could not be present himself, yet he gave full 
 power to his captains to prosecute the war against the Jews with the 
 utmost rigour. He placed his tent there, as if he had taken possession 
 <I>of the glorious holy mountain</I> and called it <I>his own.</I> 
 Note, When impiety grows very impudent we may see its ruin near. 

 2. His exit: <I>He shall come to his end and none shall help him;</I>
 God shall cut him off in the midst of his days and none shall be able
 to prevent his fall. This is the same with that which was foretold

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:35"><I>ch.</I> viii. 25</A>

 (<I>He shall be broken without hand</I>), where we took a view of his
 miserable end. Note, When God's time shall come to bring proud 
 oppressors to their end none shall be able to help them, nor perhaps 
 inclined to help them; for those that covet to be feared by all when 
 they are in their grandeur, when they come to be in distress will find 
 themselves loved by none; none will lend them so much as a hand or a 
 prayer to help them; and, if the Lord do not help, who shall?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Of the kings that came after Antiochus nothing is here prophesied, for 
 that was the most malicious mischievous enemy to the church, that was a 
 type of the son of perdition, whom the Lord shall consume with the
 breath of his mouth and destroy with the brightness of his coming, and 
 none shall help him.</P>
