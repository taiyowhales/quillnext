 Still the correspondence is kept up between God and his prophet. In the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:1-17">first chapter</A>

 he spoke to God, then God to him, and then he to God again; in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:1-20">second chapter</A>

 God spoke wholly to him by the Spirit of prophecy; now, in 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:1-19">this chapter</A>,

 he speaks wholly to God by the Spirit of prayer, for he would not let
 the intercourse drop on his side, like a genuine son of Abraham, who
 "returned not to his place until God had left communing with him." 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:33">Gen. xviii. 33</A>.

 The prophet's prayer, in this chapter, is in imitation of David's
 psalms, for it is directed "to the chief musician," and is set to 
 musical instruments. The prayer is left upon record for the use of the 
 church, and particularly of the Jews in their captivity, while they 
 were waiting for their deliverance, promised by the vision in the 
 foregoing chapter.

 I. He earnestly begs of God to relieve and succour his people in
 affliction, to hasten their deliverance, and to comfort them in the
 mean time,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:1">ver. 2</A>.

 II. He calls to mind the experiences which the church formerly had of
 God's glorious and gracious appearances on her behalf, when he brought 
 Israel out of Egypt through the wilderness to Canaan, and there many a 
 time wrought wonderful deliverances for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:3-15">ver. 3-15</A>.

 III. He affects himself with a holy concern for the present troubles of
 the church, but encourages himself and others to hope that the issue 
 will be comfortable and glorious at last, though all visible means fail,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.
 &nbsp; 2 O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, I have heard thy speech, <I>and</I> was afraid: O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the
 years make known; in wrath remember mercy.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter is entitled <I>a prayer of Habakkuk.</I> It is a 
 meditation with himself, an intercession for the church. Prophets were 
 praying men; this prophet was so (<I>He is a prophet, and he shall pray 
 for thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:7">Gen. xx. 7</A>);

 and sometimes they prayed for even those whom they prophesied against.
 Those that were intimately acquainted with the mind of God concerning
 future events knew better than others how to order their prayers, and
 what to pray for, and, in the foresight of troublous times, could lay
 up a stock of prayers that might then receive a gracious answer, and so
 be serving the church by their prayers when their prophesying was over.
 This prophet had found God ready to answer his requests and complaints
 before, and therefore now repeats his applications to him. Because
 <I>God has inclined his ear to us,</I> we must resolve that
 <I>therefore we</I> will <I>call upon him as long as we live.</I> 

 1. The prophet owns the receipt of God's answer to his former
 representation, and the impression it made upon him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>O Lord! I have heard thy speech, thy hearing</I>" (so some read 
 it), "that which thou wouldst have us hear, the decree that has gone 
 forth for the afflicting of thy people. <I>I received thine,</I> and it 
 is before me." Note, Those that would rightly order their speech to God 
 must carefully observe, and lay before them, his speech to them. He
 had said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:1"><I>ch.</I> ii. 1</A>),

 <I>I will watch to see what he will say;</I> and now he owns, <I>Lord,
 I have heard thy speech;</I> for, if we turn a deaf ear to God's word,
 we can expect no other than that he should turn a deaf ear to our
 prayers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:9">Prov. xxviii. 9</A>.

 I heard it, <I>and was afraid.</I> Messages immediately from heaven
 commonly struck even the best and boldest men into a consternation; 
 Moses, Isaiah, and Daniel, did <I>exceedingly fear and quake.</I> But, 
 besides that, the matter of this message made the prophet afraid, when 
 he heard how low the people of God should be brought, under the 
 oppressing power of the Chaldeans, and how long they should continue 
 under it; he was afraid lest their spirits should quite fail, and lest 
 the church should be utterly rooted out and run down, and, being kept 
 low so long, should be lost at length. 

 2. He earnestly prays that <I>for the elect's sake</I> these <I>days of 
 trouble</I> might be <I>shortened,</I> or the trouble of these days 
 mitigated and moderated, or the people of God supported and comforted 
 under it. He thinks it very long to wait till the <I>end of the 
 years;</I> perhaps he refers to the seventy years fixed for the 
 continuance of the captivity, and therefore, "Lord," says he, "do 
 something on our behalf <I>in the midst of the years,</I> those years 
 of our distress; though we be not delivered, and our oppressors 
 destroyed, yet let us not be abandoned and cast off."

 (1.) "Do something for thy own cause: <I>Revive thy work,</I> thy 
 church" (that is the <I>work of God's own hand,</I> formed by him, 
 formed for him); "<I>revive</I> that, even when it <I>walks in the
 midst of trouble,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+138:7,8">Ps. cxxxviii. 7, 8</A>.

 Grant thy people <I>a little reviving in their bondage,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+9:8,Ps+85:6">Ezra ix. 8; Ps. lxxxv. 6</A>.

 <I>Preserve alive thy work</I>" (so some read it); "though thy church
 be chastened, let it not be killed; though it have not its liberty, yet 
 continue its life, save a remnant alive, to be a seed of another 
 generation. <I>Revive the work of thy grace</I> in us, by sanctifying
 the trouble to us and supporting us under it, though the time be not 
 yet come, <I>even the set time,</I> for our deliverance out of it.
 Whatever becomes of us, though we be as dead and dry bones, Lord, let 
 <I>thy work be revived,</I> let not that sink, and go back, and come to 
 nothing."

 (2.) "Do something for thy own honour: <I>In the midst of the years 
 make known,</I> make thyself known, for now <I>verily thou art a God 
 that hidest thyself</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:15">Isa. xlv. 15</A>),

 make known thy power, thy pity, thy promise, thy providence, in the
 government of the world, for the safety and welfare of thy church.
 Though we be buried in obscurity, yet, Lord, make thyself known; 
 whatever becomes of Israel, let not the God of Israel be forgotten in 
 the world, but discover himself even in the midst of the dark years, 
 before thou art expected to appear." When <I>in the midst of the 
 years</I> of the captivity God miraculously owned the three children in 
 the fiery furnace, and humbled Nebuchadnezzar, this prayer was 
 answered, <I>In the midst of the years make known.</I>

 (3.) "Do something for thy people's comfort: <I>In wrath remember 
 mercy,</I> and <I>make that known. Show us thy mercy, O Lord!</I>" 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+85:7">Ps. lxxxv. 7</A>.

 They see God's displeasure against them in their troubles, and that
 makes them grievous indeed. There is wrath in the bitter cup; that 
 therefore they deprecate, and are earnest in begging that he is a 
 merciful God and they are vessels of his mercy. Note, Even those that 
 are under the tokens of God's wrath must not despair of his mercy; and 
 mercy, mere mercy, is that which we must flee to for refuge, and rely 
 upon as our only plea. He does not say, Remember our merit, but, Lord, 
 <I>remember thy own mercy.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>3 God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran.
 Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of
 his praise.
 &nbsp; 4 And <I>his</I> brightness was as the light; he had horns <I>coming</I>
 out of his hand: and there <I>was</I> the hiding of his power.
 &nbsp; 5 Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth
 at his feet.
 &nbsp; 6 He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove
 asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were
 scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways <I>are</I>
 everlasting.
 &nbsp; 7 I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: <I>and</I> the curtains
 of the land of Midian did tremble.
 &nbsp; 8 Was the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> displeased against the rivers? <I>was</I> thine anger
 against the rivers? <I>was</I> thy wrath against the sea, that thou
 didst ride upon thine horses <I>and</I> thy chariots of salvation?
 &nbsp; 9 Thy bow was made quite naked, <I>according</I> to the oaths of the
 tribes, <I>even thy</I> word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with
 rivers.
 &nbsp; 10 The mountains saw thee, <I>and</I> they trembled: the overflowing
 of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, <I>and</I> lifted
 up his hands on high.
 &nbsp; 11 The sun <I>and</I> moon stood still in their habitation: at the
 light of thine arrows they went, <I>and</I> at the shining of thy
 glittering spear.
 &nbsp; 12 Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst
 thresh the heathen in anger.
 &nbsp; 13 Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, <I>even</I>
 for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of
 the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the
 neck. Selah.
 &nbsp; 14 Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his
 villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their
 rejoicing <I>was</I> as to devour the poor secretly.
 &nbsp; 15 Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, <I>through</I>
 the heap of great waters.

 It has been the usual practice of God's people, when they have been in 
 distress and ready to fall into despair, to help themselves by 
 recollecting their experiences, and reviving them, <I>considering the 
 days of old,</I> and <I>the years of ancient times</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+77:5">Ps. lxxvii. 5</A>),

 and pleading with God in prayer, as he is pleased sometimes to plead
 them with himself.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:11">Isa. lxiii. 11</A>,

 <I>Then he remembered the days of old.</I> This is that which the
 prophet does here, and he looks as far back as the first forming of 
 them into a people, when they were brought by miracles out of Egypt, 
 <I>a house of bondage,</I> through the wilderness, <I>a land of 
 drought,</I> into Canaan, then possessed by <I>mighty nations.</I> He 
 that thus brought them at first into Canaan, through so much 
 difficulty, can now bring them thither again out of Babylon, how great 
 soever the difficulties are that lie in the way. Those works of
 wonder, wrought of old, are here most magnificently described, for the 
 greater encouragement to the faith of God's people in their present 
 straits.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God appeared in his glory, so as he never did before or since 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>):

 <I>He came from Teman, even the Holy One from Mount Paran.</I> This 
 refers to the visible display of the glory of God when he gave the law 
 upon Mount Sinai, as appears by 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:2">Deut. xxxiii. 2</A>

 whence these expressions are borrowed. Then <I>the Lord came down</I>
 upon Mount Sinai in a cloud

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:20">Exod. xix. 20</A>)

 and his glory was <I>as the devouring fire,</I> not only to enforce the
 law he then gave them, but to avow the deliverance he had wrought for 
 them and to magnify it; for the first word he said there was, "<I>I am 
 the Lord thy God, that brought thee out of the land of Egypt.</I> I 
 that appear in this glory am the author of that work." Then <I>his 
 glory covered the heavens,</I> which shone with the reflection of that 
 glorious appearance of his; the <I>earth also</I> was <I>full of his 
 praise,</I> or of his <I>splendour,</I> as some read it. People at a 
 distance saw the cloud and fire on the top of Mount Sinai, and praised 
 the God of Israel. Or the earth was full of those works of God which
 were to be praised. <I>His brightness was as the light,</I> as the
 light of the sun when he goes forth in his strength; <I>he had 
 horns,</I> or <I>bright beams</I> (so it should be rendered), <I>coming 
 out of his side</I> or <I>hand.</I> Rays of glory were darted forth 
 around him; and with some rays borrowed thence it was that Moses's face 
 shone when he <I>came down from</I> that <I>mount</I> of glory. Some by 
 the horns, the <I>two horns</I> (for the word is dual), <I>coming out 
 of his hand,</I> understand the <I>two tables of the law,</I> which 
 perhaps, when God delivered them to Moses, though they were tables of 
 stone, had a glory round them; those books were gilt with beams, and so 
 it agrees with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:2">Deut. xxxiii. 2</A>,

 <I>From his right hand went a fiery law for them.</I> It is added,
 <I>And there was the hiding of his power;</I> there was his hidden 
 power, in the rays that came out of his hand. The operations of his 
 power, compared with what he could have done, were rather the hiding of 
 it than the discovery of it; the secrets of his power, as well as of 
 his wisdom, are <I>double to that which is,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:6">Job xi. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God sent plagues on Egypt, for the humbling of proud Pharaoh, and 
 the obliging of him to let the people go 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Before him went the pestilence,</I> which slew all the first-born of 
 Egypt in one night; and <I>burning coals went forth at his feet,</I> 
 when, in the plague of hail, there was <I>fire mingled with 
 hail--burning diseases</I> (so the margin reads it), some think those 
 that wasted Egypt, others those with which the number of the Canaanites 
 was diminished before Israel was brought in up on them. These were 
 <I>at his feet,</I> that is, at his coming, for they are at his 
 command; he says to them, Go, and they go, Come, and they come, Do 
 this, and they do it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He divided the land of Canaan to his people Israel, and expelled 
 the heathen from before them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>He stood, and measured the earth,</I> measured that land, to assign
 it for an inheritance to Israel his people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:8,9">Deut. xxxii. 8, 9</A>.

 <I>He beheld, and drove asunder the nations</I> that were in possession
 of it; though they combined together against Israel, God dispersed and
 discomfited them before Israel. Or he exerted such a mighty power as
 was enough to shake in pieces all the nations of the earth. Then
 <I>the everlasting mountains were scattered, and the perpetual hills
 did bow;</I> the mighty princes and potentates of Canaan, that seemed
 as high, as strong, and as firmly fixed, as the mountains and hills,
 were broken to pieces; they and their kingdoms were totally subdued. Or
 the power of God was so exerted as to shake the mountains and hills;
 nay, and Sinai did tremble, and the adjacent hills; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:7,8">Ps. lxviii. 7, 8</A>.

 To this he adds, <I>His ways are everlasting,</I> that is, all the 
 motions of his providence are according to his eternal counsels; and he 
 is the same for ever, that which he was yesterday and to-day. His 
 covenant is unchangeable, and <I>his mercy endures for ever.</I> When 
 he <I>drove asunder the nations of Canaan</I> one might have seen the 
 <I>tents of Cushan in affliction, the curtains of the land of Midian 
 trembling,</I> and all the inhabitants of the neighbouring countries 
 taking the alarm; and though they were not in the commission given to 
 Israel to destroy, nor their land within the warrant given to Israel to 
 possess, yet they thought their own house in danger when their 
 neighbour's house was on fire, and therefore they were in a great 
 fright, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Balak the king of Moab was so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:3,4">Num. xxii. 3, 4</A>.

 Some make the tents of Cushan to be in affliction when, in the days of 
 judge Othniel, God delivered Cushan-rishathaim into his hand 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+3:8">Judg. iii. 8</A>),

 and the <I>curtains of the land of Midian to tremble</I> when, in the
 days of judge Gideon, a barley cake, in a dream, overthrew the tent of 
 Midian,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:13">Judg. vii. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He divided the Red Sea and Jordan, when they stood in the way of 
 Israel's progress, and yet fetched a river out of a rock when Israel
 wanted it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 One would have thought that God was <I>displeased with the rivers,</I> 
 and that <I>his wrath</I> was <I>against the sea,</I> for he made them 
 give way and flee before him when he <I>rode upon his horses and 
 chariots of salvation,</I> as a general at the head of his forces, 
 mighty to save. Note, God's chariots are not so much chariots of state 
 to himself as chariots of salvation to his people; it is his glory to 
 be Israel's Saviour. This seems to be referred to again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):
 
 "<I>Thou didst walk through the sea,</I> through the Red Sea, <I>with 
 thy horses,</I> in the pillar of cloud and fire (that was his chariot 
 drawn by angels); thus thou didst walk secure, and so as to accommodate 
 thyself to the slow pace that Israel could go, as Jacob tenderly drove, 
 in consideration of his children and cattle: <I>Thou didst walk through 
 the heap,</I> or mud, <I>of great waters;</I> and Israel likewise was 
 led <I>through the deep as a horse through the wilderness,</I>" 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:13,14">Isa. lxiii. 13, 14</A>.

 When they came to enter Canaan the <I>overflowing of the water passed
 by,</I> that is, Jordan, which at that time overflowed all his banks, 
 was divided, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:15">Jos. iii. 15</A>.

 Note, When the difficulties in the way of perfecting the salvation of
 Israel seem most insuperable, when they rise to the height, and 
 overflow, yet then God can put them by, break through them, and get 
 over them. Then <I>the deep uttered his voice,</I> when, the Red Sea 
 and Jordan being divided, the waters roared and made a noise, as if 
 they were sensible of the restraint they were under from proceeding in 
 their natural course, and complained of it. They <I>lifted up their 
 hands,</I> or sides, <I>on high</I> (for the waters <I>stood up on a 
 heap,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:16">Jos. iii. 16</A>),

 as if they would have made opposition to the orders given them. They
 <I>lifted up their voice, lifted up their waves;</I> but in vain.
 <I>The Lord on high was mightier than they,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+93:3,4">Ps. xciii. 3, 4</A>.

 With the dividing of the sea and Jordan, notice is again taken of the
 trembling of the mountains, as if the stop given to the waters gave a 
 shock to the adjacent hills; they are put together,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+114:3,4">Ps. cxiv. 3, 4</A>.

 When <I>the sea saw it and fled,</I> and <I>Jordan was driven back, the
 mountains skipped like rams and the little hills like lambs.</I> The 
 whole creation yielded; earth and waters trembled <I>at the presence of 
 the Lord, at the presence of the mighty God of Jacob.</I> But (as Mr.
 Cowley paraphrases it)</P>

 So here, <I>Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers;</I> channels were 
 made in the wilderness, such as seemed to cleave the earth, for the 
 waters to run in, which issued out of the rock, to supply the camp of 
 Israel, and which followed them in all their removes. Note, The God of 
 nature can alter and control the powers of nature, which way he 
 pleases, can turn waters into crystal rocks and rocks into crystal 
 streams.</P>

 V. He arrested the motion of the sun and moon, to befriend and complete 
 Israel's victories 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>The sun and moon stood still</I> at the prayer of Joshua, that the 
 Canaanites might not have the benefit of the night to favour their 
 escape; they <I>stood still in their habitation</I> in the heaven 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:4">Ps. xix. 4</A>),

 but with an eye to Gibeon and the <I>valley of Ajalon,</I> where God's
 work was in the doing, and of which they, though at so vast a distance, 
 attended the motions. <I>At the light,</I> at the direction, <I>of thy 
 arrows, they went,</I> and at <I>the shining of thy glittering 
 spear;</I> they followed Israel's arms, to favour them; according to 
 the intimation of the arrows God shot (as Jonathan's arrows,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:20">1 Sam. xx. 20</A>),

 and which way soever his spear pointed (the glittering light of which
 they acknowledged to outshine theirs) that way they directed their 
 influences, benign to Israel and malignant against their enemies, as 
 when <I>the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.</I> Note, The 
 heavenly bodies, as well as earth and seas, are at God's command, and, 
 when he pleases, at Israel's service too.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. He carried on and completed Israel's victories over the nations of 
 Canaan and their kings; he <I>slew great kings</I> and <I>famous,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:17,18">Ps. cxxxvi. 17, 18</A>.

 This is largely insisted upon here, as a proper plea with God to
 enforce the present petition, that he would restore them again to that 
 land which they were, at the expense of so many lives, so many 
 miracles, first put in possession of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Many expressions are here used to set forth the conquest of Canaan. 
 
 (1.) God's <I>bow was made quite naked,</I> taken out of the case, to 
 be employed for Israel; we should say, his <I>sword was quite 
 unsheathed,</I> not drawn out a little way, to frighten the enemy, and 
 then put up again, but quite drawn out, not to be returned till they 
 are all cut off. 

 (2.) He <I>marched through the land</I> from end to end, <I>in 
 indignation,</I> as scorning to let that wicked generation of 
 Canaanites any longer possess so good a land. He marched <I>cum 
 fastidio--with distaste</I> (so some), despising their confederacies.
 
 (3.) He <I>threshed the heathen in anger,</I> trod them down, nay, he
 trod them out, as corn in the floor, to give them, and what they had, 
 to be meat to his people Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+4:13">Mic. iv. 13</A>.

 (4.) He <I>wounded the heads out of the house of the wicked;</I> he
 destroyed the families of the Canaanites, and wounded their princes, 
 the heads of their families; nay, he cut off the heads, and so 
 <I>discovered the foundations of them,</I> even <I>to the neck.</I> Are 
 they a building? They are razed even to the foundation. Are they a 
 body? They are plunged into deep mire even to the neck, so that they 
 cannot get out, or help themselves. He <I>broke the heads of leviathan
 in pieces,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:14">Ps. lxxiv. 14</A>.

 Some apply this to Christ's victories over Satan and the powers of 
 darkness, in which he <I>wounded the heads over many countries,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:6">Ps. cx. 6</A>.

 (5.) He <I>struck through with his staves the head of the villages</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);

 with Israel's staves God <I>struck through</I> the <I>head of the 
 villages</I> of the enemies, whether Egypt or Canaan. Staves shall do 
 the same execution as swords when God pleases to make use of them. The
 enemy came out with the utmost force and fury, <I>as a whirlwind to 
 scatter me</I> (says Israel); for <I>many a time have they thus 
 afflicted me,</I> thus attacked me, <I>from my youth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+129:1">Ps. cxxix. 1</A>.
 
 Pharaoh, when he pursued Israel to the Red Sea, <I>came out as a
 whirlwind;</I> so did the kings of Canaan in their confederacies 
 against Israel. <I>Their rejoicing was as to devour the poor 
 secretly;</I> they were as confident of success in their enterprise as 
 ever any great man was of devouring a poor man, that was no way a match 
 for him; and his design against him was carried on with secrecy. But 
 God disappointed them, and their pride did but make their fall the more 
 shameful and God's care of his poor the more illustrious. 

 (6.) He <I>walked to the sea with his horses</I> (so some read it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 that is, he carried Israel's victories to the Great Sea, which was 
 opposite to that side of Canaan at which they entered, so that they 
 went quite through it, and made themselves masters of it all, or rather 
 God made them so, for they <I>got it not by their own sword,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:3">Ps. xliv. 3</A>.
 
 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. There were three things that God had a eye to, in giving Israel so 
 many bloody victories over the Canaanites:--

 (1.) He would hereby make good his promise to the fathers; it was 
 <I>according to the oaths of the tribes, even his word,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 He had sworn to give this land to the <I>tribes of Israel;</I> it was 
 his oath <I>to Isaac confirmed to Jacob,</I> and repeated many a time 
 to <I>the tribes of Israel, Unto thee will I give the land of 
 Canaan.</I> This word God will accomplish, though Israel be ever so 
 unworthy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:5">Deut. ix. 5</A>)

 and their enemies ever so many and mighty. Note, What God does for his
 tribes is according to the oaths of the tribes, according to what he
 has said and sworn to them; <I>for he is faithful that has
 promised.</I> 

 (2.) He would hereby show his kindness to <I>his people,</I> because of 
 their relation to him, and his interest in them: <I>Thou wentest forth 
 for the salvation of thy people,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 All the powers of nature are shaken, and the course of nature changed,
 and every thing seems to be thrown into disorder, and all is <I>for the 
 salvation of God's people.</I> There are a people in the world who are 
 God's people, and their salvation is that which he has in his eye in 
 all the operations of his providence. Heaven and earth shall sooner
 come together than any of the links in the golden chain of their 
 salvation shall be broken; and even that which seems most unlikely 
 shall by an overruling hand be made to work for their salvation, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:19">Phil. i. 19</A>.

 (3.) He would hereby give a type and figure of the redemption of the
 world by Jesus Christ. It is <I>for salvation with thy anointed,</I> 
 with Joshua, who led the armies of Israel and was a figure of him whose 
 name he bore, even Jesus our Joshua. What God did for his Israel of old 
 was done with an eye to his anointed, for the sake of the Mediator, who 
 was both the founder and foundation of the covenant made with them. It 
 was salvation <I>with him,</I> for in all the salvations wrought for 
 them, <I>God looked upon the face of the anointed,</I> and did them by 
 him.</P>

 Within the compass of these few lines we have the prophet in the 
 highest degree both of trembling and triumphing, such are the varieties 
 both of the state and of the spirit of God's people in this world. In 
 heaven there shall be no more trembling, but everlasting triumphs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The prophet had foreseen the prevalence of the church's enemies and 
 the long continuance of the church's troubles; and the sight made him 
 tremble, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Here he goes on with what he had said 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>,

 "<I>I have heard thy speech and was afraid. When I heard</I> what sad 
 times were coming upon the church <I>my belly trembled, my lips 
 quivered at the voice;</I> the news made such an impression that it put 
 me into a perfect ague fit." The blood retiring to the heart, to 
 succour that when it was ready to faint, the extreme parts were left 
 destitute of spirits, so that <I>his lips quivered.</I> Nay, he was so 
 weak, and so unable to help himself, that he was as if 
 <I>rottenness</I> had <I>entered into his bones;</I> he had no strength 
 left in him, could neither stand nor go; he <I>trembled in himself,</I> 
 trembled all over him, trembled within him; he yielded to his 
 trembling, and <I>troubled himself,</I> as our Savior did; his <I>flesh 
 trembled for fear of God</I> and <I>he was afraid of his judgments,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:120">Ps. cxix. 120</A>.

 He was touched with a tender concern for the calamities of the church,
 and trembled for fear lest they should end at length in ruin, and the 
 <I>name of Israel be blotted out.</I> Nor did he think it any 
 disparagement to him, nor any reproach to his courage, but freely owned 
 he was one of those that <I>trembled at God's word,</I> for to them he 
 will look with favour: <I>I tremble in myself, that I might rest in the 
 day of trouble.</I> Note, When we see a day of trouble approaching it 
 concerns us to provide accordingly, and to lay up something in store, 
 by the help of which we may rest in that day; and the best way to make 
 sure rest for ourselves in the day of trouble is to tremble within 
 ourselves at the word of God and the threatenings of that word. He that 
 has joy in store for those that <I>sow in tears</I> has rest in store 
 for those that tremble before him. <I>Good hope through grace</I> is 
 founded in a <I>holy fear.</I> Noah, who was <I>moved with fear,</I> 
 trembled within himself at the warning given him of the deluge coming, 
 had the ark for his resting place in the day of that trouble. The 
 prophet tells us what he said in his trembling. His fear is that,
 <I>when he comes up to the people,</I> when the <I>Chaldean comes up to 
 the people</I> of Israel, <I>he will invade them,</I> will surround 
 them, will break in upon them, nay (as it is in the margin), He will 
 <I>cut them in pieces with his troops;</I> he cried out, We are all 
 undone; the whole nation of the Jews is lost and gone. Note, When
 things look bad we are too apt to aggravate them, and make the worst of 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He had looked back upon the experiences of the church in former 
 ages, and had observed what great things God had done for them, and so 
 he recovered himself out of his fright, and not only retrieved his 
 temper, but fell into a transport of holy joy, with an express <I>non 
 obstante--notwithstanding</I> to the calamities he foresaw coming, and
 this not for himself only, but in the name of every faithful 
 Israelite.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He supposes the ruin of all his creature comforts and enjoyments, 
 not only of the delights of this life, but even of the necessary 
 supports of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Famine is one of the ordinary effects of war, and those commonly feel 
 it first and most that sit still and are quiet; the prophet and his 
 pious friends, when the Chaldean army comes, will be plundered and 
 stripped of all they have. Or he supposes himself deprived of all by 
 blasting and unseasonable weather, or some other immediate hand of God. 
 Or though the captives in Babylon have not that plenty of all good 
 things in their own land. 

 (1.) He supposes the fruit-tree to be withered and become barren; the 
 <I>fig-tree</I> (which used to furnish them with much of their food; 
 hence we often read of <I>cakes of figs</I>) shall not so much as 
 <I>blossom, nor shall fruit be in the vine,</I> from which they had 
 their drink, that made glad the heart: he supposes <I>the labour of the 
 olive</I> to <I>fail,</I> their oil, which was to them as butter is to 
 us; the <I>labour of the olive shall lie</I> (so it is in the margin); 
 their expectations from it shall be disappointed. 

 (2.) He supposes the bread-corn to fail; <I>the fields shall yield no 
 meat;</I> and, since <I>the king himself is served of the field,</I> if 
 the productions of that be withdrawn, every one will feel the want of 
 them. 

 (3.) He supposes the cattle to perish for want of the food which the 
 field should yield and does not, or by disease, or being destroyed and 
 carried away by the enemy: <I>The flock is cut off from the fold, and 
 there is no herd in the stall.</I> Note, When we are in the full 
 enjoyment of our creature comforts we should consider that there may 
 come a time when we shall be stripped of them all, and use them 
 accordingly, as not abusing them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:29,30">1 Cor. vii. 29, 30</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He resolves to delight and triumph in God notwithstanding; when all 
 is gone his God is not gone 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "<I>Yet will I rejoice in the Lord;</I> I shall have him to rejoice in, 
 and will rejoice in him." <I>Destroy the vines and the fig-trees,</I> 
 and you make all the mirth of a carnal heart to cease, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:11,12">Hos. ii. 11, 12</A>.
 
 But those who, when they were full, enjoyed God in all, when they are
 emptied and impoverished can <I>enjoy all in God,</I> and can sit down 
 upon a melancholy heap of the ruins of all their creature comforts and 
 even then can sing to the praise and glory of God, as the God of their 
 salvation. This is the principal ground of our joy in God, that he is 
 the God of our salvation, our eternal salvation, the salvation of the 
 soul; and, if he be so, we may rejoice in him as such in our greatest 
 distresses, since by them our salvation cannot be hindered, but may be 
 furthered. Note, Joy in God is never out of season, nay, it is in a 
 special manner seasonable when we meet with losses and crosses in the 
 world, that it may then appear that our hearts are not set upon these 
 things, nor our happiness bound up in them. See how the prophet 
 triumphs in God: <I>The Lord God is my strength,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 He that is the <I>God of our salvation</I> in another world will be our 
 strength in this world, to carry us on in our journey thither, and help 
 us over the difficulties and oppositions we meet with in our way. Even 
 when provisions are cut off, to make it appear that <I>man lives not by 
 bread alone,</I> we may have the want of bread supplied by the graces 
 and comforts of God's Spirit and with the supplies of them. 

 (1.) We shall be strong for our spiritual warfare and work: <I>The Lord 
 God is my strength,</I> the strength of my heart. 

 (2.) We shall be swift for our spiritual race: "<I>He will make my feet 
 like hinds' feet,</I> that with enlargement of heart I may run the way 
 of his commands and outrun my troubles." 

 (3.) We shall be successful in our spiritual enterprises: "<I>He will 
 make me to walk upon my high places;</I> that is, I shall gain my 
 point, shall be restored unto my own land, and tread upon the high 
 places of the enemy," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:13,33:29">Deut. xxxii. 13; xxxiii. 29</A>.

 Thus the prophet, who began his prayer with fear and trembling,
 concludes it with joy and triumph, for prayer is heart's ease to a 
 gracious soul. When Hannah had prayed she <I>went her way, and did eat, 
 and her countenance was no more sad.</I> This prophet, finding it so, 
 publishes his experience of it, and puts it into the hand of the 
 <I>chief singer</I> for the use of the church, especially in the day of 
 our captivity. And, though then the harps were hung upon the 
 willow-trees, yet in the hope that they would be resumed, and their 
 right hand retrieve its cunning, which it had forgotten, he set his 
 song upon <I>Shigionoth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 wandering tunes, <I>according to the variable songs,</I> and upon 
 <I>Neginoth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 <I>the stringed instruments.</I> He that is afflicted, and has prayed 
 aright, may then be so easy, may then be so merry, as to sing 
 psalms.</P>
