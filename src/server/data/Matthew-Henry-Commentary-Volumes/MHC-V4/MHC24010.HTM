 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may conjecture that the prophecy of this chapter was delivered after 
 the first captivity, in the time of Jeconiah or Jehoiachin, when many 
 were carried away to Babylon; for it has a double reference:--

 I. To those that were carried away into the land of the Chaldeans, a
 country notorious above any other for idolatry and superstition; and 
 they are here cautioned against the infection of the place, not to 
 learn the way of the heathen 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>),

 for their astrology and idolatry are both foolish things

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>),

 and the worshippers of idols brutish, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:8,9">ver. 8, 9</A>.

 So it will appear in the day of their visitation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:14,15">ver. 14, 15</A>.

 They are likewise exhorted to adhere firmly to the God of Israel, for
 there is none like him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>.

 He is the true God, lives for ever, and has the government of the world
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:10-13">ver. 10-13</A>),

 and his people are happy in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:16">ver. 16</A>.

 II. To those that yet remained in their own land. They are cautioned
 against security, and told to expect distress 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:17,18">ver. 17, 18</A>)

 and that by a foreign enemy, which God would bring upon them for their
 sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:20-22">ver. 20-22</A>.

 This calamity the prophet laments 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:19">ver. 19</A>) 

 and prays for the mitigation of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:23-25">ver. 23-25</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Hear ye the word which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> speaketh unto you, O house of
 Israel:
 &nbsp; 2  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be
 not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed
 at them.
 &nbsp; 3  For the customs of the people <I>are</I> vain: for <I>one</I> cutteth a
 tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman,
 with the axe.
 &nbsp; 4  They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with
 nails and with hammers, that it move not.
 &nbsp; 5  They <I>are</I> upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must
 needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them;
 for they cannot do evil, neither also <I>is it</I> in them to do good.
 &nbsp; 6  Forasmuch as <I>there is</I> none like unto thee, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; thou
 <I>art</I> great, and thy name <I>is</I> great in might.
 &nbsp; 7  Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth
 it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise <I>men</I> of the
 nations, and in all their kingdoms, <I>there is</I> none like unto
 thee.
 &nbsp; 8  But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock <I>is</I> a
 doctrine of vanities.
 &nbsp; 9  Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold
 from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the
 founder: blue and purple <I>is</I> their clothing: they <I>are</I> all the
 work of cunning <I>men.</I>
 &nbsp; 10  But the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> the true God, he <I>is</I> the living God, and
 an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and
 the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.
 &nbsp; 11  Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the
 heavens and the earth, <I>even</I> they shall perish from the earth,
 and from under these heavens.
 &nbsp; 12  He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the
 world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his
 discretion.
 &nbsp; 13  When he uttereth his voice, <I>there is</I> a multitude of waters
 in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the
 ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth
 forth the wind out of his treasures.
 &nbsp; 14  Every man is brutish in <I>his</I> knowledge: every founder is
 confounded by the graven image: for his molten image <I>is</I>
 falsehood, and <I>there is</I> no breath in them.
 &nbsp; 15  They <I>are</I> vanity, <I>and</I> the work of errors: in the time of
 their visitation they shall perish.
 &nbsp; 16  The portion of Jacob <I>is</I> not like them: for he <I>is</I> the
 former of all <I>things;</I> and Israel <I>is</I> the rod of his
 inheritance: The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts <I>is</I> his name.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet Isaiah, when he prophesied of the captivity in Babylon, 
 added warnings against idolatry and largely exposed the sottishness of 
 idolaters, not only because the temptations in Babylon would be in 
 danger of drawing the Jews there to idolatry, but because the 
 afflictions in Babylon were designed to cure them of their idolatry. 
 Thus the prophet Jeremiah here arms people against the idolatrous 
 usages and customs of the heathen, not only for the use of those that 
 had gone to Babylon, but of those also that staid behind, that being 
 convinced and reclaimed, by the word of God, the rod might be 
 prevented; and it is <I>written for our learning.</I> Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A solemn charge given to the people of God not to conform themselves 
 to the ways and customs of the heathen. Let the house of Israel hear 
 and receive this word from the God of Israel: "<I>Learn not the way of 
 the heathen,</I> do not approve of it, no, nor think indifferently 
 concerning it, much less imitate it or accustom yourselves to it. Let 
 not any of their customs steal in among you (as they are apt to do 
 insensibly) nor mingle themselves with your religion." Note, It ill 
 becomes those that are taught of God to <I>learn the way of the 
 heathen,</I> and to think of worshipping the true God with such rites 
 and ceremonies as they used in the worship of their false gods. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:29-31">Deut. xii. 29-31</A>.

 It was the way of the heathen to worship the host of heaven, the sun,
 moon, and stars; to them they gave divine honours, and from them they 
 expected divine favours, and therefore, according as <I>the signs of 
 heaven</I> were, whether they were auspicious or ominous, they thought 
 themselves countenanced or discountenanced by their deities, which 
 made them observe those signs, the eclipses of the sun and moon, the 
 conjunctions and oppositions of the planets, and all the unusual 
 phenomena of the celestial globe, with a great deal of anxiety and 
 trembling. Business was stopped if any thing occurred that was thought 
 to bode ill; if it did but thunder on their left hand, they were almost 
 as if they had been thunderstruck. Now God would not have his people to 
 be <I>dismayed at the signs of heaven,</I> to reverence the stars as 
 deities, nor to frighten themselves with any prognostications grounded 
 upon them. Let them fear the God of heaven, and keep up a reverence of 
 his providence, and then they need not be <I>dismayed at the signs of 
 heaven,</I> for the <I>stars in their courses</I> fight not against any 
 that are at peace with God. The heathen are dismayed at these signs, 
 for they know no better; but let not the <I>house of Israel,</I> that 
 are taught of God, be so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Divers good reasons given to enforce this charge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The way of the heathen is very ridiculous and absurd, and is 
 condemned even by the dictates of right reason, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 The statutes and ordinances of the heathen are vanity itself; they 
 cannot stand the test of a rational disquisition. This is again and 
 again insisted upon here, as it was by Isaiah. The Chaldeans valued 
 themselves upon their wisdom, in which they thought that they excelled 
 all their neighbours; but the prophet here shows that they, and all 
 others that worshipped idols and expected help and relief from them, 
 were brutish and sottish, and had not common sense. 

 (1.) Consider what the idol is that is worshipped. It was a <I>tree cut 
 out of the forest</I> originally. It was fitted up by <I>the hands of 
 the workman,</I> squared, and sawed, and worked into shape; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:12">Isa. xliv. 12</A>,

 &c. But, after all, it was but the stock of a tree, fitter to make a
 gate-post of than any thing else. But, to hide the wood, <I>they deck 
 it with silver and gold,</I> they gild or lacquer it, or they deck it 
 with gold and silver lace, or cloth of tissue. <I>They fasten it</I> to 
 its place, which they themselves have assigned it, <I>with nails and 
 hammers,</I> that it fall not, nor be thrown down, nor stolen away, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 The image is made straight enough, and it cannot be denied but that the 
 workman did his part, for it <I>is upright as the palm-tree</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>);

 it looks stately, and stands up as if it were going to speak to you, 
 but it <I>cannot speak;</I> it is a poor dumb creature; nor can it take 
 one step towards your relief. If there be any occasion for it to shift 
 its place, it must be carried in procession, for it <I>cannot go.</I> 
 Very fitly does the admonition come in here, "<I>Be not afraid of 
 them,</I> any more than of the signs of heaven; be not afraid of 
 incurring their displeasure, for <I>they can do no evil;</I> be not 
 afraid of forfeiting their favour, <I>for neither is it in them to do 
 good.</I> If you think to mend the matter by mending the materials of 
 which the idol is made, you deceive yourselves. Idols of gold and
 silver are an unworthy to be worshipped as wooden gods. <I>The stock is 
 a doctrine of vanities,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 It teaches lies, teaches lies concerning God. It is <I>an instruction 
 of vanities; it is wood.</I>" It is probable that the idols of gold and 
 silver had wood underneath for the substratum, and then <I>silver 
 spread into plates is brought from Tarshish,</I> imported from beyond 
 sea, <I>and gold from Uphaz,</I> or <I>Phaz,</I> which is sometimes 
 rendered the <I>fine</I> or <I>pure gold,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:3">Ps. xxi. 3</A>.

 A great deal of art is used, and pains taken, about it. They are not
 such ordinary mechanics that are employed about these as about the 
 wooden gods,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 These are cunning men; it is <I>the work of the workman;</I> the graver
 must do his part when it has passed through <I>the hands of the 
 founder.</I> Those were but decked here and there with silver and gold; 
 these are silver and gold all over. And, that these gods might be 
 reverenced as kings, <I>blue and purple are their clothing,</I> the 
 colour of royal robes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),
 
 which amuses ignorant worshippers, but makes the matter no better. For 
 what is the idol when it is made and when they have made the best they 
 can of it? He tells us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>They are falsehood;</I> they are not what they pretend to be, but a 
 great cheat put upon the world. They are worshipped as the gods that 
 give us breath and life and sense, whereas they are lifeless senseless 
 things themselves, and <I>there is no breath in them;</I> there is 
 <I>no spirit in them</I> (so the word is); they are not animated, or 
 inhabited, as they are supposed to be, by any <I>divine spirit</I> or 
 <I>numen--divinity.</I> They are so far from being gods that they have 
 not so much as the <I>spirit of a beast that goes downward. They are 
 vanity, and the work of errors,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Enquire into the use of them and you will find they are vanity; they
 are good for nothing; no help is to be expected from them nor any 
 confidence put in them. They are a <I>deceitful work, works of 
 illusions,</I> or <I>mere mockeries;</I> so some read the following 
 clause. They <I>delude</I> those that put their trust in them, make 
 fools of them, or, rather, they make fools of themselves. Enquire into 
 the use of them and you will find they are <I>the work of errors,</I> 
 grounded upon the grossest mistakes that ever men who pretended to 
 reason were guilty of. They are the creatures of a deluded fancy; and
 the errors by which they were produced they propagate among their 
 worshippers. 

 (2.) Infer hence what the idolaters are that worship these idols.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>They are altogether brutish and foolish.</I> Those that make them 
 are like unto them, senseless and stupid, and there is no spirit in 
 them--no use of reason, else they would never stoop to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 
 <I>Every man</I> that makes or worships idols has become <I>brutish in 
 his knowledge,</I> that is, brutish for want of knowledge, or brutish 
 in that very thing which one would think they should be fully 
 acquainted with; compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:10">Jude 10</A>,

 <I>What they know naturally,</I> what they cannot but know by the light
 of nature, <I>in those things as brute beasts they corrupt 
 themselves.</I> Though in the works of creation they cannot but see the 
 eternal power and godhead of the Creator, yet they have become <I>vain 
 in their imaginations, not liking to retain God in their knowledge.</I> 
 See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:21,28">Rom. i. 21, 28</A>.

 Nay, whereas they thought it a piece of wisdom thus to multiply gods,
 it really was the greatest folly they could be guilty of. <I>The world 
 by wisdom knew not God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:21,Ro+1:22">1 Cor. i. 21; Rom. i. 22</A>.
 
 <I>Every founder</I> is himself <I>confounded by the graven image;</I>
 when he has made it by a mistake he is more and more confirmed in his 
 mistake by it; he is bewildered, bewitched, and cannot disentangle 
 himself from the snare; or it is what he will one time or other be 
 ashamed of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The God of Israel is the one only living and true God, and those
 that have him for their God need not make their application to any 
 other; nay, to set up any other in competition with him is the greatest 
 affront and injury that can be done him. Let the house of Israel cleave 
 to the God of Israel and serve and worship him only, for,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He is a non-such. Whatever men may set in competition with him, 
 there is none to be compared with him. The prophet turns from speaking 
 with the utmost disdain of the idols of the heathen (as well he might) 
 to speak with the most profound and awful reverence of the God of 
 Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>):

 "<I>Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O Lord!</I> none of all 
 the heroes which the heathen have deified and make such ado about," the 
 dead men of whom they made dead images, and whom they worshipped.
 "Some were deified and adored for their wisdom; but, <I>among all the 
 wise men of the nations,</I> the greatest philosophers or statesmen, as 
 Apollo or Hermes, <I>there is none like thee.</I> Others were deified 
 and adored for their dominion; but, <I>in all their royalty</I>" (so it 
 may be read), "among all their kings, as Saturn and Jupiter, <I>there 
 is none like unto thee.</I>" What is the glory of a man that invented a 
 useful art or founded a flourishing kingdom (and these were grounds 
 sufficient among the heathen to entitle a man to an apotheosis) 
 compared with the glory of him that is the Creator of the world and 
 that <I>forms the spirit of man within him?</I> What is the glory of 
 the greatest prince or potentate, compared with the glory of him whose 
 <I>kingdom rules over all?</I> He acknowledges 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 <I>O Lord! thou art great,</I> infinite and immense, and <I>thy name is 
 great in might;</I> thou hast all power, and art known to have it. 
 Men's name is often beyond their might; they are thought to be greater 
 than they are; but God's <I>name is great,</I> and no greater than he 
 really is. And therefore <I>who would not fear thee, O King of 
 nations?</I> Who would not choose to worship such a God as this, that 
 can do every thing, rather than such dead idols as the heathen worship, 
 that can do nothing? Who would not be afraid of offending or forsaking 
 a God whose name is so <I>great in might?</I> Which of all the nations, 
 if they understood their interests aright, <I>would not fear him</I> 
 who is the <I>King of nations?</I> Note, There is an admirable decency 
 and congruity in the worshipping of God only. It is fit that he who is 
 God alone should alone be served, that he who is Lord of all should be 
 served by all, that he who is great should be greatly feared and 
 greatly praised.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) His verity is as evident as the idol's vanity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 They are the work of men's hands, and therefore nothing is more plain 
 than that it is a jest to worship them, if that may be called a jest 
 which is so great an indignity to him that made us: <I>But the Lord is 
 the true God,</I> the God of truth; he is God in truth. <I>God Jehovah 
 is truth;</I> he is not a counterfeit and pretender, as they are, but 
 is really what he has revealed himself to be; he is one we may depend 
 upon, in whom and by whom we cannot be deceived.

 [1.] Look upon him as he is in himself, and he is <I>the living 
 God.</I> He is life itself, has life in himself, and is the fountain of 
 life to all the creatures. The gods of the heathen are dead things,
 worthless and useless, but ours is a living God, and hath immortality.

 [2.] Look upon him with relation to his creatures, he is a <I>King,</I> 
 and absolute monarch, over them all, is their owner and ruler, has an 
 incontestable right both to command them and dispose of them. As a 
 king, he protects the creatures, provides for their welfare, and 
 preserves peace among them. He is <I>an everlasting king.</I> The
 counsels of his kingdom were from everlasting and the continuance of it 
 will be to everlasting. He is a <I>King of eternity.</I> The idols whom 
 they call their kings are but of yesterday, and will soon be abolished; 
 and the kings of the earth, that set them up to be worshipped, will 
 themselves be in the dust shortly; but <I>the Lord shall reign for 
 ever, thy God, O Zion! unto all generations.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) None knows the power of his anger. Let us stand in awe, and not 
 dare to provoke him by giving that glory to another which is due to him 
 alone; for <I>at his wrath the earth shall tremble,</I> even the 
 strongest and stoutest of the kings of the earth; nay, the earth, 
 firmly as it is fixed, when he pleases is made to quake and the rocks 
 to tremble, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:32,Hab+3:6,10">Ps. civ. 32; Hab. iii. 6, 10</A>.

 Though the nations should join together to contend with him, and unite
 their force, yet they would be found utterly unable not only to resist, 
 but even <I>to abide his indignation.</I> Not only can they not make 
 head against it, for it would overcome them, but they cannot bear up 
 under it, for it would overload them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:7,8,Na+1:6">Ps. lxxvi. 7, 8; Nah. i. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) He is the God of nature, the fountain of all being; and all the
 powers of nature are at his command and disposal, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.

 The God we worship is he that made the heavens and the earth, and has a 
 sovereign dominion over both; so that his <I>invisible things</I> are 
 manifested and proved in the <I>things that are seen.</I>

 [1.] If we look back, we find that the whole world owed its origin to 
 him as its first cause. It was a common saying even among the 
 Greeks--<I>He that sets up to be another god ought first to make 
 another world.</I> While the heathen worship gods that they made, we 
 worship the God that made us and all things. <I>First, The earth</I> is 
 a body of vast bulk, has valuable treasures in its bowels and more 
 valuable fruit on its surface. It and them he has <I>made by his 
 power;</I> and it is by no less than an infinite power that it <I>hangs 
 upon nothing,</I> as it does 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+26:7">Job xxvi. 7</A>)--

 <I>ponderibus librata suis--poised by its own weight. Secondly, The
 world,</I> the habitable part of the earth, is admirably fitted for the 
 use and service of man, and <I>he hath established it</I> so <I>by his 
 wisdom,</I> so that it continues serviceable in constant changes and 
 yet a continual stability from one generation to another. Therefore 
 both the earth and the world are his, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:1">Ps. xxiv. 1</A>.

 <I>Thirdly, The heavens</I> are wonderfully <I>stretched out</I> to an
 incredible extent, and it is <I>by his discretion</I> that they are so, 
 and that the motions of the heavenly bodies are directed for the 
 benefit of this lower world. These <I>declare his glory</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:1">Ps. xix. 1</A>),

 and oblige us to declare it, and not give that glory to the heavens
 which is due to him that made them.

 [2.] If we look up, we see his providence to be a continued creation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>When he uttereth his voice</I> (gives the word of command) <I>there 
 is a multitude of waters in the heavens,</I> which are poured out on 
 the earth, whether for judgment or mercy, as he intends them. When he 
 utters his voice in the thunder, immediately there follow 
 thunder-showers, in which there are a multitude of waters; and those 
 come with <I>a noise,</I> as the margin reads it; and we read of the 
 <I>noise of abundance of rain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:41">1 Kings xviii. 41</A>.

 Nay, there are wonders done daily in the kingdom of nature without
 noise: <I>He causes the vapours to ascend from the ends of the 
 earth,</I> from all parts of the earth, even the most remote, and 
 chiefly those that lie next the sea. All the earth pays the tribute of
 vapours, because all the earth receives the blessing of rain. And thus 
 the moisture in the universe, like the money in a kingdom and the blood 
 in the body, is continually circulating for the good of the whole.
 Those vapours produce wonders, for of them are formed <I>lightnings for 
 the rain,</I> and <I>the winds</I> which God from time to time 
 <I>brings forth out of his treasures,</I> as there is occasion for 
 them, directing them all in such measure and for such use as he thinks 
 fit, as payments are made out of the treasury. All the meteors are so 
 ready to serve God's purposes that he seems to have treasures of them, 
 that cannot be exhausted and may at any time be drawn from, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:7">Ps. cxxxv. 7</A>.
 
 God glories in the treasures he has of these,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:22,23">Job xxxviii. 22, 23</A>.

 This God can do; but which of the idols of the heathen can do the like?
 Note, There is no sort of weather but what furnishes us with a proof 
 and instance of the wisdom and power of the great Creator.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) This God is Israel's God in covenant, and the felicity of every 
 Israelite indeed. Therefore let the house of Israel cleave to him, and
 not forsake him to embrace idols; for, if they do, they certainly 
 change for the worse, for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 <I>the portion of Jacob is not like them;</I> their rock is not as our 
 rock 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:31">Deut. xxxii. 31</A>),
 
 nor ours like their mole-hills. Note,

 [1.] Those that have the Lord for their God have a full and complete 
 happiness in him. The <I>God of Jacob</I> is the <I>portion of 
 Jacob;</I> he is his all, and in him he has enough and needs no more in 
 this world nor the other. In him we have a worthy portion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:5">Ps. xvi. 5</A>.

 [2.] If we have entire satisfaction and complacency in God as our 
 portion, he will have a gracious delight in us as his people, whom he 
 owns as <I>the rod of his inheritance,</I> his possession and treasure, 
 with whom he dwells and by whom he is served and honoured.

 [3.] It is the unspeakable comfort of all the Lord's people that he who 
 is their God is <I>the former of all things,</I> and therefore is able 
 to do all that for them, and give all that to them, which they stand in 
 need of. Their <I>help stands in his name who made heaven and 
 earth.</I> And he is the <I>Lord of hosts,</I> of all the hosts in 
 heaven and earth, has them all at his command, and will command them 
 into the service of his people when there is occasion. This is the
 name by which they know him, which they first give him the glory of and 
 then take to themselves the comfort of.

 [4.] Herein God's people are happy above all other people, happy 
 indeed, <I>bona si sua norint--did they but know their blessedness.</I> 
 The gods which the heathen pride, and please, and so portion themselves 
 in, are vanity and a lie; but <I>the portion of Jacob is not like 
 them.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The prophet, having thus compared the gods of the heathen with the 
 God of Israel (between whom there is no comparison), reads the doom, 
 the certain doom, of all those pretenders, and directs the Jews, in 
 God's name, to read it to the worshippers of idols, though they were 
 their lords and masters 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>Thus shall you say unto them</I> (and the God you serve will bear 
 you out in saying it), <I>The gods which have not made the heavens and 
 the earth</I> (and therefore are no gods, but usurpers of the honour 
 due to him only who did make heaven and earth) <I>shall perish,</I> 
 perish of course, because they are vanity--perish by his righteous 
 sentence, because they are rivals with him. As gods they shall perish 
 <I>from off the earth</I> (even all those things <I>on earth 
 beneath</I> which they make gods of) <I>and from under these 
 heavens,</I> even all those things in the firmament of heaven, under 
 the highest heavens, which are deified, according to the distribution 
 in the second commandment. These words in the original are not in the 
 Hebrew, like all the rest, but in the Chaldee dialect, that the Jews in 
 captivity might have this ready to say to the Chaldeans in their own 
 language when they tempted them to idolatry: "Do you press us to 
 worship your gods? We will never do that; for," 

 (1.) "They are counterfeit deities; they are no gods, for they <I>have 
 not made the heavens and the earth,</I> and therefore are not entitled 
 to our homage, nor are we indebted to them either for the products of 
 the earth or the influences of heaven, as we are to the God of Israel." 
 The primitive Christians would say, when they were urged to worship 
 such a god, <I>Let him make a world and he shall be my god.</I> While 
 we have him to worship who made heaven and earth, it is very absurd to 
 worship any other. 

 (2.) "They are condemned deities. They <I>shall perish;</I> the time 
 shall come when they shall be no more respected as they are now, but 
 shall be buried in oblivion, and they and their worshippers shall sink 
 together. The earth shall no longer bear them; the heavens shall no 
 longer cover them; but both shall abandon them." It is repeated

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 <I>In the time of their visitation</I> they shall perish. When God 
 comes to reckon with idolaters he will make them weary of their idols, 
 and glad to be rid of them. They shall <I>cast them to the moles and to 
 the bats,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:20">Isa. ii. 20</A>.

 Whatever runs against God and religion will be run down at last.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The prophet threatens, in God's name, the approaching ruin of Judah 
 and Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.

 The Jews that continued in their own land, after some were carried into 
 captivity, were very secure; they thought themselves <I>inhabitants of 
 a fortress;</I> their country was their strong hold, and, in their own 
 conceit, impregnable; but they are here told to think of leaving it: 
 they must prepare to go after their brethren, and pack up their effects 
 in expectation of it: "<I>Gather up thy wares out of the land;</I> 
 contract your affairs, and bring them into as small a compass as you 
 can. <I>Arise, depart, this is not your rest,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+2:10">Mic. ii. 10</A>.

 Let not what you have lie scattered, for the Chaldeans will be upon you
 again, to be the executioners of the sentence God has passed upon you

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "<I>Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this 
 once;</I> they have hitherto dropped out, by a few at a time, but one 
 captivity more shall make a thorough riddance, and they shall be slung 
 out as a stone out of a sling, so easily, so thoroughly shall they be 
 cast out; nothing of them shall remain. They shall be thrown out with
 violence, and driven to a place at a great distance off, in a little 
 time." See this comparison used to signify an utter destruction, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:29">1 Sam. xxv. 29</A>.

 <I>Yet once more</I> God will shake their land, and <I>shake the wicked
 out of it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:26">Heb. xii. 26</A>.

 He adds, <I>And I will distress them, that they may find it so.</I> He
 will not only throw them out hence (that he may do and yet they may be 
 easy elsewhere); but, whithersoever they go, trouble shall follow them; 
 they shall be continually perplexed and straitened, and at a loss 
 within themselves: and who or what can make those easy whom God <I>will 
 distress,</I> whom he will distress <I>that they may find it so,</I> 
 that they may feel that which they would not believe? They were often 
 told of the weight of God's wrath and their utter inability to make 
 head against it, or bear up under it. They were told that their sin 
 would be their ruin, and they would not regard nor credit what was told 
 them; but now <I>they shall find it so;</I> and <I>therefore</I> God 
 will pursue them with his judgments, <I>that they may find it so,</I> 
 and be forced to acknowledge it. Note, sooner or later sinners will 
 find it just as the word of God has represented things to them, and no 
 better, and that the threatenings were not bugbears.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He brings in the people sadly lamenting their calamities 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):
 
 <I>Woe is me for my hurt!</I> Some make this the prophet's own 
 lamentation, not for himself, but for the calamities and desolations of 
 his country. He mourned for those that would not be persuaded to mourn 
 for themselves; and, since there were none that had so much sense as to 
 join with them, he weeps in secret, and cries out, <I>Woe is me!</I> In 
 mournful times it becomes us to be of a mournful spirit. But it may be 
 taken as the language of the people, considered as a body, and 
 therefore speaking as a single person. The prophet puts into their 
 mouths the words they <I>should</I> say; whether they would say them or 
 no, they should have cause to say them. Some among them would thus 
 bemoan themselves, and all of them, at last, would be forced to do it. 

 1. They lament that the affliction is very great, and it is very hard 
 to them to bear it, the more hard because they had not been used to 
 trouble and now did not expect it: "<I>Woe is me for my hurt,</I> not 
 for what I fear, but for what I feel;" for they are not, as some are, 
 worse frightened than hurt. Nor is it a slight hurt, but <I>a 
 wound,</I> a wound that is <I>grievous,</I> very painful, and very 
 threatening. 

 2. That there is no remedy but patience. They cannot help themselves, 
 but must sit still, and abide it: <I>But I said,</I> when I was about 
 to complain of my wound, To what purpose is it to complain? <I>This is
 a grief, and I must bear it</I> as well as I can. This is the language 
 rather of a sullen than of a gracious submission, of a patience per 
 force, not a patience by principle. When I am in affliction I should 
 say, "This is an evil, and I will bear it, because it is the will of 
 God that I should, because his wisdom has appointed this for me and his 
 grace will make it work for good to me." This is <I>receiving evil</I> 
 at the hand of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+2:10">Job ii. 10</A>.

 But to say, "This is an evil, <I>and I must bear it,</I> because I
 cannot help it," is but a brutal patience, and argues a want of those 
 good thoughts of God which we should always have, even under our 
 afflictions, saying, not only, God can and will do what he pleases, 
 but, <I>Let him do what he pleases.</I>

 3. That the country was quite ruined and wasted

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):
 
 <I>My tabernacle is spoiled.</I> Jerusalem, though a strong city, now 
 proves as weak and moveable as a tabernacle or tent, when it is taken 
 down, and <I>all its cords,</I> that should keep it together, are 
 <I>broken.</I> Or by the tabernacle here may be meant the temple, the 
 sanctuary, which at first was but a tabernacle, and is now called so, 
 as then it was sometimes called a temple. Their church is ruined, and 
 all the supports of it fail. It was a general destruction of church and 
 state, city and country, and there were none to repair these 
 desolations. "<I>My children have gone forth of me;</I> some have fled, 
 others are slain, others carried into captivity, so that as to me, 
 <I>they are not;</I> I am likely to be an outcast, and to perish for 
 want of shelter; for <I>there is none to stretch forth my tent any 
 more,</I> none of my children that used to do it for me, <I>none to set 
 up my curtains,</I> none to do me any service." <I>Jerusalem has none 
 to guide her of all her sons,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:18">Isa. li. 18</A>.

 4. That the rulers took no care, nor any proper measures, for the 
 redress of their grievances and the re-establishing of heir ruined 
 state

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>The pastors have become brutish.</I> When the tents, the shepherds' 
 tents, were spoiled 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 it concerned the shepherds to look after them; but they were foolish 
 shepherds. Their kings and princes had no regard at all for the public 
 welfare, seemed to have no sense of the desolations of the land, but 
 were quite besotted and infatuated. The priests, the pastors of God's 
 tabernacle, did a great deal towards the ruin of religion, but nothing 
 towards the repair of it. They are <I>brutish</I> indeed, for <I>they 
 have not sought the Lord;</I> they have neither made their peace with 
 him nor their prayer to him; they had no eye to him and his providence, 
 in their management of affairs; they neither acknowledged the judgment, 
 nor expected the deliverance, to come from his hand. Note, Those are 
 brutish people that do not seek the Lord, that live without prayer, and 
 live without God in the world. Every man is either a saint or a brute.
 But it is sad indeed with a people when their pastors, that should 
 <I>feed them with knowledge and understanding,</I> are themselves thus 
 brutish. And what comes of it? <I>Therefore they shall not
 prosper;</I> none of their attempts for the public safety shall 
 succeed. Note, Those cannot expect to prosper who do not by faith and 
 prayer take God along with them in all their ways. And, when the
 pastors are brutish, what else can be expected but that <I>all their 
 flocks</I> should be <I>scattered? For, if the blind lead the blind, 
 both will fall into the ditch.</I> The ruin of a people is often owing 
 to the brutishness of their pastors. 

 5. That the report of the enemy's approach was very dreadful

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>The noise of the bruit has come,</I> of the report which at first 
 was but whispered and bruited abroad, as wanting confirmation. It now 
 proves too true: <I>A great commotion</I> arises <I>out of the north 
 country,</I> which threatens to make all <I>the cities of Judah 
 desolate and a den of dragons;</I> for they must all expect to be 
 sacrificed to the avarice and fury of the Chaldean army. And what else 
 can that place expect but to be made a den of dragons which has by sin 
 made itself a den of thieves?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He turns to God, and addresses himself to him, finding it to 
 little purpose to speak to the people. It is some comfort to poor 
 ministers that, if men will not hear them, God will; and to him they 
 have liberty of access at all times. Let them close their preaching 
 with prayer, as the prophet, and then they shall have no reason to say 
 that they have laboured in vain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The prophet here acknowledges the sovereignty and dominion of the 
 divine Providence, that by it, and not by their own will and wisdom, 
 the affairs both of nations and particular persons are directed and 
 determined, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 This is an article of our faith which it is very proper for us to make 
 confession of at the throne of grace when we are complaining of an 
 affliction or suing for a mercy: "<I>O Lord, I know,</I> and believe, 
 <I>that the way of man is not in himself;</I> Nebuchadnezzar did not 
 come of himself against our land, but by the direction of a divine 
 Providence." We cannot of ourselves do any thing for our own relief, 
 unless God work with us and command deliverance for us; for <I>it is 
 not in man that walketh to direct his steps,</I> though he seem in his 
 walking to be perfectly at liberty and to choose his own way. Those 
 that had promised themselves a long enjoyment of their estates and 
 possessions were made to know, by sad experience, when they were thrown 
 out by the Chaldeans, that <I>the way of man is not in himself;</I> he 
 designs which men lay deep, and think well-formed, are dashed to pieces 
 in a moment. We must all apply this to ourselves, and mix faith with 
 it, that we are not at our own disposal, but under a divine direction; 
 the event is often overruled so as to be quite contrary to our 
 intention and expectation. We are not masters of our own way, nor can 
 we think that every thing should be according to our mind; we must 
 therefore refer ourselves to God and acquiesce in his will. Some think 
 that the prophet here mentions this with a design to make this 
 comfortable use of it, that, the way of the Chaldean army being not in 
 themselves, they can do no more than God permits them; he can set 
 bounds to thee proud waves, and say, <I>Hitherto they shall come, and 
 no further.</I> And a quieting consideration it is that the most 
 formidable enemies have <I>no power against us but what is given them 
 from above.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He deprecates the divine wrath, that it might not fall upon God's 
 Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 He speaks not for himself only, but on the behalf of his people: <I>O 
 Lord, correct me, but with judgment</I> (in measure and with 
 moderation, and in wisdom, no more than is necessary for driving out of 
 the foolishness that is bound up in our hearts), <I>not in thy 
 anger</I> (how severe soever the correction be, let it come from thy 
 love, and be designed for our good and made to work for good), not to 
 <I>bring us to nothing,</I> but to bring us home to thyself. Let it not 
 be according to the desert of our sins, but according to the design of 
 thy grace. Note, 

 (1.) We cannot pray in faith that we may never be corrected, while we 
 are conscious to ourselves that we need correction and deserve it, and 
 know that as many as God loves he chastens. 

 (2.) The great thing we should dread in affliction is the wrath of God. 
 Say not, Lord, <I>do not correct</I> me, but, Lord, do not correct me 
 <I>in anger;</I> for that will infuse wormwood and gall into the 
 affliction and misery that will <I>bring us to nothing.</I> We may bear 
 the smart of his rod, but we cannot bear the weight of his wrath.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He imprecates the divine wrath against the oppressors and 
 persecutors of Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not.</I> This 
 prayer does not come from a spirit of malice or revenge, nor is it 
 intended to prescribe to God whom he should execute his judgments upon, 
 or in what order; but, 

 (1.) It is an appeal to his justice. As if he had said, "Lord, we are a 
 provoking people; but are there not other nations that are more so? And 
 shall we only be punished? We are thy children, and may expect a 
 fatherly correction; but they are thy enemies, and against them we have 
 reason to think thy indignation should be, not against us." This is 
 God's usual method. The <I>cup put into the hands</I> of God's people 
 is <I>full of mixtures,</I> mixtures of mercy; but the <I>dregs of the 
 cup</I> are reserved for <I>the wicked of the earth,</I> let them 
 <I>wring them out,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+75:8">Ps. lxxv. 8</A>.

 (2.) It is a prediction of God's judgments upon all the impenitent 
 enemies of his church and kingdom. If <I>judgment begin</I> thus <I>at 
 the house of God,</I> what shall be <I>the end of those that obey not 
 his gospel?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:17">1 Pet. iv. 17</A>.

 See how the heathen are described, on whom God's fury shall be poured
 out.

 [1.] They are strangers to God, and are content to be so. They <I>know
 him not,</I> nor desire to know him. They are families that live
 without prayer, that have nothing of religion among them; they <I>call 
 not on God's name.</I> Those that restrain prayer prove that they know 
 not God; for those that know him will seek to him and entreat his 
 favour.

 [2.] They are persecutors of the people of God and are resolved to be 
 so. <I>They have eaten up Jacob</I> with as much greediness as those 
 that are hungry eat their necessary food; nay, with more, they have 
 <I>devoured him, and consumed him, and made his habitation 
 desolate,</I> that is, the land in which he lives, or the temple of 
 God, which is his habitation among them. Note, What the heathen, in
 their rage and malice, do against the people of God, though therein he 
 makes use of them as the instruments of his correction, yet he will, 
 for that, make them the objects of his indignation. This prayer is 
 taken from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:6,7">Ps. lxxix. 6, 7</A>.</P>
