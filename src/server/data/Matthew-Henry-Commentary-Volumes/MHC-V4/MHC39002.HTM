 There are two great ordinances which divine wisdom has instituted, the 
 wretched profanation of both of which is complained of and sharply 
 reproved in this chapter. 

 I. The ordinance of the ministry, which is peculiar to the church, and
 is designed for the maintaining and keeping up of that; this was
 profaned by those who were themselves dignified with the honour of it
 and entrusted with the business of it. The priests profaned the holy
 things of God; this they are here charged with; their sin is
 aggravated, and they are severely threatened for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:1-9">ver. 1-9</A>.

 II. The ordinance of marriage, which is common to the world of mankind,
 and was instituted for the maintaining and keeping up of that; this was
 profaned both by the priests and by the people, in marrying strangers
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:11,12">ver. 11, 12</A>),
 
 treating their wives unkindly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:13">ver. 13</A>),
 
 putting them away
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:16">ver. 16</A>),

 and herein dealing treacherously, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:10,14,15">ver. 10, 14, 15</A>.

 And that which was at the bottom of this and other instances of 
 profaneness and downright atheism, thinking God altogether such a one 
 as themselves, which was, in effect, to say, There is no God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:17">ver. 17</A>.
 
 And these reproofs to them are warnings to us.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And now, O ye priests, this commandment <I>is</I> for you.
 &nbsp; 2 If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay <I>it</I> to heart, to
 give glory unto my name, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, I will even
 send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I
 have cursed them already, because ye do not lay <I>it</I> to heart.
 &nbsp; 3 Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your
 faces, <I>even</I> the dung of your solemn feasts; and <I>one</I> shall
 take you away with it.
 &nbsp; 4 And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you,
 that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts.
 &nbsp; 5 My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them
 to him <I>for</I> the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid
 before my name.
 &nbsp; 6 The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found
 in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn
 many away from iniquity.
 &nbsp; 7 For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should
 seek the law at his mouth: for he <I>is</I> the messenger of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 of hosts.
 &nbsp; 8 But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to
 stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts.
 &nbsp; 9 Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before
 all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have
 been partial in the law.

 What was said in the foregoing chapter was directed to the priests 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:6"><I>ch.</I> i. 6</A>):

 <I>Thus saith the Lord of hosts to you, O priests! that despise my
 name.</I> But the crimes there charged upon them they were guilty of as 
 sacrificers, and for those they might think it some excuse that they 
 offered what the people brought, and therefore that, if they were not 
 so good as they should be, it was not their fault, but the people's; 
 and therefore here the corruptions there complained of are traced to 
 the source and spring of them--the faults the priests were guilty of as 
 teachers of the people, as expositors of the law and the lively 
 oracles; and this is a part of their office which still remains in the 
 hands of gospel-ministers (who are appointed to be pastors and 
 teachers, like the priests under the law, though not sacrificers, like 
 them), and therefore by them the admonition here is to be particularly 
 regarded. If the priests had given the people better instructions, the 
 people would have brought better offerings; and therefore the blame 
 returns upon the priests: "<I>And now, O you priests! this commandment 
 is</I> purely <I>for you</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 who should have taught the people the good knowledge of the Lord, and
 how to worship him aright." Note, The governors of the churches are 
 under God's government, and to him they are accountable. Even for those 
 who command God has commandments. Nay

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 <I>you shall know that I have sent these commandments for you.</I> They
 should know it either, 

 1. By the power of the Spirit working with the word for their
 conviction and reformation: "You shall know its original by its 
 efficacy, whence it comes by what it does." When the word of God to us 
 brings about, and carries on, the work of God in us, then we cannot but 
 know that he sent it to us, that it is not the word of 
 <I>Malachi--God's messenger,</I> but it is indeed the word of God, and 
 is sent, not only in general to all, but in particular to us. Or, 

 2. By the accomplishment of the threatenings denounced against them: 
 "<I>You shall know,</I> to your cost, <I>that I have sent this 
 commandment to you,</I> and it shall not return void."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Let us now see what this commandment is which is for the priests, 
 which, they must know, was sent to them; and let us put into method the 
 particulars of the charge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is a recital of the covenant God made with that sacred tribe, 
 which was their commission for their work and the patent of their 
 honour: The <I>Lord of hosts sent a commandment</I> to them, for the 
 establishing of this covenant 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 for his covenant is said to be the <I>word which he commanded</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:8">Ps. cv. 8</A>);

 and he sent <I>this commandment</I> by the prophet at this time for the
 re-establishing of it, that it might not be cut off for their 
 persisting in the violation of it. Let the sons of Levi know then (and 
 particularly the sons of Aaron) what honour God put upon their family, 
 and what a trust he reposed in them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>My covenant was with him of life and peace.</I> Besides the covenant
 of peculiarity made with all the house of Israel, there was a covenant 
 of priesthood made with one family, that they should do the services, 
 and, upon condition of that, should enjoy all the privileges, of the 
 priest's office--that, as Israel was a peculiar nation, a <I>kingdom of 
 priests,</I> so the house of Aaron should be a family of priests, set 
 apart for the service and honour of God, to bear up his name in that 
 nation, as they were to bear up his name among the nations; both the 
 one and the other, in different degrees, were to <I>give glory unto 
 God's name,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 God covenanted with them as his menial servants, obliged them to do his
 work and promised to own and accept them in it. This is called <I>his 
 covenant of life and peace,</I> because it was intended for the support 
 of religion, which brings life and peace to the souls of men--life to 
 the dead, peace to the distressed, or because life and peace were by 
 this covenant promised to those priests that faithfully and 
 conscientiously discharged their duty; they shall have peace, which 
 implies security from all evil, and life, which comprises the summary 
 of all good. What is here said of the covenant of priesthood is true of 
 the covenant of grace made with all believers, as spiritual priests; it 
 is a covenant of life and peace; it assures all believers of life and 
 peace, everlasting peace, everlasting life, all happiness both in this 
 world and in that to come. This covenant was made with the whole tribe 
 of Levi when they were distinguished from the rest of the tribes, were 
 not numbered with them, but were <I>taken from among</I> them and 
 <I>appointed over the tabernacle of testimony</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+1:49,50">Num. i. 49, 50</A>),

 by virtue of which appointment God says

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:12">Num. iii. 12</A>),

 <I>The Levites shall be mine.</I> It was made with Aaron when he and
 his sons were taken to <I>minister unto the Lord in the priest's 
 office,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:1">Exod. xxviii. 1</A>.

 Aaron is therefore called <I>the saint of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:16">Ps. cvi. 16</A>.

 It was made with Phinehas and his family, a branch of Aaron's, upon a
 particular occasion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:12,13">Num. xxv. 12, 13</A>.

 And there the covenant of priesthood is called, as here, the
 <I>covenant of peace,</I> because by it peace was made and kept between 
 God and Israel. These great blessings of life and peace, contained in 
 that covenant, God <I>gave to him,</I> to Levi, to Aaron, to Phinehas; 
 he promised life and peace to them and their posterity, entrusted them 
 with these benefits for the use and behoof of God's Israel; they 
 received that they might give, as Christ himself did,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:18">Ps. lxviii. 18</A>.

 Now, for the further opening of this covenant, observe, 

 1. The considerations upon which it was grounded: It was <I>for the
 fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name.</I> The 
 tribe of Levi gave a signal proof of their holy fear of God, and their 
 reverence for his name, when they appeared so bravely against the 
 worshippers of the golden calf

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:26">Exod. xxxii. 26</A>);

 and for their zeal in that matter God bestowed this blessing upon them
 and invited them to consecrate themselves unto him. Phinehas also
 showed himself zealous in the fear of God and his judgments when, to
 stay the plague, he stabbed <I>Zimri and Cozbi,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:30,31">Ps. cvi. 30, 31</A>.
 
 Note, Those, and those only, who fear God's name, can expect the
 benefit of the <I>covenant of life and peace;</I> and those who give 
 proofs of their zeal for God shall without fail be recompensed in the 
 glorious privileges of the Christian priesthood. Some read this, not as 
 the consideration of the grant, but as the condition of it: <I>I gave 
 them to him, provided</I> that he should <I>fear before me.</I> If God 
 grant us life and peace, he expects we should fear before him.

 2. The trust that was lodged in the priests by this covenant,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 They were hereby made <I>the messengers of the Lord of hosts,</I>
 messengers of that covenant of life and peace, not mediators of it, but 
 only messengers, or ambassadors, employed to treat of the terms of 
 peace between God and Israel. The priests were <I>God's mouth</I> to 
 his people, from whom they must receive instructions according to the 
 lively oracles. This was the office to which Levi was advanced; 
 because, in his zeal for God, he <I>did not acknowledge his brethren, 
 nor know his own children,</I> therefore <I>they shall teach Jacob 
 God's judgments,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:9,10">Deut. xxxiii. 9, 10</A>.

 Note, It is an honour to God's servants to be employed as his
 messengers and to be sent on his errands. Angels have their name 
 thence. Haggai was called <I>the Lord's messenger.</I> This being their 
 office, observe,

 (1.) What is the duty of ministers: <I>The priests' lips should keep 
 knowledge,</I> not keep it from the people, but keep it for them. 
 Ministers must be men of knowledge; for how are those able to teach 
 others the things of God who are themselves unacquainted with those 
 things or unready in them? They must keep knowledge, must furnish 
 themselves with it and retain what they have got, that they may be like 
 the <I>good householder,</I> who <I>brings out of his treasury things 
 new and old.</I> Not only their heads, but their lips, must keep 
 knowledge; they must not only have it, but they must have it ready, 
 must have it at hand, must have it (as we say) at their tongue's end, 
 to be communicated to others as there is occasion. Thus we read of 
 <I>wisdom</I> in <I>the lips of him that has understanding,</I> with 
 which they <I>feed many,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+10:13,21">Prov. x. 13, 21</A>.
 
 (2.) What is the duty of the people: <I>They should seek the law at his
 mouth;</I> they should consult the priests as God's messengers, and not 
 only hear the message, but ask questions upon it, that they may the 
 better understand it and that mistakes concerning it may be prevented 
 and rectified. We are all concerned fully to know <I>what the will of 
 the Lord is,</I> to know it distinctly and certainly; we should be 
 desirous to know it and therefore inquisitive concerning it. <I>Lord, 
 what wilt thou have me to do?</I> We must not only consult the written 
 word (<I>to the law and to the testimony</I>), but must have recourse 
 to God's messengers, and desire instruction and advice from them in the 
 affairs of our souls as we do from physicians and lawyers concerning 
 our bodies and estates. Not but that ministers ought to lay down the
 law of God to those who do not enquire concerning it, or desire the 
 knowledge of it (they must <I>instruct those that oppose
 themselves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:25">2 Tim. ii. 25</A>,

 as well as those that offer themselves), but it is people's duty to
 apply to them for instruction, not only to hear, but to ask questions.
 <I>Watchman, what of the night?</I> Thus <I>if you will enquire,
 enquire you;</I> see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:8,11,12">Isa. xxi. 8, 11, 12</A>.

 People should not only seek comfort at the mouth of their ministers,
 but should seek the law there; for, if we found in the way of duty, we 
 shall find it the way of comfort.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is a memorial of the fidelity and zeal of many of their 
 predecessors in the priest's office, which are mentioned as an 
 aggravation of their sin in degenerating from such honourable ancestors 
 and deserting such illustrious examples, and as a justification of God 
 in withdrawing from them those tokens of his presence which he had 
 granted to those that kept close to him. See here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 how good the godly priest was, whose steps they should have trod in, 
 and what good he did, God's grace working with him. 

 1. See how good he was. He was ready and mighty in the scriptures:
 <I>The law of truth was in his mouth,</I> for the use of those that 
 <I>asked the law at his mouth;</I> and in all his discourses there 
 appeared more or less of the law of truth. Every thing he said was
 under the government of that law, and with it he governed others. He 
 spoke as one having authority (every word was <I>a law</I>), and as one 
 that had both wisdom and integrity--it was a <I>law of truth,</I> and 
 truth is a law, it has a commanding power. It is by truth that Christ 
 rules. <I>The law of truth was in his mouth,</I> for his resolutions of 
 cases of conscience proposed to him were such as might be depended 
 upon; his opinion was good law. <I>Iniquity was not found in his 
 lips;</I> he did not <I>handle the word of God deceitfully,</I> to 
 please men, to serve a turn, or to make an interest for himself, but 
 told all that consulted him what the law was, whether it were pleasing 
 or displeasing. He did not pronounce that unclean which was clean, nor 
 that clean which was unclean, as one of the rabbin expounds it. And his 
 conversation was of a piece with his doctrine. God himself gives him 
 this honourable testimony: <I>He walked with me in peace and 
 equity.</I> He did not think it enough to talk of God, but he walked 
 with him. The temper of his mind, and the tenour of his life, were of a 
 piece with his doctrine and profession; he lived a life of communion 
 with God, and made it his constant care and business to please him; he 
 lived like a priest that was chosen to <I>walk before God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:30">1 Sam. ii. 30</A>.

 His conversation was quiet; he was meek and <I>gentle towards all
 men,</I> was a pattern and promoter of love; he walked with God in 
 peace, was himself peaceable and a great peace-maker. His conversation
 was also honest; he did no wrong to any, but made conscience of 
 rendering to all their due: <I>He walked with me in equity,</I> or 
 rectitude. We must not, for peace-sake, transgress the rules of equity, 
 but must keep the peace as far as is consistent with justice. <I>The 
 wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable.</I> Ministers, of all 
 men, are concerned to <I>walk with God in peace and equity,</I> that 
 they may be <I>examples to the flock.</I> 

 2. See what good he did; he answered the ends of his advancement to
 that office: <I>He did turn many away from iniquity;</I> he made it his 
 business to do good, and God crowned his endeavours with wonderful 
 success; he helped to save many a soul from death, and there are 
 multitudes now in heaven blessing God that ever they knew him.
 Ministers must lay out themselves to the utmost for the conversion of 
 sinners, and even among those that have the name of Israelites there is 
 need of conversion-work, there are many to be turned from iniquity; and 
 they must reckon it an honour, and a rich reward of their labour, if 
 they may but be instrumental herein. It is God only that by his grace 
 can turn men from iniquity, and yet it is here said of a pious 
 laborious minister that he turned men from iniquity as a worker 
 together with God, and an instrument in his hand; and <I>those that 
 turn many to righteousness shall shine as the stars,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+12:3">Dan. xii. 3</A>.
 
 Note, Those ministers, and those only, are likely to turn men from
 iniquity, that preach sound doctrine and live good lives, and both 
 according to the scripture; for, as one of the rabbin observes here, 
 <I>When the priest is upright many will be upright.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is a high charge drawn up against the priests of the present 
 age, who violated the covenant of the priesthood and went directly 
 contrary both to the rules and to the examples that were set before 
 them. Many particulars of their sins we had in the foregoing chapter, 
 and we find 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:1-31">Neh. xiii.</A>)

 that many corruptions had crept into the church of the Jews at this
 time, mixed marriages, admitting strangers into the house of God, 
 profanation of the sabbath-day, which were all owing to the 
 carelessness and unfaithfulness of the priests; here it is charged upon 
 them in general, 

 1. That they transgressed the rule: <I>You have departed out of the
 way</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 out of the good way which God has prescribed to you, and which your 
 godly ancestors walked before you in. It is ill with a people when
 those whose office it is to guide them in the way do themselves depart 
 out of it: "<I>You have not kept my ways,</I> not kept in them 
 yourselves, nor done your part to keep others in them,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 2. That they betrayed their trust: "<I>You have corrupted the covenant
 of Levi,</I> have violated it, have contradicted the great intentions 
 of it, and have done what in you lay to frustrate and defeat them; you 
 have managed your office as if it were designed only to feed you fat 
 and make you great; and not for the glory of God and the good of the 
 souls of men." This was a corrupting of the covenant of Levi; it was 
 perverting the ends of the office, and making it subservient to those 
 sensual secular things over which it ought always to have dominion. And 
 thus they forfeited the benefit of that covenant, and corrupted it to 
 themselves; they <I>made it void,</I> and lost the life and peace which 
 were by it settled upon them. We have no reason to expect God should 
 perform his part of the covenant if we do not make conscience of 
 performing ours. Another instance of their betraying their trust was 
 that they were <I>partial in the law,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 In the law given to them they would pick and choose their duty; this
 they would do and that they would not do, just as they pleased; this is 
 the fashion of hypocrites, while those whose hearts are upright with 
 God have a <I>respect to all his commandments.</I> Or, rather, in the 
 law they were to lay down to the people; in this they <I>knew faces</I> 
 (so the word is); they <I>accepted persons;</I> they wilfully 
 misinterpreted and misapplied the law, either to cross those they had a 
 spleen against or to countenance those they had a kindness for; they 
 would wink at those sins in some which in others they would be sharp 
 upon, according as their interest or inclination led them. God is <I>no 
 respecter of persons</I> in making his law, nor will he in reckoning 
 for the breach of it; he <I>regards not the rich more than the 
 poor,</I> and therefore his priests, his ministers, misrepresent him, 
 and do him a great deal of dishonour, if, in doctrine or discipline, 
 they be respecters of persons. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:21">1 Tim. v. 21</A>.

 3. That they did a great deal of mischief to the souls of men, which
 they should have helped to save: <I>You have caused many to stumble at 
 the law,</I> not only to <I>fall in the law</I> (as the margin reads 
 it) by transgressing it, taught and encouraged to do so by the examples 
 of the priests, but to <I>stumble at the law,</I> by contracting 
 prejudices against it, as if the law were the minister of sin and gave 
 countenance to it. Thus Hophni and Phinehas by their wickedness <I>made 
 the sacrifices of the Lord to be abhorred,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:17">1 Sam. ii. 17</A>.

 There are many to whom the law of God is a <I>stumbling-block,</I> the
 gospel of Christ <I>a savour of death unto death,</I> and Christ 
 himself <I>a rock of offence;</I> and nothing contributes more to this 
 than the vicious lives of those that make a profession of religion, by 
 which men are tempted to say, "It is all a jest." This is properly a 
 <I>scandal, a stone of stumbling;</I> there is no good reason why it 
 should be so to any, but <I>woe to those by whom this offence 
 comes.</I>

 4. That, when they were under the rebukes both of the word and of the
 providence of God for it, they <I>would not hear,</I> that is, they 
 would not heed, they <I>would not lay it to heart;</I> they were not at 
 all grieved or shamed for their sin, nor affected with the tokens of 
 God's displeasure which they were under. What we hear does us no good 
 unless we lay it to heart and admit the impressions of it: <I>You will 
 not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name,</I> by repentance and 
 reformation. <I>Therefore</I> we should lay to heart the things of God, 
 that we may give glory to the name of God, may praise him in and for 
 all that whereby he has made himself known. It is bad in any to rob God 
 of his honour, but worst in ministers, whose office and business it is 
 to bear up his name and to give him the glory due to it.</P>

 IV. Here is a record of the judgments God had brought upon these 
 priests for their profaneness, and their profanation of holy things. 

 1. They had lost their comfort

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>I have already cursed your blessings.</I> They had not the comfort 
 of their work, which is the satisfaction of doing good; for the 
 blessings with which they, as priests, blessed the people, God was so 
 far from saying <I>Amen</I> to that he turned them into curses, as he 
 did Balaam's curses into blessings. That profane people should not have 
 the favour of receiving God's blessings, nor those profane priests the 
 honour of conferring and conveying them, but both should lie under the 
 tokens of his wrath. Nor had they the comfort of their wages, for the 
 blessings with which God blessed them were turned into a curse to them 
 by their abuse of them; they could not receive them as the gifts of his 
 favour when they had made themselves so obnoxious to his displeasure by 
 not laying to heart the reproofs given them. 

 2. They had lost their credit

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the
 people.</I> While they glorified God he dignified them and supported 
 their reputation, and a great interest they had in the love and esteem 
 of the people while they did their duty and <I>walked with God in peace 
 and equity;</I> every one had a value and veneration for them; they 
 were truly styled <I>the reverend, the priests;</I> but when they 
 forsook the ways of God, and corrupted the covenant of Levi, they 
 thereby made themselves not only mean, but vile, in the eyes even of 
 the common people, who, the more they honoured the order, the more they 
 hated the men that were a dishonour to it. Their conduct, their 
 misconduct, had a direct tendency to this, and God owns his hand in it, 
 and will have it looked upon as a just judgment of his upon them, and 
 not only produced by their sin but answering to it; they put dishonour 
 upon God, and made <I>his table and the fruit thereof contemptible</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:12"><I>ch.</I> i. 12</A>),

 and therefore God justly put dishonour upon them and made them
 contemptible; they exposed themselves, and therefore God exposed them. 
 Note, As sin is a reproach to any people, so especially to priests; 
 there is not a more despicable animal upon the face of the earth than a 
 profane, wicked, scandalous minister.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Here is a sentence of wrath passed upon them; and this the prophet
 begins with, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 But it is conditional: <I>If you will not lay it to heart,</I>
 implying, "If you will, God's anger shall be turned away, and all shall 
 be well; but, if you persist in these wicked courses, hear your 
 doom--Your sin will be your ruin." 

 1. They shall fall and lie under the curse of God: <I>I will send a
 curse upon you.</I> The wrath of God shall be revealed against them, 
 according to the threatenings of the written word. Note, Those who 
 violate the commands of the law lay themselves under the curses of the 
 law. 

 2. Neither their employments nor their enjoyments, as priests, shall be
 clean to them: "<I>I will curse your blessings,</I> so that you shall 
 neither be blessed yourselves nor blessings to the people, but even 
 your plenty shall be a plague to you and you shall be plagues to your 
 generation." 

 3. The fruits of the earth, which they had the tithe of, should be no
 comfort to them: "<I>Behold, I will corrupt your seed;</I> the corn you 
 sow shall rot under ground and never come up again, the consequence of 
 which must needs be famine and scarcity of provisions; so that no 
 meat-offerings shall be brought to the altar, which the priests will 
 soon have a loss of." Or it may be understood of the seed of the word 
 which they preached; God threatens to deny his blessing to the 
 instructions they gave the people, so that their labour shall be lost, 
 as that of the husbandman is when the seed is corrupt; and so it agrees 
 with that threatening

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:32">Jer. xxiii. 32</A>),

 <I>They shall not profit this people at all.</I> 

 4. They and their services shall be rejected of God; he will be so far
 from taking any pleasure in them that he will loathe and detest them: 
 <I>I will spread dung in your faces, even the dung of your solemn 
 feasts.</I> He refers to the sacrifices that were offered at those 
 feasts. Instead of being himself pleased with the fat of their 
 sacrifices, he will show himself displeased by throwing the dung of 
 them in their faces, which he does, in effect, when he says, <I>Bring 
 no more vain oblations;</I> your <I>incense is an abomination</I> to 
 me. Note, Those who rest in their external performances of religion, 
 which they should count but <I>dung, that they may win Christ,</I> 
 shall not only come short of acceptance with God in them, but shall be 
 filled with shame and confusion for their folly. 

 5. All will end, at last, in their utter ruin: <I>One shall take you
 away with it.</I> They shall be so overspread with the dung of their 
 sacrifices that they shall be carried away with it to the dunghill, as 
 a part of it. Any one shall serve to take you away, the common 
 scavenger. <I>Reprobate silver shall men call them,</I> and treat them 
 accordingly, <I>because the Lord has rejected them.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10 Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why
 do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by
 profaning the covenant of our fathers?
 &nbsp; 11 Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is
 committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the
 holiness of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> which he loved, and hath married the
 daughter of a strange god.
 &nbsp; 12 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will cut off the man that doeth this, the master

 offereth an offering unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts.
 &nbsp; 13 And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 with tears, with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that he
 regardeth not the offering any more, or receiveth <I>it</I> with good
 will at your hand.
 &nbsp; 14 Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath been witness
 between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast
 dealt treacherously: yet <I>is</I> she thy companion, and the wife of
 thy covenant.
 &nbsp; 15 And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the
 spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed.
 Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal
 treacherously against the wife of his youth.
 &nbsp; 16 For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth
 putting away: for <I>one</I> covereth violence with his garment, saith
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye
 deal not treacherously.
 &nbsp; 17 Ye have wearied the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> with your words. Yet ye say,
 Wherein have we wearied <I>him?</I> When ye say, Every one that doeth
 evil <I>is</I> good in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and he delighteth in

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Corrupt practices are the genuine fruit and product of corrupt 
 principles; and the badness of men's hearts and lives is owing to some 
 loose atheistical notions which they have got and which they govern 
 themselves by. Now, in these verses, we have an instance of this; we 
 here find men dealing falsely with one another, and it is because they 
 think falsely of their God. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How corrupt their practices were. In general, they <I>dealt 
 treacherously every man against his brother,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 It cannot be expected that he who is false to his God should be true to
 his friend. They had dealt treacherously with God in his tithes and
 offerings, and had defrauded him, and thus conscience was debauched, 
 its bonds and cords were broken, a door was opened to all manner of 
 injustice and dishonesty, and the bonds of relation and natural 
 affection are broken through likewise and no difficulty made of it. 
 Some think that the treacherous dealings here reproved are the same 
 with those instances of oppression and extortion which we find 
 complained of to Nehemiah about this time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:3-7">Neh. v. 3-7</A>.

 Therein they forgot the God of their fathers, and the covenant of their
 fathers, and rendered their offerings unacceptable,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:11">Isa. i. 11</A>.

 But it seems rather to refer to what was amiss in their marriages,
 which was likewise complained of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:23">Neh. xiii. 23</A>.

 Two things they are here charged with, as very provoking to God in this
 matter--taking strange wives of heathen nations, and abusing and 
 putting away the wives they had of their own nation; in both these they 
 dealt treacherously and violated a sacred covenant; the former was in 
 contempt of the covenant of peculiarity, the latter of the 
 marriage-covenant.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In contempt of the covenant God made with Israel, as a peculiar
 people to himself, they married strange wives, which was expressly
 prohibited, and provided against, in that covenant, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:3">Deut. vii. 3</A>.

 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What good reason they had to deal faithfully with God and one 
 another in this covenant, and not to make marriages with the heathen. 
 
 [1.] They were expressly bound out from such marriages by covenant. God 
 engaged to do them good upon this condition, that they should not 
 mingle with the heathen; this was the <I>covenant of their fathers,</I> 
 the covenant made with their fathers, denoting the antiquity and the 
 authority of it, and its being the great charter by which that nation 
 was incorporated. They lay under all possible obligations to observe
 it strictly, yet they profaned it, as if they were not bound by it. 
 Those profane the covenant of their fathers who live in disobedience to 
 the command of the God of their fathers. 

 [2.] They were a peculiar people, united in one body, and therefore 
 ought to have united for the preserving of the honour of their 
 peculiarity: <I>Have we not all one Father?</I> Yes, we have, for 
 <I>has not one God created us?</I> Are we not all <I>his offspring?</I> 
 And are we not <I>made of one blood?</I> Yes, certainly we are. God is 
 a common Father to all mankind, and, upon that account, <I>all we are 
 brethren,</I> members one of another, and therefore ought to <I>put 
 away lying</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:25">Eph. iv. 25</A>),

 and not to <I>deal treacherously,</I> no, not <I>any man against his
 brother.</I> But here it seems to refer to the Jewish nation: <I>Have 
 we not all one father,</I> Abraham, or Jacob? This they prided 
 themselves in, <I>We have Abraham to our father;</I> but here it is 
 turned upon them as an aggravation of their sin in betraying the honour 
 of their nation by intermarrying with heathens: "<I>Has not one God 
 created us,</I> that is, formed us into a people, made us a nation by 
 ourselves, and put a life into us, distinct from that of other nations? 
 And should not this oblige us to maintain the dignity of our 
 character?" Note, The consideration of the unity of the church in 
 Christ, its founder and Father, should engage us carefully to preserve 
 the purity of the church and to guard against all corruptions.

 [3.] They were dedicated to God, as well as distinguished from the
 neighbouring nations. <I>Israel was holiness to the Lord</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:3">Jer. ii. 3</A>),

 taken into covenant with him, set apart by him for himself, to be to
 him for a name and a praise, and upon this account he <I>loved them</I> 
 and delighted in them; the sanctuary set up among them was the 
 <I>holiness of the Lord, which he loved,</I> of which he said, It is 
 <I>my rest for ever, here will I dwell, for I have desired it;</I> but 
 by marrying strange wives they profaned this holiness, and laid the 
 honour of it in the dust. Note, Those who are devoted to God, and 
 beloved of him, are concerned to preserve their integrity, that they 
 may not throw themselves out of his love, nor lose the honour, or 
 defeat the end, of their dedication to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How treacherously they dealt, notwithstanding, They profaned 
 themselves in that very thing which was prescribed to them for the 
 preserving of the honour of their singularity: <I>Judah has married the 
 daughter of a strange god.</I> The harm was not so much that she was 
 the daughter of a strange nation (God has made <I>all nations of 
 men,</I> and is himself <I>King of nations</I>), but that she was the 
 daughter of a strange god, trained up in the service and worship of 
 false gods, at their disposal, as a daughter at her father's disposal, 
 and having a dependence upon them; hence some of the rabbin (quoted by 
 Dr. Pocock) say, <I>He that marries a heathen woman is as if he made 
 himself son-in-law to an idol.</I> The corruption of the old world 
 began with the intermarriages of the <I>sons of God</I> with the 
 <I>daughters of men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:2">Gen. vi. 2</A>.

 It is the same thing that is here complained of, but as it is expressed
 it sounds worse: The <I>sons of God married the daughters of a strange 
 god.</I> Herein Judah is said to have <I>dealt treacherously,</I> for 
 they basely betrayed their own honour and <I>profaned</I> that 
 <I>holiness of the Lord</I> which they <I>should have loved</I> (so 
 some read it); and it is said to be <I>an abomination committed in 
 Israel and in Jerusalem;</I> it was hateful to God, and very unbecoming 
 those that were called by his name. Note, it is an abominable thing for 
 those who profess the holiness of the Lord to profane it, particularly 
 by yoking themselves unequally with unbelievers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) How severely God would reckon with them for it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>The Lord will cut off the man that doeth this,</I> that marries the 
 daughter of a strange god. He has, in effect, cut himself off from the 
 holy nation, and joined in with foreigners and <I>aliens to the 
 commonwealth of Israel,</I> and so shall his doom be; <I>God will cut 
 him off, him and all that belongs to him;</I> so the original 
 intimates. He shall be cut off from Israel and from Jerusalem, and not 
 be <I>written among the living</I> there. The Lord will cut off both 
 <I>the master and the scholar,</I> that are guilty of this sin, both 
 the teachers and the taught. The blind leaders and the blind followers 
 shall fall together into the ditch, <I>both him that wakeneth</I> and 
 <I>him that answereth</I> (so it is in the margin), for the master 
 calls up his scholar to his business, and stirs him up in it. They 
 shall be cut off together <I>out of the tabernacles of Jacob.</I> God 
 will no more own them as belonging to his nation; nay, and the priest 
 that <I>offers an offering to the Lord,</I> if he marry a strange wife 
 (as we find many of the priests did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+10:18">Ezra x. 18</A>),

 shall not escape; the offering he offers shall not atone for him, but
 he shall be cut off from the temple of the Lord, as others from the
 tabernacles of Jacob. <I>Nehemiah chased away from him,</I> and from
 the priesthood, one of the sons of the high priest, whom he found
 guilty of this sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:28">Neh. xiii. 28</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In contempt of the marriage-covenant, which God instituted for the 
 common benefit of mankind, they abused and put away the wives they had 
 of their own nation, probably to make room for those strange wives, 
 when it was all the fashion to marry such 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>This also have you done;</I> this is the second article of the 
 charge. For the way of sin is down-hill, and one violation of the 
 covenant is an inlet to another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Let us see what it is that is here complained of. they did not 
 behave as they ought to have done towards their wives. 

 [1.] They were cross with them, froward and peevish, and made their 
 lives bitter to them, so that when they came with their wives and 
 families to worship God at the solemn feasts, which they should have 
 done with rejoicing, they were all out of humour; the poor wives were 
 ready to break their hearts, and, not daring to make their case known 
 to any other, they complained to God, and <I>covered the altar of the 
 Lord with tears, with weeping, and with crying.</I> This is illustrated 
 by the instance of Hannah, who, upon the account of her husband's 
 having another wife (though otherwise a kind husband), and the 
 discontent thence arising, whenever they went up to the house of the 
 Lord to worship <I>fretted and wept,</I> and was in <I>bitterness of 
 soul,</I> and <I>would not eat,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:6,7,10">1 Sam. i. 6, 7, 10</A>.

 So it was with these wives here; and this was so contrary to the
 cheerfulness which God requires in his worshippers that it spoiled the 
 acceptableness of their devotions: God <I>regards not their offering 
 any more.</I> See here what a good Master we serve, who will not have 
 his altar covered with tears, but compassed with songs. This condemns 
 those who left his worship for that of idols, among the rites of which 
 we find <I>women weeping for Tammuz</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:14">Ezek. viii. 14</A>),

 and the blood of the worshippers gushing out upon the altar, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:28">1 Kings xviii. 28</A>.

 See also what a wicked thing it is to put others out of frame for the
 cheerful worship of God; though it is their fault by their fretfulness 
 to indispose themselves for their duty, yet it is much more the fault 
 of those who <I>provoked them to make them to fret.</I> It is a reason 
 given why yoke-fellows should live in holy love and joy--<I>that their 
 prayers may not be hindered,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:7">1 Pet. iii. 7</A>.
 
 [2.] They dealt treacherously with them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:14-16"><I>v.</I> 14-16</A>.

 They did not perform their promises to them, but defrauded them of
 their maintenance or dower, or took in concubines, to share in the 
 affection that was due to their wives only. 

 [3.] They <I>put them away,</I> gave them a bill of divorce, and turned 
 them off, nay, perhaps they did it without the ceremony that the law of 
 Moses prescribed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 [4.] In all this <I>they covered violence with their garment;</I> they
 abused their wives, and were vexatious to them, and yet, in the sight 
 of others, they pretended to be very loving to them and tender of them, 
 and to cast a skirt over them. It is common for those who do violence 
 to advance some specious pretence or other wherewith to cover it as 
 with a garment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Let us see the proof and aggravations of the charge. 

 [1.] It is sufficiently proved by the testimony of God himself: "<I>The 
 Lord has been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 has been witness to the marriage-covenant between thee and her, for to 
 him you appealed concerning your sincerity in it and fidelity to it; he 
 has been a witness to all the violations of it, and all thy treacherous 
 dealings in contempt of it, and is ready to judge between thee and 
 her." Note, This should engage us to be faithful both to God and to all 
 with whom we have to do, that God himself is a witness both to all our 
 covenants and to all our covenant-breaches; and he is a witness against 
 whom there lies no exception. 

 [2.] It is highly aggravated by the consideration of the person wronged 
 and abused. <I>First,</I> "She is <I>thy wife;</I> thy own, bone of thy 
 bone and flesh of thy flesh, the nearest to thee of all the relations 
 thou hast in the world, and to cleave to whom thou must quit the rest." 
 <I>Secondly,</I> "She is <I>the wife of thy youth,</I> who had thy 
 affections when they were at the strongest, was thy first choice, and 
 with whom thou hast lived long. Let not the darling of thy youth be the 
 scorn and loathing of thy age." <I>Thirdly,</I> "She is <I>thy 
 companion;</I> she has long been an equal sharer with thee in thy 
 cares, and griefs, and joys." The wife is to be looked upon, not as a 
 servant, but as a companion to the husband, with whom he should freely 
 converse and <I>take sweet counsel,</I> as with a friend, and in whose 
 company he should take delight more than in any other's; for <I>is she 
 not</I> appointed to be <I>thy companion? Fourthly,</I> "She is <I>the 
 wife of thy covenant,</I> to whom thou art so firmly bound that, while 
 she continues faithful, thou canst not be loosed from her, for it was a 
 covenant for life. It is the wife with whom thou hast covenanted, and 
 who has covenanted with thee; there is an oath of God between you, 
 which is not to be trifled with, is not to be played fast and loose 
 with." Married people should often call to mind their marriage-vows, 
 and review them with all seriousness, as those that make conscience of 
 performing what they promised.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Let us see the reasons given why man and wife should continue 
 together, to their lives' end, in holy love and peace, and neither 
 quarrel with each other nor separate from each other. 

 [1.] Because god has joined them together

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>Did not he make one,</I> one Eve for one Adam, that Adam might never 
 <I>take another to her to vex her</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:18">Lev. xviii. 18</A>),

 nor put her away to make room for another? It is great wickedness to 
 complain of the law of marriage as a confinement, when Adam in 
 innocency, in honour, in Eden, in the garden of pleasure, was confined 
 to one. Yet <I>God had the residue of the Spirit;</I> he could have 
 made another Eve, as amiable as that he did make, but, designing 
 <I>Adam a help meet for him,</I> he made him <I>one wife;</I> had he 
 made him more, he would not have had a <I>meet help.</I> And wherefore 
 did he make but one woman for one man? It was <I>that he might seek a
 godly seed</I>--<I>a seed of God</I> (so the word is), a seed that 
 should bear the image of God, be employed in the service of God, and be 
 devoted to his glory and honour,--that <I>every man having his own 
 wife,</I> and <I>but one,</I> according to the law, 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:2">1 Cor. vii. 2</A>),

 they might live in chaste and holy love, under the directions and
 restraints of the divine law, and not, as brute beasts, under the 
 dominion of lust, and thus might propagate the nature of man in such a 
 way as might make it most likely to participate of a divine 
 nature,--that the children, being born in holy matrimony, which is an 
 ordinance of God, and by which the inclinations of nature are kept 
 under the regulations of God's command, might thus be made a <I>seed to 
 serve him,</I> and be bred, as they are born, under his direction and 
 dominion. Note, The raising up of a godly seed, which shall be 
 <I>accounted to the Lord for a generation,</I> is one great end of the 
 institution of marriage; but that is a good reason why the marriage-bed 
 should be kept undefiled and the marriage bond inviolable. Husbands
 and wives must <I>therefore</I> live in the fear of God, that their 
 seed may be a godly seed, else were they <I>unclean,</I> but <I>now 
 they are holy, as children of the covenant,</I> the marriage-covenant, 
 which was a type of the covenant of grace, and the conjugal union, when 
 thus preserved entire, of the mystical union between Christ and his 
 church, in which he seeks and secures to himself a godly seed; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:25,32">Eph. v. 25, 32</A>.

 [2.] Because he is much displeased with those who go about to put
 asunder <I>what he has joined together</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>The God of Israel saith that he hateth putting away.</I> He hath
 indeed permitted it to the Jews, <I>for the hardness of their
 hearts,</I> or, rather, limited and clogged it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:8">Matt. xix. 8</A>);

 but <I>he hated</I> it, especially as those practised it who <I>put
 away their wives for every cause,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:3">Matt. xix. 3</A>.

 Let those wives that elope from their husbands and put themselves away,
 those husbands that are cruel to their wives and turn them away, or 
 take their affections off from their wives and place them upon others, 
 yea, and those husbands and wives that live asunder by consent, for 
 want of love to each other, let such as these know that the God of 
 Israel hates such practices, however vain men may make a jest of 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) Let us see the caution inferred from all this. We have it twice 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously
 against the wife of his youth;</I> and again,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Note, Those that would be kept from sin must <I>take heed to their
 spirits,</I> for there all sin begins; they must keep their hearts with 
 all diligence, must keep a jealous eye upon them and a strict hand, and 
 must watch against the first risings of sin there. We shall act as we 
 are spirited; and therefore, that we may regulate our actions, we must 
 consider <I>what manner of spirit we are of;</I> we must <I>take heed 
 to our spirits</I> with reference to our particular relations, and see 
 that we stand rightly affected to them and be of a good temper, for 
 otherwise we shall be in danger of dealing treacherously. If our own 
 hearts deal treacherously with us, whom will they not deal 
 treacherously with?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Observe how corrupt their principles were, to which were owing all 
 these corrupt practices. Let us trace up the streams to the fountain 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>You have wearied the Lord with your words.</I> They thought to evade 
 the convictions of the word, and to justify themselves by cavilling 
 with God's proceedings; but their defence was their offence, and their 
 vindication of themselves was the aggravation of their crime; they 
 affronted the Lord with their words, and repeated them so often, and 
 persisted so long in their contradictions, that they even <I>wearied 
 him;</I> see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:13">Isa. vii. 13</A>.

 They made him weary of doing them good as he had done, and stopped the
 current of his favours; or they represented him as weary of governing 
 the world, and willing to quit it and lay aside the care of it. Note, 
 It is a wearisome thing, even to God himself, to hear people insist 
 upon their own justification in their corrupt and wicked practices, and 
 plead their atheistical principles in vindication of them. But, as if 
 God by his prophet had done them wrong, see how impudently they ask, 
 <I>Wherein have we wearied him?</I> What are those vexatious words 
 whereby we have wearied him? Note, Sinful words are more offensive to 
 the God of heaven than they are commonly thought to be. But God has
 his proofs ready; two things they had said, at least in their hearts 
 (and thoughts are words to God), with which they had wearied him:--

 1. They had denied him to be a holy God, and had asserted that
 concerning him which is directly contrary to the doctrine of his 
 holiness. As he is a holy God, he hates sin, <I>is of purer eyes than 
 to behold it,</I> and <I>cannot endure to look upon it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:13">Hab. i. 13</A>.
 
 He <I>is not a God that has pleasure in wickedness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+5:4">Ps. v. 4</A>.

 And yet they had the impudence to say, in direct contradiction to this,
 <I>Every one that does evil is good in the sight of the Lord, and he 
 delights in them.</I> This wicked inference they drew, without any 
 reason, from the prosperity of sinners in their sinful courses (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:15"><I>ch.</I> iii. 15</A>),

 as if God's love or hatred were to be known by that which is before us,
 and those must be concluded <I>good in the sight of the Lord</I> who 
 are rich in the world. Or this they said because they wished it might 
 be so; they were resolved to <I>do evil,</I> and yet to think 
 themselves <I>good in the sight of the Lord,</I> and to believe that 
 <I>he delighted in them,</I> notwithstanding; and therefore, under 
 pretence of making God not so severe as he was commonly represented, 
 they said as they would have it, and thought he was <I>altogether such 
 a one as themselves.</I> Note, Those who think God a friend to sin 
 affront him and deceive themselves.

 2. They had denied him to be the righteous governor of the world. If he
 did not delight in sin and sinners, yet it would serve their turn to 
 believe that he would never punish it or them. They said, "<I>Where is 
 the God of judgment?</I> That God who, we have been so often told, 
 would call us to an account, and reckon with us for what we have said 
 and done--where is he? He has forsaken the earth, and takes no notice 
 of what is said and done there; he has said that he will <I>come to 
 judgment;</I> but <I>where is the promise of his coming?</I> We may do 
 what we please; he sees us not, nor will regard us." It is such a 
 challenge to the Judge of the whole earth as bids defiance to his 
 justice, and, in effect, dares him to <I>do his worst.</I> Such 
 scoffers as these there were in the latter days of the Jewish church, 
 and such there shall be in the latter days of the Christian church; but 
 their unbelief shall not make the promise of God of no effect; for the 
 day of the Lord will come. <I>Behold, the Judge stands before the 
 door;</I> the God of judgment <I>is at hand.</I></P>
