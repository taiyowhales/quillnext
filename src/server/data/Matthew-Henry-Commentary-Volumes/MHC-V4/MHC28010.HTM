 In this chapter, 

 I. The people of Israel are charged with gross corruptions in the
 worship of God and are threatened with the destruction of their images 
 and altars, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:1,2,5,6,8">ver. 1, 2, 5, 6, 8</A>.

 II. They are charged with corruptions in the administration of the
 civil government and are threatened with the ruin of that, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:3,4,7">ver. 3, 4, 7</A>.

 III. They are charged with imitating the sins of their fathers, and
 with security in their own sins, and are threatened with smarting
 humbling judgments, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:9-11">ver. 9-11</A>.

 IV. They are earnestly invited to repent and reform, and are threatened 
 with ruin if they did not,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Israel <I>is</I> an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto
 himself: according to the multitude of his fruit he hath
 increased the altars; according to the goodness of his land they
 have made goodly images.
 &nbsp; 2  Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he
 shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images.
 &nbsp; 3  For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared
 not the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; what then should a king do to us?
 &nbsp; 4  They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a
 covenant: thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of
 the field.
 &nbsp; 5  The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves
 of Beth-aven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the
 priests thereof <I>that</I> rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof,
 because it is departed from it.
 &nbsp; 6  It shall be also carried unto Assyria <I>for</I> a present to king
 Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed
 of his own counsel.
 &nbsp; 7  <I>As for</I> Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the
 water.
 &nbsp; 8  The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be
 destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their
 altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the
 hills, Fall on us.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 I. What the sins are which are here laid to Israel's charge, the 
 national sins which bring down national judgment. The prophet deals 
 plainly with them; for what good would it do them to be flattered?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They were not fruitful in the fruits of righteousness to the glory 
 of God. Here all their other wickedness began 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>Israel is an empty vine.</I> The church of God is fitly compared to 
 a <I>vine,</I> weak, and of an unpromising outside, yet spreading and 
 fruitful; believers are branches of that vine, and partake of its root 
 and fatness. But this was the character of Israel, they were as <I>an 
 empty vine,</I> a vine that had no sap or virtue in it, and therefore 
 none of those good fruits produced by it that were expected from it, 
 with which God and man should be honoured. Note, There are many who, 
 though they have not become <I>degenerate</I> vines, are yet <I>empty 
 vines,</I> have no good in them. A vine is of all trees least 
 serviceable if it do not bear fruit. It is thenceforth good for 
 nothing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+15:3,5">Ezek. xv. 3, 5</A>.

 And those that bring forth no grapes will soon come to bring forth wild
 grapes; those that do no good will do hurt. He is an <I>empty vine,</I> 
 for <I>he brings forth fruit to himself.</I> What good there is in him 
 is not directed to the glory of God, but he takes the praise of it to 
 himself, and prides himself in it. Christians live not to themselves

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:6">Rom. xiv. 6</A>),

 but hypocrites make self their centre; they <I>eat and drink to
 themselves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+7:5,6">Zech. vii. 5, 6</A>.

 Or Israel is by the judgments of God <I>emptied</I> and <I>spoiled</I>
 of all his wealth, because he made use of it in the service of his 
 lusts, and not to the honour of God who gave it to him. Note, What we 
 do not rightly employ we may justly expect to be emptied of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They multiplied their altars and images, and the more bountiful 
 God's providence was to them the more prodigal they were in serving 
 their idols: <I>According to the multitude of his fruit</I> which his 
 land brought forth <I>he has increased the altars,</I> and <I>according 
 to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images.</I> Note, It 
 is a great affront to God, and an abuse of his goodness, when the more 
 mercies we receive from him the more sins we commit against him, and 
 when the more wealth men have the more mischief they do. Should not we 
 be thus abundant in the service of our God, as they were in the service 
 of their idols? As we find our estates increasing, we should 
 proportionably abound the more in works of piety and charity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Their hearts were divided, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 (1.) They were divided among themselves. They were at variance about 
 their idols, some for one, some for another, at variance about their 
 kings, whose separate interests made parties in the kingdom, and in 
 them their very hearts were divided, and alienated one from another, 
 and there was no such thing as cordial friendship to be found among 
 them; it follows therefore, <I>Now shall they be found faulty.</I> 
 Note, The divisions and animosities of a people are the causes of much 
 sin and the presages of ruin. 

 (2.) They were divided between God and their idols. They had a 
 remaining affection in their hearts for God, but a reigning affection 
 for their idols. They <I>halted between God and Baal,</I> that was the 
 dividing of their heart. But God is the sovereign of the heart and he 
 will by no means endure a rival; he will either have all or none. 
 Satan, like the pretended mother, says, <I>Let it be neither mine nor 
 thine, but divide it;</I> but, if this be yielded to, God says, Nay, 
 <I>let him take it all.</I> A heart thus divided will be <I>found 
 faulty,</I> and be rejected as treacherous in covenanting with God. 
 Note, A heart divided between God and mammon, though it may trim the 
 matter so as to appear plausible, will, in the day of discovery, be 
 <I>found faulty.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They made no conscience of what they said and what they did in the 
 most solemn manner, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>

 (1.) Not of what they said in swearing, which is the most solemn 
 speaking: <I>They have spoken words,</I> and words only, for they meant 
 not as they said; they did <I>verba dare--give words.</I> They <I>swore 
 falsely in making a covenant;</I> they were deceitful in their 
 covenanting with God, the covenant of circumcision, the fair promises 
 they made of reformation when they were in distress; and no marvel if 
 those that were false to their God were false to all mankind. They 
 contracted such a habit of treachery that they broke through the most 
 sacred bonds, and made nothing of them; subjects violated their oaths 
 of allegiance and their kings their coronation-oaths; they broke their 
 leagues with the nations they were in alliance with, nor was any 
 conscience made of contracts between private persons. 

 (2.) Nor of what they did in judgment, which is the most solemn acting. 
 Justice could not take place when men made nothing of forswearing 
 themselves; for thus <I>judgment,</I> which should have been a healing 
 medicinal plant and of a sweet smell, <I>sprang up as hemlock,</I> 
 which is both nauseous and noxious, <I>in the furrows of the field,</I> 
 in the field that was ploughed and furrowed for good corn. Note, God is 
 greatly offended with corruptions, not only in his own worship, but in 
 the administration of justice between man and man, and the dishonesty 
 of a people shall be the ground of his controversy with them as well as 
 their idolatry and impiety; for God's laws are intended for man's 
 benefit and the good of the community, as well as for God's honour, and 
 the profanation of courts of justice shall be avenged as surely as the 
 profanation of temples.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What the judgments are with which Israel should be punished for 
 these sins; they sinned both in civil and religious matters, and in 
 both they shall be punished. 

 1. They shall have no joy of their kings and of their government.
 Because justice is turned into oppression, therefore those who are 
 entrusted with the administration of it, and should be blessings to the 
 state, shall be complained of as the burdens of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and those that would not rule their people well shall not be able to 
 protect them: <I>Now they shall say, "We have no king,</I> that is, we 
 are as if we had none, we have none to do us any good nor stand us in 
 any stead, none to keep us from destroying ourselves or being destroyed 
 by our enemies, none to preserve the public peace nor to fight our 
 battles; and justly has this come to us. <I>Because we feared not the 
 Lord,</I> when we were safe under the protection of our kings, 
 therefore we are rejected by him, and then <I>what shall a king do for 
 us?</I> What good can we expect from a king when we have forfeited the 
 favour of our God?" Note, Those that cast off the fear of God are not 
 likely to have joy of any of their creature-comforts; nor will men's 
 loyalty to their prince befriend them without religion, for, though 
 that may engage him to be for them, what good will that do them if God 
 be against them? Those that keep themselves in the fear and favour of 
 God may say, with triumph, "What can the greatest of men do against 
 us?" But those that throw themselves out of his protection must say, 
 with despair, "What can the greatest of men do for us?" He was a king 
 that said, <I>If the Lord do not help thee, whence should I help 
 thee?</I> Yet he is a fool that says, If a king cannot help us, we must 
 perish (as these intimate here), for God can do that for us which kings 
 cannot. Time was when they doted upon having a king; but now what can a 
 king (who, they thought, could do any thing) do for them? God can make 
 people sick of those creature-confidences which they were most fond of.
 This is their complaint when their king is disabled to help them, yet 
 this is not the worst; their civil government shall not only be 
 weakened, but quite destroyed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>As for Samaria,</I> the royal city, which is now almost all that is 
 left, <I>her king is cut off as the foam from the water.</I> The foam 
 swims uppermost, and makes a great show upon the face of the water, yet 
 it is but a heap of bubbles raised by the troubling of the water. Such 
 were the kings of Israel, after their revolt from the house of David, a 
 mere scum; their government had no foundation. No better are the 
 greatest of kings when they set up in opposition to God; when God comes 
 to contend with them by his judgments he can as easily disperse and 
 dissolve them, and bring them to nothing, as the froth upon the water. 
 
 2. They shall have no joy of their idols and of their worship of them.
 And miserable is the case of that people whose gods fail them when 
 their kings do. 

 (1.) The idols they had made, and the altars they had set up in honour 
 of them, should be broken down, and spoiled, and carried away, as 
 common plunder, by the victorious enemy: He <I>shall break down their 
 altars.</I> God shall do it by the hand of the Assyrians: the Assyrians 
 shall do it by order from God. <I>He shall spoil their images,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Note, What men make idols of it is just with God to <I>break down</I> 
 and <I>spoil.</I> But the calf at Bethel was the sovereign idol; it was 
 this that the inhabitants of Samaria doted most upon; now it is here 
 foretold that this should be destroyed: <I>The glory of it has departed 
 from it</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 when it is thrown down and defaced, no more to be worshipped; but this 
 is not all: <I>It shall also be carried to Assyria</I> (as some think 
 that the calf at Dan was some time before) <I>for a present to king 
 Jareb.</I> It was carried to him as a rich booty (for it was a golden 
 calf, and probably adorned with the gifts and offerings of its 
 worshippers) and as a trophy of victory over their enemies: and what 
 more glorious trophy could they bring than this, or more incontestable 
 proof of an absolute conquest? Thus it is said, <I>The sin of Israel 
 shall be destroyed</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 that is, the idols which they made the matter of their sin; it is said 
 of them, <I>They became a sin to all Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:30">1 Kings xii. 30</A>.

 Note, If the grace of God prevail not to destroy the love of sin in us,
 it is just that the providence of God should destroy the food and fuel 
 of sin about us. With the idols, <I>the high places</I> shall be
 destroyed, the <I>high places of Aven,</I> that is, of <I>Bethaven</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 or <I>Bethel;</I> it was called <I>the house of God</I> (so Bethel 
 signifies), but now it is called <I>the house of iniquity,</I> nay, 
 <I>iniquity</I> itself. The kings did not, as they ought to have done, 
 <I>take away the high places</I> by the sword of justice, and therefore 
 God will take them away by the sword of war; so that <I>the thorn and 
 the thistle</I> shall <I>come up on their altars,</I> that is, they 
 shall lie in ruins. Their altars, while they stood, were as thorns and
 thistles, offensive to God and good men, and fruits of sin and the 
 curse; justly therefore are they buried in thorns and thistles.

 (2.) The destruction of their idols, their altars, and their high 
 places, shall be the occasion of sorrow, and shame, and terror to them.

 [1.] It shall be an occasion of sorrow to them. When the calf at Bethel 
 is broken <I>the people thereof shall mourn over it.</I> They looked 
 upon the calf to be the protector of their nation, and, when that was 
 gone, thought they must all be undone, which made the poor ignorant 
 people that were deluded into the love of it lament bitterly, as Micah 
 did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:24">Judg. xviii. 24</A>),

 <I>You have taken away my gods, and what have I more?</I> The priests
 that had rejoiced in it shall now mourn for it with the people. Note, 
 Whatever men make a god of they will mourn for the loss of; and an 
 inordinate sorrow for the loss of any worldly good is a sign we made an 
 idol of it. They used to be very merry in the worship of their idols, 
 but now they shall mourn over them; for sinful mirth shall, sooner or 
 later, be turned into mourning.

 [2.] It shall be an occasion of shame to them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Ephraim shall receive shame</I> when he sees the gods he trusted to 
 carried into captivity, and <I>Israel shall be ashamed of his own 
 counsel,</I> in putting such confidence in them and paying such 
 adoration to them. God's ark and altars were never thrown down till the 
 people rejected them; but the idolatrous altars were thrown down when 
 the people were doting on them, which shows that the contempt of the 
 former, and the veneration for the latter, were the sins for which God 
 visited them. 
 
 [3.] It shall be an occasion of fear to them
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):
 
 <I>The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear;</I> they shall be in pain for 
 their gods and afraid of losing them; or, rather, they shall be in pain 
 for themselves and their children and families, when they see the 
 judgments of God breaking in upon them and beginning with their idols, 
 as he <I>executed judgment against the gods of Egypt,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:12">Exod. xii. 12</A>.
 
 Thus idolaters are brought in trembling when God arises to <I>shake
 terribly the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:21">Isa. ii. 21</A>.
 
 And here
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 <I>They shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on 
 us.</I> The supporters of idolatry 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:15,16">Rev. vi. 15, 16</A>)

 are brought in calling thus in vain to rocks and mountains to shelter 
 them from God's wrath.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there
 they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity
 did not overtake them.
 &nbsp; 10  <I>It is</I> in my desire that I should chastise them; and the
 people shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind
 themselves in their two furrows.
 &nbsp; 11  And Ephraim <I>is as</I> a heifer <I>that is</I> taught, <I>and</I> loveth
 to tread out <I>the corn;</I> but I passed over upon her fair neck: I
 will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, <I>and</I> Jacob shall
 break his clods.
 &nbsp; 12  Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up
 your fallow ground: for <I>it is</I> time to seek the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, till he
 come and rain righteousness upon you.
 &nbsp; 13  Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have
 eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way, in
 the multitude of thy mighty men.
 &nbsp; 14  Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy
 fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Beth-arbel in the
 day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon <I>her</I>
 children.
 &nbsp; 15  So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great
 wickedness: in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut
 off.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. They are put in mind of the sins of their fathers and predecessors, 
 for which God would now reckon with them. It was told them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:9"><I>ch.</I> ix. 9</A>)

 that they had <I>corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah,</I> 
 and here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 <I>O Israel! thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah.</I> Not only the 
 wickedness that was committed in that age is revived in this, and 
 reacted, a copy from that original, but the wickedness that was 
 committed in that age has been continued in a constant series and 
 succession through all the intervening ages down to this; so that the 
 measure of iniquity had been long in filling; and still there had been 
 made additions to it. Or, "<I>Thou has sinned more than in the days of 
 Gibeah</I>" (so it may be read); "the sins of this age exceed those of 
 the worst of former ages. The case was bad then, for <I>there they 
 stood;</I> the criminals stood in their own defence, and the tribes of 
 Israel, who undertook to chastise them for their wickedness, were <I>at 
 a stand,</I> when both in the first and in the second battle the 
 malefactors were the victors; and <I>the battle in Gibeah against the 
 children of iniquity did not overtake them</I> till the third 
 engagement, and then did not overtake them all, for 600 made their 
 escape. But thy sin is worse than theirs, and therefore thou canst not 
 expect but that the battle against the children of iniquity should 
 overtake thee, and overcome thee."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They have warning given them, fair warning, of the judgments of God 
 that were coming upon them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 God had hitherto pitied and spared them. Though they had been very 
 provoking, he had a mind to try whether they would be wrought upon by 
 patience and forbearance; but now, "<I>It is in my desire that I should 
 chastise them;</I> it is what I have a purpose of and will take 
 pleasure in." He will <I>rejoice over them to do them hurt,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:63">Deut. xxviii. 63</A>.

 Note, Because God does not desire the death and ruin of sinners,
 therefore he does desire their chastisement. And see what the
 chastisement it: <I>The people shall be gathered against them,</I> as 
 all the other tribes were against Benjamin in the battle of Gibeah.
 One of the rabbin thus descants upon it: "Because they receive not 
 chastisement from me by my prophets, who in my name rebuke them, I will 
 chastise them by the hands of the people who shall be <I>gathered 
 against them, when they shall bind themselves in their two 
 furrows,</I>" that is, when they shall think to fortify themselves, as 
 it were, within a double entrenchment. Or, <I>When I shall bind them
 for their two transgressions</I> (so the margin reads it), meaning 
 their corporal and spiritual whoredom, which they are so often charged 
 with, or the <I>two calves</I> at Dan and Bethel, or those two great 
 evils mentioned

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:12">Jer. ii. 13</A>.

 Or, <I>When I shall bind them to their two furrows,</I> that is, bring
 them into servitude to the Assyrians, who shall keep them under the 
 yoke as oxen in the plough, who are bound to the two furrows up the 
 field and down it, and dare not, for fear of the goad, stir a step out 
 of them. The Chaldee says, Those that are <I>gathered against them 
 shall exercise dominion over them, in like manner as a pair of heifers 
 are tied to their two furrows.</I> Thus those that would not be God's 
 freemen shall be their enemies' slaves, and shall be made to know the 
 difference between <I>God's service</I> and <I>the service of the 
 kingdoms of the countries,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:8">2 Chron. xii. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They are made to know that their unacquaintedness with sufferings 
 and hardships should not excuse them from a very miserable captivity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 See how nice, and tender, and delicate, Ephraim is; he is <I>as a 
 heifer that is taught to tread out the corn, and loves</I> that work, 
 because, being not allowed to be muzzled, she has liberty to eat at 
 pleasure, and the work itself was dry and easy, and both its own 
 diversion and its own wages. "But," says God, "I have a yoke to put 
 upon <I>her fair neck,</I> fair as it is. <I>I will make Ephraim to 
 ride,</I> that is, I will tame them, or cause them to be ridden by the 
 Assyrians and other conquerors that shall rule them with rigour, as men 
 do the beasts they ride upon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:12">Ps. lxvi. 12</A>);

 and <I>Judah</I> too shall be made to <I>plough,</I> and <I>Jacob to
 break the clods,</I>" that is, they shall be used hardly, but not so 
 hardly as Ephraim. Note, It is just with God to make those know what 
 hardships mean that indulge themselves too much in their own ease and 
 pleasure. The learned Dr. Pocock inclines to another sense of these
 words, as intimating the tender gentle methods God took with this 
 people, to bring them into obedience to his law, as a reason why they 
 should return to that obedience; he had managed them as the husbandman 
 does his cattle that he trains up for service. Ephraim being as a 
 docile heifer, fit to be employed, God took hold of <I>her fair 
 neck,</I> to accustom her to the hand, <I>harnessed her,</I> or put the 
 yoke of his commandments upon her, gave his people Israel a law, that, 
 being trained up in his institutions, they might not be tempted by the 
 usages of the heathen; he had used all fair and likely means with them 
 to keep them in their obedience, had set <I>Judah to plough</I> and 
 <I>Jacob to break the clods,</I> had employed them in the observance of 
 precepts proper for them; and yet they would not be retained in their 
 obedience, but started aside.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. They are invited and encouraged to return to God by prayer, 
 repentance, and reformation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.
 
 See here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The duties they are called to. They are <I>God's husbandry</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:9">1 Cor. iii. 9</A>),

 and the duties are expressed in language borrowed from the husbandman's
 calling. If they would not be brought into bondage by their oppressors, 
 let them return to God's service.

 (1.) Let them <I>break up the fallow ground;</I> let them cleanse their 
 hearts from all corrupt affections and lusts, which are as weeds and 
 thorns, and let them be humbled for their sins, and be of a broken and 
 contrite spirit in the sense of them; let them be full of sorrow and 
 shame at the remembrance of them, and prepare to receive the divine 
 precepts, as the ground that is ploughed is to receive the seed, that 
 it may take root. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:3">Jer. iv. 3</A>.

 (2.) Let them <I>sow to themselves in righteousness;</I> let them
 return to the practice of good works, according to the law of God, 
 which is the rule of righteousness; let them abound in works of piety 
 towards God, and of justice and charity towards one another, and herein 
 let them <I>sow to the Spirit,</I> as the apostle speaks, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:7,8">Gal. vi. 7, 8</A>.
 
 Every action is seed sown. Let them <I>sow in righteousness;</I> let
 them sow what they should sow, do what they should do, and they 
 themselves shall have the benefit of it. 

 (3.) Let them <I>seek the Lord;</I> let them look up to him for his 
 grace, and beg of him to bless the <I>seed sown.</I> The husbandman 
 must plough and sow with an eye to God, asking of him rain in the 
 season thereof.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The arguments used for the pressing of these duties. Consider, 

 (1.) It is time to do it; it is <I>high time.</I> The husbandman sows 
 in seed-time, and, if that time be far spent, he applies to the work 
 with the more diligence. Note, Seeking the Lord is to be every day's 
 work, but there are some special occasions given by the providence and 
 grace of God when it is, in a particular manner, time to seek him. 

 (2.) If we do our part, God will do his. If we <I>sow to ourselves in 
 righteousness</I>--if we be careful and diligent to do our duty, in a 
 dependence upon his grace--he will shower down his grace upon us, will 
 <I>rain righteousness,</I> the very thing that those need most who are 
 to sow <I>in righteousness;</I> for <I>by the grace of God we are what 
 we are.</I> Some apply it to Christ, who should come in the fulness of 
 time, and for whose coming they must prepare themselves; he shall come 
 as <I>the Lord our righteousness,</I> and shall <I>rain righteousness 
 upon us,</I> that everlasting righteousness which he has brought in; he 
 will grant us of it abundantly. It is foretold 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:6">Ps. lxxii. 6</A>)

 that <I>he shall come down like rain.</I>

 (3.) If we <I>sow in righteousness,</I> we shall <I>reap in mercy,</I> 
 which agrees with that promise, If we <I>sow to the Spirit,</I> we 
 shall <I>of the Spirit reap life everlasting.</I> We shall reap 
 <I>according to the measure of mercy</I> (so the word is); it shall be 
 a great reward, according to the <I>riches of mercy,</I> such a reward, 
 not as becomes such mean creatures as we are to receive, but as becomes 
 a God of infinite mercy to give, a reward, <I>not of debt,</I> but 
 <I>of grace.</I> We reap not in merit, but in mercy. It is what is 
 sown; God gives a body as it has pleased him. 

 (4.) We have <I>ploughed wickedness and reaped iniquity;</I> and the 
 time <I>past of our life may suffice</I> that we have done so,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 "You have taken a great deal of pains in the service of sin, have 
 laboured at it in the very fire; and will you grudge to bear the burden 
 and heat of the day in God's service and in doing that which will be 
 for your own advantage? You have done much to damn your souls; will you 
 not undo it again, and do something to save them?" 

 (5.) We never got any thing in the service of sin. They have 
 <I>ploughed wickedness</I> (that is, they have done the drudgery of 
 sin), and they have <I>reaped iniquity,</I> that is, they have got all 
 that is to be got by it; they have carried it on to the <I>harvest,</I> 
 and what the better? It is all a cheat. <I>They have eaten the fruit of 
 lies,</I> fruit that is but a lie, which looks fair, but is rotten 
 within; the <I>works of darkness</I> are <I>unfruitful works,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:11,Ro+6:21">Eph. v. 11; Rom. vi. 21</A>.

 Even the gains of sin yield the sinner no satisfaction.

 (6.) As our comforts, so our confidences, in the service of sin will 
 certainly fail us: "<I>Thou didst trust in thy ways, in the multitude 
 of thy mighty men;</I> thou has stayed thyself upon creatures, thy own 
 power and policy, and therefore hast ventured to plough wickedness, and 
 thy hopes have deceived thee; come therefore, and seek the Lord, and 
 thy hope in him shall not deceive thee."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. They are threatened with utter destruction, both for their carnal 
 practices and for their carnal confidences, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.
 
 <I>Therefore,</I> because thou has sown wickedness, and trusted in thy 
 own way, <I>a tumult shall arise among thy people,</I> either by 
 insurrections at home or invasions from abroad, either of which will 
 put a kingdom into confusion and make a noise, much more both together. 
 
 1. Their cities and strongholds shall be a prey to the enemy: The
 <I>fortresses</I> which they confided in, and in which they had laid up 
 their effects, shall be seized and rifled, as <I>Shalman spoiled 
 Beth-arbel in the day of battle.</I> This refers to some event that had 
 lately happened, not elsewhere recorded; and probably Shalman is the 
 same with Shalmaneser king of Assyria, who had lately put some town, or 
 castle, or house (<I>Beth-arbel is the house of Arbel</I>), under 
 <I>military execution,</I> which perhaps he used with severity in the 
 beginning of his conquests, to terrify other garrisons into a speedy 
 surrender at the first summons. God tells them that thus Samaria should 
 be <I>spoiled.</I> 

 2. The inhabitants shall be put to the <I>sword,</I> as it was at
 <I>Beth-arbel;</I> when it was taken <I>the mother was dashed in pieces 
 upon her children,</I> that is, they were both dashed in pieces 
 together by the fury of the soldiers. See what cruel work war makes. 
 <I>Jusque datum sceleri--Wickedness has free course.</I> It is strange 
 that any of the human race could be so inhuman; but see what comes of 
 sin. <I>Homo homini lupus--Man is a wolf to man,</I> and then, <I>Homo 
 homini agnus--Man is a lamb to man.</I> 

 3. Even royal blood shall be mingled with common gore: <I>In a morning
 shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Hoshea was the last king of Israel; in him the whole kingdom was <I>cut 
 off</I> and came to a period; it may refer either to him or to some of 
 his predecessors that were cut off by treachery. It shall be done <I>in 
 a morning,</I> in a very little time, as suddenly as the dawning of the 
 morning, or at the time appointed, for so the morning comes, punctually 
 at its time. Or <I>in the morning,</I> when they think the night of 
 calamity is over, and expect a returning day, then shall all their 
 hopes be dashed by the sudden cutting off of their king, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Kings, though gods to us, are men to God, and shall die like men. And 
 (<I>lastly</I>) what does all this desolation owe its rise to? What is 
 the spring of this bloodshed? He tells us
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>So shall Bethel do unto you.</I> Bethel was the place where one of 
 the calves was; Gilgal, where <I>all their wickedness</I> is said to 
 have been, was hard by; there was their <I>great wickedness,</I> the 
 <I>evil of their evil</I> (so the word is), the sum and quintessence of 
 their sin; and that was it that <I>did this to them,</I> that made all 
 this havoc, for that was it that provoked God to bring it upon them. He 
 does not say, "So shall the <I>king of Assyria</I> do to you;" but, "So 
 shall <I>Bethel</I> do to you." Note, Whatever mischief is done to us 
 it is sin that does it. Are the fortresses spoiled? Are the women and 
 children murdered? Is the king cut off? It is sin that does all this.
 It is sin that ruins soul, body, estate, all. <I>So shall Bethel do 
 unto you.</I> It is <I>thy own wickedness</I> that <I>corrects thee</I> 
 and <I>thy backslidings</I> that <I>reprove thee.</I></P>
