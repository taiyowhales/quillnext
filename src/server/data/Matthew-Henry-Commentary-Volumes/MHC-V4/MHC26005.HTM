 In this chapter we have a further, and no less terrible, denunciation 
 of the judgments of God, which were coming with all speed and force 
 upon the Jewish nation, which would utterly ruin it; for when God 
 judges he will overcome. This destruction of Judah and Jerusalem is 
 here, 

 I. Represented by a sign, the cutting, and burning, and scattering of
 hair, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. That sign is expounded, and applied to Jerusalem.

 1. Sin is charged upon Jerusalem as the cause of this
 desolation--contempt of God's law

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:5-7">ver. 5-7</A>)

 and profanation of his sanctuary, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:11">ver. 11</A>.

 2. Wrath is threatened, great wrath 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:8-10">ver. 8-10</A>),
 
 a variety of miseries

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:12,16,17">ver. 12, 16, 17</A>),

 such as should be their reproach and ruin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:13-15">ver. 13-15</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a
 barber's razor, and cause <I>it</I> to pass upon thine head and upon
 thy beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the
 <I>hair.</I>
 &nbsp; 2  Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the
 city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt
 take a third part, <I>and</I> smite about it with a knife: and a third
 part thou shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword
 after them.
 &nbsp; 3  Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number, and bind them
 in thy skirts.
 &nbsp; 4  Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the
 fire, and burn them in the fire; <I>for</I> thereof shall a fire come
 forth into all the house of Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the sign by which the utter destruction of Jerusalem is 
 set forth; and here, as before, the prophet is himself the sign, that 
 the people might see how much he affected himself with, and interested 
 himself in, the case of Jerusalem, and how it lay to his heart, even 
 when he foretold the desolations of it. He was so much concerned about
 it as to take what was done to it as done to himself, so far was he 
 from desiring the woeful day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He must <I>shave off the hair of his head and beard</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),
 
 which signified God's utter rejecting and abandoning that people, as a 
 useless worthless generation, such as could well be spared, nay, such 
 as it would be his honour to part with; his judgments, and all the 
 instruments he made use of in cutting them off, were this <I>sharp 
 knife</I> and this <I>razor,</I> that were proper to be made use of, 
 and would do execution. Jerusalem had been the head, but, having 
 degenerated, had become as the <I>hair,</I> which, when it grows thick 
 and long, is but a burden which a man wishes to get clear of, as God of 
 the sinners in Zion. <I>Ah! I will ease me of my adversaries,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:24">Isa. i. 24</A>.

 Ezekiel must not cut off that hair only which was superfluous, but
 <I>cut it all off,</I> denoting the full end that God would make of 
 Jerusalem. The hair that would not be trimmed and kept neat and clean 
 by the admonitions of the prophets must be all shaved off by utter 
 destruction. Those will be ruined that will not be reformed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He must <I>weigh the hair</I> and <I>divide it into three 
 parts.</I> This intimates the very exact directing of God's judgments 
 according to equity (by him men and their actions are <I>weighed</I> in 
 the unerring balance of truth and righteousness) and the proportion 
 which divine justice observes in punishing some by one judgment and 
 others by another; one way or other, they shall all be met with. Some 
 make the shaving of the hair to denote the loss of their liberty and of 
 their honour: it was looked upon as a mark of ignominy, as in the 
 disgrace Hanun put on David's ambassadors. It denotes also the loss of 
 their joy, for they shaved their heads upon occasion of great mourning; 
 I may add the loss of their Nazariteship, for the shaving of the head 
 was a period to that vow 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+6:18">Num. vi. 18</A>),

 and Jerusalem was now no longer looked upon as a <I>holy city.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He must dispose of the hair so that it might all be destroyed or 
 dispersed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 1. One <I>third part</I> must <I>be burnt in the midst of the city,</I> 
 denoting the multitudes that should perish by famine and pestilence, 
 and perhaps many in the conflagration of the city, <I>when the days of 
 the siege were fulfilled.</I> Or the laying of that glorious city in 
 ashes might well be looked upon as a third part of the destruction 
 threatened. 

 2. Another third part was to be <I>cut in pieces with a knife,</I> 
 representing the many who, during the siege, were slain by the sword, 
 in their sallies out upon the besiegers, and especially when the city 
 was taken by storm, the Chaldeans being then most furious and the Jews 
 most feeble. 

 3. Another third part was to be <I>scattered in the wind,</I> denoting
 the carrying away of some into the land of the conqueror and the flight 
 of others into the neighbouring countries for shelter; so that they 
 were hurried, some one way and some another, like loose hairs in the 
 wind. But, lest they should think that this dispersion would be their 
 escape, God adds, <I>I will draw out a sword after them,</I> so that 
 wherever they go evil shall pursue them. Note, God has variety of 
 judgments wherewith to accomplish the destruction of a sinful people 
 and to make an end when he begins.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He must preserve a small quantity of the third sort that were to be 
 <I>scattered in the wind,</I> and <I>bind them in his skirts,</I> as 
 one would bind that which he is very mindful and careful of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 This signified perhaps that little handful of people which were left 
 under the government of Gedaliah, who, it was hoped, would keep 
 possession of the land when the body of the people was carried into 
 captivity. Thus God would have done well for them if they would have 
 done well for themselves. But these few that were reserved must be
 taken and <I>cast into the fire,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 When Gedaliah and his friends were slain the people that put themselves 
 under his protection were scattered, some gone into Egypt, others 
 carried off by the Chaldeans, and in short the land totally cleared of 
 them; then this was fulfilled, for out of those combustions <I>a fire 
 came forth into all the house of Israel,</I> who, as fuel upon the 
 fire, kindled and consumed one another. Note, It is ill with a people 
 when those are taken away in wrath that seemed to be marked for 
 monuments of mercy; for then there is no remnant or escaping, none shut 
 up or left.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; This <I>is</I> Jerusalem: I have set it
 in the midst of the nations and countries <I>that are</I> round about
 her.
 &nbsp; 6  And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than
 the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that <I>are</I>
 round about her: for they have refused my judgments and my
 statutes, they have not walked in them.
 &nbsp; 7  Therefore thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Because ye multiplied more
 than the nations that <I>are</I> round about you, <I>and</I> have not
 walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither
 have done according to the judgments of the nations that <I>are</I>
 round about you;
 &nbsp; 8  Therefore thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Behold, I, even I, <I>am</I>
 against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in
 the sight of the nations.
 &nbsp; 9  And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and
 whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine
 abominations.
 &nbsp; 10  Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of
 thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute
 judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter
 into all the winds.
 &nbsp; 11  Wherefore, <I>as</I> I live, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Surely, because
 thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things,
 and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish
 <I>thee;</I> neither shall mine eye spare, neither will I have any
 pity.
 &nbsp; 12  A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with
 famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third
 part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and I will scatter
 a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword
 after them.
 &nbsp; 13  Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my
 fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall
 know that I the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> have spoken <I>it</I> in my zeal, when I have
 accomplished my fury in them.
 &nbsp; 14  Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the
 nations that <I>are</I> round about thee, in the sight of all that
 pass by.
 &nbsp; 15  So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an
 astonishment unto the nations that <I>are</I> round about thee, when I
 shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in
 furious rebukes. I the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> have spoken <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 16  When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which
 shall be for <I>their</I> destruction, <I>and</I> which I will send to
 destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will
 break your staff of bread:
 &nbsp; 17  So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they
 shall bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through
 thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> have
 spoken <I>it.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the explanation of the foregoing similitude: <I>This is 
 Jerusalem.</I> Thus it is usual in scripture language to give the name 
 of the thing signified to the sign; as when Christ said, <I>This is my 
 body.</I> The prophet's head, which was to be shaved, signified 
 Jerusalem, which by the judgments of God was now to be stripped of all 
 its ornaments, to be emptied of all its inhabitants, and to be set 
 <I>naked and bare,</I> to be <I>shaved with a razor that is hired,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:20">Isa. vii. 20</A>.

 The head of one that was a priest, a prophet, a holy person, was
 fittest to represent Jerusalem the holy city. Now the contents of these 
 verses are much the same with what we have often met with, and still 
 shall, in the writings of the prophets. Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The privileges Jerusalem was honoured with 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries that are 
 round about her,</I> and those famous nations and very considerable. 
 Jerusalem was not situated in a remote obscure corner of the world, far 
 from neighbours, but in the midst of kingdoms that were populous, 
 polite, and civilized, famed for learning, arts, and sciences, and 
 which then made the greatest figure in the world. But there seems to be 
 more in it than this. 

 1. Jerusalem was dignified and preferred above the neighbouring nations
 and their cities. it was <I>set in the midst</I> of them as excelling 
 them all. This <I>holy mountain was exalted above all the hills,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:2">Isa. ii. 2</A>.

 <I>Why leap you, you high hills? This is the hill which God desires to 
 dwell in,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:16">Ps. lxviii. 16</A>.

 Jerusalem was a city upon a hill, conspicuous and illustrious, and
 which all the neighbouring nations had an eye upon, some for good-will, 
 some for ill-will.

 2. Jerusalem was designed to have a good influence upon <I>the nations
 and countries round about,</I> was set in the midst of them as a candle 
 upon a candlestick, to spread the light of divine revelation, which she 
 was blessed with, to all the dark corners of the neighbouring nations, 
 that from them it might diffuse itself further, even to the ends of the 
 earth. Jerusalem was set <I>in the midst</I> of the nations, to be as 
 the heart in the body, to invigorate this dead world with a divine life 
 as well as to enlighten this dark world with a divine light, to be an 
 example of every thing that was good. The nations that observed what 
 excellent <I>statutes and judgments</I> they had concluded them to be 
 <I>a wise and understanding people</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:6">Deut. iv. 6</A>),

 fit to be consulted as an oracle, as they were in Solomon's time, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:34">1 Kings iv. 34</A>.

 And, had they preserved this reputation and made a right use of it,
 what a blessing would Jerusalem have been to all the nations about!
 But, failing to be so, the accomplishment of this intention was 
 reserved for its latter days, <I>when out of Zion went forth the</I> 
 gospel <I>law and the word of the Lord</I> Jesus <I>from Jerusalem,</I> 
 and there <I>repentance and remission</I> began to be preached, and 
 thence the preachers of them <I>went forth into all nations.</I> And, 
 when that was done, Jerusalem was levelled with the ground. Note, When 
 places and persons are made great, it is with design that they may do 
 good and that those about them may be the better for them, that their 
 <I>light may shine before men.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The provocations Jerusalem was guilty of. A very high charge is 
 here drawn up against that city, and proved beyond contradiction 
 sufficient to justify God in seizing its privileges and putting it 
 under military execution. 

 1. She has <I>not walked in God's statutes,</I> nor <I>kept his
 judgments</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 nay, the inhabitants of Jerusalem had <I>refused his judgments and his 
 statutes</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 they did not do their duty, nay, they <I>would not,</I> they said that 
 they would not. Those <I>statutes and judgments</I> which their 
 neighbours admired they despised, which they should have set before 
 their face they cast behind their back. Note, A contempt of the word 
 and law of God opens a door to all manner of iniquity. God's statutes 
 are the terms on which he deals with men; those that refuse his terms 
 cannot expect his favours. 

 2. She had <I>changed God's judgments into wickedness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 a very high expression of profaneness, that the people had not only 
 broken God's laws, but had so perverted and abused them that they had 
 made them the excuse and colour of their wickedness. They introduced
 the abominable customs and usages of the heathen, instead of God's 
 institutions; this was changing <I>the truth of God into a lie</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:25">Rom. i. 25</A>)
 
 and the <I>glory of God into shame,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:2">Ps. iv. 2</A>.

 Note, Those that have been well educated, if they live ill, put the 
 highest affront imaginable upon God, as if he were the patron of sin 
 and <I>his judgments</I> were <I>turned into wickedness.</I> 

 3. She had been worse than the neighbouring nations, to whom she should
 have set a good example: <I>She has changed my judgments,</I> by 
 idolatries and false worship, <I>more than the nations</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 and she has <I>multiplied</I> (that is, multiplied idols and altars, 
 gods and temples, multiplied those things the unity of which was their 
 praise) <I>more than the nations that were round about.</I> Israel's 
 God is one, and his name one, his altar one; but they, not content with 
 this one God, multiplied their gods to such a degree that <I>according 
 to the number of their cities so were their gods,</I> and their altars 
 were <I>as heaps in the furrows of the field;</I> so that they exceeded 
 all their neighbours in having <I>gods many and lords many.</I> They 
 corrupted revealed religion more than the Gentiles had corrupted 
 natural religion. Note, If those who have made a profession of 
 religion, and have had a pious education, apostatize from it, they are 
 commonly more profane and vicious than those who never made any 
 profession; they have <I>seven other spirits more wicked.</I> 

 4. She had <I>not done according to the judgments of the nations,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Israel had not acted towards their God, as the nations had acted
 towards their gods, though they were false gods; they had not been so 
 observant of him nor so constant to him. Has a nation <I>changed its 
 gods,</I> or slighted them, so as they have? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:11">Jer. ii. 11</A>.

 Or it may refer to their morals; instead of reforming their neighbors,
 they came short of them; and many who were of the <I>uncircumcision 
 kept the righteousness of the law</I> better than those who were <I>of 
 the circumcision,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:26,27">Rom. ii. 26, 27</A>.

 Those who had the light of scripture did not <I>according to the
 judgments</I> of many who had only the light of nature. Note, There are 
 those who are called <I>Christians</I> who will in the great day be 
 condemned by the better tempers and better lives of sober heathens.

 5. The particular crime charged upon Jerusalem is profaning the holy
 things, which she had been both entrusted and honoured with

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>Thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things,</I> 
 with thy idols and idolatries. The images of their pretended deities, 
 and the groves erected in honour of them, were brought into the temple; 
 and the ceremonies used by idolaters were brought into the worship of 
 God. Thus every thing that is sacred was polluted. Note, Idols are 
 detestable things any where, but more especially so in the 
 sanctuary.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The punishments that Jerusalem should fall under for these 
 provocations: <I>Shall not God visit for these things?</I> No doubt he 
 shall. The matter of the sentence here passed upon Jerusalem is very 
 dreadful, and the manner of expression makes it yet more so; the 
 judgments are various, and the threatenings of them varied, reiterated, 
 inculcated, that one may well say, <I>Who is able to stand in God's 
 sight when once he is angry?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God will take this work of punishing Jerusalem into his own hands; 
 and <I>who knows the power of his anger</I> and what <I>a fearful thing 
 it is to fall into his hands?</I> Observe what a strong emphasis is 
 laid upon it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>I, even I, am against thee.</I> God had been for Jerusalem, to 
 defend and save it; but miserable is its case when he has turned to be 
 its enemy and fights against it. If God be against us, the whole 
 creation is at war with us, and nothing can be for us so as to stand us 
 in any stead: "You think it is only the Chaldean army that is against 
 you, but they are God's hand, or rather the staff in his hand; it is 
 <I>I, even I,</I> that <I>am against thee,</I> not only to speak 
 against thee by prophets, but to act against thee by providence. <I>I
 will execute judgments in thee</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),
 
 <I>in the midst of thee</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 not only in the suburbs, but in the heart of the city, not only in the 
 borders, but in the bowels of the country." Note, Those who will not 
 observe the judgments of God's mouth shall not escape the judgments of 
 his hand; and God's judgments, when they come with commission, will 
 penetrate into the midst of a people, will enter into the soul, <I>into 
 the bowels like water</I> and <I>like oil into the bones. I will 
 execute judgments.</I> Note, God himself undertakes to execute his own 
 judgments, according to the true and full intent of them; whatever are 
 the instruments, he is the principal agent.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. These punishments shall come from his displeasure. As to the body of 
 the people, it shall not be a correction in love, but he will 
 <I>execute judgments in anger, and in fury, and in furious rebukes</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 strange expressions to come from a God who has said, <I>Fury is not in 
 me,</I> and who has declared himself <I>gracious, and merciful,</I> and 
 <I>slow to anger.</I> But they are designed to show the malignity of 
 sin, and the offence it gives to the just and holy God. That must needs 
 be a very evil thing which provokes him to such resentments, and 
 against his own people too, that had been so high in his favour, and 
 expressed with so much satisfaction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 "<I>My anger,</I> which has long been withheld, <I>shall</I> now <I>be 
 accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them;</I> it shall 
 not only light upon them, but lie upon them, and fill them as vessels 
 of wrath fitted by their own wickedness to destruction; <I>and,</I> 
 justice being hereby glorified, <I>I will be comforted,</I> I will be 
 entirely satisfied in what I have done." As, when God is dishonoured by 
 the sins of men, he is said to be <I>grieved</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:10">Ps. xcv. 10</A>),

 so when he is honoured by their destruction he is said to <I>be
 comforted.</I> The struggle between mercy and judgment is over, and in 
 this case judgment triumphs, triumphs indeed; for mercy that has been 
 so long abused is now silent and gives up the cause, has not a word 
 more to say on the behalf of such an ungrateful incorrigible people: 
 <I>My eye shall not spare, neither will I have any pity,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Divine compassion defers the punishment, or mitigates it, or supports 
 under it, or shortens it; but here is <I>judgment without mercy,</I> 
 wrath without any mixture or allay of pity. These expressions are thus 
 sharpened and heightened perhaps with design to look further, to the 
 vengeance of eternal fire, which some of the destructions we read of in 
 the Old Testament were typical of, and particularly that of Jerusalem; 
 for surely it is nowhere on this side hell that this word has its full 
 accomplishment, <I>My eye shall not spare,</I> but <I>I will cause my 
 fury to rest.</I> Note, Those who live and die impenitent will perish 
 for ever unpitied; there is a day coming when <I>the Lord will not 
 spare.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Punishments shall be public and open: <I>I will execute</I> these 
 <I>judgments in the sight of the nations</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 the judgments themselves shall be so remarkable that all the nations 
 far and near shall take notice of them; they shall be all the talk of 
 that part of the world, and the more for the conspicuousness of the 
 place and people on which they are inflicted. Note, Public sins, as 
 they call for public reproofs (<I>those that sin rebuke before 
 all</I>), so, if those prevail not, they call for public judgments. 
 <I>He strikes them as wicked men in the open sight of others</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:26">Job xxxiv. 26</A>),

 that he may maintain and vindicate the honour of his government, for
 (as Grotius descants upon it here) <I>why should he suffer it to be 
 said, See what wicked lives those lead who profess to be the 
 worshippers of the only true God!</I> And, as the publicity of the 
 judgments will redound to the honour of God, so it will serve,

 (1.) To aggravate the punishment, and to make it lie the more heavily.
 Jerusalem, being made <I>waste,</I> becomes <I>a reproach among the 
 nations in the sight of all that pass by,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 The more conspicuous and the more peculiar any have been in the day of 
 their prosperity the greater disgrace attends their fall; and that was 
 Jerusalem's case. The more Jerusalem had been <I>a praise in the 
 earth</I> the more it is now <I>a reproach and a taunt,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 This she was warned of as much as any thing when her glory commenced 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+9:8">1 Kings ix. 8</A>),

 and this was lamented as much as any thing when it was laid in the
 dust, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:15">Lam. ii. 15</A>.

 (2.) To teach the nations to fear before the God of Israel, when they 
 see what a jealous God he is, and how severely he punishes sin even in 
 those that are nearest to him: <I>It shall be an instruction to the 
 nations,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Jerusalem should have taught her neighbours the fear of God by her 
 piety and virtue, but, she not doing that, God will teach it to them by 
 her ruin; for they have reason to say, <I>If this be done in the green 
 tree, what shall be done in the dry?</I> If <I>judgment begin at the 
 house of God,</I> where will it end? If those be thus punished who only 
 had some idolaters among them, what will become of us who are all 
 idolaters? Note, The destruction of some is designed for the 
 instruction of others. Malefactors are publicly punished <I>in 
 terrorem</I>--<I>that others may take warning.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. These punishments, in the kind of them, shall be very severe and 
 grievous. 

 (1.) They shall be such as have no precedent or parallel. Their sins
 being more provoking than those of others, the judgments executed upon 
 them should be uncommon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>"I will do in thee that which I have not done</I> in thee before, 
 though thou hast long since deserved it; nay, that which I have not 
 done in any other city." This punishment of Jerusalem is said to be 
 <I>greater than that of Sodom</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:6">Lam. iv. 6</A>),

 which was more grievous than all that went before it; nay, it is such
 as "<I>I will not do any more the like,</I> all the circumstances taken 
 in, to any other city, till the like come to be done again to this 
 city, in the final overthrow by the Romans." This is a rhetorical 
 expression of the most grievous judgments, like that character of 
 Hezekiah, that there was <I>none like him, before or after him.</I>

 (2.) They shall be such as will force them to break the strongest bonds 
 of natural affection to one another, which will be a just punishment of 
 them for their wilfully breaking the bonds of their duty to God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>The fathers shall eat the sons, and the sons shall eat the 
 fathers,</I> through the extremity of the famine, or shall be compelled 
 to do it by their barbarous conquerors. 

 (3.) There shall be a complication of judgments, any one of them 
 terrible enough, and desolating; but what then would they be when they 
 came all together and in perfection? Some shall be taken away by the 
 plague

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 the <I>pestilence shall pass through thee</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 sweeping all before it, as the destroying angel; others <I>shall be 
 consumed with famine,</I> shall gradually waste away as men in a 
 consumption 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 this is again insisted on 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>I will send upon them the evil arrows of famine;</I> hunger shall 
 make them pine, and shall pierce them to the heart, as if arrows, 
 <I>evil arrows,</I> poisoned darts, were shot into them. God has many 
 arrows, <I>evil arrows,</I> in his quiver; when some are discharged, he 
 has still more in reserve. <I>I will increase the famine upon you.</I> 
 A famine in a bereaved country may <I>decrease</I> as fruits spring 
 forth; but a famine in a besieged city will <I>increase</I> of course; 
 yet god speaks of it as his act: "<I>I will increase it, and will break 
 your staff of bread,</I> will take away the necessary supports of life, 
 will disappoint you of all that which you depend upon, so that there is 
 no remedy, but you must fall to the ground." Life is frail, is weak, is 
 burdened, so that, if it have not daily bread for its staff to lean 
 upon, it cannot but sink, and is soon gone if that staff be broken.
 Others <I>shall fall by the sword round about</I> Jerusalem, when they 
 sally out upon the besiegers; it is a <I>sword</I> which God <I>will 
 bring,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 The sword of the Lord, that used to be drawn for Jerusalem's defence, 
 is now drawn for its destruction. Others are devoured by <I>evil 
 beasts,</I> which will make a prey of those that fly for shelter to the 
 deserts and mountains. They shall meet their ruin where they expected 
 refuge, for there is no escaping the judgments of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 And, <I>lastly,</I> those who escape shall be <I>scattered into</I> all 
 parts of the world, <I>into all the winds</I> (so it is expressed, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:10,12"><I>v.</I> 10, 12</A>),

 intimating that they should not only be dispersed, but hurried, and 
 tossed, and driven to and fro, as <I>chaff before the wind.</I> Nay, 
 and Cain's curse (to be fugitives and vagabonds) is not the worst of it 
 neither; their restless life shall be cut off by a bloody death: "<I>I 
 will draw out a sword after them,</I> which shall follow them wherever 
 they go." <I>Evil pursues sinners;</I> and the curse shall come upon 
 them and overtake them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. These punishments will prove their ruin by degrees. They shall be 
 <I>diminished</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);

 their strength and glory shall grow less and less. They shall be 
 <I>bereaved</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 emptied of all that which was their joy and confidence. God sends these 
 judgments on purpose to destroy them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 The arrows are not sent (as those which Jonathan shot) for their 
 direction, but <I>for their destruction;</I> for god will <I>accomplish 
 his fury upon them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 the day of God's patience is over, and the ruin is remediless. Though
 this prophecy was to have its accomplishment now quickly, in the 
 destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans, yet the executioners not 
 being named here, but the criminal only (<I>this is Jerusalem</I>), we 
 may well suppose that it looks further, to the final destruction of 
 that great city by the Romans when God made a full end of the Jewish 
 nation, and <I>caused his fury to rest upon them.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. All this is ratified by the divine authority and veracity: <I>I the 
 Lord have spoken it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>
 
 and again 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 The sentence is passed by him that is Judge of heaven and earth, whose 
 <I>judgment is according to truth,</I> and the judgments of whose hand 
 are according to the judgments of his mouth. He has spoken it who can
 do it, for with him nothing is impossible. He has spoken it who will do 
 it, for <I>he is not a man that he should lie.</I> He has spoken it 
 whom we are bound to hear and heed, whose <I>ipse dixit--word</I>
 commands the most serious attention and submissive assent: <I>And they
 shall know that I the Lord have spoken it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 There were those who thought it was only the prophet that spoke it in 
 his delirium; but God will make them know, by the accomplishment of it, 
 that he has spoken it in his zeal. Note, Sooner or later, God's word
 will prove itself.</P>
