 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter the approaching ruin of the land of Israel is most 
 particularly foretold in affecting expressions often repeated, that if 
 possible they might be awakened by repentance to prevent it. The 
 prophet must tell them, 

 I. That it will be a final ruin, a complete utter destruction, which
 would make an end of them, a miserable end, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. That it is an approaching ruin, just at the door, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:7-10">ver. 7-10</A>.

 III. That it is an unavoidable ruin, because they had by sin brought
 it upon themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:10-15">ver. 10-15</A>.

 IV. That their strength and wealth should be no fence against it, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:16-19">ver. 16-19</A>.

 V. That the temple, which they trusted in, should itself be ruined, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:20-22">ver. 20-22</A>.

 VI. That it should be a universal ruin, the sin that brought it having 
 been universal, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:23-27">ver. 23-27</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Moreover the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> unto the land
 of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the
 land.
 &nbsp; 3  Now <I>is</I> the end <I>come</I> upon thee, and I will send mine anger
 upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will
 recompense upon thee all thine abominations.
 &nbsp; 4  And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity:
 but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations
 shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I <I>am</I> the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 5  Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; An evil, an only evil, behold, is
 come.
 &nbsp; 6  An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee;
 behold, it is come.
 &nbsp; 7  The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the
 land: the time is come, the day of trouble <I>is</I> near, and not the
 sounding again of the mountains.
 &nbsp; 8  Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish
 mine anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy
 ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations.
 &nbsp; 9  And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I
 will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations
 <I>that</I> are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I <I>am</I>
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> that smiteth.
 &nbsp; 10  Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone
 forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.
 &nbsp; 11  Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them
 <I>shall remain,</I> nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs:
 neither <I>shall there be</I> wailing for them.
 &nbsp; 12  The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer
 rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath <I>is</I> upon all the
 multitude thereof.
 &nbsp; 13  For the seller shall not return to that which is sold,
 although they were yet alive: for the vision <I>is</I> touching the
 whole multitude thereof, <I>which</I> shall not return; neither shall
 any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.
 &nbsp; 14  They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but
 none goeth to the battle: for my wrath <I>is</I> upon all the
 multitude thereof.
 &nbsp; 15  The sword <I>is</I> without, and the pestilence and the famine
 within: he that <I>is</I> in the field shall die with the sword; and
 he that <I>is</I> in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here fair warning given of the destruction of the land of 
 Israel, which was now hastening on apace. God, by the prophet, not only 
 sends notice of it, but will have it inculcated in the same 
 expressions, to show that the thing is certain, that it is near, that 
 the prophet is himself affected with it and desires they should be so 
 too, but finds them deaf, and stupid, and unaffected. When the town is 
 on fire men do no seek for fine words and quaint expressions in which 
 to give an account of it, but cry about the streets, with a loud and 
 lamentable voice, "Fire! fire!" So the prophet here proclaims, <I>An 
 end! an end! it has come, it has come; behold, it has come. He that 
 hath ears to hear let him hear.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. <I>An end has come, the end has come</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),
 
 and again 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:3,6"><I>v.</I> 3, 6</A>),

 <I>Now has the end come upon thee</I>--the end which all their 
 wickedness had a tendency to, and which God had often told them it 
 would come to at last, when by his prophets he had asked them, <I>What 
 will you do in the end hereof?</I>--the end which all the foregoing 
 judgments had been working towards, as means to bring it about (their 
 ruin shall now be completed)--or <I>the end,</I> that is, the period of 
 their state, the final destruction of their nation, as the deluge was 
 <I>the end of all flesh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:13">Gen. vi. 13</A>.

 They had flattered themselves with hopes that they should shortly
 <I>see an end</I> of their troubles. "Yea," says God, "<I>An end has 
 come,</I> but a miserable one, not <I>the expected end</I>" (which is 
 promised to the pious remnant among them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:11">Jer. xxix. 11</A>);

 "<I>it is the end, that end</I> which you have been so often warned of,
 <I>that last end</I> which Moses wished you to <I>consider</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:29">Deut. xxxii. 29</A>),

 and which, because <I>Jerusalem remembered not, therefore she came down
 wonderfully,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+1:9">Lam. i. 9</A>.

 This end was long in coming, but <I>now it has come.</I> Though the
 ruin of sinners comes slowly, it comes surely. "<I>It has come;</I> it 
 watches for thee, ready to receive thee." This perhaps looks further, 
 to the last destruction of that nation by the Romans, which that by the 
 Chaldeans was an earnest of; and still further to the final destruction 
 of the world of the ungodly. <I>The end of all things is at hand;</I> 
 and Jerusalem's last end was a type of <I>the end of the world,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:3">Matt. xxiv. 3</A>.

 Oh that we could all see that end of time and days very near, and the
 end of our own time and days much nearer, that we may secure a happy 
 lot <I>at the end of the days!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+12:13">Dan. xii. 13</A>.

 This <I>end comes upon the four corners of the land.</I> The ruin, as
 it shall be final, so it shall be total; no part of the land shall 
 escape; no, not that which lies most remote. Such will the destruction 
 of the world be; all these things shall be dissolved. Such will the 
 destruction of sinners be; none can avoid it. <I>Oh that the wickedness 
 of the wicked</I> might <I>come to an end,</I> before it bring them to 
 <I>an end!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. <I>An evil, an only evil, behold, has come,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Sin is <I>an evil, an only evil, an evil</I> that has no good in it; it 
 is the worst of evils. But this is spoken of the evil of trouble; it is 
 <I>an evil,</I> one <I>evil,</I> and that one shall suffice to affect 
 and complete the ruin of the nation; there needs no more to do its 
 business; this one shall <I>make an utter end,</I> affliction needs not 
 <I>rise up a second time,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+1:9">Nah. i. 9</A>.

 It is <I>an evil</I> without precedent or parallel, <I>an evil</I> that
 stands alone; you cannot produce such another instance. It is to the 
 impenitent <I>an evil, an only evil;</I> it hardens their hearts and 
 irritates their corruptions, whereas there were those to whom it was 
 sanctified by the grace of God and made a means of much good; they were 
 <I>sent into Babylon for their good,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+24:5">Jer. xxiv. 5</A>.

 The wicked have <I>the dregs of that cup</I> to drink which to the
 righteous is full of <I>mixtures of mercy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+75:8">Ps. lxxv. 8</A>.

 The same affliction is to us either a half <I>evil</I> or <I>an only
 evil</I> according as we conduct ourselves under it and make use of it. 
 But when <I>an end, the end, has come</I> upon the wicked world, then 
 <I>an evil, an only evil,</I> comes upon it, and not till then. The
 sorest of temporal judgments have their allays, but the torments of the 
 damned are <I>an evil, an only evil.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. <I>The time has come,</I> the set time, for the inflicting of this 
 <I>only evil</I> and the making of this <I>full end;</I> for to all 
 God's purposes <I>there is a time,</I> a proper time, and that 
 prefixed, in which the purpose shall have its accomplishment; 
 particularly the time of reckoning with wicked people, and rendering to 
 them according to their desserts, is fixed, <I>the day of the 
 revelation of the righteous judgment of god;</I> and <I>he sees,</I> 
 whether we see it or no, that <I>his day is coming.</I> This they are 
 here told of again and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>Behold, the day</I> that has lingered so long <I>has come</I> at 
 last, <I>behold, it has come. The time has come, the day draws near, 
 the day of trouble is near,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:7,12"><I>v.</I> 7, 12</A>.

 Though threatened judgments may be long deferred, yet they shall not be 
 dropped; the time for executing them will come. Though God's patience 
 may put them off, nothing but man's sincere repentance and reformation 
 will put them by. <I>The morning has come unto thee</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 <I>The morning has gone forth;</I> the day of trouble dawns, the day of 
 destruction is already begun. <I>The morning</I> discovers that which 
 was hidden; they thought their secret sins would never come to light, 
 but now they will be brought to light. They used to try and execute
 malefactors in the morning, and such a morning of judgment and 
 execution is now coming upon them, <I>a day of trouble</I> to sinners, 
 <I>the year of their visitation.</I> See how stupid these people were, 
 that, though the day of their destruction was already begun, yet they 
 were not aware of it, but must be thus told of it again and again.
 <I>The day of trouble,</I> real trouble, <I>is near, and not the 
 sounding again of the mountains,</I> that is, not a mere echo or report 
 of troubles, as they were willing to think it was, nothing but a 
 groundless surmise; as if the <I>men that came against them</I> were 
 but <I>the shadow of the mountains</I> (as Zebul suggested to Gaal,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:36">Matt. ix. 36</A>)

 and the intelligence they received were but <I>an empty sound,</I>
 reverberated from the mountains. No; the trouble is not a fancy, and so 
 you will soon find.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. All this comes from God's wrath, not allayed, as sometimes it has 
 been, with mixtures of mercy. This is the fountain from which all these 
 calamities flow; and this is <I>the wormwood and the gall</I> in <I>the 
 affliction and the misery,</I> which make it bitter indeed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>I will send my anger upon thee.</I> Observe, God is Lord of his 
 anger; it does not break out but when he pleases, nor fasten upon any 
 but as he directs it and gives it commission. The expression rises 
 higher 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee</I> in full vials, 
 <I>and accomplish my anger,</I> all the purposes and all the products 
 of it, <I>upon thee.</I> This wrath does not single out here and there 
 one to be made examples, but it <I>is upon all the multitude 
 thereof</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:12,14"><I>v.</I> 12, 14</A>);

 the whole body of the nation has become a <I>vessel of wrath, fitted 
 for destruction.</I> God does sometimes <I>in wrath remember mercy,</I> 
 but now he says, <I>My eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have 
 pity,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:4,9"><I>v.</I> 4 and again <I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Those shall <I>have judgment without mercy</I> who made light of mercy
 when it was offered them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. All this is the just punishment of their sins, and it is what they 
 have by their own folly brought upon themselves. This is much insisted 
 on here, that they might be brought to justify God in all he had 
 brought upon them. God never sends his anger but in wisdom and justice; 
 and therefore it follows, "<I>I will judge thee according to thy 
 ways,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 I will examine what thy ways have been, compare them with the law, and 
 then deal with thee according to the merit of them, and 
 <I>recompense</I> them to <I>thee,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Note, In the heaviest judgments God inflicts upon sinners he does but 
 <I>recompense their own ways upon them;</I> they are beaten with their 
 own rod. And, when God comes to reckon with a sinful people, he will 
 bring every provocation to account: "<I>will recompense upon thee all 
 thy abominations</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 and now <I>thy iniquity shall be found to be hateful</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+36:2">Ps. xxxvi. 2</A>)

 <I>and thy abominations shall be in the midst of thee</I>" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 that is, the secret wickedness shall now be brought to light, and that 
 shall appear to have been in the midst of thee which before was not 
 suspected; and thy sin shall now become an <I>abomination</I> to 
 thyself. So the abomination of iniquity will be when it comes to be an 
 <I>abomination of desolation,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:15">Matt. xxiv. 15</A>.

 Or, <I>Thy abominations</I> (that is, the punishments of them) <I>shall
 be in the midst of thee;</I> they shall <I>reach to thy heart.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:18">Jer. iv. 18</A>.

 Or therefore <I>God will not spare, nor have pity,</I> because, even
 when he is <I>recompensing their ways</I> upon them, yet <I>in their 
 distress they trespass yet more;</I> their <I>abominations</I> are 
 still <I>in the midst of them,</I> indulged and harboured in their 
 hearts. It is repeated again

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>),

 <I>I will judge thee, I will recompense thee.</I> Two sins are 
 particularly specified as provoking God to bring these judgments upon 
 them--pride and oppression. 

 1. God will humble them by his judgments, for they have magnified
 themselves. <I>The rod</I> of affliction <I>has blossomed,</I> but it
 was <I>pride</I> that <I>budded,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 What buds in sin will blossom in some judgment or other. The pride of 
 Judah and Jerusalem appeared among all orders and degrees of men, as 
 buds upon the tree in spring.

 2. Their enemies shall deal hardly with them, for they have dealt
 hardly with one another

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>Violence has risen up into a rod of wickedness;</I> that is, their 
 injuriousness to one another is protected and patronised by the power 
 of the magistrate. The rod of government had become a <I>rod of
 wickedness,</I> to such a degree of impudence was <I>violence risen up.
 I saw the place of judgment, that wickedness was there,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:16,Isa+5:7">Eccl. iii. 16; Isa. v. 7</A>.

 Whatever are the fruits of God's judgments, it is certain that our sin
 is the root of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. There is no escape from these judgments nor fence against them, for 
 they shall be universal and shall bear down all before them, without 
 remedy. 

 1. Death in its various shapes shall ride triumphantly, both in town
 and in country, both within the city and without it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Men shall be safe nowhere; for <I>he that is in the field shall die by 
 the sword</I> (every field shall be to them a field of battle) <I>and 
 he that is in the city,</I> though it be a holy city, yet it shall not 
 be his protection, but <I>famine and pestilence shall devour him.</I> 
 Sin had abounded both in city and country, <I>Iliacos intra muros 
 peccator et extra--Trojans and Greeks offend alike;</I> and therefore 
 among both desolations are made. 

 2. None of those that are marked for death shall escape: There <I>shall 
 none of them remain.</I> None of those proud oppressors that did 
 violence to their poor neighbours with <I>the rod of wickedness,</I> 
 none of them shall be left, but they shall be all swept away by the 
 desolation that is coming

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>None of their multitude,</I> that is, of the rabble, whom they set 
 on to do mischief, and to countenance them in doing it, to cry, 
 "Crucify, crucify," when they were resolved on the destruction of any, 
 <I>none of them shall remain, nor any of theirs;</I> their families 
 shall all be destroyed, and neither root nor branch left them. This 
 multitude, this mob, divine vengeance will in a particular manner 
 fasten upon; <I>for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:12,14"><I>v.</I> 12, 14</A>)

 and <I>the vision was touching the whole multitude thereof</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 the bulk of the common people. The judgments coming shall carry them 
 away by wholesale, and they shall neither secure themselves nor their 
 masters whose creatures and tools they were. God's judgments, when
 they come with commission, cannot be overpowered by multitudes.
 <I>Though hand join in hand, yet shall not the wicked go 
 unpunished.</I> 
 
 3. Those that fall shall not be lamented

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>There shall be no wailing for them,</I> for there shall be none left
 to bewail them, but such as are hastening apace after them. And the
 times shall be so bad that men shall rather congratulate than lament 
 the death of their friends, as reckoning those happy that are taken 
 away from seeing these desolations and sharing in them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:4,5">Jer. xvi. 4, 5</A>.
 
 4. They shall not be able to make any resistance. The decree has gone
 forth, and <I>the vision</I> concerning them <I>shall not return,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 God will not reveal it, and they cannot defeat it; and therefore it 
 <I>shall not return re infecta--without having accomplished any 
 thing,</I> but shall <I>accomplish that for which he sends it.</I> 
 God's word will take place, and then, 

 (1.) Particular persons cannot make their part good against God: No man 
 <I>shall strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life;</I> it will be 
 to no purpose for sinners to set God and his judgments at defiance as 
 they used to do. <I>None ever hardened his heart against God and 
 prospered.</I> Those that strengthen themselves in their wickedness 
 will be found not only to weaken, but to ruin, themselves,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+52:7">Ps. lii. 7</A>.

 (2.) <I>The multitude</I> cannot resist the torrent of these judgments, 
 nor make head against them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>They have blown the trumpet,</I> to call their soldiers together,
 and to animate and encourage those whom they have got together, and 
 thus they think <I>to make all ready;</I> but all in vain; none enlist 
 themselves, or those that do have not courage to face the enemy. Note, 
 If God be against us, none can be for us to do us any service. 

 5. They shall have no hope of the return of their prosperity, with
 which to support themselves in their adversity; they shall have given 
 up all for gone; and therefore, "<I>Let not the buyer rejoice</I> that 
 he is increasing his estate and has become a purchaser; nor let <I>the 
 seller mourn</I> that he is lessening his estate and has become a 
 bankrupt,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 See the vanity of the things of this world, and how worthless they 
 are--that in a time of trouble, when we have most need of them, we may 
 perhaps make least account of them. Those that have sold are the more 
 easy, having the less to lose, and those that have bought have but 
 increased their own cares and fears. Because <I>the fashion of this 
 world passes away,</I> let <I>those that buy be as though they 
 possessed not,</I> because they know not how soon they may be 
 dispossessed,

 "<I>The seller shall not return,</I> at the year of jubilee, <I>to that
 which is sold,</I> according to the law, though he should escape the 
 sword and pestilence, and live till that year comes; for no 
 inheritances shall be enjoyed here till the seventy years be 
 accomplished, and then men shall return to their possessions, shall 
 claim and have their own again." In the belief of this, Jeremiah, about 
 this time, <I>bought his uncle's field,</I> yet, according to the 
 charge, the buyer did not rejoice, but complain,

 Lord</I>

 you, but you shall be made to know he is but the staff: it is the hand 
 of the Lord that smiteth you, and who knows the weight of his hand?" 
 Those who would not know it was the <I>Lord that did them goo</I> shall 
 be made to know it is <I>the Lord that smiteth</I> them; for, one way 
 or other, he will be owned.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on
 the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning,
 every one for his iniquity.
 &nbsp; 17  All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak <I>as</I>
 water.
 &nbsp; 18  They shall also gird <I>themselves</I> with sackcloth, and horror
 shall cover them; and shame <I>shall be</I> upon all faces, and
 baldness upon all their heads.
 &nbsp; 19  They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold
 shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able
 to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: they shall
 not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels: because it is
 the stumbling-block of their iniquity.
 &nbsp; 20  As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but
 they made the images of their abominations <I>and</I> of their
 detestable things therein: therefore have I set it far from them.
 &nbsp; 21  And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a
 prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall
 pollute it.
 &nbsp; 22  My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute
 my secret <I>place:</I> for the robbers shall enter into it, and
 defile it.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have attended the fate of those that are cut off, and are now to 
 attend the flight of those that have an opportunity of escaping the 
 danger; some of them <I>shall escape</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 but what the better? As good die once as, in a miserable life, die a
 thousand deaths, and escape only like Cain to be <I>fugitives and 
 vagabonds,</I> and afraid of being slain by every one they meet; so 
 shall these be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They shall have no comfort or satisfaction in their own minds, but 
 be in continual anguish and terror; for, wherever they go, they carry 
 about with them guilty consciences, which make them a burden to 
 themselves. 

 1. They shall be always solitary and under prevailing melancholy; they
 shall not be in the cities, or places of concourse, but all alone 
 <I>upon the mountains,</I> not caring for society, but shy of it, as 
 being ashamed of the low circumstances to which they are reduced. 

 2. They shall be always sorrowful. Those have reason to be so that are
 under the tokens of God's displeasure; and God can make those so that 
 have been most jovial and have set sorrow at defiance. Those that once 
 thought themselves as the lions of the mountains, so daring were they, 
 now become as the <I>doves of the valleys,</I> so timid are they, and 
 so dispirited, ready to <I>flee when none pursues</I> and to tremble at 
 the shaking of a leaf. They are all of them mourning (not with a 
 <I>godly sorrow,</I> but with the <I>sorrow of the world,</I> which 
 <I>works death), every one for his iniquity,</I> that is, for those 
 calamities which they now see their iniquity has brought upon them, not 
 only the iniquity of the land, but their own: they shall then be 
 brought to acknowledge what they have each of them contributed to the 
 national guilt. Note, Sooner or later sin will have sorrow of one kind 
 or other; and those that will not repent of their iniquity may justly 
 be left to pine away in it; those that will not mourn for it as it is 
 an offence to God shall be made to mourn for it as it is a shame and 
 ruin to themselves, to <I>mourn at the last, when the flesh and the 
 body are consumed, and to say, How have I hated instruction!</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:11,12">Prov. v. 11, 12</A>.

 3. They shall be deprived of all their strength of body and mind 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>All hands shall be feeble,</I> so that they shall not be able to 
 fight, or defend themselves, and <I>all knees shall be weak as 
 water,</I> so that they shall neither be able to flee nor to stand 
 their ground; they shall feel a universal colliquation: their knees 
 <I>shall flow as water,</I> so that they must fall of course. Note, It 
 is folly for the <I>strong man to glory in his strength,</I> for God 
 can soon weaken it. 

 4. They shall be deprived of all their hopes and shall abandon 
 themselves to despair 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>);

 they shall have nothing to hold up their spirits with; their aspects 
 shall show what are their prospects, all dreadful, for they shall 
 <I>gird themselves with sackcloth,</I> as having no expectation ever to 
 wear better clothing. <I>Horror shall cover them,</I> and
 <I>shame,</I> and <I>baldness,</I> all the expressions of a desperate 
 sorrow, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+17:11">Isa. xvii. 11</A>.

 Note, Those that will not be kept from sin by fear and shame shall by
 fear and shame be punished for it; such is the confusion that sin will 
 end in.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They shall have no benefit from their wealth and riches, but shall 
 be perfectly sick of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Those that were reduced to this distress were such as had had abundance 
 of <I>silver and gold,</I> money, and plate, and jewels, and other 
 valuable goods, from which they promised themselves a great deal of 
 advantage in times of public trouble. They thought their wealth would 
 be <I>their strong city,</I> that with it they could bribe enemies and 
 buy friends, that it would be the ransom of their lives, that they 
 could never want bread as long as they had money, and that <I>money 
 would answer all things;</I> but see how it proved. 

 1. Their wealth had been a great temptation to them in the <I>day of
 their prosperity;</I> they set their affections upon it, and put their 
 confidence in it. By their eager pursuit of it they were drawn into 
 sin, and by their plentiful enjoyment of it they were hardened in sin; 
 and thus it was the stumbling-block of their iniquity; it occasioned 
 their falling into sin and obstructed their return to God. Note, There 
 are many whose wealth is their snare and ruin. The gaining of the world 
 is the losing of their souls; it makes them proud, secure, covetous, 
 oppressive, voluptuous; and that which, it well used, might have been 
 the servant of their piety, being abused, becomes <I>the 
 stumbling-block of their iniquity.</I> 

 2. It was no relief to them now in the day of their adversity; for,

 (1.) Their <I>gold and silver</I> could not protect them from the 
 judgments of God. They <I>shall not be able to deliver them in the day 
 of the wrath of the Lord;</I> they shall not serve to atone his 
 justice, or turn away his wrath, nor to screen them from the judgments 
 he is bringing upon them. Note, <I>Riches profit not in the day of
 wrath,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+11:4">Prov. xi. 4</A>.

 They neither set them so high that god's judgments cannot reach them 
 nor make them so strong that they cannot conquer them. There is a day 
 of wrath coming, when it will appear that men's wealth is utterly 
 unable to deliver them or do them any service. What the better was the
 rich man for his full barns when his soul was required of him, or that 
 other rich man for his <I>purple, and scarlet, and sumptuous fare,</I> 
 when in hell he could not procure a drop of water to <I>cool his 
 tongue?</I> Money is no defence against the arrests of death, nor any 
 alleviation to the miseries of the damned.

 (2.) Their <I>gold and silver</I> could not give them any content under 
 their calamities.

 [1.] They could not fill their bowels; when there was no bread left in 
 the city, none to be had for love or money, their silver and gold could 
 not satisfy their hunger, nor serve to make one meal's meat for them. 
 Note, We could better be without mines of gold than fields of corn; the 
 products of the earth, which may easily be gathered from the surface of 
 it, are much greater blessings to mankind than its treasures, which are 
 with so much difficulty and hazard dug out of its bowels. If God give 
 us daily bread, we have reason to be thankful, and no reason to 
 complain, though silver and gold we have none. 

 [2.] Much less could they satisfy their souls, or yield them any inward 
 comfort. Note, The wealth of this world has not that in it which will 
 answer the desires of the soul, or be any satisfaction to it in a day 
 of distress. <I>He that loves silver shall not be satisfied with 
 silver,</I> much less he that loses it. 

 (3.) Their <I>gold and silver shall be thrown into the streets,</I> 
 either by the hands of the enemy, who shall have more spoil than they 
 care for or can carry away (silver shall be nothing accounted of; they 
 shall <I>cast that in the streets;</I> but the <I>gold,</I> which is 
 more valuable, shall be removed and brought to Babylon); or they 
 themselves shall <I>throw away their silver and gold,</I> because it 
 would be an incumbrance to them and retard their flight, or because it 
 would expose them and be a temptation to the enemy to cut their throats 
 for their money, or in indignation at it, because, after all the care 
 and pains they had taken to scrape it together and hoard it up, they 
 found that it would stand them in no stead, but do them a mischief 
 rather. Note, <I>The world passes away, and the lusts thereof,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:17">1 John ii. 17</A>.

 The time may come when worldly men will be as weary of their wealth as
 now they are wedded to it, when those will fare best that have 
 least.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. God's temple shall stand them in no stead, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:20-22"><I>v.</I> 20-22</A>.

 This they had prided themselves in, and promised themselves security 
 from 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:4,Mic+3:11">Jer. vii. 4; Mic. iii. 11</A>);

 but this confidence of theirs shall fail them. Observe, 

 1. The great honour God had done to that people in setting up his
 sanctuary among them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>As for the beauty of his ornament,</I> that <I>holy and beautiful 
 house,</I> where <I>they and their fathers praised God</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:11">Isa. lxiv. 11</A>),

 which was therefore beautiful because holy (it was called the <I>beauty
 of holiness,</I> and holiness is the beauty of its ornament; it was 
 also adorned with gold and gifts)--as for this, <I>he set it in 
 majesty;</I> every thing was contrived to make it magnificent, that it 
 might help to make the people of Israel the more illustrious among 
 their neighbours. <I>He built his sanctuary like high palaces,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:69">Ps. lxxviii. 69</A>.
 
 It was a <I>glorious high throne from the beginning,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:12">Jer. xvii. 12</A>.
 
 But,

 2. Here is the great dishonour they had done to God in profaning his
 sanctuary; they <I>made the images of their</I> counterfeit deities, 
 which they set up in rivalship with God, and which are here called 
 <I>their abominations</I> and <I>their detestable things</I> (for so 
 they were to God, and so they should have been to them), and these they 
 set up in God's temple, than which a greater affront could not be put 
 upon him. And therefore, 

 3. It is here threatened that they shall be deprived of the temple, and
 it shall be no succour to them: <I>Therefore have I set it far from 
 them,</I> that is, sent them far from it, so that it is out of the 
 reach of their services and they are out of the reach of its 
 influences. Note, God's ordinances, and the privileges of a profession 
 of religion, will justly be taken away from those that despise and 
 profane them. Nay, they shall not only be kept at a distance from the 
 temple, but the temple itself shall be involved in the common 
 desolation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>);

 the Chaldeans, who are <I>strangers,</I> and therefore have no 
 veneration for it, who are <I>the wicked of the earth,</I> and 
 therefore have an antipathy to it, shall <I>have it for a prey</I> and 
 for <I>a spoil;</I> all the ornaments and treasures of it shall fall 
 into their hands, who will make no difference between that and other 
 plunder. This was a grief to the saints in Zion, who complained of 
 nothing so much as of that which <I>the enemy did wickedly in the 
 sanctuary</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:3">Ps. lxxiv. 3</A>);

 but it was the punishment of the sinners in Zion, who, by profaning the
 temple with <I>strange gods,</I> provoked God to suffer it to be 
 profaned by <I>strange nations,</I> and to <I>turn his face from those 
 that did it</I> as if he had not seen them and their crimes and from 
 those that deprecated it as not regarding them and their prayers. Let 
 the soldiers do as they will; let them <I>enter into the secret 
 place,</I> into the holy of holies, as robbers; let them strip it, let 
 them pollute it; its defence has departed, and then farewell all its 
 glory. Note, Those are unworthy to be honoured with the form of 
 godliness who will not be governed by the power of godliness.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>23  Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the
 city is full of violence.
 &nbsp; 24  Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they
 shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the
 strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.
 &nbsp; 25  Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and <I>there
 shall be</I> none.
 &nbsp; 26  Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon
 rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law
 shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.
 &nbsp; 27  The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with
 desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be
 troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to
 their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I <I>am</I>
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, I. The prisoner arraigned: <I>Make a chain,</I> in which to 
 drag the criminal to the bar, and set him before the tribunal of divine 
 justice; let him stand in fetters (as a notorious malefactor), stand 
 pinioned to receive his doom. Note, Those that break the bands of God's 
 law <I>asunder,</I> and <I>cast away those cords from them,</I> will 
 find themselves bound and held by the chains of his judgments, which 
 they cannot break nor cast from them. The chain signified the siege of 
 Jerusalem, or the slavery of those that were carried into captivity, or 
 that they were all bound over to the righteous judgment of God, 
 <I>reserved in chains.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The indictment drawn up against the prisoner: <I>The land is full 
 of bloody crimes,</I> full of <I>the judgments of blood</I> (so the 
 word is), that is, of the guilt of blood which they had shed under 
 colour of justice and by forms of law, with the solemnity of a 
 judgment. The innocent blood which Manasseh shed, probably thus shed, 
 by the <I>judgment of the blood,</I> was the measure-filling sin of 
 Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:4">2 Kings xxiv. 4</A>.

 Or, It is full of such crimes as by the law were to be punished with
 death, <I>the judgment of blood.</I> Idolatry, blasphemy, witchcraft, 
 Sodomy, and the like, were <I>bloody crimes,</I> for which particular 
 sinners were to die; and therefore, when they had become national, 
 there was no remedy but the nation must be cut off. Note, Bloody
 crimes will be punished with bloody judgments. <I>The city,</I> the 
 city of David, the holy city, that should have been the pattern of 
 righteousness, the protector of it, and the punisher of wrong, <I>is 
 now full of violence;</I> the rulers of that city, having greater power 
 and reputation, are greater oppressors than any others. This was sadly
 to be lamented. <I>How has the faithful city become a harlot!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Judgment given upon this indictment. God will reckon with them not 
 only for the profaning of his sanctuary, but for the perverting of 
 justice between man and man; for, as <I>holiness becomes his house,</I> 
 so the <I>righteous Lord loves righteousness</I> and is the avenger of 
 unrighteousness. Now the judgment given is, 

 1. That since they had walked in the way of the heathen, and done worse
 than they, God would <I>bring the worst of the heathen upon them</I> to 
 destroy them and lay them waste, the most barbarous and outrageous, 
 that have the least compassion to mankind and the greatest antipathy to 
 the Jews. Note, Of the heathen some are worse than others, and God 
 sometimes picks out the worst to be a scourge to his own people, 
 because he intends them for the fire when the work is done. 

 2. That since they had filled their houses with goods unjustly gotten, 
 and used their pomp and power for the crushing and oppressing of the 
 weak, God would give their houses to be possessed and all the furniture 
 of them to be enjoyed by strangers, and <I>make the pomp of the strong 
 to cease,</I> so that their great men should not dazzle the eyes of the 
 weak-sighted with their pomp, nor with their might at any time prevail 
 against right, as they had done.

 3. That, since they had <I>defiled the holy places</I> with their
 idolatries, God would defile them with his judgments, since they had 
 set up the images of other gods in the temple, God would remove thence 
 the tokens of the presence of their own God. When the holy places are 
 deserted by their God they will soon be defiled by their enemies. 

 4. Since they had followed one sin with another, God would pursue them
 with one judgment upon another: "<I>Destruction comes, utter 
 destruction</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>);

 for there shall come <I>mischief upon mischief</I> to ruin you, and 
 <I>rumour upon rumour</I> to frighten you, like the waves in a storm, 
 one upon the neck of another." Note, Sinners that are marked for ruin 
 shall be prosecuted to it; for God will overcome when he judges. 

 5. Since they had disappointed God's expectations from them, he would
 disappoint their expectations from him; for,

 (1.) They shall not have the <I>deliverance out of their troubles</I> 
 that they expect. They shall <I>seek peace;</I> they shall desire it 
 and pray for it; they shall aim at and expect it: but <I>there shall be 
 none;</I> their attempts both to court their enemies and to conquer 
 them shall be in vain, and their troubles shall grow worse and worse.

 (2.) They shall not have the direction in the trouble that they expect 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>They shall seek a vision of the prophet,</I> shall desire, for their 
 support under their troubles, to be assured of a happy issue out of 
 them. They did not desire a vision to reprove them for sin, nor to warn 
 them of danger, but to promise them deliverance. Such messages they 
 longed to hear. But <I>the law shall perish from the priest;</I> he 
 shall have no words either of counsel or comfort to say to them. They
 would not hear what God had to say to them by ways of conviction, and 
 therefore he has nothing to say to them by way of encouragement.
 <I>Counsel shall perish from the ancients;</I> the elders of the 
 people, that should advise them what to do in this difficult juncture, 
 shall be infatuated and at their wits' end. It is bad with a people
 when those that should be their counsellors know not how to consider 
 within themselves, consult with one another, or counsel them. 

 6. Since they had animated and encouraged one another to sin, God would 
 dispirit and dishearten them all, so that they should not be able to 
 make head against the judgments of God that were breaking in upon them. 
 All orders and degrees of men shall lie down by consent under the load

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>The king,</I> that should inspire life into them, and <I>the 
 prince,</I> that should lead them onto attack the enemy, <I>shall 
 mourn</I> and be <I>clothed with desolation;</I> their heads and hearts 
 shall fail, their politics and their courage; and then no wonder if 
 <I>the hands of the people of the land,</I> that should fight for them, 
 be <I>troubled.</I> None of the men of might shall <I>find their 
 hands.</I> What can men contrive or do for themselves when God has 
 departed from them and appears against them? All must needs be in 
 <I>tears,</I> all in <I>trouble,</I> when God comes to <I>judge them 
 according to their deserts,</I> and so make then know, to their cost, 
 that he is the Lord, the <I>God to whom vengeance belongs.</I></P>
