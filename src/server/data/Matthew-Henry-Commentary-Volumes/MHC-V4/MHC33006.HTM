 After the precious promises in the two foregoing chapters, relating to 
 the Messiah's kingdom, the prophet is here directed to set the sins of 
 Israel in order before them, for their conviction and humiliation, as 
 necessary to make way for the comfort of gospel-grace. Christ's 
 forerunner was a reprover, and preached repentance, and so prepared his 
 way. Here, 

 I. God enters an action against his people for their base ingratitude,
 and the bad returns they had made him for his favours, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. He shows the wrong course they should have taken, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:6-8">ver. 6-8</A>.

 III. He calls upon them to hear the voice of his judgments, and sets
 the sins in order before them for which he still proceeded in his
 controversy with them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:9">ver. 9</A>),
 
 their injustice 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:10-15">ver. 10-15</A>),

 and their idolatry 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:16">ver. 16</A>),

 for both which ruin was coming upon them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Hear ye now what the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> saith; Arise, contend thou before
 the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.
 &nbsp; 2 Hear ye, O mountains, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s controversy, and ye strong
 foundations of the earth: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath a controversy with
 his people, and he will plead with Israel.
 &nbsp; 3 O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I
 wearied thee? testify against me.
 &nbsp; 4 For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed
 thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses,
 Aaron, and Miriam.
 &nbsp; 5 O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted,
 and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto
 Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. The prefaces to the message are very solemn and such as may engage 
 our most serious attention. 

 1. The people are commanded to give audience: <I>Hear you now what the
 Lord says.</I> What the prophet speaks he speaks from God, and in his 
 name; they are therefore bound to hear it, not as the word of a sinful 
 dying man, but of the holy living God. <I>Hear now</I> what he saith, 
 for, first or last, he will be heard. 

 2. The prophet is commanded to speak in earnest, and to put an emphasis
 upon what he said: <I>Arise, contend thou before the mountains,</I> or 
 <I>with the mountains,</I> and <I>let the hills hear thy voice,</I> if 
 it were possible; contend with the mountains and hills of Judea, that 
 is, with the inhabitants of those mountains and hills; and, some think, 
 reference is had to those mountains and hills on which they worshipped 
 idols and which were thus polluted. But it is rather to be taken more 
 generally, as appears by his call, not only to the mountains, but to 
 the <I>strong foundations of the earth,</I> pursuant to the 
 instructions given him. This is designed,

 (1.) To excite the earnestness of the prophet; he must speak as 
 vehemently as if he designed to make even the hills and mountains hear 
 him, must <I>cry aloud, and not spare;</I> what he had to say in God's 
 name he must proclaim publicly before the mountains, as one that was 
 neither ashamed nor afraid to own his message; he must speak as one 
 concerned, as one that desired to speak to the heart, and therefore 
 appeared to speak from the heart. 

 (2.) To expose the stupidity of the people; "<I>Let the hills hear thy 
 voice,</I> for this senseless careless people will not hear it, will 
 not heed it. Let the rocks, the <I>foundations of the earth,</I> that 
 have no ears, hear, since Israel, that has ears, will not hear." It is 
 an appeal to the mountains and hills; let them bear witness that Israel 
 has fair warning given them, and good counsel, if they would but take 
 it. Thus Isaiah begins with, <I>Hear, O heavens! and give ear, O 
 earth!</I> Let them <I>judge between God and his vineyard.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The message itself is very affecting. He is to let all the world 
 know that God has a quarrel with his people, good ground for an action 
 against them. Their offences are public, and therefore so are the 
 articles of impeachment exhibited against them. Take notice <I>the Lord 
 has a controversy with his people and he will plead with Israel,</I> 
 will plead by his prophets, plead by his providences, to make good his 
 charge. Note, 

 1. Sin begets a controversy between God and man. The righteous God has
 an action against every sinner, an action of debt, an action of 
 trespass, an action of slander. 

 2. If Israel, God's own professing people, provoke him by sin, he will
 let them know that he has a controversy with them; he sees sin in them, 
 and is displeased with it, nay, their sins are more displeasing to him 
 than the sins of others, as they are a greater grief to his Spirit and 
 dishonour to his name. 

 3. God will plead with those whom he has a controversy with, will
 plead with his people Israel, that they may be convinced and that he 
 may be justified. In the close of the foregoing chapter he pleaded with 
 the heathen in anger and fury, to bring them to ruin; but here he 
 pleads with Israel in compassion and tenderness, to bring them to 
 repentance, <I>Come now, and let us reason together.</I> God reasons 
 with us, to teach us to reason with ourselves. See the equity of God's 
 cause, it will bear to be pleaded, and sinners themselves will be 
 forced to confess judgment, and to own that <I>God's ways are 
 equal,</I> but their <I>ways are unequal,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:25">Ezek. xviii. 25</A>.
 
 Now,

 (1.) God here challenges them to show what he had done against them
 which might give them occasion to desert him. They had revolted from 
 God and rebelled against him; but had they any cause to do so?

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>O my people! what have I done unto thee? Wherein have I wearied 
 thee?</I>" If subjects quit their allegiance to their prince, they will 
 pretend (as the ten tribes did when they revolted from Rehoboam), that 
 his yoke is too heavy for them; but can you pretend any such thing?
 <I>What have I done to you</I> that is unjust or unkind? <I>Wherein 
 have I wearied you</I> with the impositions of service or the exactions 
 of tribute? <I>Have I made you to serve with an offering?</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:23">Isa. xliii. 23</A>.
 
 <I>What iniquity have your fathers found in me?</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:5">Jer. ii. 5</A>.

 He never deceived us, nor disappointed our expectations from him, never
 did us wrong, nor put disgrace upon us; why then do we wrong and 
 dishonour him, and frustrate his expectations from us? Here is a 
 challenge to all that ever were in God's service to testify against him 
 if they have found him, in any thing, a hard Master, or if they have 
 found his demands unreasonable.

 (2.) Since they could not show any thing that he had done against them, 
 he will show them a great deal that he has done for them, which should 
 have engaged them for ever to his service,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 They are here directed, and we in them, to look a great way back in 
 their reviews of the divine favour; let them remember their former 
 days, their first days, when they were formed into a people, and the 
 great things God did for them, 

 [1.] When he brought them out of Egypt, the land of their bondage,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 They were content with their slavery, and almost in love with their 
 chains, for the sake of the garlic and onions they had plenty of; but 
 God <I>brought them up,</I> inspired them with an ambition of liberty 
 and animated them with a resolution by a bold effort to shake off their 
 fetters. The Egyptians held them fast, and would not let the people go; 
 but God <I>redeemed them,</I> not by price, but by force, <I>out of the 
 house of servants,</I> or, rather, <I>the house of bondage,</I> for it 
 is the same word that is used in the preface to the ten commandments, 
 which insinuates that the considerations which are arguments for duty, 
 if they be not improved by us, will be improved against us as 
 aggravations of sin. When he brought them out of Egypt into a vast 
 howling wilderness, as he left not himself without witness, so he left 
 not them without guides, for he sent before them <I>Moses, Aaron, and 
 Miriam, three prophets</I> (says the Chaldee paraphrase), Moses the 
 great prophet of the Old Testament, Aaron his prophet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+7:1">Exod. vii. 1</A>),

 and Miriam a prophetess, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:20">Exod. xv. 20</A>.

 Note, When we are calling to mind God's former mercies to us we must
 not forget the mercy of good teachers and governors when we were young; 
 let those be made mention of, to the glory of God, who went before us, 
 saying, <I>This is the way, walk in it;</I> it was God that sent them 
 before us, to prepare the way of the Lord and to prepare a people for 
 him.

 [2.] When he brought them into Canaan. God no less glorified himself, 
 and honoured them, in what he did for them when he brought them into 
 the land of their rest than in what he did for them when he brought 
 them out of the land of their servitude. When Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, 
 were dead, yet they found God the same. Let them remember now what God 
 did for them, <I>First,</I> In baffling and defeating the designs of 
 Balak and Balaam against them, which he did by the power he has over 
 the hearts and tongues of men,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Let them remember <I>what Balak the king of Moab consulted,</I> what 
 mischief he devised and designed to do to Israel, when they encamped in 
 the plains of Moab; that which he consulted was to <I>curse Israel,</I> 
 to divide between them and their God, and to disengage him from the 
 protection of them. Among the heathen, when they made war upon any
 people, they endeavoured by magic charms or otherwise to get from them 
 their tutelar gods, as to rob Troy of its Palladium. Macrobius has a
 chapter <I>de ritu evocandi Deos--concerning the solemnity of calling 
 out the gods.</I> Balak would try this against Israel; but remember 
 <I>what Balaam the son of Beor answered him,</I> how contrary to his 
 own intention and inclination; instead of cursing Israel, he blessed 
 them, to the extreme confusion and vexation of Balak. Let them remember 
 the malice of the heathen against them, and for that reason never 
 <I>learn the way of the heathen,</I> nor associate with them. Let them 
 remember the kindness of their God to them, how he <I>turned the curse 
 into a blessing (because the Lord thy God loved thee,</I> as it is, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:5">Deut. xxiii. 5</A>),

 and for that reason never forsake him. Note, The disappointing of the 
 devices of the church's enemies ought always to be remembered to the 
 glory of the church's protector, who can make <I>the answer of the 
 tongue</I> directly to contradict the preparation and consultation of 
 the heart,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+16:1">Prov. xvi. 1</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> In bringing them <I>from Shittim,</I> their last
 lodgment out of Canaan, <I>unto Gilgal,</I> their first lodgment in 
 Canaan. There it was, between Shittim and Gilgal, that, upon the death 
 of Moses, Joshua, a type of Christ, was raised up to put Israel in 
 possession of the land of promise and to fight their battles; there it 
 was that they passed over Jordan through the divided waters, and 
 renewed the covenant of circumcision; these mercies of God to their 
 fathers they must now remember, that they may <I>know the righteousness 
 of the Lord, his righteousness</I> (so the word is), his justice in 
 destroying the Canaanites, his goodness in giving rest to his people 
 Israel, and his faithfulness to his promise made unto the fathers. The 
 remembrance of what God had done to them might convince them of all 
 this, and engage them for ever to his service. Or they may refer to the 
 controversy now pleaded between God and Israel; let them remember God's 
 many favours to them and their fathers, and compare with them their 
 unworthy ungrateful conduct towards him, <I>that they may know the 
 righteousness of the Lord</I> in contending with them, and it may 
 appear that in this controversy he has right on his side; his ways are 
 equal, for he will be <I>justified when he speaks,</I> and <I>clear 
 when he judges.</I></P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is the proposal for accommodation between God and Israel, the 
 parties that were at variance in the beginning of the chapter. Upon the 
 trial, judgment is given against Israel; they are convicted of 
 injustice and ingratitude towards God, the crimes with which they stood 
 charged. Their guilt is too plain to be denied, too great to be 
 excused, and therefore,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They express their desires to be at peace with God upon any terms 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>):

 <I>Wherewith shall I come before the Lord?</I> Being made sensible of 
 the justice of God's controversy with them, and dreading the 
 consequences of it, they were inquisitive what they might do to be 
 reconciled to God and to make him their friend. They apply to a proper 
 person, with this enquiry, to the prophet, the Lord's messenger, by 
 whose ministry they had been convinced. Who so fit to show them their 
 way as he that had made them sensible of their having missed it? And it 
 is observable that each one speaks for himself: <I>Wherewith shall I 
 come?</I> Knowing every one the plague of his own heart, they ask, not, 
 <I>What shall this man do?</I> But, <I>What shall I do?</I> Note, Deep 
 convictions of guilt and wrath will put men upon careful enquiries 
 after peace and pardon, and then, and not till then, there begins to be 
 some hope of them. They enquire <I>wherewith they may come before the 
 Lord, and bow themselves before the high God.</I> They believe there is 
 a God, that he is Jehovah, and that he is the <I>high God,</I> the 
 <I>Most High.</I> Those whose consciences are convinced learn to speak 
 very honourably of God, whom before they spoke slightly of. Now, 

 1. We know we must <I>come before God;</I> he is the God with whom
 <I>we have to do;</I> we must come as subjects, to pay our homage to 
 him, as beggars, to ask alms from him, nay, we must <I>come before 
 him,</I> as criminals, to receive our doom from him, must come before 
 him as our Judge. 

 2. When we come before him we must <I>bow before him;</I> it is our
 duty to be very humble and reverent in our approaches to him; and, when 
 we come before him, there is no remedy but we must submit; it is to no 
 purpose to contend with him. 

 3. When we come and bow before him it is our great concern to find
 favour with him, and to be accepted of him; their enquiry is, <I>What 
 will the Lord be pleased with?</I> Note, All that rightly understand 
 their own interest cannot but be solicitous what they must do to please 
 God, to avoid his displeasure and to obtain his good-will. 

 4. In order to God's being pleased with us, our care must be that the
 sin by which we have displeased him may be taken away, and an atonement 
 made for it. The enquiry here is, <I>What shall I give for my
 transgression,</I> for <I>the sin of my soul?</I> Note, The 
 transgression we are guilty of is the sin of our soul, for the soul 
 acts it (without the soul's act it is not sin) and the soul suffers by 
 it; it is the disorder, disease, and defilement of the soul, and 
 threatens to be the death of it: <I>What shall I give for my 
 transgressions?</I> What will be accepted as a satisfaction to his 
 justice, a reparation of his honour? And what will avail to shelter me 
 from his wrath? 

 5. We must therefore ask, <I>Wherewith may we come before him?</I> We
 must not appear before the Lord empty. What shall we bring with us? In 
 what manner must we come? In whose name must we come? We have not
 that in ourselves which will recommend us to him, but must have it from 
 another. What righteousness then shall we appear before him in?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They make proposals, such as they are, in order to it. Their 
 enquiry was very good and right, and what we are all concerned to make, 
 but their proposals betray their ignorance, though they show their 
 zeal; let us examine them:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They bid high. They offer, 

 (1.) That which is very rich and costly--<I>thousands of rams.</I> God 
 required one ram for a sin-offering; they proffer flocks of them, their 
 whole stock, will be content to make themselves beggars, so that they 
 may but be at peace with God. They will bring the best they have, the 
 rams, and the most of them, till it comes to thousands. 

 (2.) That which is very dear to them, and which they would be most loth 
 to part with. They could be content to part with <I>their first-born
 for their transgressions,</I> if that would be accepted as an 
 atonement, and the <I>fruit of their body for the sin of their 
 soul.</I> To those that had become <I>vain in their imaginations</I> 
 this seemed a probable expedient of making satisfaction for sin, 
 because our children are pieces of ourselves; and therefore the heathen 
 sacrificed their children, to appease their offended deities. Note, 
 Those that are thoroughly convinced of sin, of the malignity of it, and 
 of their misery and danger by reason of it, would give all the world, 
 if they had it, for peace and pardon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Yet they do not bid right. It is true some of these things were 
 instituted by the ceremonial law, as the bringing of burnt-offerings to 
 God's altar, and calves of a year old, rams for sin-offerings, and oil 
 for the meat-offerings; but these alone would not recommend them to 
 God. God had often declared that <I>to obey is better than 
 sacrifice,</I> and to <I>hearken than the fat of rams,</I> that 
 <I>sacrifice</I> and <I>offering he would not;</I> the legal sacrifices 
 had their virtue and value from the institution, and the reference they 
 had to Christ the great propitiation; but otherwise, of themselves, it 
 was <I>impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away 
 sin.</I> And as to the other things here mentioned, 

 (1.) Some of them are impracticable things, as <I>rivers of oil,</I> 
 which nature has not provided to feed men's luxury, but rivers of water 
 to supply men's necessity. All the proposals of peace but those that 
 are according to the gospel are absurd. One stream of the blood of 
 Christ is worth ten thousand rivers of oil. 

 (2.) Some of them are wicked things, as to give our <I>first-born</I> 
 and the <I>fruit of our body</I> to death, which would but add to the 
 transgression and the <I>sin of the soul.</I> He that hates robbery for 
 burnt-offerings much more hates murder, such murder. What right have we 
 to our <I>first born</I> and the <I>fruit of our body?</I> Do they not 
 belong to God? Are they not his already, and born to him? Are they not
 sinners by nature, and their lives forfeited upon their own account? 
 How then can they be a ransom for ours? 

 (3.) They are all external things, parts of that bodily exercise which 
 profiteth little, and which could not <I>make the comers thereunto 
 perfect.</I> 

 (4.) They are all insignificant, and insufficient to attain the end 
 proposed; they could not answer the demands of divine justice, nor 
 satisfy the wrong done to God in his honour by sin, nor would they 
 serve in lieu of the sanctification of the heart and the reformation of 
 the life. Men will part with any thing rather than their sins, but they 
 part with nothing to God's acceptance unless they part with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. God tells them plainly what he demands, and insists upon, from 
 those that would be accepted of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Let their money perish with them that think the pardon of sin and the 
 favour of God may be so purchased; no, <I>God has shown thee, O man!
 what is good.</I> Here we are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That God has made a discovery of his mind and will to us, for the 
 rectifying of our mistakes and the direction of our practice. 

 (1.) It is God himself that has shown us what we must do. We need not 
 trouble ourselves to make proposals, the terms are already settled and 
 laid down. He whom we have offended, and to whom we are accountable, 
 has told us upon what conditions he will be reconciled to us. 

 (2.) It is to man that he has shown it, not only to thee, <I>O 
 Israel!</I> but <I>to thee, O man!</I> Gentiles as well as Jews--to 
 men, who are rational creatures, and capable of receiving the 
 discovery, and not to brutes,--to men, for whom a remedy is provided, 
 not to devils, whose case is desperate. What is spoken to <I>all men 
 every where</I> in general, must by faith be applied to ourselves in 
 particular, as if it were spoken <I>to thee, O man!</I> by name, and to 
 no other. 

 (3.) It is a discovery of <I>that which is good,</I> and which <I>the 
 Lord requires of us.</I> He has shown us our end, which we should aim 
 at, in showing us what is good, wherein our true happiness does 
 consist; he has shown us our way in which we must walk towards that end 
 in showing us what he requires of us. There is something which God 
 requires we should do for him and devote to him; and it is good. It is 
 good in itself; there is an innate goodness in moral duties, antecedent 
 to the command; they are not, as ceremonial observances, good because 
 they are commanded, but commanded because they are good, consonant to 
 the eternal rule and reason of good and evil, which are unalterable. It 
 has likewise a direct tendency to our good; our conformity to it is not 
 only the condition of our future happiness, but is a great expedient of 
 our present happiness; <I>in keeping</I> God's <I>commandments there is 
 great reward,</I> as well as after keeping them. 

 (4.) It is shown us. God has not only made it known, but made it
 plain; he has discovered it to us with such convincing evidence as 
 amounts to a demonstration. <I>Lo this, we have searched it, so it
 is.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What that discovery is. The good which God requires of us is not the 
 paying of a price for the pardon of sin and acceptance with God, but 
 doing the duty which is the condition of our interest in the pardon 
 purchased. 

 (1.) We must <I>do justly,</I> must <I>render to all their due,</I> 
 according as our relation and obligation to them are; we must do wrong 
 to none, but do right to all, in their bodies, goods, and good name. 
 
 (2.) We must <I>love mercy;</I> we must delight in it, as our God does, 
 must be glad of an opportunity to do good, and do it cheerfully.
 Justice is put before mercy, for we must not give that in alms which is 
 wrongfully got, or with which our debts should be paid. <I>God hates 
 robbery for a burnt-offering.</I> 

 (3.) We must <I>walk humbly with our God.</I> This includes all the 
 duties of the first table, as the two former include all the duties of 
 the second table. We must take the Lord for our God in covenant, must 
 attend on him and adhere to him as ours, and must make it our constant 
 care and business to please him. Enoch's walking with God is
 interpreted 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:5">Heb. xi. 5</A>)

 his <I>pleasing God.</I> We must, in the whole course of our
 conversation, conform ourselves to the will of God, keep up our 
 communion with God, and study to approve ourselves to him in our 
 integrity; and this we must do humbly (submitting our understandings to 
 the truths of God and our will to his precepts and providences); we 
 must <I>humble ourselves to walk with God</I> (so the margin reads it); 
 every thought within us must be brought down, to be brought into 
 obedience to God, if we would walk comfortably with him. This is that 
 which God requires, and without which the most costly services are 
 <I>vain oblations;</I> this is more than <I>all burnt-offerings and 
 sacrifices.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s voice crieth unto the city, and <I>the man of</I>
 wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath
 appointed it.
 &nbsp; 10 Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of
 the wicked, and the scant measure <I>that is</I> abominable?
 &nbsp; 11 Shall I count <I>them</I> pure with the wicked balances, and with
 the bag of deceitful weights?
 &nbsp; 12 For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the
 inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue <I>is</I>
 deceitful in their mouth.
 &nbsp; 13 Therefore also will I make <I>thee</I> sick in smiting thee, in
 making <I>thee</I> desolate because of thy sins.
 &nbsp; 14 Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down
 <I>shall be</I> in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but
 shalt not deliver; and <I>that</I> which thou deliverest will I give
 up to the sword.
 &nbsp; 15 Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread
 the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet
 wine, but shalt not drink wine.
 &nbsp; 16 For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the
 house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make
 thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof a hissing:
 therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God, having shown them how necessary it was that they should do justly, 
 here shows them how plain it was that they had done unjustly; and since 
 they submitted not to his controversy, nor went the right way to have 
 it taken up, here he proceeds in it. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How the action is entered against them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 God speaks to <I>the city,</I> to Jerusalem, to Samaria. His <I>voice 
 cries</I> to it by his servants the prophets who were to <I>cry aloud 
 and not spare.</I> Note, The voice of the prophets is <I>the Lord's 
 voice,</I> and that <I>cries to the city,</I> cries to the country. 
 <I>Doth not wisdom cry?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:1">Prov. viii. 1</A>.

 When the sin of a city cries to God his voice cries against the city; 
 and, when the judgments of God are coming upon a city, his voice first 
 <I>cries unto it.</I> He warns before he wounds, because he is <I>not 
 willing that any should perish.</I> Now observe, 

 1. How the voice of God is discerned by some: <I>The man of wisdom will
 see thy name.</I> When the voice of God cries to us we may by it see 
 his name, may discern and perceive that by which he makes himself 
 known. Yet many see it not, are not aware of it, because they do not 
 regard it. God <I>speaks once, yea, twice, and they perceive it not</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:14">Job xxxiii. 14</A>);

 but those that are men of wisdom will see it, and perceive it, and make
 a good use of it. Note, It is a point of true wisdom to discover the 
 name of God in the voice of God, and to learn what he is from what he 
 says. <I>Wisdom shall see thy name,</I> for <I>the knowledge of the 
 holy is understanding.</I> 

 2. What this voice of God says to all: "<I>Hear you the rod, and who
 hath appointed it.</I> Hear the rod when it is coming; hear it at a 
 distance, before you see it and feel it; and be awakened to go forth to 
 meet the Lord in the way of his judgments. Hear the rod when it has
 come, and is actually upon you, and you are sensible of the smart of 
 it; hear what it says to you, what convictions, what counsels, what 
 cautions, it speaks to you." Note, Every rod has a voice, and it is the 
 voice of God that is to be heard in the rod of God, and it is well for 
 those that understand the language of it, which if we would do we must 
 have an eye to <I>him that appointed it.</I> Note, Every rod is 
 appointed, of what kind it shall be, where it shall light, and how long 
 it shall lie. God in every affliction <I>performs the thing that is 
 appointed for us</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:14">Job xxiii. 14</A>),

 and to him therefore we must have an eye, to him we must have an ear;
 we must hear what he says to us by the affliction. <I>Hear it, and
 know it for thy good,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:6">Job v. 6</A>.

 The work of ministers is to explain the providences of God and to
 quicken and direct men to learn the lessons that are taught by 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What is the ground of the action, and what are the things that are 
 laid to their charge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They are charged with injustice, a sin against the second table. Are 
 there yet to be found among them the marks and means of fraudulent 
 dealing? What! after all the methods that God has taken to teach them 
 to do justly, will they yet deal unjustly? It seems, they will,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 And <I>shall I count them pure?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 No; this is a sin which will by no means consist with a profession of 
 purity. Those that are dishonest in their dealings have not the spots 
 of God's children, and shall never be reckoned pure, whatever shows of 
 devotion they may make. <I>Be not deceived, God is not mocked.</I>
 When a man is suspected of theft, or fraud, the justice of peace will 
 send a warrant to search his house. God here does, as it were, search 
 the houses of those citizens, and there he finds, 

 (1.) <I>Treasures of wickedness,</I> abundance of wealth, but it is 
 ill-got, and not likely to prosper; for <I>treasures of wickedness 
 profit nothing.</I> 

 (2.) A <I>scant measure,</I> by which they sold to the poor, and so 
 exacted upon them and cheated them. 

 (3.) They had <I>wicked balances and a bag of false weights,</I> by 
 which, under a pretence of weighing what they sold, and giving the 
 buyer what was right, they did him the greatest wrong,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 (4.) Those that had wealth and power in their hands abused it to 
 oppression and extortion; <I>The rich men thereof are full of 
 violence;</I> for those that have much would have more, and are in a 
 capacity of making it more by the power which their abundance of wealth 
 gives them. They are <I>full of violence,</I> that is, they have their
 houses full of that which is got by violence. 

 (5.) Those that had not the advantage of doing wrong by their wealth 
 yet found means of defrauding those they dealt with: <I>The inhabitants 
 thereof have spoken lies;</I> if they are not able to use force and 
 violence, they use fraud and deceit; the <I>inhabitants</I> have 
 <I>spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth;</I> they 
 do not stick at a deliberate lie, to make a good bargain. Some
 understand it of their speaking falsely concerning God, saying, <I>The 
 Lord seeth not; he hath forsaken the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:12">Ezek. viii. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They are charged with idolatry 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>The statutes of Omri are kept, and all the work of the house of 
 Ahab.</I> Both these kings were wicked, and <I>did evil in the sight of 
 the Lord;</I> but the wickedness which they established by a law, 
 concerning which they made statutes, and which was the peculiar work of 
 that house, was idolatry. Omri walked in the way of Jeroboam, and
 <I>in his sin of provoking God to anger with their vanities,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+16:26,31">1 Kings xvi. 26, 31</A>.

 Ahab introduced the worship of Baal. These reigns were some ages
 before the time when this prophet lived, and yet the wickedness which 
 they established by their laws and examples remained to this day; those 
 statutes were still kept, and that work was still done; and the princes 
 and people still <I>walked in their counsels,</I> took the same 
 measures, and governed themselves and the people by the same politics.
 Observe,

 (1.) The same wickedness continued from one generation to another. Sin 
 is a <I>root of bitterness,</I> soon planted, but not so soon plucked 
 up again. The iniquity of former ages is often transmitted to, and 
 entailed upon, the succeeding ones. Those that make corrupt laws, and 
 bring in corrupt usages, are doing that which perhaps may prove the 
 ruin of the child unborn. 

 (2.) It was not the less evil in itself, provoking to God, and
 dangerous to the sinners, for its having been established and confirmed 
 by the laws of princes, the examples of great men, and a long 
 prescription. Though the worship of idols is enacted by the statutes of 
 Omri, recommended by the practice of the house of Ahab, and pleads that 
 it has been the usage of many generations, yet it is still displeasing 
 to God and destructive to Israel; for no laws nor customs are of force 
 against the divine command.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What is the judgment given upon this. Being found guilty of these 
 crimes, the sentence is that that which God had given them warning of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)
 
 shall be brought upon them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Therefore also will I make thee sick, in smiting thee.</I> As they 
 had smitten the poor with the rod of their oppressions, so would God in 
 like manner smite them, so as to make them sick, sick of the gains they 
 had unjustly gotten, so that though they had <I>swallowed down 
 riches</I> they should <I>vomit them up again,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:15">Job xx. 15</A>.

 Their doom is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That what they have they shall not have any comfortable enjoyment
 of; it shall do them no good. They grasped at more than enough, but, 
 when they have it, it shall not be enough to make them easy and happy. 
 What is got by fraud and oppression cannot be kept or enjoyed with any 
 satisfaction. 

 (1.) Their food shall not nourish them: <I>Thou shalt eat, but not be 
 satisfied,</I> either because the food shall not digest, for want of 
 God's blessing going along with it, or because the appetite shall by 
 disease be made insatiable and still craving, the just punishment of 
 those that were greedy of gain and enlarged their desires as hell. Men 
 may be surfeited with the good things of this world and yet not 
 satisfied, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:10,Isa+55:2">Eccl. v. 10; Isa. lv. 2</A>.

 (2.) Their country shall not harbour and protect them: "<I>Thy casting
 down shall be in the midst of thee,</I> that is, thou shalt be broken 
 and ruined by the intestine troubles, mischiefs at home enough to cast 
 thee down, though thou shouldst not be invaded by a foreign force." God 
 can cast a nation down by that which is in the midst of them, can 
 consume them by a fire in their own bowels. 

 (3.) They shall not be able to preserve what they have from a foreign 
 force, nor to recover what they have lost: "<I>Thou shalt take hold</I> 
 of what is about to be taken from thee, but thou shalt not hold it 
 fast, shalt catch at it, but <I>shalt not deliver it,</I> shalt not 
 retrieve it." It is meant of their wives and children, that were very 
 dear to them, which they took hold of, as resolved not to part with 
 them, but there is no remedy, they must go into captivity. Note, What 
 we hold closest we commonly lose soonest, and that proves least safe 
 which is most dear. 

 (4.) What they save for a time shall be reserved for a future and sorer 
 stroke: <I>That which thou deliverest</I> out of the hand of one enemy 
 <I>will I give up to the sword</I> of another enemy; for God has many 
 arrows in his quiver; if one miss the sinner, the next shall not. 

 (5.) What they have laboured for they shall not enjoy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 "<I>Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap;</I> it shall be blasted 
 and withered, and there shall be nothing to reap, or an enemy shall 
 come and reap it for himself, or thou shalt be carried into captivity, 
 and leave it to be reaped by thou knowest not whom. Thou shalt <I>tread 
 the olives,</I> but <I>thou shalt not anoint thyself with oil,</I> 
 having no heart to make use of ornaments and refreshments when all is 
 going to ruin. Thou shalt tread out <I>the sweet wine,</I> but <I>shalt 
 not drink wine,</I> for many things may fall between the cup and the 
 lip." Note, It is very grievous to be disappointed of our expectations, 
 and not to have the pleasure of that which we have taken pains for; and 
 this will be the just punishment of those that frustrate God's 
 expectations from them, and answer not the cost he has been at upon 
 them. See this threatened in the law,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:16,De+28:30,38">Lev. xxvi. 16; Deut. xxviii. 30, 38</A>,

 &c.; and compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:8,9">Isa. lxii. 8, 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That all they have shall at length be taken from them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):
 
 <I>Thou shalt be made desolate because of thy sins;</I> and 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>,

 <I>a desolation and a hissing.</I> Sin makes a nation desolate; and 
 when a people that have been famous and flourishing are made desolate 
 it is the astonishment of some and the triumph of others; some lament 
 it, and others hiss at it. Thus <I>you shall bear the reproach of my 
 people.</I> Their being the people of God, in name and profession while 
 they kept close to their duty and kept themselves in his love, was an 
 honour to them, and all their neighbours thought it so; but now that 
 they have corrupted and ruined themselves, now that their sins and 
 God's judgments have made their land desolate, their having been once 
 the people of God does but turn so much the more to their reproach; 
 their enemies will say, <I>These are the people of the Lord,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:20">Ezek. xxxvi. 20</A>.

 Note, If professors of religion ruin themselves, their ruin will be the
 most reproachful of any; and they in a special manner will rise at the
 last day to everlasting shame and contempt.</P>
