 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have, 

 I. A further description of that terrible desolation which should be
 made in the land of Judah by the locusts and caterpillars, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:1-11">ver. 1-11</A>.

 II. A serious call to the people, when they are under this sore
 judgment, to return and repent, to fast and pray, and to seek unto God 
 for mercy, with directions how to do this aright, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:12-17">ver. 12-17</A>.

 III. A promise that, upon their repentance, God would remove the
 judgment, would repair the breaches made upon them by it, and restore
 unto them plenty of all good things, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:18-27">ver. 18-27</A>.

 IV. A prediction of the setting up of the kingdom of the Messiah in the
 world, by the pouring out of the Spirit in the latter days, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:28-32">ver. 28-32</A>.
 
 Thus the beginning of this chapter is made terrible with the tokens of
 God's wrath, but the latter end of it made comfortable with the
 assurances of his favour, and it is in the way of repentance that this 
 blessed change is made; so that, though it is only the last paragraph 
 of the chapter that points directly at gospel-times, yet the whole may 
 be improved as a type and figure, representing the curses of the law 
 invading men for their sins, and the comforts of the gospel flowing in 
 to them upon their repentance.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy
 mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the
 day of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> cometh, for <I>it is</I> nigh at hand;
 &nbsp; 2 A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of
 thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great
 people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither
 shall be any more after it, <I>even</I> to the years of many
 generations.
 &nbsp; 3 A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame
 burneth: the land <I>is</I> as the garden of Eden before them, and
 behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape
 them.
 &nbsp; 4 The appearance of them <I>is</I> as the appearance of horses; and
 as horsemen, so shall they run.
 &nbsp; 5 Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall
 they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the
 stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.
 &nbsp; 6 Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces
 shall gather blackness.
 &nbsp; 7 They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall
 like men of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and
 they shall not break their ranks:
 &nbsp; 8 Neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one
 in his path: and <I>when</I> they fall upon the sword, they shall not
 be wounded.
 &nbsp; 9 They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon
 the wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter
 in at the windows like a thief.
 &nbsp; 10 The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall
 tremble: the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall
 withdraw their shining:
 &nbsp; 11 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall utter his voice before his army: for his
 camp <I>is</I> very great: for <I>he is</I> strong that executeth his word:
 for the day of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> great and very terrible; and who can
 abide it?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have God contending with his own professing people for their 
 sins and executing upon them the judgment written in the law 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:42">Deut. xxviii. 42</A>),

 <I>The fruit of thy land shall the locust consume,</I> which was one of
 those diseases of Egypt that God would bring upon them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:60"><I>v.</I> 60</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is the war proclaimed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>Blow the trumpet in Zion,</I> either to call the invading army
 together, and then the trumpet sounds a charge, or rather to give 
 notice to Judah and Jerusalem of the approach of the judgment, that 
 they might <I>prepare to meet their God</I> in the way of his judgments 
 and might endeavor by prayers and tears, the church's best artillery, 
 to put by the stroke. It was the priests' business to sound the trumpet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:8">Num. x. 8</A>),

 both as an appeal to God in the day of their distress and a summons to
 the people to come together to seek his face. Note, It is the work of 
 ministers to give warning from the word of God of the fatal 
 consequences of sin, and to reveal his wrath from heaven against the 
 ungodliness and unrighteousness of men. And though it is not the 
 privilege of Zion and Jerusalem to be exempted from the judgments of 
 God, if they provoke him, yet it is their privilege to be warned of 
 them, that they might make their peace with him. Even in <I>the holy 
 mountain</I> the <I>alarm</I> must be <I>sounded,</I> and then it 
 sounds most dreadful, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:2">Amos iii. 2</A>.

 Now, <I>shall a trumpet be blown in the city,</I> in the holy city,
 <I>and the people not be afraid?</I> Surely they will. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:6">Amos iii. 6</A>.
 
 <I>Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble;</I> they shall be made
 to tremble by the judgment itself; let them therefore tremble at the 
 alarm of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is a general idea given of the day of battle, which 
 <I>cometh,</I> which is <I>nigh at hand,</I> and there is no avoiding 
 it. It is the <I>day of the Lord,</I> the day of his judgment, in which 
 he will both manifest and magnify himself. It is <I>a day of darkness 
 and gloominess</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 literally so, the swarms of locusts and caterpillars being so large and 
 so thick as to darken the sky 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:15">Exod. x. 15</A>),

 or rather figuratively; it will be a melancholy time, a time of
 grievous affliction. And it will come <I>as the morning spread upon the 
 mountains;</I> the darkness of this day will come as suddenly as the 
 morning light, as irresistibly, will spread as far, and grow upon them 
 as the morning light.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is the army drawn up in array 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 They are a <I>great people, and a strong.</I> Any one sees the vast 
 numbers that there shall be of locusts and caterpillars, destroying the 
 land, will say (as we are all apt to be most affected with what is 
 present), "Surely, never was the like before, nor ever will be the like 
 again." Note, Extraordinary judgments are rare things, and seldom 
 happen, which is an instance of God's patience. When God had drowned 
 the world once he promised never to do it again. The army is here 
 describe to be, 

 1. Very bold and daring: <I>They are as horses,</I> as war-horses, that 
 rush into the battle and <I>are not affrighted</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:22">Job xxxix. 22</A>);

 and <I>as horsemen,</I> carried on with martial fire and fury, <I>so 
 they shall run,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Some of the ancients have observed that the head of a locust is very
 like, in shape, to the head of a horse. 

 2. Very loud and noisy--<I>like the noise of chariots,</I> of many 
 chariots, when driven furiously over rough ground, <I>on the tops of 
 the mountains,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Hence is borrowed part of the description of the locusts which St. John 
 saw rise out of the bottomless pit. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+9:7,9">Rev. ix. 7, 9</A>,

 <I>The shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared to the 
 battle; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots, of 
 many horses running to the battle.</I> Historians tell us that the 
 noise made by swarms of locusts in those countries that are infested 
 with them has sometimes been heard six miles off. The noise is likewise 
 compared to that of a <I>roaring fire;</I> it is like the <I>noise of a 
 flame</I> that <I>devours the stubble,</I> which noise is the more 
 terrible because that which it is the indication of is devouring. Note, 
 When God's judgments are abroad they make a great noise; and it is 
 necessary for the awakening of a secure and stupid world that they 
 should do so. 

 (3.) They are very regular, and keep ranks in their march; though
 numerous and greedy of spoil, yet they are <I>as a strong people set in 
 battle array</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>They shall march every one on his ways,</I> straight forward, as if 
 they had been trained up by the discipline of war to keep their post 
 and observe their right-hand man. <I>They shall not break their ranks, 
 nor one thrust another,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 Their number and swiftness shall breed no confusion. See how God can 
 make creatures to act by rule that have no reason to act by, when he 
 designs to serve his own purposes by them. And see how necessary it is 
 that those who are employed in any service for God should observe 
 order, and keep ranks, should diligently go on in their own work and 
 stand in one another's way. 

 4. They are very <I>swift;</I> they <I>run like horsemen</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),
 
 run <I>like mighty men</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 they <I>run to and fro in the city,</I> and <I>run upon the wall,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 When God <I>sends forth his command on earth</I> his word <I>runs very 
 swiftly,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:15">Ps. cxlvii. 15</A>.

 Angels have wings, and so have locusts, when God makes use of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Here is the terrible execution done by this formidable army, 

 1. In the country,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:2"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 View the army in the front, and you will see a <I>fire devouring before 
 them;</I> they consume all as if they breathed fire. View it in the 
 rear, and you will see those that come behind as furious as the 
 foremost: <I>Behind them a flame burns.</I> When they are gone, then it 
 will appear what destruction they have made. Look upon the fields that 
 they have not yet invaded, and they are <I>as the garden of Eden,</I> 
 pleasant to the eye, and full of good fruits; they are the pride and 
 glory of the country. But look upon the fields that they have eaten up 
 and they are <I>as a desolate wilderness;</I> one would not think that 
 these had ever been like the former, and yet so they were perhaps but 
 the day before, or that those should ever be made like these, and yet 
 so they shall be perhaps by to-morrow night; yea, and <I>nothing shall 
 escape them</I> than can possibly be made food for them. Let none be 
 proud of the beauty of their grounds any more than of their bodies, for 
 God can soon change the face of both. 

 2. In the city. They shall <I>climb the wall</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 they shall <I>run upon the houses,</I> and <I>enter in at the windows 
 like a thief</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 when Egypt was plagued with <I>locusts,</I> they filled <I>Pharaoh's 
 houses</I> and the <I>houses of his servants,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:5,6">Exod. x. 5, 6</A>.

 The locusts out of the bottomless pit, Satan's emissaries, and
 missionaries of the man of sin, do as these locusts. God's judgments 
 too, when they come with commission, cannot be kept out with bars and 
 bolts; they will find or force their way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The impressions that should hereby be made upon the people. They 
 shall find it to no purpose to make opposition. These enemies are 
 invulnerable and therefore irresistible: <I>When they fall upon the 
 sword they shall not be wounded,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 And those that cannot be hurt cannot be stopped; and therefore 
 <I>before their faces the people shall be much pained</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 as the merchants are in pain for their trading ships when they hear 
 they are just in the mouth of a squadron of the enemies. "One is in 
 pain for his field, another for his vineyard, <I>and all faces gather 
 blackness,</I>" which denotes the utmost consternation imaginable. Men 
 in fear look pale, but men in despair look black; the whiteness of a 
 sudden fright, when it is settled, turns into blackness. What is the 
 matter of our pride and pleasure God can soon make the matter of our 
 pain. The terror that the country should be in is described 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>)

 by figurative expressions: <I>The earth shall quake and the heavens 
 tremble;</I> even the hearts that seemed undaunted, so firm that 
 nothing would frighten them, as immovable as heaven or earth, shall be 
 seized with astonishment. Or when the inhabitants of the land are made 
 to quake it seems to them as if all about them trembled too. Through 
 the prevalency of their fear, or for want of the supports of life which 
 they used to have, their eye shall wax dim and their sight fail them, 
 so that to them <I>the sun and moon shall seem</I> to be <I>dark,</I> 
 and the stars to <I>withdraw their shining.</I> Note, When God frowns 
 upon men the lights of heaven will be small joy to them; for man, by 
 rebelling against his Creator, has forfeited the benefit of all the 
 creatures. But, though this is to be understood figuratively, there is 
 a day coming when it will be accomplished in the letter, when the 
 <I>heavens</I> shall be <I>rolled together like a scroll,</I> and 
 <I>the earth, and all the works that are therein,</I> shall be <I>burnt 
 up.</I> Particular judgments should awaken us to think of the general 
 judgment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. We are here directed to look up both him who is the 
 commander-in-chief of this formidable army, and that is God himself, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 It is <I>his army;</I> it is <I>his camp.</I> He raised it; he gives it 
 commission; he <I>utters his voice before it,</I> as the general gives 
 orders to his army what to do and makes a speech to animate the 
 soldiers; it is the Lord that gives the word of command to all these 
 animals, which they exactly observe. Some think that with this cloud of 
 locusts God sent terrible thunder, for that is called, <I>The voice of 
 the Lord,</I> and was another of the plagues of Egypt, and this made 
 the heavens and the earth tremble. It is the <I>day of the Lord</I> (as 
 it was called, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 for in this war we are sure he carries the day; it must needs be his, 
 for <I>his camp is great</I> and numerous. Those whom he makes war upon 
 he can, as here, overpower with numbers; and whoever he employs to 
 <I>execute his word,</I> as the minister of his justice, is sure to be 
 made <I>strong</I> and <I>par negotio--equal to what he undertakes;</I> 
 whom God gives commission to he girds with strength for the executing 
 of that commission. And this makes the <I>great day</I> of the Lord 
 <I>very terrible</I> to all those who in that day are to be made the 
 monuments of his justice; for <I>who can abide it?</I> None can escape 
 the arrests of God's wrath, can make head against the force of it, or 
 bear up under the weight of it,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12 Therefore also now, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, turn ye <I>even</I> to me
 with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with
 mourning:
 &nbsp; 13 And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God: for he <I>is</I> gracious and merciful, slow to
 anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.
 &nbsp; 14 Who knoweth <I>if</I> he will return and repent, and leave a
 blessing behind him; <I>even</I> a meat offering and a drink offering
 unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God?
 &nbsp; 15 Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn
 assembly:
 &nbsp; 16 Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the
 elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let
 the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her
 closet.
 &nbsp; 17 Let the priests, the ministers of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, weep between the
 porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should
 rule over them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where
 <I>is</I> their God?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an earnest exhortation to repentance, inferred from that 
 desolating judgment described and threatened in the 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:1-11">foregoing verses</A>:

 <I>Therefore now turn you to the Lord.</I> 

 1. "Thus you must answer the end and intention of the judgment; for it 
 was sent for this end, to convince you of your sins, to humble you for 
 them, to reduce you to your right minds and to your allegiance." God 
 brings us into straits, that he may bring us to repentance and so bring 
 us to himself. 

 2. "Thus you may stay the progress of the judgment. Things are bad
 with you, but thus you may prevent their growing worse; nay, if you 
 take this course, they will soon grow better." Here is a gracious 
 invitation,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To a personal repentance, exercised in the soul, <I>every family 
 apart, and their wives apart,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:12">Zech. xii. 12</A>.

 When the judgments of God are abroad, each person is concerned to
 contribute his <I>quota</I> to the common supplications, having 
 contributed to the common guilt. Every one must mend one and mourn for 
 one, and then we should all be mended and all found among God's 
 mourners. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What we are here called to, which will teach us what it is to 
 repent, for it is the same that the Lord our God still requires of us, 
 we having all made work for repentance. 

 (1.) We must be truly humbled for our sins, must be sorry we have by
 sin offended God, and ashamed we have by sin wronged ourselves, both 
 wronged our judgments and wronged our interests. There must be outward 
 expressions of sorrow and shame, <I>fasting,</I> and <I>weeping,</I> 
 and <I>mourning;</I> tears for the sin that procured it. But what will 
 the outward expressions of sorrow avail if the inward impressions be 
 not agreeable, and not only accompany them, but be the root and spring 
 of them, and give rise to them? And therefore it follows, <I>Rend your 
 heart, and not your garments;</I> not but that, according to the custom 
 of that age, it was proper for them to rend their garments, in token of 
 great grief for their sins and a holy indignation against themselves 
 for their folly; but, "Rest not in the doing of that, as if that were 
 sufficient, but be more in care to accommodate your spirits than to 
 accommodate your dress to a day of fasting and humiliation; nay, rend 
 not your garments at all, unless withal you rend your hearts, for the 
 sign without the thing signified is but a jest and a mockery, and an 
 affront to God." Rending the heart is that which God looks for and 
 requires; that is the <I>broken and contrite heart</I> which he <I>will 
 not despise,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:17">Ps. li. 17</A>.

 When we are greatly grieved in soul for sin, so that it even <I>cuts us
 to the heart</I> to think how we have dishonoured God and disparaged 
 ourselves by it, when we conceive an aversion to sin, and earnestly 
 desire and endeavor to get clear of the principles of it and never to 
 return to the practice of it, then we rend our hearts for it, and then 
 will God <I>rend the heavens</I> and come down to us with mercy.

 (2.) We must be thoroughly converted to our God, and come home to him
 when we fall out with sin. <I>Turn you even to me, said the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),
 
 and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 <I>Turn unto the Lord your God.</I> Our fasting and weeping are worth 
 nothing if we do not with them turn to God as our God. When we are 
 fully convinced that it is our duty and interest to keep in with him, 
 and are heartily sorry we have ever turned the back upon him, and 
 thereupon, by a firm and fixed resolution, make his glory our end, his 
 will our rule, and his favour our felicity, then we <I>return to the 
 Lord our God,</I> and this we are all commanded and invited to do, and 
 to do it quickly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What arguments are here used to persuade this people thus to turn to 
 the Lord, and to turn to him <I>with all their hearts.</I> When the 
 heart is rent for sin, and rent from it, then it is prepared to turn 
 entirely to God, and to be devoted entirely to him, and he will have it 
 all or none. Now, to bring ourselves to this, let us consider, 

 (1.) We are sure that he is, in general, a good God. We must <I>turn to
 the Lord our God,</I> not only because he has been just and righteous 
 in punishing us for our sins, the fear of which should drive us to him, 
 but because he is <I>gracious and merciful,</I> in receiving upon us 
 our repentance, the hope of which should draw us to him. He is gracious 
 and merciful, delights not in the death of sinners, but desires that 
 they may turn and live. <I>He is slow to anger</I> against those that 
 offend him, but of <I>great kindness</I> towards those that desire to 
 please him. These very expressions are used in God's proclamation of 
 his name when he caused <I>his goodness,</I> and with it all his glory, 
 to <I>pass before Moses,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:6,7">Exod. xxxiv. 6, 7</A>.

 <I>He repents him of the evil,</I> not that he changes his mind, but,
 when the sinner's mind is changed, God's way towards him is changed; 
 the sentence is reversed, and the curse of the law is taken off. Note, 
 That is genuine, ingenuous, and evangelical repentance, which arises 
 from a firm belief of the mercy of God, which we have sinned against, 
 and yet are not in despair. <I>Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at 
 hand.</I> The goodness of God, if it be rightly understood, instead of 
 emboldening us to go on in sin, will be the most powerful inducement to 
 repentance,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+130:4">Ps. cxxx. 4</A>.

 The act of indemnity brings those to God whom the act of attainder
 frightened from him.

 (2.) We have reason to hope that he will, upon our repentance, give us
 that good which by sin we have forfeited and deprived ourselves of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 that he will <I>return and repent,</I> that he will not proceed against 
 us as he has done, but will act in favour of us. <I>Therefore</I> let
 us repent of our sins against him, and return to him in a way of duty, 
 because then we may hope that he will repent of his judgments against 
 us and return to us in a way of mercy. Now observe, 

 [1.] The manner of expectation is very humble and modest: <I>Who knows 
 if he will?</I> Some think it is expressed thus doubtfully to check the 
 presumption and security of the people, and to quicken them to a holy 
 carefulness and liveliness in their repentance, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:19">Josh. xxiv. 19</A>.

 Or, rather, it is expressed doubtfully because it is the removal of a
 temporal judgment that they here promise themselves, of which we cannot 
 be so confident as we can that, in general, God is gracious and 
 merciful. There is no question at all to be made but that if we truly 
 repent of our sins God will forgive them, and be reconciled to us; but 
 whether he will remove this or the other affliction which we are under 
 may well be questioned, and yet the probability of it should encourage 
 us to repent. Promises of temporal good things are often made with a 
 peradventure. <I>It may be, you shall be hid,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+2:3">Zeph. ii. 3</A>.

 David's sin is pardoned, and yet the child shall die, and, when David
 prayed for its life, he said, as here, <I>Who can tell whether God will 
 be gracious to me</I> in this matter likewise?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:22">2 Sam. xii. 22</A>.

 The Ninevites repented and reformed upon such a consideration as this,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+3:9">Jonah iii. 9</A>.

 [2.] The matter of expectation is very pious. They hope God will return 
 and repent, and <I>leave a blessing behind him,</I> not as if he were 
 about to go from them, and they could be content with any blessing in 
 lieu of his presence, but <I>behind him,</I> that is, "After he has 
 ceased his controversy with us, he will bestow a blessing upon us;" and 
 what is it? It is a <I>meat-offering and a drink-offering to the Lord 
 our God.</I> The fruits of the earth are called <I>a blessing</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:8">Isa. xlv. 8</A>)

 because they depend upon God's blessing and are necessary blessings to
 us. They had been deprived of these, and that which grieved them most 
 while they were so was that God's altar was deprived of its offerings 
 and God's priests of their maintenance; that therefore which they 
 comfort themselves with the prospect of in their return of plenty is 
 that then there shall be meat-offerings and drink-offerings in 
 abundance brought to God's altar, which they more desired than to see 
 the wonted abundance of meat and drink brought to their own tables.
 Thus when Hezekiah was in hopes that he should recover of his sickness 
 he asked, <I>What is the sign that I shall go up,</I> not to the 
 thrones of judgment, or to the councilboard, but <I>to the house of the 
 Lord?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+38:22">Isa. xxxviii. 22</A>.

 Note, The plentiful enjoyment of God's ordinances in their power and
 purity is the most valuable instance of a nation's prosperity and the 
 greatest blessing that can be desired. If God give the blessing of 
 meat-offering and the drink-offering, that will bring along with it 
 other blessings, will sanctify them, sweeten them, and secure them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They are here called to a public national repentance, to be 
 exercised in the solemn assembly, as a national act, for the glory of 
 God and the excitement of one another, and that the neighbouring 
 nations might know and observe what it was that qualified them for 
 God's gracious returns in mercy to them, which they would be the 
 admiring witnesses of. Let us see here, 

 1. How the congregation must be called together,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 The trumpet was blown 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 to sound an <I>alarm of war;</I> but now it must be blown in order to a 
 treaty of peace. God is willing to show mercy to his people if he do 
 but find them in a frame fit for it; and therefore, Call them together; 
 <I>sanctify a fast.</I> By the law many annual feasts were appointed, 
 but only one day in the year was to be observed as a fast, the <I>day 
 of atonement,</I> a day to <I>afflict the soul;</I> and, if they had 
 kept close to God and their duty, there would have been no occasion to 
 observe any more; but now that they had by sin brought the judgments of 
 God upon them they are often called to fasting. What was said

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:14"><I>ch.</I> i. 14</A>

 is here repeated: "<I>Call a solemn assembly; gather the people</I> 
 (press them to come together upon this errand); <I>sanctify the 
 congregation;</I> appoint a time for solemn preparation beforehand and 
 put them in mind to prepare themselves. Let not the greatest be 
 excused, but <I>assemble the elders,</I> the judges and magistrates. 
 Let not the meanest be passed by, but <I>gather the children, and those 
 that suck the breasts.</I>" It is good to bring little children, as 
 soon as they are capable of understanding any thing, to religious 
 assemblies, that they may be trained up betimes in the way wherein they 
 should go; but these were brought even when they were at the breast and 
 were kept fasting, that by their cries for the breast the hearts of the 
 parents might be moved to repent of sin, which God might justly so 
 visit upon their children that the <I>tongue of the sucking child</I> 
 might <I>cleave to the roof of his mouth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:4">Lam. iv. 4</A>),

 and that on them God might have compassion, as he had on the infants of 
 Nineveh,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+4:11">Jonah iv. 11</A>.

 New-married people must not be exempted: <I>Let the bridegroom go forth
 of his chamber and the bride out of her closet;</I> let them not take 
 state upon them as usual, not put on their ornaments, nor indulge 
 themselves in mirth, but address themselves to the duties of the public 
 fast with as much gravity and sadness as any of their neighbours. Note, 
 Private joys must always give way to public sorrows, both those for 
 affliction and those for sin. 

 2. How the work of the day must be carried on,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 (1.) The priests, <I>the Lord's ministers,</I> must preside in the 
 congregation, and be God's mouth to the people, and theirs to God; who 
 should stand in the gap to turn away the wrath of God but those whose 
 business it was to make intercession upon ordinary occasions? 

 (2.) They must officiate <I>between the porch and the altar.</I> There
 they used to attend about the sacrifices, and therefore now that they 
 have no sacrifices to offer, or next to none, there they must offer up 
 spiritual sacrifices. There the people must see them weeping and 
 wrestling, like their father Jacob, and be helped into the same devout 
 frame. Ministers must themselves be affected with those things 
 wherewith they desire to affect others. It was <I>between the porch and 
 the altar</I> that Zechariah the son of Jehoiada was put to death for 
 his faithfulness; that precious blood God would require at their hands, 
 and therefore, to turn away the judgment threatened for it, there they 
 must <I>weep.</I>

 (3.) They must pray. Words here are put into their mouths, which they
 might in their prayers enlarge upon. Their petition must be, <I>Spare
 thy people, O Lord!</I> God's people, when they are in distress, can 
 expect no relief against God's justice but what comes from his mercy. 
 They cannot say, Lord, <I>right us,</I> but, Lord, <I>spare us.</I> We 
 deserve the correction; we need it; but, Lord, mitigate it. The 
 sinner's supplication is, <I>Spare us, good Lord.</I> Their plea must 
 be taken from the relation wherein they stand to God ("They are <I>thy 
 people,</I> and <I>thy heritage,</I> therefore have compassion on 
 them"), but especially from the concern of God's glory in their 
 trouble--"Lord, <I>give not thy heritage to reproach,</I> to the 
 reproach of famine; let not the land of Canaan, that has so long been 
 celebrated as the glory of all lands, now be made the scorn of all 
 lands; let not <I>the heathen rule over them,</I> as they will easily 
 do when thy heritage is thus impoverished and disabled to subsist. Let 
 not the heathen make them <I>a proverb,</I> or a <I>by-word</I>" (so 
 some read it); "let it never be said, <I>As poor and beggarly as an 
 Israelite.</I>" Note, The maintaining of the credit of the nation among 
 its neighbours is a blessing to be desired and prayed for by all that 
 wish well to it. But that reproach of the church is especially to be 
 dreaded and deprecated which reflects upon God: "Let them not <I>say 
 among the people, Where is their God</I>--that God who has promised to 
 help them, whom they have boasted so much of and put such a confidence 
 in?" If God's heritage be destroyed, the neighbours will say, "God was 
 either weak and could not relieve them or unkind and would not."

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>18 Then will the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> be jealous for his land, and pity his
 people.
 &nbsp; 19 Yea, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I
 will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied
 therewith: and I will no more make you a reproach among the
 heathen:
 &nbsp; 20 But I will remove far off from you the northern <I>army,</I> and
 will drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face
 toward the east sea, and his hinder part toward the utmost sea,
 and his stink shall come up, and his ill savour shall come up,
 because he hath done great things.
 &nbsp; 21 Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will do
 great things.
 &nbsp; 22 Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of
 the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig
 tree and the vine do yield their strength.
 &nbsp; 23 Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 your God: for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and
 he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and
 the latter rain in the first <I>month.</I>
 &nbsp; 24 And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the fats shall
 overflow with wine and oil.
 &nbsp; 25 And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath
 eaten, the canker-worm, and the caterpillar, and the palmer-worm,
 my great army which I sent among you.
 &nbsp; 26 And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the
 name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you:
 and my people shall never be ashamed.
 &nbsp; 27 And ye shall know that I <I>am</I> in the midst of Israel, and
 <I>that</I> I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God, and none else: and my people
 shall never be ashamed.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See how ready God is to succour and relieve his people, how he <I>waits 
 to be gracious;</I> as soon as ever they humble themselves under this 
 hand, and pray, and seek his face, he immediately meets them with his 
 favours. They prayed that God would <I>spare them,</I> and see here 
 with what <I>good words and comfortable words</I> he answered them; for 
 God's promises are real answers to the prayers of faith, because with 
 him saying and doing are not two things. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Whence this mercy promised shall take rise 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 God will be <I>jealous for his land</I> and <I>pity his people.</I> He 
 will have an eye, 

 1. To his own honour, and the reputation of his covenant with Israel, 
 by which he had conveyed to them that good land and had given in the 
 value of it very high; now he will not suffer it to be despised nor 
 disparaged, but will be jealous for the credit of his land, and the 
 inhabitants of it, who had been praised as a happy people and therefore 
 must not lie open to reproach as a miserable people. 

 2. To their distress: He will <I>pity his people,</I> and, in pity to 
 them, he will restore them their forfeited comforts. God's compassion 
 is a great encouragement to those that come humbly to him as penitents 
 and as petitioners.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What his mercy shall be, in several instances:--

 1. The destroying army shall be dispersed and defeated

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 "<I>I will remove far off from you the northern army,</I> that army of 
 locusts and caterpillars that invaded you from the north, brought in 
 upon the wings of a north wind, an army which you could put no stop to 
 the progress of; but, when you have made your peace with God, he will 
 ease you of these soldiers that are quartered upon you and will 
 <I>drive them into a land barren and desolate,</I> into that vast 
 howling wilderness that Israel wandered in, where, after having 
 surfeited upon the plenty of Canaan, they shall perish for want of 
 sustenance. Those that have their <I>face to the east sea</I> (the Dead 
 Sea, which lay east of Judea) shall perish in that, and the rear of the 
 army shall be lost in the Great Sea," called here the <I>utmost 
 sea.</I> They had made the land barren and desolate, and now God will 
 cast them into a land barren and desolate. Thus those whom God employs 
 for the correction of his people come afterwards to be themselves 
 reckoned with; and the rod is thrown into the fire. Nothing shall 
 remain of these swarms of insects but the ill savour of them. When 
 Egypt was eased of the plague of locusts they were carried away to the 
 Red Sea, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:19">Exod. x. 19</A>.

 Note, When an affliction has done its work it shall be removed in
 mercy, as the locusts of Canaan were from a penitent people, not as the 
 locusts of Egypt were removed, in wrath, from an impenitent prince, 
 only to make room for another plague. Many interpreters, by this 
 northern army, understand that of Sennacherib, which was dispersed when 
 God by it had <I>accomplished his whole work upon Mount Zion and upon 
 Jerusalem,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:12">Isa. x. 12</A>.

 This enemy shall be driven away, because <I>he has done great
 things,</I> has done a great deal of mischief, and has <I>magnified</I> 
 to do it, has done it in the pride of his heart; therefore it follows

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 <I>The Lord will do great things for</I> his people, as the enemy has 
 done great things against them, to convince them that wherein they deal 
 proudly he is, and will be, above them, that, what great things soever 
 they did, they did no more than God commissioned them to do; and as, 
 when he said to them, Go, they went, so, when he said to them, Come, 
 they came, to show that they were <I>soldiers under him.</I> 

 2. The destroyed land shall be watered and made fruitful. When the army
 is scattered, yet what shall we do if the desolation they have made 
 continue? It is therefore promised

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>)

 that <I>the pastures of the wilderness,</I> the pastures which the 
 locusts had left as bare as the wilderness, shall again <I>spring</I> 
 and the <I>trees shall again bear their fruit,</I> particularly the 
 <I>fig-tree and the vine.</I> But, when we see how the country is 
 wasted, we are tempted to say, <I>Can these dry bones live? If the
 Lord should make windows in heaven,</I> it cannot be; but it shall be, 
 for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>)

 <I>the Lord has given</I> and will give you <I>the former rain and the 
 latter rain,</I> and, if he give them in mercy, he will give them 
 moderately, so that the rain shall not turn into a judgment, and he 
 will give them in due season, the <I>latter rain in the first 
 month,</I> when it was wanted and expected. It would make it 
 comfortable to them to see it coming from the hand of God, and ordered 
 by his wisdom, for then we are sure it is well ordered. <I>He has given 
 you a teacher of righteousness,</I> (so the margin reads it, for the 
 same word that signifies the <I>rain</I> signifies a <I>teacher.</I> 
 and that which we translate <I>moderately</I> is <I>according to 
 righteousness</I>), and this <I>teacher of righteousness,</I> says one 
 of the rabbin, is the King Messias, and of him many others understand 
 this; for he is a <I>teacher come from God,</I> and he shows us the way 
 of <I>righteousness.</I> But others understand it of any prophet that 
 <I>instructs unto righteousness,</I> and some of Hezekiah particularly, 
 others of Isaiah. Note, It is a good sign that God has mercy in store
 for a people when he sends them teachers of righteousness, pastors 
 after his own heart.
 
 3. All their losses shall be repaired
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):
 
 "<I>I will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten;</I> you 
 shall be comforted according to the time that you have been afflicted, 
 and shall have years of plenty to balance the years of famine." Thus 
 does it <I>repent the Lord concerning his servants,</I> when they 
 repent, and, to show how perfectly he is reconciled to them, he makes 
 good the damage they have sustained by his judgments, and, like the 
 jailer, <I>washes their stripes.</I> Though, in justice, he distrained 
 upon them, and did them no wrong, yet, in compassion, he makes 
 restitution; as the father of the prodigal, upon his return, made up 
 all he had lost by his sin and folly, and took him into his family, as 
 in his former estate. The locusts and caterpillars are here called 
 <I>God's great army which he sent among them,</I> and he will repair 
 what they had devoured because they were his army. 

 4. They shall have great abundance of all good things. The earth shall 
 yield her increase, and they shall enjoy it. Look into the stores
 where they lay up, and you shall find <I>the floors full of wheat, and 
 the fats overflowing with wine and oil</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 whereas, in the day of their distress, the <I>wine and oil 
 languished</I> and <I>the barns were broken down,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:10,17"><I>ch.</I> i. 10, 17</A>.

 Look upon their tables, where they lay out what they have laid up, and
 you shall find that they <I>eat in plenty and are satisfied,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.
 
 They do not eat to excess, nor are surfeited; we hope the 
 <I>drunkards</I> are cured by the late affliction of their inordinate 
 love of wine and strong drink, for, though they were brought in howling 
 for their scarcity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:5"><I>ch.</I> i. 5</A>),

 they are now brought in again here singing for the plenty of it; but
 now all shall have enough, and shall known when they have enough, for 
 God will make their food nourishing and give them to be content with 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These are the mercies promised, and in these <I>God does great 
 things</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),
 
 <I>He deals wondrously with his people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.
 
 Herein he glorifies his power, and shows that he can relieve his people 
 though their distress be ever so great, and glorifies his goodness, 
 that he will do it upon their repentance though their provocations were 
 ever so great. Note, When God deals graciously with poor sinners that 
 return to him it must be acknowledged that he deals wondrously and does 
 great things. Some expositors understand these promises figuratively, 
 as pointing at gospel-grace, and having their accomplishment in the 
 abundant comforts that are treasured up for believers in the covenant 
 of grace and the satisfaction of soul they have therein. When God sends 
 us his promises to be the matter of our comfort, his graces to be the 
 grounds of it, and his Spirit to be the author of it, we may well own 
 that he has sent us (according to his promise here, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>)

 <I>corn, and wine, and oil,</I> or that which is unspeakably better, 
 and we have reason to be satisfied therewith.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What use shall be made of these returns of God's mercy to them and 
 the good account they shall turn to.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God shall have the glory thereof, for they shall <I>rejoice in the 
 Lord their God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 and what is the matter of their rejoicing shall be the matter of their 
 thanksgiving; they shall <I>praise the name of the Lord their God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>)

 and not praise their idols, nor call their corn and wine the <I>rewards 
 that their lovers had given them.</I> Note, The plenty of our 
 creature-comforts is a mercy indeed to us when by them our hearts are 
 enlarged in love and thankfulness to God, who gives us all things 
 richly to enjoy, though we serve him but poorly. When God restores to 
 us plenty after we have known scarcity, as it is doubly pleasant to us, 
 so it should make us the more thankful to God. When Israel comes out of 
 a wilderness into a Canaan, and there eats and is full, surely he will 
 then <I>bless the Lord,</I> with a very sensible pleasure, for <I>that 
 good land</I> which <I>he has given him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:10">Deut. viii. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They shall have the credit, and comfort, and spiritual benefit, 
 thereof. When God gives them plenty again, and gives them to be 
 satisfied with it, 

 (1.) Their reputation shall be retrieved; they and their God shall be
 no more reflected upon as unfaithful to one another when they have 
 returned to him in a way of duty and he to them in a way of mercy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 "<I>I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen,</I> that 
 triumphed in your calamities and insulted over you;" and 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>,

 "<I>My people shall never be ashamed,</I> as they have been, of their
 good land which they used to boast of, but shall again and ever have 
 the same occasion to boast of it." Note, It redounds much to the honour 
 of God when he does that which saves the honour of his people; and 
 those that are his people indeed, though they may be for a time, shall 
 not be always, a <I>reproach among the heathens;</I> if we be rightly 
 ashamed of our sins against God, we shall never be ashamed of our 
 glorying in God. 
 
 (2.) Their joys shall be revived
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>Be glad and rejoice, O land!</I> and all the inhabitants of it. 
 Times of plenty are commonly times of joy; yet the favour of God 
 <I>puts gladness into the heart</I> more than those who have <I>corn, 
 and wine, and oil increase.</I> But especially <I>be glad them, you 
 children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 They <I>mourned in Zion</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 and therefore there in a particular manner they shall rejoice; for 
 those that sow in penitential tears shall certainly reap in thankful 
 joys. The children of Zion, who led the rest in fasting, must lead the 
 rest in rejoicing. But observe, They shall <I>rejoice in the Lord their 
 God,</I> not so much in the good themselves that are given them as in 
 the good hand that gives them and in the return of his favour to them, 
 as theirs in covenant, which these good things are the tokens and 
 pledges of. The <I>joy of harvest</I> and the joy of a feast must both 
 terminate in God, whose love we should taste in all the gifts of his 
 bounty, that we may make him our chief joy, as he is our chief good, 
 and the fountain of all good to us. 

 (3.) Their faith in God shall be confirmed and increased. When
 temporal mercies are made by the grace of God to be of spiritual 
 advantage to us, and plenty for the body is so far from being an enemy 
 (as with many it proves) that it becomes a friend to the prosperity of 
 the soul, then they are mercies indeed to us. This is promised here

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>You shall know that I am in the midst of Israel,</I> the <I>Holy One 
 in the midst of thee</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:9">Hos. xi. 9</A>),

 <I>and that I am the Lord your God, and none else.</I> As it proves
 that the Lord is God, and there is none other, because he <I>wounds</I> 
 and he <I>heals,</I> he <I>forms light and darkness,</I> he does 
 <I>good and evil</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:7,De+32:39">Isa. xlv. 7; Deut. xxxii. 39</A>),

 so it proves him to be <I>God of Israel,</I> a God in covenant with his
 people and a father to them, that as a father he both corrects them 
 when they offend and comforts them when they repent. It was the burden
 of the threatenings in Ezekiel's prophecy, Such and such evils I will 
 bring upon you, <I>and you shall know that I am the Lord;</I> and the 
 same is here made the crown of the promises: You shall <I>eat, and be 
 satisfied,</I> and rejoice, and thus <I>you shall know that I am the 
 Lord.</I> Note, We should labour to grow in our acquaintance with God 
 by all providences, both merciful and afflictive. When God gives to
 his people plenty, and peace, and joy, upon their return to him, he 
 thereby gives them to understand that he is pleased with their 
 repentance, that he has pardoned their sins, and that he is theirs as 
 much as ever--that they are taken into the same covenant with him, for 
 he is the Lord their God, and into the same communion, for he is in the 
 midst of them, <I>nigh unto them in all that they call upon him 
 for,</I> and, as the sun in the centre of the worlds, so in the midst 
 of them as to diffuse his benign influences to all the parts of his 
 land.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Even the inferior creatures shall share therein and be made easy 
 thereby: <I>Fear not, O land!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 <I>Be not afraid, you beasts of the field,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 They had suffered for the sin of man, and for God's quarrel with him; 
 and now they shall fare the better for man's repentance and God's 
 reconciliation to him. Nay, the beasts were said to <I>cry unto
 God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:20"><I>ch.</I> i. 20</A>);

 and now that cry is answered, and they are directed not to <I>be
 afraid,</I> for they shall have plenty of all that which their nature 
 craves. God, in sparing Nineveh, had an eye to the cattle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+4:11">Jonah iv. 11</A>),
 
 for the cattle had fasted,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:8"><I>ch.</I> iii. 8</A>.

 This may lead us to think of the restitution of all things, when the 
 <I>creature,</I> that is now <I>made subject to vanity</I> and 
 <I>groans</I> under it, <I>shall be brought,</I> though not into the 
 glorious joy, yet <I>into the glorious liberty, of the children of 
 God,</I>

 The promises of corn, and wine, and oil, in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:12-27">foregoing verses</A>,

 would be very acceptable to a wasted country; but here we are taught
 that we must not rest in those things. God has reserved some better 
 things for us, and these verses have reference to those better things,
 both the kingdom of grace and the kingdom of glory, with the happiness 
 of true believers in both. We are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How the kingdom of grace shall be introduced by a plentiful 
 <I>effusion of the Spirit,</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:28,29"><I>v.</I> 28, 29</A>).

 We are not at a loss about the meaning of this promise, nor in doubt
 what it refers to and wherein it had its accomplishment, for the 
 apostle Peter has given us an infallible explication and application of 
 it, assuring us that when the Spirit was poured out upon the apostles, 
 on the day of Pentecost

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:1">Acts ii. 1</A>,

 &c.), that was the very thing <I>which was spoken of here by the
 prophet Joel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 That was the gift of the Spirit, which, according to this prediction, 
 was <I>to come,</I> and we are not to <I>look for any other,</I> any 
 more than for another accomplishment of the promise of the Messiah. 
 Now, 

 1. The blessing itself here promised is the <I>pouring out of the
 Spirit of God,</I> his gifts, graces, and comforts, which the blessed 
 Spirit is the author of. We often read in the Old Testament of the 
 Spirit of the Lord coming by drops, as it were, upon the judges and 
 prophets whom God raised up for extraordinary services; but now the 
 Spirit shall be poured out plentifully in a full stream, as was 
 promised with an eye to gospel-times, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:3">Isa. xliv. 3</A>.

 <I>I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed.</I>

 2. The time fixed for this is <I>afterwards;</I> after the fulfilling
 of the foregoing promises this shall be fulfilled. St. Peter expounds 
 this of <I>the last days,</I> the days of the Messiah, by whom the 
 world was to have its last revelation of the divine will and grace in 
 the last days of the Jewish church, a little before its dissolution. 

 3. The extent of this blessing, in respect of the persons on whom it
 shall be bestowed. The Spirit shall be <I>poured out upon all 
 flesh,</I> not as hitherto upon Jews only, but upon Gentiles also; for 
 in Christ there is no distinction between Jew and Greek,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:11,12">Rom. x. 11, 12</A>.

 Hitherto divine revelation was confined to the seed of Abraham, none
 but those of the land of Israel had the Spirit of prophecy; but, in the 
 last days, <I>all flesh shall see the glory of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:5">Isa. xl. 5</A>)

 and shall come to <I>worship before him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:23">Isa. lxvi. 23</A>.

 The Jews understand it of all flesh in the land of Israel, and Peter
 himself did not fully understand it as speaking of the Gentiles till he 
 saw it accomplished in the descent of the Holy Ghost upon Cornelius and 
 his friends, who were Gentiles

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:44,45">Acts x. 44, 45</A>),

 which was but a continuation of the same gift which was bestowed on the
 day of Pentecost. The Spirit shall be poured out <I>upon all flesh,</I> 
 that is, upon all those whose hearts are made hearts of flesh, soft and 
 tender, and so prepared to receive the impressions and influences of 
 the Holy Ghost. <I>Upon all flesh,</I> that is, upon some of all sorts 
 of men; the gifts of the Spirit shall not be so sparing, or so much 
 confined, as they have been, but shall be more general and diffusive of 
 themselves.

 (1.) The Spirit shall be poured out upon some of each sex. Not <I>your
 sons</I> only, but <I>your daughters,</I> shall prophesy; we read of 
 four sisters in one family that were prophetesses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:9">Acts xxi. 9</A>.

 Not the parents only, but the children, shall be filled with the
 Spirit, which intimates the continuance of this gift for some ages 
 successively in the church.

 (2.) Upon some of each age: "<I>Your old men,</I> who are past their
 vigour and whose spirits begin to decay, <I>your young men,</I> who 
 have yet but little acquaintance with and experience of divine things, 
 shall yet <I>dream dreams</I> and <I>see visions;</I>" God will reveal 
 himself by dreams and visions both to the young and old. 

 (3.) Upon those of the meanest rank and condition, even <I>upon the
 servants and the handmaids.</I> The Jewish doctors say, <I>Prophecy 
 does not reside on any</I> but such as are <I>wise, valiant, and 
 rich,</I> not upon the soul of a <I>poor man,</I> or a man <I>in 
 sorrow.</I> But in Christ Jesus there is <I>neither bond nor free,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:28">Gal. iii. 28</A>.
 
 There were many that <I>were called being servants</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:21">1 Cor. vii. 21</A>),

 but that was no obstruction to their receiving the Holy Ghost.

 (4.) The effect of this blessing: <I>They shall prophesy;</I> they
 shall receive new discoveries of divine things, and that not for their 
 own use only, but for the benefit of the church. They shall interpret 
 scripture, and speak of things secret, distant, and future, which by 
 the utmost sagacities of reason, and their natural powers, they could 
 not have any insight into nor foresight of. By these extraordinary 
 gifts the Christian church was first founded and set up, and the 
 scriptures were written, and the ministry settled, by which, with the 
 ordinary operations and influences of the Spirit, it was to be 
 afterwards maintained and kept up.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How the kingdom of glory shall be introduced by the universal 
 change of nature, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:30,31"><I>v.</I> 30, 31</A>.

 The pouring out of the Spirit will be very comfortable to the 
 righteous; but let the unrighteous hear this, and tremble. There is a 
 <I>great and terrible day of the Lord</I> coming, which shall be 
 ushered in with <I>wonders</I> in <I>heaven and earth, blood, and fire, 
 and pillars of smoke,</I> the turning of <I>the sun into darkness and 
 the moon into blood.</I> This is to have its full accomplishment (as 
 the learned Dr. Pocock thinks) in the day of judgment, at the end of 
 time, before which these signs will be performed in the letter of them, 
 yet so that it was accomplished in part in the death of Christ (which 
 is called the <I>judgment of this world,</I> when the earth quaked and 
 the sun was darkened, and a <I>great and terrible day</I> it was), and 
 more fully in the destruction of Jerusalem, which was a type and figure 
 of the general judgment, and before which there were many amazing 
 prodigies, besides the convulsions of states and kingdoms prophesied of 
 under the figurative expressions of turning the <I>sun into darkness 
 and the moon into blood,</I> and the <I>wars and rumours of wars,</I> 
 and <I>distress of nations,</I> which our Saviour spoke of as the 
 <I>beginning of</I> these <I>sorrows,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:6,7">Matt. xxiv. 6, 7</A>.

 But before the last judgment there will be <I>wonders</I> indeed <I>in
 heaven and earth,</I> the dissolution of both, without a metaphor. The 
 judgments of God upon a sinful world, and the frequent destruction of 
 wicked kingdoms by fire and sword, are prefaces to and presages of the 
 judgment of the world in the last day. Those on whom the Spirit is 
 poured out shall foresee and foretel that <I>great and terrible day of 
 the Lord,</I> and expound the <I>wonders in heaven and earth</I> that 
 go before it; for, as to his first coming, so to his second, all the 
 prophets did and do bear witness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+10:7">Rev. x. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The safety and happiness of all true believers both in the first 
 and second coming of Jesus Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 This speaks of particular persons, for to them the New Testament has 
 more respect, and less to kingdoms and nations, than the Old. Now 
 observe here, 

 1. That there is a salvation wrought out. Though the day of the Lord
 will be great and terrible, yet <I>in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there 
 shall be deliverance</I> from the terror of it. It is the day of the 
 Lord, the day of his judgment, who knows how to separate between the 
 precious and the vile. In the everlasting gospel, which <I>went from 
 Zion,</I> in the church of the first-born typified by Mount Zion, and 
 which is the Jerusalem that is from above, there is <I>deliverance;</I> 
 a way of escaping the <I>wrath to come</I> is found out and laid open. 
 Christ is himself not only the <I>Saviour,</I> but <I>the 
 salvation;</I> he is so <I>to the ends of the earth.</I> This 
 deliverance, laid up for us in the covenant of grace, is in performance 
 of the promises made to the fathers. <I>There shall be deliverance, as 
 the Lord has said.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:72">Luke i. 72</A>.

 Note, This is ground of comfort and hope to sinners, that, whatever
 danger there is in their case, there is also deliverance, deliverance 
 for them, if it be not their own fault. And, if we would share in this 
 deliverance, we must ourselves apply to the gospel--Zion, to God's 
 Jerusalem. 

 2. That there is a remnant interested in this salvation, and for whom
 the deliverance is wrought. It is <I>in that remnant</I> (that is, 
 among them) that the deliverance is, or in their souls and spirits; 
 there are the earnests and evidences of it. <I>Christ in you, the hope
 of glory.</I> They are called a <I>remnant,</I> because they are but a 
 few in comparison with the multitudes that are left to perish; a little 
 remnant but a chosen one, a <I>remnant according to the election of 
 grace.</I> And here we are told who they are that shall be delivered in 
 the great day.

 (1.) Those that sincerely call upon God: <I>Whosoever shall call upon
 the name of the Lord,</I> whether Jew or Gentile (for the apostle so 
 expounds it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:13">Rom. x. 13</A>,

 where he lays this down as the great rule of the gospel by which we
 must all be judged), <I>shall be delivered.</I> This calling on God 
 supposes knowledge of him, faith in him, desire towards him, dependence 
 on him, and, as an evidence of the sincerity of all this, a 
 conscientious obedience to him; for, without that, crying <I>Lord, 
 Lord,</I> will not stand us in any stead. Note, It is the praying 
 remnant that shall be the saved remnant. And it will aggravate the ruin 
 of those who perish that they might have been saved on such easy terms.

 (2.) Those that are effectually called to God. The deliverance is sure
 to the <I>remnant whom the Lord shall call,</I> not only with the 
 common call of the gospel, with which many are called that are not 
 chosen, but with a special call into the fellowship of Jesus Christ, 
 whom <I>the Lord predestinates,</I> or <I>prepares,</I> so the Chaldee.
 St. Peter borrows this phrase, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:39">Acts ii. 39</A>.

 Note, Those only shall be delivered in the great day that are now
 effectually called from sin to God, from self to Christ, from things 
 below to things above.</P>
