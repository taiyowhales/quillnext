 In this chapter, 

 I. We are sure to find the grace of Christ, published by himself to a
 lost world in the everlasting gospel, under the type and figure of 
 Isaiah's province, which was to foretel the deliverance of the Jews out 
 of Babylon, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. We think we find the glories of the church of Christ, its
 spiritual glories, described under the type and figure of the Jews'
 prosperity after their return out of their captivity.

 1. It is promised that they decays of the church shall be repaired,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:4">ver. 4</A>.

 2. That those from without shall be made serviceable to the church, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:5">ver. 5</A>.

 3. That the church shall be a royal priesthood, maintained by the
 riches of the Gentiles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:6">ver. 6</A>.

 4. That she shall have honour and joy in lieu of all her shame and 
 sorrow, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:7">ver. 7</A>.

 5. That her affairs shall prosper, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:8">ver. 8</A>.

 6. That prosperity shall enjoy these blessings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:9">ver. 9</A>.

 7. That righteousness and salvation shall be the eternal matter of the 
 church's rejoicing and thanksgiving, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:10,11">ver. 10, 11</A>.

 If the Jewish church was ever thus blessed, much more shall the 
 Christian church be so, and all that belong to it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The Spirit of the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> upon me; because the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath
 sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the
 captives, and the opening of the prison to <I>them that are</I> bound;
 &nbsp; 2  To proclaim the acceptable year of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and the day of
 vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;
 &nbsp; 3  To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them
 beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of
 praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called
 trees of righteousness, the planting of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that he might
 be glorified.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 He that is the best expositor of scripture has no doubt given us the 
 best exposition of these verses, even our Lord Jesus himself, who read 
 this in the synagogue at Nazareth (perhaps it was the lesson for the 
 day) and applied it entirely to himself, saying, <I>This day is this 
 scripture fulfilled in your ears</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:17,18,21">Luke iv. 17, 18, 21</A>);

 and the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth, in the opening
 of this text, were admired by all that heard them. As Isaiah was 
 authorized and directed to proclaim liberty to the Jews in Babylon, so 
 was Christ, God's messenger, to publish a more joyful jubilee to a lost 
 world. And here we are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How he was fitted and qualified for this work: <I>The Spirit of the 
 Lord God is upon me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 The prophets had the Spirit of God moving them at times, both
 instructing them what to say and exciting them to say it. Christ had 
 the Spirit always resting on him without measure; but to the same 
 intent that the prophets had, as a Spirit of counsel and a Spirit of 
 courage,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:1-3"><I>ch.</I> xi. 1-3</A>.

 When he entered upon the execution of his prophetical office the
 Spirit, as a dove, <I>descended upon him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:16">Matt. iii. 16</A>.

 This Spirit which was upon him he communicated to those whom he sent to
 proclaim the same glad tidings, saying to them, when he gave them their 
 commission, <I>Receive you the Holy Ghost,</I> thereby ratifying 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How he was appointed and ordained to it: <I>The Spirit of God is 
 upon me, because the Lord God has anointed me.</I> What service God 
 called him to he furnished him for; <I>therefore</I> he gave him his 
 Spirit, because he had by a sacred and solemn unction set him apart to 
 this great office, as kings and priests were of old destined to their 
 offices by anointing. Hence the Redeemer was called the <I>Messiah,</I> 
 the <I>Christ,</I> because he was <I>anointed with the oil of gladness 
 above his fellows. He has sent me;</I> our Lord Jesus did not go 
 unsent; he had a commission from him that is the fountain of power; 
 <I>the Father sent him</I> and <I>gave him commandment.</I> This is a 
 great satisfaction to us, that, whatever Christ said, he had a warrant 
 from heaven for; his doctrine was not his, but his that sent him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What the work was to which he was appointed and ordained.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He was to be a preacher, was to execute the office of a prophet. So 
 well pleased was he with the good-will God showed towards men through 
 him that he would himself be the preacher of it, that an honour might 
 thereby be put upon the ministry of the gospel and the faith of the 
 saints might be confirmed and encouraged. He must preach <I>good 
 tidings</I> (so <I>gospel</I> signified) <I>to the meek,</I> to the 
 penitent, and humble, and poor in spirit; to them the tidings of a 
 Redeemer will be indeed good tidings, pure gospel, <I>faithful sayings, 
 and worthy of all acceptation.</I> The poor are commonly best disposed 
 to receive the gospel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:5">Jam. ii. 5</A>),

 and it is likely to profit us when it is received with meekness, as it
 ought to be; to such Christ preached good tidings when he said, 
 <I>Blessed are the meek.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He was to be a healer. He was sent to <I>bind up the 
 broken-hearted,</I> as pained limbs are rolled to give them ease, as 
 broken bones and bleeding wounds are bound up, that they may knit and 
 close again. Those whose hearts are broken for sin, who are truly 
 humbled under the sense of guilt and dread of wrath, are furnished in 
 the gospel of Christ with that which will make them easy and silence 
 their fears. Those only who have experienced the pains of a penitential 
 contrition may expect the pleasure of divine cordials and 
 consolations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He was to be a deliverer. He was sent as a prophet to preach, as a 
 priest to heal, and as a king to issue out proclamations and those of 
 two kinds:--

 (1.) Proclamations of peace to his friends: He shall <I>proclaim 
 liberty to the captives</I> (as Cyrus did to the Jews in captivity) and 
 the <I>opening of the prison to those that were bound.</I> Whereas, by 
 the guilt of sin, we are bound over to the justice of God, are his 
 lawful captives, sold for sin till payment be made of that great debt, 
 Christ lets us know that he has made satisfaction to divine justice for 
 that debt, that his satisfaction is accepted, and if we will plead 
 that, and depend upon it, and make over ourselves and all we have to 
 him, in a grateful sense of the kindness he has done us, we may be 
 faith sue out our pardon and take the comfort of it; there is, and 
 shall be, <I>no condemnation to us.</I> And whereas, by the dominion of 
 sin in us, we are bound under the power of Satan, sold under sin, 
 Christ lets us know that he has conquered Satan, has <I>destroyed him 
 that had the power of death and his works,</I> and provided for us 
 grace sufficient to enable us to shake off the yoke of sin and to loose 
 ourselves from <I>those bands of our neck. The Son</I> is ready by his 
 Spirit to <I>make us free;</I> and then we shall be <I>free indeed,</I> 
 not only discharged from the miseries of captivity, but advanced to all 
 the immunities and dignities of citizens. This is the gospel 
 proclamation, and it is like the blowing of the jubilee-trumpet, which 
 proclaimed the great year of release 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+25:9,40">Lev. xxv. 9, 40</A>),

 in allusion to which it is here called <I>the acceptable year of the
 Lord,</I> the time of our acceptance with God, which is the origin of 
 our liberties; or it is called the <I>year of the Lord</I> because it 
 publishes his free grace, to his own glory, and an <I>acceptable 
 year</I> because it brings glad tidings to us, and what cannot but be 
 very acceptable to those who know the capacities and necessities of 
 their own souls.

 (2.) Proclamations of war against his enemies. Christ proclaims <I>the 
 day of vengeance of our God,</I> the vengeance he takes, 

 [1.] On sin and Satan, death and hell, and all the powers of darkness,
 that were to be destroyed in order to our deliverances; these Christ 
 triumphed over in his cross, having spoiled and weakened them, shamed 
 them, and <I>made a show of them openly,</I> therein taking vengeance 
 on them for all the injury they had done both to God and man, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:15">Col. ii. 15</A>.

 [2.] On those of the children of men that stand it out against those 
 fair offers. They shall not only be left, as they deserve, in their 
 captivity, but be dealt with as enemies; we have the gospel summed up, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:16">Mark xvi. 16</A>,

 where that part of it, <I>He that believes shall be saved,</I>
 proclaims <I>the acceptable year of the Lord</I> to those that will 
 accept of it; but the other part, <I>He that believes not shall be 
 damned,</I> proclaims <I>the day of vengeance of our God,</I> that 
 vengeance which he will take on those that <I>obey not the gospel of 
 Jesus Christ,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+1:8">2 Thess. i. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He was to be a comforter, and so he is as preacher, healer, and 
 deliverer; he is sent to <I>comfort all who mourn,</I> and who, 
 mourning, seek to him, and not to the world, for comfort. Christ not 
 only provides comfort for them, and proclaims it, but he applies it to 
 them; he does by his Spirit comfort them. There is enough in him to 
 <I>comfort all who mourn,</I> whatever their sore or sorrow is; but 
 this comfort is sure to those who <I>mourn in Zion,</I> who sorrow 
 <I>after a godly sort,</I> according to God, for his residence is in 
 Zion,--who <I>mourn because of Zion's</I> calamities and desolations,
 and mingle their tears by a holy sympathy with those of all God's 
 suffering people, though they themselves are not in trouble; such tears 
 God has <I>a bottle</I> for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:8">Ps. lvi. 8</A>),

 such mourners he has comfort in store for. As <I>blessings out of
 Zion</I> are spiritual blessings, so <I>mourners in Zion</I> are holy 
 mourners, such as carry their sorrows to the throne of grace (for in 
 Zion was the mercy-seat) and pour them out as Hannah did before the 
 Lord. To such as these Christ has appointed by his gospel, and will 
 give by his Spirit

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 those consolations which will not only support them under their 
 sorrows, but turn them into songs of praise. He will give them, 

 (1.) <I>Beauty for ashes.</I> Whereas they lay in ashes, as was usual 
 in times of great mourning, they shall not only be raised out of their 
 dust, but made to look pleasant. Note, The holy cheerfulness of 
 Christians is their beauty and a great ornament to their profession.
 Here is an elegant <I>paronomasia</I> in the original: He will give 
 them <I>pheer--beauty,</I> for <I>epher--ashes;</I> he will turn their 
 sorrow into joy as quickly and as easily as you can transpose a letter; 
 for he speaks, and it is done. 

 (2.) <I>The oil of joy,</I> which <I>make the face to shine,</I> 
 instead of <I>mourning,</I> which <I>disfigures the countenance</I> and 
 makes it unlovely. this <I>oil of joy</I> the saints have from that 
 <I>oil of gladness</I> with which Christ himself was <I>anointed above 
 his fellows,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:9">Heb. i. 9</A>.

 (3.) <I>The garments of praise,</I> such beautiful garments as were 
 worn on thanksgiving-days, instead of the <I>spirit of heaviness, 
 dimness,</I> or <I>contraction</I>--open joys for secret mournings. The 
 <I>spirit of heaviness</I> they keep to themselves (Zion's mourners 
 <I>weep in secret</I>); but the joy they are recompensed with they are 
 clothed with as with a garment in the eye of others. Observe, Where God 
 gives the oil of joy he gives the garment of praise. Those comforts 
 which come from God dispose the heart to, and enlarge the heart in, 
 thanksgivings to God. Whatever we have the joy of God must have the 
 praise and glory of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He was to be a planter; for the church is God's husbandry. 
 <I>Therefore</I> he will do all this for his people, will cure their 
 wounds, release them out of bondage, and comfort them in their sorrows, 
 <I>that they may be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the 
 Lord,</I> that they may be such and be acknowledged to be such, that 
 they may be ornaments to God's vineyard and may be <I>fruitful in the 
 fruits of righteousness,</I> as the branches of <I>God's planting,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:21"><I>ch.</I> lx. 21</A>.

 All that Christ does for us is to make us God's people, and some way
 serviceable to him as living trees, <I>planted in the house of the 
 Lord,</I> and <I>flourishing in the courts of our God;</I> and all this 
 <I>that he may be glorified</I>--that we may be brought to glorify him 
 by a sincere devotion and an exemplary conversation (for <I>herein is 
 our Father glorified, that we bring broth much fruit</I>), that others 
 also may take occasion from God's favour shining on his people, and his 
 grace shining in them, to praise him, and that he may be for ever 
 <I>glorified in his saints.</I></P>

 former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the
 desolations of many generations.
 &nbsp; 5  And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons
 of the alien <I>shall be</I> your ploughmen and your vinedressers.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Promises are here made to the Jews now returned out of captivity, and 
 settled again in their own land, which are to be extended to the gospel 
 church, and all believers, who through grace are delivered out of 
 spiritual thraldom; for they are capable of being spiritually 
 applied.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It is promised that their houses shall be rebuilt 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 that their cities shall be raised out of the ruins in which they had 
 long lain, and be fitted up for their use again: <I>They shall build 
 the old wastes;</I> the <I>old wastes</I> shall be built, the <I>waste 
 cities shall be repaired,</I> the <I>former desolations,</I> even 
 <I>the desolations of many generations,</I> which it was feared would 
 never be repaired, shall be <I>raised up.</I> The setting up of 
 Christianity in the world repaired the decays of natural religion and 
 raised up those desolations both of piety and honesty which had been 
 for many generations the reproach of mankind. An unsanctified soul is 
 like a city that is broken down and has no walls, like a house in 
 ruins; but by the power of Christ's gospel and grace it is repaired, it 
 is put in order again, and fitted to be a habitation of God through the 
 Spirit. And <I>they</I> shall do this, those that are released out of
 captivity; for we are brought out of the house of bondage that we may 
 serve God, both in building up ourselves to his glory and in helping to 
 build up his church on earth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Those that were so lately servants themselves, working for their 
 oppressors and lying at their mercy, shall now have servants to do 
 their work for them and be at their command, not of their brethren 
 (they are all the Lord's freemen), but of <I>the strangers, and the 
 sons of the alien,</I> who shall <I>keep their sheep, till their 
 ground,</I> and <I>dress their gardens,</I> the ancient employments of 
 Abel, Cain, and Adam: <I>Strangers shall feed your flocks,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 When, by the grace of God, we attain to a holy indifference as to all
 the affairs of this world, <I>buying as though we possessed 
 not</I>--when, though our hands are employed about them, our hearts are
 not entangled with them, but reserved entire for God and his 
 service--then <I>the sons of the alien are our ploughmen and
 vine-dressers.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They shall not only be released out of their captivity, but highly 
 preferred and honourably employed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "While the strangers are <I>keeping your flocks,</I> you shall be 
 keeping <I>the charge of the sanctuary;</I> instead of being slaves to 
 your task-masters, <I>you shall be named the priests of the Lord,</I> a 
 high and holy calling." Priests were princes' peers, and in Hebrew were 
 called by the same name. You <I>shall be the ministers of our God,</I> 
 as the Levites were. Note, Those whom God sets at liberty he sets to 
 work; he <I>delivers them out of the hands of their enemies</I> that 
 they may <I>serve him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:74,75,Ps+116:16">Luke i. 74, 75; Ps. cxvi. 16</A>.

 But his service is perfect freedom, nay, it is the greatest honour.
 When God brought Israel out of Egypt he took them to be to him a 
 <I>kingdom of priests,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:6">Exod. xix. 6</A>.

 And the gospel church is a <I>royal priesthood,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:9">1 Pet. ii. 9</A>.

 All believers are made to our God kings and priests; and they ought to
 conduct themselves as such in their devotions and in their whole 
 conversation, with <I>holiness to the Lord</I> written upon their 
 foreheads, that men may <I>call them the priests of the Lord.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The wealth and honour of the Gentile converts shall redound to the
 benefit and credit of the church, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 <I>The Gentiles</I> shall be brought into the church. Those that were
 strangers shall become <I>fellow-citizens with the saints;</I> and with 
 themselves they shall bring all they have, to be devoted to the glory 
 of God and used in his service; and the priests, the Lord's ministers, 
 shall have the advantage of it. It will be a great strengthening and 
 quickening, as well as a comfort and encouragement, to all good 
 Christians, to see the Gentiles serving the interests of God's kingdom. 

 1. They shall <I>eat the riches of the Gentiles,</I> not which they 
 have themselves seized by violence, but which are fairly and honourably 
 presented to them, as <I>gifts brought to the altar,</I> which the 
 priests and their families lived comfortably upon. It is not said, "You 
 shall <I>hoard the riches of the Gentiles,</I> and treasure them," but, 
 "You shall <I>eat them;</I>" for there is nothing better in riches than 
 to use them and to do good with them. 

 2. They shall <I>boast themselves in their glory.</I> Whatever was the 
 honour of the Gentiles converts before their conversion--their 
 nobility, estates, learning, virtue, or places of trust and power--it 
 shall all turn to the reputation of the church to which they have 
 joined themselves; and whatever is their glory after their 
 conversion--their holy zeal and strictness of conversation, their 
 usefulness, their patient suffering, and all the displays of that 
 blessed change which divine grace has made in them--shall be very much 
 for the glory of God and therefore all good men shall glory in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. They shall have abundance of comfort and satisfaction in their own 
 bosoms, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The Jews no doubt were thus privileged after their return; they were in
 a new world, and now knew how to value their liberty and property, the 
 pleasures of which were continually fresh and blooming. Much more do 
 all those rejoice whom Christ has brought into the glorious liberty of 
 God's children, especially when the privileges of their adoption shall 
 be completed in the resurrection of the body.

 1. <I>They shall rejoice in their portion;</I> they shall not only have
 their own again, but (which is a further gift of God) they shall have 
 the comfort of it, and a heart to rejoice in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:13">Eccl. iii. 13</A>.

 Though the houses of the returned Jews, as well as their temple, be
 much inferior to what they were before the captivity, yet they shall be 
 well pleased with them and thankful for them. It is a portion <I>in 
 their land,</I> their own land, the holy land, Immanuel's land, and 
 therefore they shall rejoice in it, having so lately known what it was 
 to be <I>strangers in a strange land.</I> Those that have God and 
 heaven for their portion have reason to say that they have a worthy 
 portion and to rejoice in it.

 2. <I>Everlasting joy shall be unto them,</I> that is, a joyful state
 of their people, which shall last long, much longer than the captivity 
 had lasted. Yet that joy of the Jewish nation was so much allayed, so 
 often interrupted, and so soon brought to an end, that we must look for 
 the accomplishment of this promise in the spiritual joy which believers 
 have in God and the eternal joy they hope for in heaven. 

 3. This shall be a double recompence to them, and more than double, for
 all the reproach and vexation they have lain under in the land of their 
 captivity: "<I>For your shame you shall have double</I> honour, and 
 <I>in your land</I> you <I>shall possess double</I> wealth, to what you 
 lost; the blessing of God upon it, and the comfort you shall have in 
 it, shall make an abundant reparation for all the damages you have 
 received. You shall be owned not only as <I>God's sons,</I> but as his 
 <I>first-born</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:22">Exod. iv. 22</A>),

 and therefore entitled to a double portion." As the miseries of their
 captivity were so great that in them they are said to have received 
 <I>double for all their sins</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:2"><I>ch.</I> xl. 2</A>),

 so the joys of their return shall be so great that in them they shall
 receive <I>double for all their shame.</I> The former is applicable to 
 the fulness of Christ's satisfaction, in which God received <I>double 
 for all our sins;</I> the latter to the fulness of heaven's joys, in 
 which we shall receive more than <I>double for all our services</I> and 
 sufferings. Job's case illustrates this: when God <I>turned again his 
 captivity,</I> he gave him <I>twice as much as he had before.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. God will be their faithful guide and a God in covenant with them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>I will direct their work in truth.</I> God by his providence will 
 order their affairs for the best, according to the word of his truth. 
 He will guide them in the ways of true prosperity, by the rules of true 
 policy. He will by his grace direct the works of good people in the 
 right way, the true way that leads to happiness; he will direct them to 
 be done in sincerity and then they are pleasing to him. God <I>desires 
 truth in the inward parts;</I> and, if we do our works in truth, he 
 will <I>make an everlasting covenant with us;</I> for to those that 
 <I>walk before him</I> and <I>are upright</I> he will certainly be a 
 <I>God all-sufficient.</I> Now, as a reason both of this and of the 
 foregoing promise, that God will recompense to them <I>double for their 
 shame,</I> those words come in, in the former part of the verse, <I>I 
 the Lord love judgment.</I> He loves that judgment should be done among 
 men, both between magistrates and subjects and between neighbour and 
 neighbour, and therefore he hates all injustice; and, when wrongs are 
 done to his people by their oppressors and persecutors, he is 
 displeased with them, not only because they are done to his people, but 
 because they are wrongs, and against the eternal rules of equity. If 
 men do not do justice, he loves to do judgment himself in giving 
 redress to those that suffer wrong and punishing those that do wrong. 
 God pleads his people's injured cause, not only because he is jealous 
 for them, but because he is jealous for justice. To illustrate this,
 it is added that he <I>hates robbery for burnt-offering.</I> He hates 
 injustice even in his own people, who honour him with what they have in 
 their burnt-offerings, much more does he hate it when it is against his 
 own people; if he hates robbery when it is for burnt-offerings to 
 himself, much more when it is for burnt-offerings to idols, and when 
 not only his people are robbed of their estates, but he is robbed of 
 his offerings. It is a truth much to the honour of God that ritual
 services will never atone for the violation of moral precepts, nor will 
 it justify any man's robbery to say, "It was for burnt-offerings," or 
 <I>Corban--It is a gift.</I> Behold, <I>to obey is better than 
 sacrifice,</I> to <I>do justly and love mercy</I> better than 
 <I>thousands of rams;</I> nay, that robbery is most of all hateful to 
 God which is covered with this pretence, for it makes the righteous God 
 to be the patron of unrighteousness. Some make this a reason of the 
 rejection of the Jews upon the bringing in of the Gentiles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),
 
 because they were so corrupt in their morals, and, while they tithed 
 mint and cummin, made nothing of <I>judgment and mercy</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:23">Matt. xxiii. 23</A>),
 
 whereas <I>God loves judgment</I> and insists upon that, and he hates
 both <I>robbery for burnt offerings</I> and <I>burnt-offerings for 
 robbery</I> too, as that of the Pharisees, who made long prayers that 
 they might the more plausibly devour widows' houses. Others read these 
 words thus: <I>I hate rapine by iniquity,</I> that is, the spoil which 
 the enemies of God's people had unjustly made of them; God hated this, 
 and therefore would reckon with them for it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. God will entail a blessing upon their posterity after them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):
 
 <I>Their seed</I> (the children of those persons themselves that are 
 now the blessed of the Lord, or their successors in profession, the 
 church's seed) shall be <I>accounted to the Lord for a generation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:30">Ps. xxii. 30</A>.

 1. They shall signalize themselves and make their neighbours to take
 notice of them: <I>They shall be known among the Gentiles,</I> shall 
 distinguish themselves by the gravity, seriousness, humility, and 
 cheerfulness of their conversation, especially by that brotherly love 
 by which all men shall know them to be Christ's disciples. And, they 
 thus distinguishing themselves, God shall dignify them, by making them 
 the blessings of their age and instruments of his glory, and by giving 
 them remarkable tokens of his favour, which shall make them eminent and 
 gain them respect from all about them. Let the children of godly 
 parents love in such a manner that they may be known to be such, that 
 all who observe them may see in them the fruits of a good education, 
 and an answer to the prayers that were put up for them; and then they 
 may expect that God will make them known, by the fulfilling of that 
 promise to them, that <I>the generation of the upright shall be 
 blessed.</I> 

 2. God shall have the glory of this, for every one shall attribute it
 to the blessing of God; all that see them shall see so much of the 
 grace of God in them, and his favour towards them, that they shall 
 <I>acknowledge them to be the seed which the Lord has blessed</I> and 
 doth bless, for it includes both. See what it is to be blessed of God. 
 Whatever good appears in any it must be taken notice of as the fruit of 
 God's blessing and he must be glorified in it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  I will greatly rejoice in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, my soul shall be joyful
 in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation,

 &nbsp; 11  For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Some make this the song of joy and praise to be sung by the prophet in 
 the name of Jerusalem, congratulating her on the happy change of her 
 circumstances in the accomplishment of the foregoing promises; others 
 make it to be spoken by Christ in the name of the New-Testament church 
 triumphing in gospel grace. We may take in both, the former as a type 
 of the latter. We are here taught to rejoice with holy joy, to God's 
 honour, 

 1. In the beginning of this good work, the clothing of the church
 <I>with righteousness and salvation,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Upon this account <I>I will greatly rejoice in the Lord.</I> Those that
 rejoice in God have cause to rejoice greatly, and we need not fear 
 running into an extreme in the greatness of our joy when we make God 
 the gladness of our joy. The first gospel song begins like this, <I>My 
 soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my 
 Saviour,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:46,47">Luke i. 46, 47</A>.

 There is just matter for this joy, and all the reason in the world why
 it should terminate in God; for salvation and righteousness are wrought 
 out and brought in, and the church is clothed with them. The salvation 
 God wrought for the Jews, and that righteousness of his in which he 
 appeared for them, and that reformation which appeared among them, made 
 them look as glorious in the eyes of all wise men as if they had been 
 clothed in robes of state or nuptial garments. Christ has clothed his 
 church with an eternal salvation (and that is truly great) by clothing 
 it with the righteousness both of justification and sanctification. The 
 <I>clean linen is the righteousness of saints,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:8">Rev. xix. 8</A>.

 Observe how these tow are put together; those, and those only, shall be
 clothed with the garments of salvation hereafter that are covered with 
 the robe of righteousness now: and those garments are rich and splendid 
 clothing, like the priestly garments (for so the word signifies) with 
 which the <I>bridegroom decks himself.</I> The brightness of the sun 
 itself is compared to them. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:5">Ps. xix. 5</A>,

 <I>He is as a bridegroom</I> coming out of his chamber, completely
 dressed. Such is the beauty of God's grace in those that are clothed 
 with the robe of righteousness, that by the righteousness of Christ are 
 recommended to God's favour and by the sanctification of the Spirit 
 have God's image renewed upon them; they are decked as a bride to be 
 espoused to God, and taken into covenant with him; they are decked as a 
 priest to be employed for God, and taken into communion with him.

 2. In the progress and continuance of this good work,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 It is not like a day of triumph, which is glorious for the present, but
 is soon over. No; the righteousness and salvation with which the church 
 is clothed are durable clothing; so they are said to be,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:18"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 18</A>.

 The church, when she is pleasing herself with the righteousness and
 salvation that Jesus Christ has clothed her with, rejoices to think 
 that these inestimable blessings shall both spring for future ages and 
 spread to distant regions. 

 (1.) They shall spring forth for ages to come, as the fruits of the 
 earth which are produced very year, from generation to generation. 
 <I>As the earth,</I> even that which lies common, <I>brings forth her 
 bud,</I> the tender grass at the return of the year, and as <I>the 
 garden</I> enclosed <I>causes the things that are sown in it to spring 
 forth</I> in their season, so duly, so constantly, so powerfully, and 
 with such advantage to mankind <I>will the Lord God cause righteousness 
 and praise to spring forth,</I> by virtue of the covenant of grace, as, 
 in the former case, by virtue of the covenant of providence. See what 
 the promised blessings are--<I>righteousness and praise</I> (for those 
 that are clothed with righteousness <I>show forth the praises</I> of 
 him that clothed them); these shall spring forth under the influence of 
 the dew of divine grace. Though it may sometimes be winter with the 
 church, when those blessings seem to wither and do not appear, yet the 
 root of them is fixed, a spring-time will come, when through the 
 reviving beams of the approaching Sun of righteousness they shall 
 flourish again. 

 (2.) They shall spread far, and <I>spring forth before all the 
 nations;</I> the great salvation shall be published and proclaimed to 
 all the world and the ends of the earth shall see it.</P>
