 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Divers things were foretold, in the two foregoing chapters, which 
 should come to pass "in that day;" this chapter speaks of a "day of the 
 Lord that cometh," a day of his judgment, and ten times in the 
 foregoing chapters, and seven times in this, it is repeated, "in that 
 day;" but what that day is that is here meant is uncertain, and perhaps 
 will be so (as the Jews speak) till Elias comes; whether it refer to
 the whole period of time from the prophet's days to the days of the 
 Messiah, or to some particular events in that time, or to Christ's 
 coming, and the setting up of his kingdom upon the ruins of the Jewish 
 polity, we cannot determine, but divers passages here seem to look as 
 far forward as gospel-times. Now the "day of the Lord" brings with it 
 both judgment and mercy, mercy to his church, judgment to her enemies 
 and persecutors. 

 I. The gates of hell are here threatening the church 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>)

 and yet not prevailing.

 II. The power of Heaven appears here for the church and against the 
 enemies of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:3,5">ver. 3, 5</A>.

 III. The events concerning the church are here represented as mixed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>),

 but issuing well at last. 

 IV. The spreading of the means of knowledge is here foretold, and the 
 setting up of the gospel-kingdom in the world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:8,9">ver. 8, 9</A>),

 which shall be the enlargement and establishment of another Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:10,11">ver. 10, 11</A>.

 V. Those shall be reckoned with that fought against Jerusalem
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:12-15">ver. 12-15</A>)
 
 and those that neglect his worship there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:17-19">ver. 17-19</A>.

 VI. It is promised that there shall be great resort to the church, and 
 great purity and piety in it,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Behold, the day of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> cometh, and thy spoil shall be
 divided in the midst of thee.
 &nbsp; 2 For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle;
 and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women
 ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and
 the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city.
 &nbsp; 3 Then shall the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> go forth, and fight against those
 nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.
 &nbsp; 4 And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of
 Olives, which <I>is</I> before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of
 Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and
 toward the west, <I>and there shall be</I> a very great valley; and
 half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of
 it toward the south.
 &nbsp; 5 And ye shall flee <I>to</I> the valley of the mountains; for the
 valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal: yea, ye shall
 flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of
 Uzziah king of Judah: and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> my God shall come, <I>and</I> all
 the saints with thee.
 &nbsp; 6 And it shall come to pass in that day, <I>that</I> the light shall
 not be clear, <I>nor</I> dark:
 &nbsp; 7 But it shall be one day which shall be known to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, not
 day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, <I>that</I> at evening time
 it shall be light.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God's providences concerning his church are here represented as 
 strangely changing and strangely mixed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. As strangely changing. Sometimes the tide runs high and strong 
 against them, but presently it turns, and comes to be in favour of 
 them; and God has, for wise and holy ends, set the one over against the 
 other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God here appears against Jerusalem; judgment begins at the house of 
 God. When the <I>day of the Lord comes</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)

 Jerusalem must pass through the fire to be refined. God himself 
 <I>gathers all nations against Jerusalem to battle</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 he gives them a charge, as he did Sennacherib, to <I>take the spoil</I> 
 and to <I>take the prey</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:6">Isa. x. 6</A>),

 for the people of Jerusalem have now become the <I>people of his
 wrath.</I> And who can stand before him or before nations gathered by 
 him? Where he gives commission he will give success. The <I>city shall 
 be taken by the</I> Romans, who have <I>nations</I> at command; the 
 houses shall be rifled, and all the riches of them taken away, by the 
 enemy; and, to gratify an insatiable lust of uncleanness as well as 
 avarice, <I>the women</I> shall <I>be ravished,</I> as if victory were 
 a license to the worst of villanies, <I>jusque datum sceleri--and 
 crimes were sanctioned by law. One-half of the city</I> shall then be 
 carried <I>into captivity,</I> to be sold or enslaved, and shall not be 
 able to help itself, such is the destruction that shall be made in the 
 great and terrible <I>day of the Lord.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He presently changes his way, and appears for Jerusalem; for, though 
 judgment begin at the house of God, yet, as it shall not end there, so 
 it shall not make a full end there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:27,30:11">Jer. iv. 27; xxx. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) A remnant shall be spared, the same with that <I>third part</I> 
 spoken of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:8"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 8</A>.

 <I>One-half shall go into captivity,</I> whence they may hereafter be
 fetched back, <I>and the residue of the people shall not</I> be cut
 off, as one would have feared, <I>from the city.</I> Many of the Jews
 shall receive the gospel, and so shall prevent their being cut off from
 the city of God, his church upon earth. <I>In it shall be a tenth,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:13">Isa. vi. 13</A>;

 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:3">Ezek. v. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Their cause shall be pleaded against their enemies
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):
 
 <I>Then,</I> when God has made use of these nations as a scourge to his 
 people, he shall <I>go forth</I> and <I>fight against them</I> by his 
 judgments, <I>as when he fought</I> against the enemies of his church 
 formerly <I>in the day of battle,</I> with the Egyptians, Canaanites, 
 and others. Note, The instruments of God's wrath will themselves be 
 made the objects of it; for it will come to their turn to drink of the 
 cup of trembling; and whom God fights against he will be sure to 
 overcome and be too hard for. And every former <I>day of battle,</I> 
 which God has made to his people a <I>day of triumph,</I> as it is an 
 engagement to God to appear for his people, because he is the same, so 
 it is an encouragement to them to trust in him. It is observable that 
 the Roman empire never flourished, after the destruction of Jerusalem 
 as it had done before, but in many instances God fought against it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Though Jerusalem and the temple be destroyed, yet God will have a 
 church in the world, into which Gentiles shall be admitted, and with 
 whom the believing Jews shall be incorporated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 These verses are dark and hard to be understood; but divers good 
 expositors take this to be the meaning of them. 

 [1.] God will carefully inspect Jerusalem, even then when the enemies
 of it are laying it waste: <I>His feet shall stand in that day upon the
 mount of Olives,</I> whence he may take a full view of the city and
 temple, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:3">Mark xiii. 3</A>.

 When the refiner puts his gold into the furnace he stands by it, and
 has his eye upon it, to see that it receive no damage; so when
 Jerusalem, God's gold, is to be refined, he will have the oversight of
 it. He will stand by <I>upon the mount of Olives;</I> this was
 literally fulfilled when our Lord Jesus was often upon this mountain,
 especially when thence he <I>ascended up into heaven,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:12">Acts i. 12</A>.

 It was the last place on which his feet stood on this earth, the place
 from which he took rise.

 [2.] The partition-wall between Jews and Gentiles shall be taken away.
 The <I>mountains about Jerusalem,</I> and particularly this, signified
 it to be an enclosure, and that it stood in the way of those who would
 approach to it. Between the Gentiles and Jerusalem this <I>mountain of
 Bether,</I> of <I>division,</I> stood, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:17">Cant. ii. 17</A>.

 But by the destruction of Jerusalem this mountain shall be made to
 <I>cleave in the midst,</I> and so the Jewish pale shall be taken down, 
 and the church laid in common with the Gentiles, who were made one with 
 the Jews by the breaking down of this <I>middle wall of partition,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:14">Eph. ii. 14</A>.

 <I>Who art thou, O great mountain?</I> And a great mountain the
 ceremonial law was in the way of the Jews' conversion, which, one would 
 think, could never have been got over; yet before Christ and his gospel 
 it was made plain. This <I>mountain departs,</I> this <I>hill 
 removes,</I> but the <I>covenant of peace</I> cannot be <I>broken;</I> 
 for peace is still <I>preached to him that is afar off and to those 
 that are nigh.</I>

 [3.] A new and living way shall be opened to the new Jerusalem, both to 
 see it and to come into it. The mountain being divided, one-half 
 <I>towards the north</I> and the other half <I>towards the south,</I> 
 there shall be <I>a very great valley,</I> that is, a broad way of 
 communication opened between Jerusalem and the Gentile world, by which 
 the Gentiles shall have free admission into the gospel-Jerusalem, and 
 the word of the Lord, that <I>goes forth from Jerusalem,</I> shall have 
 a <I>free course</I> into the Gentile world. Thus the <I>way of the
 Lord</I> is prepared, for <I>every mountain and hill shall be brought 
 low,</I> and plain and pleasant valleys shall come in the room of them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:4">Isa. xl. 4</A>.
 
 [4.] Those of the Jews that believe shall come in, and join themselves
 to the Gentiles, and incorporate with them in the gospel-church: <I>You 
 shall flee to the valley of the mountains,</I> that valley that is 
 opened between the divided halves of the mount of Olives; they shall 
 hasten into the church with the Gentiles, as formerly the Gentiles with 
 them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:23"><I>ch.</I> viii. 23</A>.
 
 The <I>valley of the mountains</I> is the gospel-church, to which there
 were added of the Jews daily <I>such as should be saved,</I> who fled 
 to that valley as to their refuge. This <I>valley of the mountains</I> 
 is said to <I>reach unto Azal,</I> or <I>to the separate place,</I> 
 that is, to all those whom God has <I>set apart for himself.</I> When 
 God <I>makes his mountains a way</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:11">Isa. xlix. 11</A>),

 by making them a valley, the way shall be opened to all the
 <I>way-faring men</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:8">Isa. xxxv. 8</A>),

 and, <I>though fools,</I> they <I>shall not err therein.</I> Or, to
 those that are now separated from God this valley shall reach; for the 
 Gentiles, who are afar off, shall be made nigh, with the Jews, who are 
 a <I>people near unto him,</I> and both have <I>an access,</I> a mutual 
 access to each other and a joint access to God as a Father by one 
 Spirit,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:18">Eph. ii. 18</A>.

 [5.] They shall flee to <I>the valley of the mountains,</I> to the
 gospel-church, under dreadful apprehensions of their danger from the
 curse of the law. They shall <I>flee from the wrath to come,</I> from
 the avenger of blood, who is in pursuit of them, to the church as to a
 <I>city of refuge,</I> or <I>as doves to their windows,</I> as they
 <I>fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+1:1">Amos i. 1</A>.
 
 <I>Therefore</I> the gospel reveals the wrath of God from heaven 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:18">Rom. i. 18</A>)

 that we might be awakened to <I>escape for our lives,</I> to flee as
 from an earthquake, for we feel the earth ready to sink under us, and 
 we can find no firm footing in it, and therefore must flee to Christ, 
 in whom alone we can stand fast and be easy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) God shall appear in his glory for the accomplishing of all this:
 <I>The Lord my God shall come, and all the saints with thee,</I> which 
 may refer to his coming to destroy Jerusalem, or to destroy the enemies 
 of Jerusalem, or his coming to set up his kingdom in the world, which 
 is called the <I>coming of the Son of man</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:37">Matt. xxiv. 37</A>),

 or to his last coming, at the end of time; however, it teaches us,

 [1.] That the Lord will come; it has been the faith of all the saints,
 <I>Behold, the Lord comes</I> to fulfil every word that he has spoken 
 in its season.

 [2.] When he comes all his saints come with him; they attend his 
 motions and are ready to serve his interests. Christ will come at the 
 end of time with <I>ten thousands of his saints,</I> as when he came to 
 give the law upon Mount Sinai. 

 [3.] Every particular believer, being related to God as his God, may 
 triumph in the expectation of his coming and speak of it with pleasure, 
 <I>The Lord my God shall come,</I> shall come to the comfort of all 
 that are his; for, "Blessed Lord, <I>all the saints shall be with 
 thee,</I> and it shall be their everlasting happiness to dwell in thy 
 presence; and therefore <I>come, Lord Jesus.</I>" And some think that 
 this may be read as a prayer, <I>Yet, O Lord my God! come, and bring
 all the saints with thee.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God's providences appear here strangely mixed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>):

 <I>In that day</I> of the Lord the <I>light shall not be clear nor 
 dark, not day</I> nor <I>night;</I> but <I>at evening time it shall be 
 light.</I> Some refer this to all the time from hence to the coming of 
 the Messiah; the Jewish church had neither perfect peace nor constant 
 trouble, but a cloudy day, neither rain nor sunshine. But it may be 
 taken more generally, as designed to represent the method God usually 
 takes in the administration of the kingdom both of providence and 
 grace. Here is, 

 1. An idea of the usual course and tenour of God's dispensations; the
 day of his grace and the day of his providence are <I>neither clear nor 
 dark, not day nor night.</I> It is so with the church of God in this 
 world; where the Sun of righteousness has risen it cannot be dark 
 night, and yet short of heaven it will not be clear day. It is so with 
 particular saints; they are not darkness, but <I>light in the Lord,</I> 
 and yet, while there is so much error and corruption remaining in them, 
 it is not perfect day. So it is as to the providences of God that 
 relate to his church; in general the affairs of the church are neither 
 good nor bad in any extremity, but there is a mixture of both; we are 
 singing both of mercy and judgment, and are uncertain which will 
 prevail, whether it be an evening or a morning twilight. We are between 
 hope and fear, not knowing what to make of things. 

 2. An intimation of comfort with reference hereunto: <I>It shall be one
 day which shall be known to the Lord.</I> This intimates,

 (1.) The beauty and harmony of such mixed events; there is one and the 
 same design and tendency in all; all the wheels make but one wheel, all 
 the revolutions but one day. 

 (2.) The brevity of them; it is, as it were, but for one day, for a 
 little moment; the cloud that darkens the light will soon blow over. 
 
 (3.) The eye God has upon all these events, and the hand he has in them 
 all; they are <I>known to the Lord;</I> he takes notice of them, and 
 orders and disposes of all for the best, according to the counsel of 
 his will. 

 3. An issue very joyful secured at last: <I>At evening-time it shall be
 light:</I> it shall be clear light, and no longer dark; we are sure of 
 it in the other world, and we hope for it in this world--at 
 <I>evening-time,</I> when our hopes are quite spent with waiting all 
 day to no purpose, nay, when we fear it will be quite dark, when things 
 are at the worst and the case of the church is most deplorable. As to 
 the church's enemies <I>the sun goes down at noon,</I> so to the church 
 it rises at night; unto the upright springs <I>light out of 
 darkness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:4">Ps. cxii. 4</A>);

 deliverance comes when the tale of bricks is doubled, and when God's
 people have done looking for it, and so it comes with a pleasing 
 surprise.</P>

 one on the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall rise up
 against the hand of his neighbour.
 &nbsp; 14 And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of
 all the heathen round about shall be gathered together, gold, and
 silver, and apparel, in great abundance.

 camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here are, 

 I. Blessings promised to Jerusalem, the gospel-Jerusalem, in the day of 
 the Messiah, and to all the earth, by virtue of the blessings poured 
 out on Jerusalem, especially to the land of Israel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Jerusalem shall be a spring of living waters to the world; it was 
 made so when there the Spirit was poured out upon the apostles, and 
 thence the word of the Lord diffused itself to the nations about 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Living waters shall go out from Jerusalem;</I> for there they began, 
 and thence those set out who were to preach <I>repentance</I> and 
 <I>remission</I> of sins <I>unto all nations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:47">Luke xxiv. 47</A>.

 Note, Where the gospel goes, and the graces of God's Spirit go along
 with it, there living waters go; those streams that <I>make glad the 
 city of our God</I> make glad the country also, and make it like 
 paradise, like the <I>garden of the Lord,</I> which was <I>well 
 watered.</I> It was the honour of Jerusalem that <I>thence the word of 
 the Lord went forth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:3">Isa. ii. 3</A>);

 and thus far, even in its worst and most degenerate age, for old
 acquaintance-sake, it was made a blessing, and to be so is to be 
 blessed. Half of these waters shall go <I>towards the former sea</I> 
 and <I>half towards the hinder sea,</I> as all rivers bend their course 
 towards some sea or other, some eastward, others westward. The gospel 
 shall spread into all parts of the world, into some that lie remote 
 from Jerusalem one way and others that lie as far off another way; for 
 the dominion of the Redeemer, which was thereby to be set up, must be 
 <I>from sea to sea</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:8">Ps. lxxii. 8</A>),

 and the earth must be <I>full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the
 waters cover the sea,</I> and as the waters that in various channels 
 run to the sea. The knowledge of God shall diffuse itself,

 (1.) Every way. These living waters shall produce both eastern
 churches and western churches, that shall each of them in its turn be 
 illustrious. 

 (2.) Every day: In <I>summer and in winter it shall be.</I> Note, Those 
 who are employed in spreading the gospel may find themselves work both 
 <I>winter</I> and <I>summer,</I> and are to serve the Lord therein at 
 all seasons, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:18">Acts xx. 18</A>.

 And such a divine power goes along with these living waters that they
 shall not be dried up, nor the course of them be obstructed, either by 
 the droughts in summer or by the frosts in winter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The kingdom of God among men shall be a universal and united 
 kingdom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 (1.) It shall be a universal kingdom: <I>The Lord shall be King over 
 all the earth.</I> He is, and ever was, so of right, and in the 
 sovereign disposals of his providence his kingdom does <I>rule over 
 all</I> and none are exempt from his jurisdiction; but it is here 
 promised that he shall be so by actual possession of the hearts of his 
 subjects; he shall be acknowledged King by all in all places; his 
 authority shall be owned and submitted to, and allegiance sworn to him.
 This will have its accomplishment with that word 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:15">Rev. xi. 15</A>),

 <I>The kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and 
 of his Christ.</I> 

 (2.) It shall be a united kingdom: <I>There shall be one Lord, and his 
 name one.</I> All shall worship one God only, and not idols, and shall 
 be unanimous in the worship of him. All false gods shall be abandoned, 
 and all false ways of worship abolished; and as God shall be the centre 
 of their unity, in whom they shall all meet, so the scripture shall be 
 the rule of their unity, by which they shall all walk.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The land of Judea, and Jerusalem, its mother-city, shall be repaired
 and replenished, and taken under the special protection of Heaven, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 Some think this denotes particular favour to the people of the Jews, 
 and points at their conversion and restoration in the latter days; but 
 it is rather to be understood figuratively of the gospel-church, 
 typified by Judah and Jerusalem, and it signifies the abundant graces 
 with which the church shall be crowned, and the fruitfulness of its 
 members, and the vast numbers of them. 

 (1.) The church shall be like a fruitful country, abounding in all the 
 rich products of the soil. The whole land of Judea, which is naturally 
 uneven and hilly, shall be <I>turned as a plain;</I> it shall become a 
 smooth level valley, from Geba, or Gibeah, its utmost border north, to 
 Rimmon, which lay <I>south of Jerusalem</I> and was the utmost southern 
 limit of Judea. The gospel of Christ, where it comes in its power, 
 levels the ground; mountains and hills are brought low by it, that the 
 Lord alone may be exalted.

 (2.) It shall be like a populous city. As the holy land shall be
 levelled, so the holy city shall be peopled, shall be rebuilt and
 replenished. <I>Jerusalem shall be lifted</I> up out of its low estate,
 shall be raised out of its ruins; when <I>the land is turned as a
 plain,</I> and not only the <I>mount of Olives</I> removed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 but other mountains too, then Jerusalem shall be <I>lifted up,</I> that
 is, shall appear the more conspicuous; she <I>shall be inhabited in her 
 place,</I> even <I>in Jerusalem,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:6"><I>ch.</I> xii. 6</A>.

 The whole city shall be inhabited in the utmost extent of it, and no
 part of it left to lie waste. The utmost limits of it are here 
 mentioned, between which there shall be no ground lost, but all built 
 upon, from <I>Benjamin's-gate</I> north-east to the <I>corner-gate</I> 
 north-west, and <I>from the tower of Hananeel</I> in the south to the 
 <I>king's wine-presses</I> in the north; when the churches of Christ in 
 all places are replenished with great numbers of holy, humble, serious 
 Christians, and many such are daily added to it, then this promise is 
 fulfilled. 

 (3.) This country and this city shall both be safe, both the meat in 
 the country and the mouths in the city: <I>Those that dwell in it</I> 
 shall dwell securely, and there shall be none to make them afraid; 
 there shall be no more of that utter destruction that has laid both 
 town and country waste, no more anathema (as some read it), no more 
 cutting off, no more curse, or separation from God to evil, no more 
 such desolating judgments as you have been groaning under, but 
 Jerusalem <I>shall be safely inhabited;</I> there shall be no danger, 
 nor any apprehension of it; neither shall its friends be fearful to 
 disquiet themselves nor its enemies formidable to disquiet them. That 
 promise of Christ explains this--that <I>the gates of hell shall not 
 prevail against the church;</I> and so do the holy security and 
 serenity of mind which believers enjoy in relying on the divine 
 protection.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here are judgments threatened against the enemies of the church, 
 that <I>have fought,</I> or do fight, against Jerusalem; and the 
 <I>threatening of these</I> judgments is in order to the preservation 
 of the church in safety. Men that read and hear of these plagues will 
 be afraid of fighting against Jerusalem, much more when these 
 threatenings are fulfilled in some will others hear and fear. Those 
 that fight against the city of God, and his people, will be found 
 fighting against God, against whom none ever hardened his heart and 
 prospered 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>This shall be the plague wherewith the Lord will smite all the 
 people that have fought against Jerusalem;</I> whoever they are, God 
 will punish them for the affront done to him, and avenge Jerusalem upon 
 them. 

 1. They shall waste away under grievous and languishing diseases:
 <I>Their flesh shall consume away,</I> and they shall be miserably 
 emaciated, even <I>while they stand on their feet,</I> so that they 
 shall be walking skeletons; nothing shall remain but skin and bones.
 The flesh which they pampered and indulged, and made provision for, 
 when they were fed to the full with the spoils of God's people, shall 
 now <I>consume away, that it cannot be seen, and the bones that were 
 not seen shall stick out,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:21">Job xxxiii. 21</A>.

 They <I>keep their feet,</I> and hope to <I>keep their ground,</I>
 crawling about as long as they can; but they must yield at last. The 
 organs of sight, the outlets of sin, <I>their eyes, shall consume away 
 in their holes,</I> shall sink into their heads or perhaps start out of 
 them; their envious malicious, adulterous eyes, the eyes they had so 
 often fed with spectacles of misery, these shall consume, which shall 
 make not only their countenances ghastly, but their lives wretched. The 
 organs of speech, the outlets of sin, <I>their tongue, shall consume 
 away in their mouth,</I> whereby God will reckon with them for all 
 their blasphemies against himself and invectives against his people.
 Thus <I>their own tongues shall fall upon them,</I> and their 
 punishment shall be legible in their sin, as his was whose tongue was 
 tormented in hell-flames. Thus Antiochus and Herod consumed away.

 2. They shall be dashed in pieces one against another
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>A great tumult from the Lord shall be among them.</I> But are 
 tumults from the Lord, who is the <I>God of order, and not of 
 confusion?</I> As they are the sin of those that raise them they are 
 not from the Lord, but from the wicked one, and from men's own lusts; 
 but, as they are the punishment of those that suffer by them, they are 
 from the Lord, who serves his own purposes, and carries on his 
 intentions, by the sins, and follies, and restless spirits, of men. It 
 is of themselves that they <I>bite and devour one another,</I> but it 
 is of the Lord, the righteous Judge, that thus they are <I>consumed one 
 of another</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:15">Gal. v. 15</A>);

 as Ahab was deceived by a lying spirit from the Lord, so Abimelech and
 the men of Shechem were <I>divided,</I> and so <I>destroyed,</I> by an 
 <I>evil spirit from the Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:23">Judg. ix. 23</A>.

 Note, Those that are confederate and combined against the church will
 justly be separated, and set against one another; and their tumults 
 raised against God will be avenged in tumults among themselves. And 
 they shall <I>lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour,</I> to 
 hold him from striking, or to bind him as his prisoner; nay, <I>his 
 hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour,</I> to strike and 
 wound him. Note, Those that aim to destroy the church are often made to 
 destroy one another; and every man's sword is sometimes set against his 
 fellow, by him whose sword they all are. Some think this was fulfilled
 in the factions and dissensions that were among the Jews, when the 
 Romans were destroying them all; for they had fought against the 
 spiritual Jerusalem, the gospel-church; and to that well enough agrees 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>,

 <I>Thou also, O Judah! shalt fight against Jerusalem;</I> the Jewish 
 nation shall be ruined by itself, shall die by its own hands; the city 
 and country shall be at war with each other, and so both shall be 
 destroyed. <I>Suis et ipsa Roma viribus ruit--Rome was urged into ruin 
 by its very strength.</I> 

 3. The plunder of their camp shall greatly enrich the people of God, or
 the spoils of their country

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):
 
 <I>Judah also shall eat at Jerusalem</I> (so one learned interpreter 
 reads it); people shall come from all parts to share in the prey; as 
 when Sennacherib's army was routed before Jerusalem there was <I>the 
 prey of a great spoil divided</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:23">Isa. xxxiii. 23</A>),

 so it shall be now; the <I>wealth of all the heathen round about,</I>
 that had spoiled <I>Jerusalem, shall be gathered together, gold, and 
 silver, and apparel, in great abundance,</I> that an equal dividend may 
 be made among all the parties entitled to a share of the prize. Note, 
 The <I>wealth of the sinner is</I> often <I>laid up for the just,</I> 
 and the Israel of God enriched with the spoil of the Egyptians.

 4. The very cattle shall share in the plague with which the enemies of 
 God's church shall be cut off, as they did in divers of the plagues of 
 Egypt 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 All <I>the beasts</I> that <I>shall be in the tents</I> of these wicked 
 men, when God comes to contend with them, shall perish with them, not 
 only beasts used in war, as the horse, but those used for travel, or in 
 the plough, as the <I>mule,</I> the <I>camel,</I> and the <I>ass.</I> 
 Note, The inferior creatures often suffer for the sin of man and in his 
 plagues. Thus God will show his indignation against sin, and will make 
 the creature that is thus <I>subject to vanity</I> groan to be 
 <I>delivered</I> into the glorious liberty of the children of God, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:21,22">Rom. viii. 21, 22</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16 And it shall come to pass, <I>that</I> every one that is left of
 all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up
 from year to year to worship the King, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, and to
 keep the feast of tabernacles.
 &nbsp; 17 And it shall be, <I>that</I> whoso will not come up of <I>all</I> the
 families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, even upon them shall be no rain.
 &nbsp; 18 And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that
 <I>have</I> no <I>rain;</I> there shall be the plague, wherewith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of
 tabernacles.
 &nbsp; 19 This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of
 all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.
 &nbsp; 20 In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses,
 HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD; and the pots in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s house shall be
 like the bowls before the altar.
 &nbsp; 21 Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness
 unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts: and all they that sacrifice shall come
 and take of them, and seethe therein: and in that day there shall
 be no more the Canaanite in the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Three things are here foretold:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That a gospel-way of worship being set up in the church there shall 
 be a great resort to it and a general attendance upon it. Those that 
 were left of the enemies of religion shall be so sensible of the mercy 
 of God to them in their narrow escape that they shall apply themselves 
 to the worship of the God of Israel, and pay their homage to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Those that were not consumed shall be converted, and this makes their 
 deliverance a mercy indeed, a double mercy. It is a great change that 
 the grace of God makes upon them; those that had <I>come against 
 Jerusalem,</I> finding their attempts vain and fruitless, shall become 
 as much her admirers as ever they had been her adversaries, and shall 
 <I>come to Jerusalem</I> to worship there, and go in concurrence with 
 those whom they had gone contrary to. Note, As some of Christ's foes 
 shall be made his footstool, so others of them shall be made his 
 friends; and, when the principle of enmity is slain in them, their 
 former acts of hostility are pardoned to them, and their services are 
 admitted and accepted, as though they had never <I>fought against 
 Jerusalem.</I> They shall <I>go up to worship</I> at Jerusalem, because 
 that was the place which God had chosen, and there the temple was, 
 which was a type of Christ and his mediation. Converting grace sets us 
 right, 

 1. In the object of our worship. <I>They shall</I> no longer
 <I>worship</I> the Molochs and Baals, the <I>kings</I> and 
 <I>lords,</I> that the Gentiles worship, the creatures of their own 
 imagination, but <I>the King,</I> the <I>Lord of hosts,</I> the 
 everlasting King, the King of kings, the sovereign Lord of all. 

 2. In the ordinances of worship, those which God himself has appointed.
 Gospel-worship is here represented by the <I>keeping of the feast of 
 tabernacles,</I> for the sake of those two great graces which were in a 
 special manner <I>acted</I> and <I>signified</I> in that feast-contempt 
 of the world, and joy in God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:17">Neh. viii. 17</A>.

 The life of a good Christian is a constant <I>feast of tabernacles,</I>
 and, in all acts of devotion, we must retire from the world and rejoice 
 in the Lord, must worship as in that feast.

 3. In the <I>Mediator</I> of our worship; we must go to Christ our
 temple with all our offerings, for in him only our <I>spiritual 
 sacrifices</I> are acceptable to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:5">1 Pet. ii. 5</A>.

 If we rest in ourselves, we come short of pleasing God; we must go up
 to him, and mention his righteousness only.

 4. In the time of it; we must be constant. They shall go up <I>from
 year to year,</I> at the times appointed for this solemn feast. Every 
 day of a Christian's life is a day of the <I>feast of tabernacles,</I> 
 and every Lord's day especially (that is the <I>great day of the 
 feast</I>); and therefore every day we must worship the Lord of hosts 
 and every Lord's day with a peculiar solemnity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That those who neglect the duties of gospel-worship shall be 
 reckoned with for their neglect. God will compel them to come and 
 worship before him, by suspending his favours from those that keep not 
 his ordinances: <I>Upon them there shall be no rain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Some understand it figuratively; the rain of heavenly doctrine shall be 
 withheld, and of the heavenly grace, which should accompany that 
 doctrine. God will <I>command the clouds that they rain no rain upon 
 them.</I> Note, It is a righteous thing with God to withhold the 
 blessings of grace from those that do not attend the means of grace, to 
 deny the <I>green pastures</I> to those that attend not the 
 <I>shepherd's tents.</I> Or we may take it literally: <I>On them there 
 shall be no rain,</I> to make their ground fruitful. Note, The gifts of 
 common providence are justly denied to those that neglect and despise 
 instituted ordinances. Those that neglected to build the temple were 
 punished with the want of rain 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:17">Hag. ii. 17</A>),

 and so were those that neglected to attend there when it was built. If
 we be barren and unfruitful towards God, justly is the earth made so to 
 us. Many are crossed, and go backward, in their affairs, and this is at 
 the bottom of it--they do not keep close to the worship of God as they 
 should; they go off from God, and then he walks contrary to them. If we 
 omit or postpone the duties he expects from us, it is just with him to 
 deny the favours we expect from him. But what shall be done to the 
 defaulters of the land of Egypt, to whom the threatening of the want of 
 rain is no threatening, for they have no rain at any time; they need 
 none; they desire none; the river Nilus is to them instead of the 
 clouds of heaven, waters their land, and makes it fruitful, so that 
 what is a punishment to others is none to them?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 It is threatened that <I>if the family of Egypt go not up, that have no 
 rain,</I> yet God will find out a way to meet with them, for there 
 shall be, in effect, the same plague wherewith other nations are 
 smitten for their neglect. God can, and often did, restrain the
 overflowing of the river, which was equivalent to the shutting up of 
 the clouds; or if the river did its part, and rose as high as it used 
 to do, God had other ways of bringing famine upon them, and destroying 
 the fruits of their ground, as he did by several of the ten plagues of 
 Egypt, so that <I>this</I> (that is, the same) shall be <I>the 
 punishment of Egypt</I> that is the punishment of other <I>nations</I> 
 who come not up to <I>keep the feast of tabernacles.</I> Note, Those 
 who think themselves least indebted to, and depending on, the mercy of 
 heaven, cannot <I>therefore</I> think themselves guarded against the 
 justice of Heaven. It does not follow that those who can live without 
 rain can therefore live without God; for not the heavens only, but all 
 other creatures, are that to us that God makes them to be, and no more; 
 nor can any man's way of living enable him to set light by the 
 judgments of God. This shall be the <I>punishment</I>--margin, <I>This 
 shall be the sin of Egypt, and the sin of all nations, that come not up 
 to keep the feast of tabernacles.</I> The same word signifies both 
 <I>sin</I> and the <I>punishment</I> of sin, so close and inseparable 
 is the connexion between them (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:7">Gen. iv. 7</A>),

 and sin is often its own punishment. Note, Omissions are sins, and we
 must come into judgment for them; those contract guilt that <I>go not 
 up to worship</I> at the times appointed, as they have opportunity; and 
 it is a sin that is its own <I>punishment,</I> for those who forsake 
 the duty forfeit the privilege of communion with God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That those who perform the duties of gospel-worship shall have 
 grace to adorn their profession by the duties of a gospel-conversation 
 too. This is promised 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>),

 and it is necessary to the completing of the beauty and happiness of 
 the church. In general, all shall be <I>holiness to the Lord.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The name and character of holiness shall not be so confined as 
 formerly. <I>Holiness to the Lord</I> had been written only upon the 
 high priest's forehead, but now it shall not be so appropriated. All 
 Christians shall be <I>living temples,</I> and <I>spiritual 
 priests,</I> dedicated to the honour of God and employed in his 
 service.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Real holiness shall be more diffused than it had been, because there 
 shall be more powerful means of sanctification, more excellent rules, 
 more cogent arguments, and brighter patterns of holiness, and because 
 there shall be a more plentiful effusion of the Spirit of holiness and 
 sanctification, after Christ's ascension than ever before.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) There shall be holiness introduced into common things; and those 
 things shall be devoted to God that seemed very foreign. 

 [1.] The furniture of their horses shall be consecrated to God. 
 "<I>Upon the bells of the horses</I> shall be engraven <I>Holiness to 
 the Lord,</I> or upon the <I>bridles</I> of the horses (so the margin) 
 or the <I>trappings.</I> The horses used in war shall no longer be used 
 against God and his people, as they have been, but for him and them.
 Even their wars shall be holy wars, their troopers serving under God's 
 banner. Their great men, who ride in state with a pompous retinue, 
 shall reckon it their greatest ornament to honour God with their 
 honours. <I>Holiness to the Lord</I> shall be written on the harness of 
 their chariot-horses, as great men have sometimes their coat of arms 
 with their motto painted on their coaches; every gentleman shall take 
 the high priest's motto for his, and glory in it, and make it a memento 
 to himself not to do any thing unworthy of it. Travellers shall have it 
 upon their bridles, with which they guide their horses, as those who 
 desire always to be put in mind of it, by having it continually before 
 them, and to guide themselves in all their motions by this rule. The 
 <I>bells of the horses,</I> which are designed to quicken them in their 
 journey and to give notice of their approach, shall have <I>Holiness to 
 the Lord</I> upon them," to signify that this is that which we ought to 
 be influenced by ourselves, and make profession of to others, wherever 
 we go.

 [2.] The furniture of their houses too shall be consecrated to God, to 
 be employed in his service. <I>First,</I> The furniture of the priests' 
 houses, or apartments adjoining to the house of the Lord. The common 
 drinking cups they used shall be <I>like the bowls before the 
 altar,</I> that were used either to receive the blood of the sacrifices 
 or to present the wine and oil in, which were for the 
 <I>drink-offerings.</I> The vessels which they used for their own 
 tables shall be used in such a religious manner, with such sobriety and 
 temperance, such devotedness to the glory of God, and such a mixture of 
 pious thoughts and expressions, that their meals shall look like 
 sacrifices; they shall eat and drink, not to themselves, but to him 
 that spreads their tables and fills their cups. And thus, in ministers' 
 families especially, should common actions be done after a godly sort, 
 however they are done in other families. <I>Secondly,</I> The furniture 
 of other houses, those of the common people: "<I>Every pot in Jerusalem 
 and in Judah shall be holiness to the Lord.</I> The pots in which they 
 boil their meat, the cups out of which they drink their wine 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+35:5">Jer. xxxv. 5</A>),

 in these God's good creatures shall never be abused to excess, nor that
 made the food and fuel of lust which should be oil to the wheels of 
 obedience," as had formerly been, when <I>all tables were full of vomit 
 and filthiness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:8">Isa. xxviii. 8</A>.

 "What they eat and drink out of these shall nourish their bodies for
 the service of God; and out of these they shall give liberally for the 
 relief of the poor;" then are they <I>Holiness to the Lord,</I> as the 
 merchandise and the hire of the converted Tyrians are said to be

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:18">Isa. xxiii. 18</A>);

 for both in our gettings and in our spendings we must have an eye to
 the will of God as our rule and the glory of God as our end. 
 <I>Thirdly,</I> When there shall be such an abundance of real holiness 
 people shall not be nice and curious about ceremonial holiness: 
 "<I>Those that sacrifice shall come and take</I> of these common 
 vessels, <I>and seethe</I> their sacrifices <I>therein,</I> making no 
 distinction between them and the <I>bowls before the altar.</I>" In 
 gospel-times the true worshippers shall worship God <I>in spirit and in 
 truth,</I> and <I>neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:21">John iv. 21</A>.

 One place shall be as acceptable to God as another (<I>I will that men
 pray every where</I>); and one vessel shall be as acceptable as 
 another. Little regard shall be had to the circumstance, provided there 
 be nothing indecent or disorderly, while the substance is religiously 
 preserved and adhered to. Some think it intimates that there should be 
 greater numbers of sacrifices offered than the vessels of the sanctuary 
 would serve for; but, rather than any should be turned back or 
 deferred, they shall make no difficulty at all of using common vessels,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) There shall be no unholiness introduced into their sacred things, 
 to corrupt them: <I>In that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in 
 the house of the Lord of hosts.</I> Some read it, There shall be no 
 more <I>the merchant,</I> for so a Canaanite sometimes signifies; and 
 they think it was fulfilled when Christ once and again drove the buyers 
 and sellers out of the temple. Or though those that were Canaanites, 
 strangers and foreigners, shall be brought into the house of the Lord,
 yet they shall cease to be Canaanites; they shall have nothing of the 
 spirit or disposition of Canaanites in them. Or it intimates that 
 though in gospel-times people should grow indifferent as to holy 
 vessels, yet they should be very strict in church-discipline, and 
 careful not to admit the profane to special ordinances, but to separate 
 between the precious and the vile, between Israelites and Canaanites. 
 Yet this will not have its full accomplishment short of the heavenly 
 Jerusalem, that <I>house of the Lord of hosts,</I> into which <I>no 
 unclean thing shall enter;</I> for at the end of time, and not before, 
 Christ shall gather out of his kingdom every thing that offends, and
 the tares and wheat shall be perfectly and eternally separated.</P>
