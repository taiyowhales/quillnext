 In this chapter the prophet goes on to show, 

 I. What great things God would do for his church and people, which
 should now shortly be accomplished in the deliverance of Jerusalem from
 Sennacherib and the destruction of the Assyrian army; but it is
 expressed generally, for the encouragement of the church in after ages,
 with reference to the power and prevalency of her enemies. 

 1. That proud oppressors should be reckoned with, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:1">ver. 1</A>.

 2. That care should be taken of the church, as of God's vineyard, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:2,3">ver. 2, 3</A>.

 3. That God would let fall his controversy with the people, upon their
 return to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:4,5">ver. 4, 5</A>.

 4. That he would greatly multiply and increase them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:6">ver. 6</A>.

 5. That, as to their afflictions, the property of them should be
 altered 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:7">ver. 7</A>),

 they should be mitigated and moderated

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:8">ver. 8</A>),

 and sanctified,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:9">ver. 9</A>.

 6. That though the church might be laid waste, and made desolate, for a 
 time 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:10,11">ver. 10, 11</A>),

 yet it should be restored, and the scattered members should be gathered
 together again,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:12,13">ver. 12, 13</A>.

 All this is applicable to the grace of the gospel, and God's promises 
 to, and providences concerning, the Christian church, and such as 
 belong to it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  In that day the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> with his sore and great and strong sword

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet is here singing of judgment and mercy,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Of judgment upon the enemies of God's church 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 <I>tribulation to those that trouble it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+1:6">2 Thess. i. 6</A>.

 When the Lord <I>comes out of his place, to punish the inhabitants of
 the earth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:21"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 21</A>),

 he will be sure to punish <I>leviathan,</I> the <I>dragon that is in
 the sea,</I> every proud oppressing tyrant, that is the terror of the 
 mighty, and, like the leviathan, is <I>so fierce that none dares stir 
 him up,</I> and <I>his heart as hard as a stone,</I> and <I>when he 
 raises up himself the mighty are afraid,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:10,24,25">Job xli. 10, 24, 25</A>.

 The church has many enemies, but commonly some one that is more
 formidable than the rest. So Sennacherib was in his day, and 
 Nebuchadnezzar in his, and Antiochus in his; so Pharaoh had been 
 formerly, and is called <I>leviathan</I> and <I>the dragon,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:9,Ps+74:13,14,Eze+29:3"><I>ch.</I> li. 9; Ps. lxxiv. 13, 14; Ezek. xxix. 3</A>.

 The New-Testament church has had its leviathans; we read of a great red
 dragon ready to devour it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:3">Rev. xii. 3</A>.

 Those malignant persecuting powers are here compared to the leviathan
 for bulk, and strength, and the mighty bustle they make in the 
 world,--to dragons for their rage and fury,--to serpents, <I>piercing 
 serpents,</I> penetrating in their counsels, quick in their motions, 
 and which, if they once get in their head, will soon wind in their 
 whole body,--<I>crossing like a bar</I> (so the margin), standing in 
 the way of all their neighbours and obstructing them,--to <I>crooked 
 serpents,</I> subtle and insinuating, but perverse and mischievous.
 Great and mighty princes, if they oppose the people of God, are in 
 God's account as dragons and serpents, the plagues of mankind; and the 
 Lord will punish them in due time. They are too big for men to deal 
 with and call to an account, and therefore the great God will take the 
 matter into his own hands. He has a <I>sore, and great, and strong 
 sword,</I> wherewith to do execution upon them when the <I>measure of 
 their iniquity is full</I> and their <I>day has come to fall.</I> It is 
 emphatically expressed in the original: <I>The Lord with his sword, 
 that cruel one, and that great one, and that strong one, shall 
 punish</I> this unwieldy, this unruly criminal; and it shall be capital 
 punishment: <I>He shall slay the dragon that is in the sea;</I> for the 
 wages of his sin is death. This shall not only be a prevention of his 
 doing further mischief, as the slaying of a wild beast, but a just 
 punishment for the mischief he has done, as the putting of a traitor or 
 rebel to death. God has a strong sword for the doing of this, variety 
 of judgments sufficient to humble the proudest and break the most 
 powerful of his enemies; and he will do it when the day of execution 
 comes: <I>In that day</I> he will punish, his day which is coming,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:13">Ps. xxxvii. 13</A>.

 This is applicable to the spiritual victories obtained by our Lord
 Jesus over the powers of darkness. He not only disarmed, spoiled, and 
 cast out, the prince of this world, but with his strong sword, the 
 virtue of his death and the preaching of his gospel, he does and will 
 <I>destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil,</I> 
 that great leviathan, that old serpent, the dragon. He shall be bound, 
 that he may not deceive the nations, and that is a punishment to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:2,3">Rev. xx. 2, 3</A>);

 and at length, for deceiving the nations, he shall be <I>cast into the 
 lake of fire,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:10">Rev. xx. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Of mercy to the church. In that same day, when God is punishing the 
 leviathan, let the church and all her friends be easy and cheerful; let 
 those that attend her sing to her for her comfort, sing her asleep with 
 these assurances; let it be sung in her assemblies,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That she is God's vineyard, and is under his particular care, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 She is, in God's eye, <I>a vineyard of red wine.</I> The world is as a
 fruitless worthless wilderness; but the church is enclosed as a 
 vineyard, a peculiar place, and of value, that has great care taken of 
 it and great pains taken with it, and from which precious fruits are 
 gathered, wherewith they honour God and man. It is a vineyard of <I>red 
 wine,</I> yielding the best and choicest grapes, intimating the 
 reformation of the church, that it now brings forth good fruit unto 
 God, whereas before it brought forth fruit to itself, or brought forth 
 wild grapes,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:4"><I>ch.</I> v. 4</A>.

 Now God takes care, 

 (1.) Of the safety of this vineyard: <I>I the Lord do keep it.</I> He
 speaks this as glorying in it that he is, and has undertaken to be, the 
 keeper of Israel. Those that bring forth fruit to God are and shall be 
 always under his protection. He speaks this as assuring us that they 
 shall be so: <I>I the Lord,</I> that can do every thing, but cannot lie 
 nor deceive, <I>I do keep it; lest any hurt it, I will keep it night 
 and day.</I> God's vineyard in this world lies much exposed to injury; 
 there are many that would hurt it, would tread it down and lay it waste

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:13">Ps. lxxx. 13</A>);

 but God will suffer no real hurt or damage to be done it, but what he
 will bring good out of. He will keep it constantly, night and day, and 
 not without need, for the enemies are restless in their designs and 
 attempts against it, and, both night and day, seek an opportunity to do 
 it a mischief. God will keep it in the night of affliction and 
 persecution, and in the day of peace and prosperity, the temptations of 
 which are no less dangerous. God's people shall be preserved, not only 
 from the <I>pestilence that walketh in darkness,</I> but from the 
 <I>destruction that wasteth at noon-day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:6">Ps. xci. 6</A>.

 This vineyard shall be well fenced.

 (2.) Of the fruitfulness of this vineyard: <I>I will water it every
 moment,</I> and yet it shall not be overwatered. The still and silent
 dews of God's grace and blessing shall continually descend upon it, 
 that it may bring forth much fruit. We need the constant and continual 
 waterings of the divine grace; for, if that be at any time withdrawn, 
 we wither, and come to nothing. God waters his vineyard by the ministry 
 of the word by his servants the prophets, whose doctrine shall drop as 
 the dew. Paul plants, and Apollos waters, but God gives the increase; 
 for without him the watchman wakes and the husbandman waters in 
 vain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That, though sometimes he contends with his people, yet, upon their 
 submission, he will be reconciled to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 <I>Fury is not in him</I> towards his vineyard; though he meets with
 many things in it that are offensive to him, yet he does not seek 
 advantages against it, nor is extreme to mark what is amiss in it. It 
 is true if he find in it briers and thorns instead of vines, and they 
 be set in battle against him (as indeed that in the vineyard which is 
 not for him is against him), he will tread them down and burn them; but 
 otherwise, "If I am angry with my people, they know what course to 
 take; let them humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and so 
 <I>take hold of my strength</I> with a sincere desire to make their 
 peace with me, and I will soon be reconciled to them, and all shall be 
 well." God sees the sins of his people and is displeased with them; 
 but, upon their repentance, he turns away his wrath. This may very well 
 be construed as a summary of the doctrine of the gospel, with which the 
 church is to be watered every moment.

 (1.) Here is a quarrel supposed between God and man; for here is a
 battle fought, and peace to be made. It is an old quarrel, ever since 
 sin first entered. It is, on God's part, a righteous quarrel, but, on 
 man's part, most unrighteous.

 (2.) Here is a gracious invitation given us to make up this quarrel,
 and to get these matters in variance accommodated: "Let him that is 
 desirous to be at peace with God take hold of his strength, of his 
 strong arm, which is lifted up against the sinner to strike him dead; 
 and let him by supplication keep back the stroke. Let him wrestle with 
 me, as Jacob did, resolving not to let me go without a blessing; and he 
 shall be <I>Israel--a prince with God.</I>" Pardoning mercy is called 
 the power of our Lord; let him take hold of that. Christ is the <I>arm 
 of the Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:1"><I>ch.</I> liii. 1</A>.

 Christ <I>crucified is the power of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:24">1 Cor. i. 24</A>);

 let him by a lively faith take hold of him, as a man that is sinking
 catches hold of a bough, or cord, or plank, that is within his reach, 
 or as the malefactor took hold of the horns of the altar, believing 
 that there is no other name by which he can be saved, by which he can 
 be reconciled.

 (3.) Here is a threefold cord of arguments to persuade us to do this.
 
 [1.] Time and space are given us to do it in; for <I>fury is not in
 God;</I> he does not carry it towards us as great men carry it towards 
 their inferiors, when the one is in a fault and the other in a fury. 
 Men in a fury will not take time for consideration; it is, with them, 
 but a word and a blow. Furious men are soon angry, and implacable when 
 they are angry; a little thing provokes them, and no little thing will 
 pacify them. But it is not so with God; he considers our frame, is slow 
 to anger, does not stir up all his wrath, nor always chide. 

 [2.] It is in vain to think of contesting with him. If we persist in
 our quarrel with him, and think to make our part good, it is but like 
 setting briers and thorns before a consuming fire, which will be so far 
 from giving check to the progress of it that they will but make it burn 
 the more outrageously. We are not an equal match for Omnipotence. 
 <I>Woe unto him</I> therefore <I>that strives with his Maker!</I> He 
 knows not the power of his anger.

 [3.] This is the only way, and it is a sure way, to reconciliation:
 "Let him take this course to make peace with me, <I>and he shall make 
 peace;</I> and thereby good, all good, shall come unto him." God is 
 willing to be reconciled to us if we be but willing to be reconciled to 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That the church of God in the world shall be a growing body, and 
 come at length to be a great body 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>In times to come</I> (so some read it), <I>in after-times,</I> when
 these calamities are overpast, or in the days of the gospel, the latter 
 days, <I>he shall cause Jacob to take root,</I> deeper root than ever 
 yet; for the gospel church shall be more firmly fixed than ever the 
 Jewish church was, and shall spread further. Or, <I>He shall cause 
 those of Jacob</I> that come back out of their captivity, or (as we 
 read it) <I>those that come of Jacob, to take root downward, and bear 
 fruit upward,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:31"><I>ch.</I> xxxvii. 31</A>.
 
 They shall be established in a prosperous state, and then they shall
 <I>blossom and bud,</I> and give hopeful prospects of a great increase; 
 and so it shall prove, for <I>they shall fill the face of the world 
 with fruit.</I> Many shall be brought into the church, proselytes shall 
 be numerous, some out of all the nations about that shall be to the God 
 of Israel for a name and a praise; and the converts shall be fruitful 
 in the fruits of righteousness. The preaching of the gospel <I>brought 
 forth fruit in all the world</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:6">Col. i. 6</A>),

 fruit that remains,

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is the prophet again singing of mercy and judgment, not, as 
 before, judgment to the enemies and mercy to the church, but judgment 
 to the church and mercy mixed with that judgment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is judgment threatened even to Jacob and Israel. <I>They shall 
 blossom and bud</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),
 
 but, 

 1. They shall be <I>smitten</I> and <I>slain</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 some of them shall. If God find any thing amiss among them, he will lay
 them under the tokens of his displeasure for it. Judgment shall begin 
 at the house of God, and those whom God has known of all the families 
 of the earth he will punish in the first place. 

 2. Jerusalem, their <I>defenced city, shall be desolate,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 "God having tried a variety of methods with them for their reformation,
 which, as to many, have proved ineffectual, he will for a time lay 
 their country waste," which was accomplished when Jerusalem was 
 destroyed by the Chaldeans; then that <I>habitation</I> was for a long 
 time <I>forsaken.</I> If less judgments do not do the work, God will 
 send greater; for <I>when he judges he will overcome.</I> Jerusalem had 
 been a defenced city, not so much by art or nature as by grace and the 
 divine protection; but, when God was provoked to withdraw, her defence 
 departed from her, and then she was left like a wilderness. "And in the 
 pleasant gardens of Jerusalem cattle shall feed, shall lie down there, 
 and there shall be none to disturb them or drive them away; there they 
 shall be <I>levant and couchant,</I> and they shall eat the tender 
 branches of the fruit-trees," which perhaps further signifies that the 
 people should become an easy prey to their enemies. "<I>When the boughs 
 thereof are withered</I> as they grow upon the tree, being blasted by 
 winds and frosts and not pruned, <I>they shall be broken off</I> for 
 fuel, and <I>the women</I> and children shall <I>come and set them on 
 fire.</I> There shall be a total destruction, for the very trees shall 
 be destroyed." And this is a figure of the deplorable state of the 
 vineyard

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)

 when it <I>brought forth wild grapes</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:2"><I>ch.</I> v. 2</A>);

 and our Saviour seems to refer to this when he says of the branches of
 the vine which <I>abide not in him</I> that they are <I>cast forth and 
 withered, and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they 
 are burned</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:6">John xv. 6</A>),

 which was in a particular manner fulfilled in the unbelieving Jews. The
 similitude is explained in the following words, <I>It is a people of no 
 understanding,</I> brutish and sottish, and destitute of the knowledge 
 of God, and that have no relish or savour of divine things, like a 
 withered branch that has no sap in it; and this is at the bottom of all 
 those sins for which God left them desolate, their idolatry first and 
 afterwards their infidelity. Wicked people, however in other things 
 they may be wits and politicians, in their greatest concerns are of no 
 understanding; and their ignorance, being wilful, shall not only not be 
 their excuse, but it shall be the ground of their condemnation; for 
 therefore <I>he that made them,</I> that gave them their being, <I>will 
 not have mercy on them,</I> nor save them from the ruin they bring upon 
 themselves; and <I>he that formed them</I> into a people, formed them 
 for himself, to show forth his praise, seeing they do not answer the 
 end of their formation, but hate to be reformed, to be new-formed, will 
 reject them, and <I>show them no favour;</I> and then they are undone: 
 for, if he that made us by his power do not make us happy in his 
 favour, we had better never have been made. Sinners flatter themselves 
 with hopes of impunity, at least that they shall not be dealt with so 
 severely as their ministers tell them, because God is merciful and 
 because he is their Maker. But here we see how weak and insufficient 
 those pleas will be; for, if they be of no understanding, he that made 
 them, though he made them, and hates nothing that he has made, and 
 though he has mercy in store for those who so far understand their 
 interests as to apply to him for it, yet on them he will have no mercy, 
 and will show them no favour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is a great deal of mercy mixed with this judgment; for there 
 are good people mixed with those that are corrupt and degenerate, <I>a 
 remnant according to the election of grace,</I> on whom God will have 
 mercy and to whom he will show favour: and these promises seem to point 
 at all the calamities of the church, for which God would graciously 
 provide these allays.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Though they shall be smitten and slain, yet not to that degree, and 
 in that manner, in which their enemies shall be smitten and slain, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 God has <I>smitten Jacob,</I> and he is slain. Many of those <I>that
 understand among the people shall fall by the sword and by flame many 
 days,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:33">Dan. xi. 33</A>.

 But it shall not be as those are smitten and slain,

 (1.) Who smote him formerly, who were the rod of God's anger and the
 staff in his hand, which he made us of for the correction of his 
 people, and to whose turn it shall come to be reckoned with even for 
 that: the child is spared, but the rod is burnt.

 (2.) Who shall afterwards be slain by him, when he shall get the
 dominion, and repay them in their own coin, or slain for his sake in 
 the pleading of his cause. God's people and God's enemies are here 
 represented, 

 [1.] As struggling with each other; so the seed of the woman and the
 seed of the serpent have been, are, and will be. In this contest there 
 are slain on both sides. God makes use of wicked men, not only to 
 smite, but to slay his people; for they are his sword, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:13">Ps. xvii. 13</A>.

 But, when the cup of trembling comes to be put into their hand, it will
 be much worse with them than ever it was with God's people in their 
 greatest straits. The seed of the woman has only his heel bruised, but 
 the serpent has his head crushed and broken. Note, Though God's 
 persecuted people may be great losers, and great sufferers, for a 
 while, yet those that oppress them will prove to be greater losers and 
 greater sufferers at last, here or hereafter; for God will render 
 double to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:6">Rev. xviii. 6</A>.

 [2.] As sharing together in the calamities of this present time. They
 are both smitten, both slain, and both by the hand of God; for there is 
 <I>one event to the righteous and to the wicked.</I> But is Jacob 
 smitten as his enemies are? No, by no means; to him the property is 
 altered, and it becomes quite another thing. Note, However it may seem
 to us, there is really a vast difference between the afflictions and 
 deaths of good people and the afflictions and deaths of wicked 
 people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Though God will debate with them, yet it shall be in measure, and 
 the affliction shall be mitigated, moderated, and proportioned to their 
 strength, not to their deserts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 He will deal out afflictions to them as the wise physician prescribes
 medicines to his patients, just such a quantity of each ingredient, or 
 orders how much blood shall be taken when a vein is opened: thus God 
 orders the troubles of his people, not <I>suffering them to be tempted 
 above what they are able,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:13">1 Cor. x. 13</A>.

 He measures out their afflictions by a little at a time, that they may
 not be pressed above measure; for he knows their frame, and corrects in 
 judgment, and does not stir up all his wrath. When the affliction is
 shooting forth, when he is sending it out and giving it its commission, 
 then he debates in measure, and not in extremity. He considers what we 
 can bear when he begins to correct; and when he proceeds in his 
 controversy, so that it is the <I>day of his east-wind,</I> which is 
 not only blustering and noisy, but blasting and noxious, yet he stays 
 his rough wind, checks it, and sets bounds to it, does not suffer it to 
 blow so hard as was feared; when he is winnowing his corn, it is with a 
 gentle gale, that shall only blow away the chaff, but not the good 
 corn. God has the winds at his command, and every affliction under his 
 check. <I>Hitherto it shall go, but no further.</I> Let us not despair 
 when things are at the worst; be the winds ever so rough, ever so high, 
 God can say unto them, <I>Peace, be still.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Though God will afflict them, yet he will make their afflictions to 
 work for the good of their souls, and correct them as the father does 
 the child, to drive out the foolishness that is bound up in their 
 hearts 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged.</I> This is
 the design of the affliction, to this it is adapted as a proper means, 
 and, by the grace of God working with it, it shall have this blessed 
 effect. It shall mortify the habits of sin; by this those defilements 
 of the soul shall be purged away. It shall break them off from the 
 practice of sin: <I>This is all the fruit,</I> this is it that God 
 intends, this is all the harm it will do them, <I>to take away their 
 sin,</I> than which they could not have a greater kindness done them, 
 though it be at the expense of an affliction. Therefore, because the 
 affliction is mitigated and moderated, and the rough wind stayed, 
 therefore we may conclude that he designs their reformation, not their 
 destruction; and, because he deals thus gently with us, we should 
 therefore study to answer his ends in afflicting us. The particular sin 
 which the affliction was intended to cure them of was the sin of 
 idolatry, the sin which did most easily beset that people and to which 
 they were strangely addicted. <I>Ephraim is joined to idols.</I> But by 
 the captivity in Babylon they were not only weaned from this sin, but 
 set against it. <I>Ephraim shall say, What have I do to any more with 
 idols?</I> Jacob has his sin taken away, his beloved sin, <I>when he 
 makes all the stones of the altar,</I> of his idolatrous altar, the 
 stones of which were precious and sacred to him, <I>as chalk-stones 
 that are beaten asunder;</I> he not only has them in contempt, and 
 values them no more than chalk-stones, but he conceives an indignation 
 at them, and, in a holy revenge, beats them asunder as easily as 
 chalk-stones are broken to pieces. <I>The groves and the images shall 
 not</I> stand before this penitent, but they shall be thrown down too, 
 never to be set up again. This was according to the law for the 
 demolishing and destroying of all the monuments of idolatry

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:5">Deut. vii. 5</A>);
 
 and according to this promise, since the captivity in Babylon, no
 people in the world have such a rooted aversion to idols and idolatry 
 as the people of the Jews. Note, The design of affliction is to 
 separate between us and sin, especially that which has been <I>our own 
 iniquity;</I> and then it appears that the affliction has done us good 
 when we keep at a distance from the occasions of sin, and use all 
 needful precaution that we may not only not relapse into it, but not so 
 much as be tempted to it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:67">Ps. cxix. 67</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Though Jerusalem shall be desolate and forsaken for a time, yet 
 there will come a day when its scattered friends shall resort to it 
 again out of all the countries whither they were dispersed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>);

 though the body of the nation is abandoned as a people of no
 understanding, yet those that are indeed children of Israel shall be 
 gathered together again, as the sheep of the flock when the shepherds 
 that scattered them are reckoned with, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:10-19">Ezek. xxxiv. 10-19</A>.

 Now observe concerning these scattered Israelites,

 (1.) Whence they shall be fetched: <I>The Lord shall beat them off</I>
 as fruit from the tree, or beat them out as corn out of the ear. He 
 shall find them out, and separate them from those among whom they 
 dwelt, and with whom they seemed to be incorporated, <I>from the 
 channel of the river</I> Euphrates north-east, <I>unto</I> Nile, <I>the 
 stream of Egypt,</I> which lay south-west--those that were driven into 
 the land of Assyria, and were captives there in the land of their 
 enemies, where they were ready to perish for want of necessaries, and 
 ready to despair of deliverance--and those that were <I>outcasts in the 
 land of Egypt,</I> whither many of those that were left behind, after 
 the captivity in Babylon, went, contrary to God's express command

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+43:6,7">Jer. xliii. 6, 7</A>),

 and there lived as outcasts: God has mercy in store for them all, and
 will make it to appear that, though they are cast out, they are not 
 cast off.

 (2.) In what manner they shall be brought back: "<I>You shall be 
 gathered one by one,</I> not in multitudes, not in troops forcing your 
 way; but silently, and as it were by stealth, dropping in, first one, 
 and then another." This intimates that the remnant that shall be saved 
 consists but of few, and those saved with difficulty, and so as by 
 fire, scarcely saved; they shall not come for company, but as God shall 
 stir up every man's spirit.

 (3.) By what means they shall be gathered together: <I>The great 
 trumpet shall be blown, and</I> then <I>they shall come.</I> Cyrus's 
 proclamation of liberty to the captives is this great trumpet, which 
 awakened the Jews that were asleep in their thraldom to bestir 
 themselves; it was like the sounding of the jubilee-trumpet, which 
 published the year of release. This is applicable both to the preaching 
 of the gospel, by which sinners are gathered in to the grace of God, 
 such as were outcasts and ready to perish (those that were afar off are 
 made nigh; the gospel proclaims the acceptable year of the Lord), and 
 also to the archangel's trumpet at the last day, by which saints shall 
 be gathered to the glory of God, that lay as outcasts in their graves.

 (4.) For what end they shall be gathered together: <I>To worship the 
 Lord in the holy mount at Jerusalem.</I> When the captives rallied 
 again, and returned to their own land, the chief thing they had their 
 eye upon, and the first thing they applied themselves to, was the 
 worship of God. The holy temple was in ruins, but they had the holy 
 mount, <I>the place of the altar,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:4">Gen. xiii. 4</A>.

 Liberty to worship God is the most valuable and desirable liberty; and,
 after restraints and dispersions, a free access to his house should be 
 more welcome to us than a free access to our own houses. Those that are 
 gathered by the sounding of the gospel trumpet are brought in to 
 worship God and added to the church; and the great trumpet of all will 
 gather the saints together, <I>to serve God day and night in his 
 temple.</I></P>
