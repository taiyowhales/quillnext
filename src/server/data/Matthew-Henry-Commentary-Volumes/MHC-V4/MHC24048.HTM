 Moab is next set to the bar before Jeremiah the prophet, whom God has 
 constituted judge over nations and kingdoms, from his mouth to receive 
 its doom. Isaiah's predictions concerning Moab had had their
 accomplishment (we had the predictions

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+15:1-16:14">Isa. xv. and xvi.</A>

 and the like

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:1">Amos ii. 1</A>),

 and they were fulfilled when the Assyrians, under Salmanassar, invaded
 and distressed Moab. But this is a prophecy of the desolations of Moab 
 by the Chaldeans, which were accomplished under Nebuzaradan, about five 
 years after he had destroyed Jerusalem. Here is,

 I. The destruction foretold, that it should be great and general,
 should extend itself to all parts of the country 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:1-6,8">ver. 1-6, 8</A>,

 and again

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:21-25,34">ver. 21-25, 34</A>),

 that spoilers should come upon them and force some to flee 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:9">ver. 9</A>),

 should carry many into captivity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:12,46">ver. 12, 46</A>),

 that the enemy should come shortly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:16">ver. 16</A>),

 come swiftly and surprise them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:40,41">ver. 40, 41</A>),

 that he should make thorough work 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:10">ver. 10</A>)

 and lay the country quite waste, though it was very strong 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:14,15">ver. 14, 15</A>),

 that there should be no escaping 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:42,45">ver. 42, 45</A>),

 that this should force them to quit their idols 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:13,35">ver. 13, 35</A>)

 and put an end to all their joy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:33,34">ver. 33, 34</A>),

 that their neighbours shall lament them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:17-19">ver. 17-19</A>)

 and the prophet himself does

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:31,36">ver. 31, 36</A>,

 &c.).

 II. The causes of this destruction assigned; it was sin that brought
 this ruin upon them, their pride, and security, and carnal confidence

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:7,11,14,29">ver. 7, 11, 14, 29</A>),

 and their contempt of and enmity to God and his people,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:26,27,30">ver. 26, 27, 30</A>.

 III. A promise of the restoration of Moab,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Against Moab thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, the God of Israel;
 Woe unto Nebo! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim is confounded <I>and</I>
 taken: Misgab is confounded and dismayed.
 &nbsp; 2  <I>There shall be</I> no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have
 devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from <I>being</I>
 a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall
 pursue thee.
 &nbsp; 3  A voice of crying <I>shall be</I> from Horonaim, spoiling and
 great destruction.
 &nbsp; 4  Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be
 heard.
 &nbsp; 5  For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up;
 for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of
 destruction.
 &nbsp; 6  Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the
 wilderness.
 &nbsp; 7  For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy
 treasures, thou shalt also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth
 into captivity <I>with</I> his priests and his princes together.
 &nbsp; 8  And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall
 escape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be
 destroyed, as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath spoken.
 &nbsp; 9  Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the
 cities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein.
 &nbsp; 10  Cursed <I>be</I> he that doeth the work of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> deceitfully,
 and cursed <I>be</I> he that keepeth back his sword from blood.
 &nbsp; 11  Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled
 on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel,
 neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained
 in him, and his scent is not changed.
 &nbsp; 12  Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that I
 will send unto him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and
 shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles.
 &nbsp; 13  And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel
 was ashamed of Beth-el their confidence.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may observe in these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The author of Moab's destruction; it is <I>the Lord of hosts,</I> 
 that has armies, all armies, at his command, and <I>the God of 
 Israel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 who will herein plead the cause of his Israel against a people that 
 have always been vexatious to them, and will punish them now for the 
 injuries done to Israel of old, though Israel was forbidden to meddle 
 with them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:9">Deut. ii. 9</A>),

 therefore the destruction of Moab is called <I>the work of the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 for it is he that pleads for Israel; and his work will exactly agree 
 with his word, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The instruments of it: <I>Spoilers shall come</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 shall come with a sword, a sword that shall <I>pursue them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 "<I>I will send unto him wanderers,</I> such as come from afar, as if 
 they were vagrants, or had missed their way, but they shall <I>cause 
 him to wander;</I> they seem as wanderers themselves, but they shall 
 make the Moabites to be really wanderers, some to flee and others to be 
 carried into captivity." These destroyers stir up themselves to do 
 execution; they <I>have devised evil against Heshbon,</I> one of the 
 principal cities of Moab, and they aim at no less than the ruin of the 
 kingdom: <I>Come, and let us cut it off from being a nation</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);
 
 nothing less will serve the turn of the invaders; they come, not to 
 plunder it, but to ruin it. The prophet, in God's name, engages them to 
 make thorough work of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>Cursed be he that does the work of the Lord deceitfully,</I> this 
 bloody work, this destroying work; though it goes against the grain 
 with men of compassion, yet it is <I>the work of the Lord,</I> and must 
 not be done by the halves. The Chaldeans have it in charge, by a secret 
 instinct (says Mr. Gataker), to destroy the Moabites, and therefore 
 they must not spare, must not, out of foolish pity, <I>keep back their 
 sword from blood;</I> they would thereby bring a sword, and a curse 
 with it, upon themselves, as Saul did by sparing the Amalekites and 
 Ahab by letting Benhadad go. <I>Thy life shall go for his life.</I> To
 this work is applied that general rule given to all that are employed 
 in any service for God, <I>Cursed by he that does the work of the Lord 
 deceitfully</I> or negligently, that pretends to do it, but does it not 
 to purpose, makes a show of serving God's glory, but is really serving 
 his own ends and carries on the work of the Lord no further than will 
 suit his own purposes, or that is slothful in business for God and 
 takes neither care nor pains to do it as it should be done, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:14">Mal. i. 14</A>.
 
 Let not such deceive themselves, for God will not thus be mocked.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The woeful instances and effects of this destruction. The cities 
 shall be laid in ruins; they shall be <I>spoiled</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)

 and cut down 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 they shall be <I>desolate</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 <I>without any to dwell therein;</I> there shall be no houses to dwell 
 in, or no people to dwell in them, or no safety and ease to those that 
 would dwell in them. <I>Every city shall be spoiled and no city shall
 escape.</I> The strongest city shall not be able to secure itself 
 against the enemies' power, nor shall the finest city be able to 
 recommend itself to the enemies' pity and favour. The <I>country</I> 
 also shall be wasted, the <I>valley shall perish,</I> and the <I>plain 
 be destroyed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 The corn and the flocks, which used to cover the plains and make the 
 valleys rejoice, shall all be destroyed, eaten up, trodden down, or 
 carried off. The most sacred persons shall not escape: The <I>priests 
 and princes shall go together into captivity.</I> Nay, Chemosh, the god 
 they worship, who, they hope, will protect them, shall share with them 
 in the ruin; his temples shall be laid in ashes and his image carried 
 away with the rest of the spoil. Now the consequence of all this will
 be, 

 1. Great shame and confusion: <I>Kirjathaim is confounded,</I> and
 Misgah is so. They shall be ashamed of the mighty boasts they have
 sometimes made of their cities: <I>There shall be no more vaunting in 
 Moab concerning Heshbon</I> (so it might be read,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 they shall no more boast of the strength of that city when the evil 
 which is designed against it is brought upon it. Nor shall they any 
 more boast of their gods 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 they <I>shall be ashamed of Chemosh</I> (ashamed of all the prayers 
 they have made to and all the confidence they put in that dunghill 
 deity), <I>as Israel was ashamed of Beth-el,</I> of the golden calf 
 they had at Beth-el, which they confided in as their protector, but 
 were deceived in, for it was not able to save them from the Assyrians; 
 nor shall Chemosh be able to save the Moabites from the Chaldeans. 
 Note, Those that will not be convinced and made ashamed of the folly of 
 their idolatry by the word of God shall be convinced and made ashamed 
 of it by the judgments of God, when they shall find by woeful 
 experience the utter inability of the gods they have served to do them 
 any service. 

 2. There will be great sorrow; there is a <I>voice of crying</I> heard

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 and the cry is nothing but <I>spoiling and great destruction.</I> Alas! 
 alas! <I>Moab is destroyed,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 The great ones having quitted the cities to shift for their own safety, 
 even the <I>little ones have caused a cry to be heard,</I> the meaner 
 sort of people, or the little children, the innocent harmless ones, 
 whose cries at such a time are the most piteous. Go up to the hills, go 
 down to the valleys, and you meet with <I>continual weeping (weeping 
 with weeping</I>); all are in tears; you meet none with dry eyes. Even 
 the enemies have heard the cry, from whom it would have been policy to 
 conceal it, for they will be animated and encouraged by it; but it is 
 so great that it cannot be hid, 

 3. There will be great hurry; they will cry to one another, "Away,
 away! <I>flee; save your lives</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);
 
 shift for your own safety with all imaginable speed, though you escape 
 as bare and naked as the <I>heath,</I> or grig, or dry shrub, <I>in the 
 wilderness;</I> think not of carrying away any thing you have, for it 
 may cost you your life to attempt it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:16-18">Matt. xxiv. 16-18</A>.

 Take shelter, though it be in a barren wilderness, that you may have
 your lives for a prey. The danger will come suddenly and swiftly; and
 therefore <I>give wings unto Moab</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 that would be the greatest kindness you could do them; that is what 
 they will call for, <I>O that we had wings like a dove!</I> for unless 
 they have wings, and can fly, there will be no escaping."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The sins for which God will now reckon with Moab, and which justify 
 God in these severe proceedings against them. 

 1. It is because they have been secure, and have trusted in their
 wealth and strength, <I>in their works</I> and <I>in their 
 treasures,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 They had taken a great deal of pains to fortify their cities and make 
 large works about them, and to fill their exchequer and private 
 coffers, so that they thought themselves in as good a posture for war 
 as any people could be and that none durst invade them, and therefore 
 set danger at defiance. They trusted <I>in the abundance of their
 riches and strengthened themselves in their wickedness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+52:7">Ps. lii. 7</A>.
 
 Now, for this reason, that they may have a sensible conviction of the
 vanity and folly of their carnal confidences, God will send an enemy 
 that will master their works and rifle their treasures. Note, We 
 forfeit the comfort of that creature which we repose that confidence in 
 which should be reposed in God only. The reed will break that is leaned 
 upon. 

 2. It is because they have not made a right improvement of the days of
 the peace and prosperity,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 (1.) They had been long undisturbed: <I>Moab has been at ease from his 
 youth.</I> It was an ancient kingdom before Israel was, and had enjoyed 
 great tranquillity, though a small country and surrounded with potent 
 neighbours. God's Israel were afflicted from their youth 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+129:1,2">Ps. cxxix. 1, 2</A>),

 but <I>Moab at ease from his youth.</I> He has <I>not been emptied from
 vessel to vessel,</I> has not known any troublesome weakening changes, 
 but is as wine kept on the lees, and not racked or drawn off, by which 
 it retains its strength and body. He has not been unsettled, nor any 
 way made uneasy; he has not <I>gone into captivity,</I> as Israel have 
 often done, and yet Moab is a wicked idolatrous nation, and one of the 
 confederates against <I>God's hidden ones,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:3,6">Ps. lxxxiii. 3, 6</A>.

 Note, There are many that persist in unrepented iniquity and yet enjoy
 uninterrupted prosperity.

 (2.) They had been as long corrupt and unreformed: He <I>has settled on
 his lees;</I> he has been secure and sensual in his prosperity, has 
 rested in it, and fetched all the strength and life of the soul from 
 it, as the wine from the lees. <I>His taste remained in him, and his
 scent is not changed;</I> he is still the same, as bad as ever he was. 
 Note, While bad people are as happy as they used to be in the world it 
 is no marvel if they are bad as they used to be. They have no changes 
 of their peace and prosperity, <I>therefore fear not God,</I> their 
 hearts and lives are unchanged,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  How say ye, We <I>are</I> mighty and strong men for the war?
 &nbsp; 15  Moab is spoiled, and gone up <I>out of</I> her cities, and his
 chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King,
 whose name <I>is</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts.
 &nbsp; 16  The calamity of Moab <I>is</I> near to come, and his affliction
 hasteth fast.
 &nbsp; 17  All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know
 his name, say, How is the strong staff broken, <I>and</I> the
 beautiful rod!
 &nbsp; 18  Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from <I>thy</I>
 glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon
 thee, <I>and</I> he shall destroy thy strong holds.
 &nbsp; 19  O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him
 that fleeth, and her that escapeth, <I>and</I> say, What is done?
 &nbsp; 20  Moab is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry;
 tell ye it in Arnon, that Moab is spoiled,
 &nbsp; 21  And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and
 upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath,
 &nbsp; 22  And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Beth-diblathaim,
 &nbsp; 23  And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Beth-gamul, and upon Beth-meon,
 &nbsp; 24  And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities
 of the land of Moab, far or near.
 &nbsp; 25  The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 26  Make ye him drunken: for he magnified <I>himself</I> against the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be
 in derision.
 &nbsp; 27  For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among
 thieves? for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for joy.
 &nbsp; 28  O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the
 rock, and be like the dove <I>that</I> maketh her nest in the sides of
 the hole's mouth.
 &nbsp; 29  We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his
 loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness
 of his heart.
 &nbsp; 30  I know his wrath, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; but <I>it shall</I> not <I>be</I>
 so; his lies shall not so effect <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 31  Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all
 Moab; <I>mine heart</I> shall mourn for the men of Kirheres.
 &nbsp; 32  O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of
 Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach <I>even</I> to the
 sea of Jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and
 upon thy vintage.
 &nbsp; 33  And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and
 from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to fail from the
 winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; <I>their</I> shouting
 <I>shall be</I> no shouting.
 &nbsp; 34  From the cry of Heshbon <I>even</I> unto Elealeh, <I>and even</I> unto
 Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar <I>even</I> unto
 Horonaim, <I>as</I> a heifer of three years old: for the waters also
 of Nimrim shall be desolate.
 &nbsp; 35  Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, him
 that offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to
 his gods.
 &nbsp; 36  Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and
 mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres:
 because the riches <I>that</I> he hath gotten are perished.
 &nbsp; 37  For every head <I>shall be</I> bald, and every beard clipped:
 upon all the hands <I>shall be</I> cuttings, and upon the loins
 sackcloth.
 &nbsp; 38  <I>There shall be</I> lamentation generally upon all the
 housetops of Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken
 Moab like a vessel wherein <I>is</I> no pleasure, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 39  They shall howl, <I>saying,</I> How is it broken down! how hath
 Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and
 a dismaying to all them about him.
 &nbsp; 40  For thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle,
 and shall spread his wings over Moab.
 &nbsp; 41  Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and
 the mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart
 of a woman in her pangs.
 &nbsp; 42  And Moab shall be destroyed from <I>being</I> a people, because
 he hath magnified <I>himself</I> against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 43  Fear, and the pit, and the snare, <I>shall be</I> upon thee, O
 inhabitant of Moab, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 44  He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he
 that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I
 will bring upon it, <I>even</I> upon Moab, the year of their
 visitation, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 45  They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of
 the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a
 flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of
 Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.
 &nbsp; 46  Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth:
 for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives.
 &nbsp; 47  Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter
 days, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>. Thus far <I>is</I> the judgment of Moab.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The destruction is here further prophesied of very largely and with a 
 great copiousness and variety of expression, and very pathetically and 
 in moving language, designed not only to awaken them by a national 
 repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, or by a personal 
 repentance and reformation to prepare for it, but to affect us with the 
 calamitous state of human life, which is liable to such lamentable 
 occurrences, and with the power of God's anger and the terror of his 
 judgments, when he comes forth to contend with a provoking people. In 
 reading this long roll of threatenings, and meditating on the terror of 
 them, it will be of more use to us to keep this in our eye, and to get 
 our hearts thereby possessed with a holy awe of God and of his wrath, 
 than to enquire critically into all the lively figures and metaphors 
 here used.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It is a surprising destruction, and very sudden, that is here 
 threatened. They were very secure, thought themselves <I>strong for 
 war</I> and able to deal with the most powerful enemy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 and yet the calamity is near, and he is not able to keep it off, nor so 
 much as to keep the enemy long in parley, for the <I>affliction hastens 
 fast</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 and will soon come to a crisis. The enemy shall <I>fly as an eagle,</I> 
 so swiftly, so strongly shall he come 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>),

 as an eagle flies upon his prey, and <I>he shall spread his wings,</I> 
 the wings of his army, <I>over Moab;</I> he shall surround it, that 
 none may escape. <I>The strong-holds</I> of Moab are taken by 
 <I>surprise</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>),

 so that all their strength stood them in no stead; and this made <I>the 
 hearts</I> even of <I>their mighty men to fail,</I> for they had not 
 time to recollect the considerations that might have animated them. It 
 requires a more than ordinary degree of courage not to be <I>afraid of 
 sudden fear.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It is an utter destruction, and such as lays Moab all in ruins: 
 <I>Moab is spoiled</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 quite spoiled, is <I>confounded and broken down</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>);

 their cities are laid in ashes, or seized by the enemy so that they are 
 forced to quit them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Divers cities are here named, upon which judgment has come, and the 
 list concludes with an <I>et cetera--and such like.</I> What occasion 
 was there for him to mention more particulars when it comes <I>upon all 
 the cities of Moab</I> in general, <I>far and near?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:21-24"><I>v.</I> 21-24</A>.

 Note, When iniquity is universal we have reason to expect that calamity 
 should be so too. The kingdom is deprived of its dignity and
 authority: <I>The horn of Moab is cut off,</I> the horn of its strength 
 and power, both offensive and defensive; <I>his arm is broken,</I> that 
 he can neither give a blow nor prevent a blow, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 Is the youth of the kingdom the strength and beauty of it? <I>His 
 chosen young men have gone down to the slaughter,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 They went down to the battle promising themselves that they should 
 return victorious; but God told them that they went <I>down to the 
 slaughter;</I> so sure are those to fall against whom God fights. In a 
 word, <I>Moab shall be destroyed from being a people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.

 Those that are enemies to God's people will soon be made no people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. It is a lamentable destruction; it will be just matter of mourning 
 and will turn joy into heaviness. 

 1. The prophet that foretels it does himself lament it, and mourns at 
 the very foresight of it, from a principle of compassion to his 
 fellow-creatures and concern for human nature. The prophet will himself 
 <I>howl for Moab;</I> his very <I>heart shall mourn for</I> them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>);

 he will <I>weep for the vine of Sibmah</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>);

 his <I>heart shall sound like pipes for Moab,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 Though the destruction of Moab would prove him a true prophet, yet he 
 could not think of it without trouble. The ruin of sinners is no 
 pleasure to God, and therefore should be a pain to us; even those that 
 give warning of it should lay it to heart. These passages, and many 
 others in this chapter, are much the same with what Isaiah had used in 
 his prophecies against Moab 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+15:16">Isa. xv. 16</A>);

 for, though there was a long distance of time between that prophecy and
 this, yet they were both dictated by one and the same Spirit, and it 
 becomes God's prophets to speak the language of those that went before 
 them. It is no plagiarism sometimes to make use of old expressions, 
 provided it be with new affections and applications. 

 2. The Moabites themselves shall lament it; it will be the greatest
 mortification and grief imaginable to them. Those that sat in
 <I>glory,</I> in the midst of wealth, and mirth, and all manner of 
 pleasure, shall <I>sit in thirst,</I> in a dry and thirsty land, where 
 no water, no comfort is,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 It is time for them to <I>sit in thirst,</I> and inure themselves to 
 hardship, when <I>the spoiler has come,</I> who will strip them of all, 
 and empty them. The Moabites in the remote corners of the country, that 
 are furthest from the danger, will be inquisitive to know how the 
 matter goes, what news from the army, will ask every one <I>that 
 escapes, What is done?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 And when they are told that all is gone, that the invader is the 
 conqueror, they will <I>howl and cry,</I> in bitterness and anguish of 
 spirit 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>);

 they will abandon themselves to solitude, to lament the desolations of 
 their country; they will <I>leave the cities</I> that used to be full 
 of mirth, <I>and dwell in the rock</I> where they may have their full 
 of melancholy; they shall no more be singing birds, but mourning birds, 
 <I>like the dove</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>);

 <I>the doves of the valley,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:16">Ezek. vii. 16</A>.

 Let those that give themselves up to mirth know that God can soon
 change their note. Their sorrow shall be so very extreme that they 
 shall make themselves <I>bald and cut</I> themselves

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>),

 which were expressions of a desperate grief, such as tempted men to be 
 even their own destroyers. <I>Job</I> indeed <I>rent his mantle and 
 shaved his head,</I> but he did not cut himself. When the flood of 
 passion rises ever so high wisdom and grace must set bounds to it, set 
 banks to it, to restrain it from such barbarities. The sorrow shall be 
 universal 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>):

 <I>There shall be a general lamentation upon all the house-tops of 
 Moab,</I> where they worshipped their idols, to whom they shall in vain 
 bemoan themselves, <I>and in</I> all <I>the streets,</I> where they 
 conversed with one another, for they shall be free in communicating 
 their grief and fears and in propagating them; for they see all lost: 
 "<I>I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein is no pleasure,</I> which 
 shall not be regarded and cannot be pieced again." That which Moab used 
 to rejoice in was their pleasant fruits and the abundance of their rich 
 wines. The delights of sense were all the matter of their joy. Take 
 away these, destroy their gardens and vineyards, and you make <I>all 
 their mirth to cease,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:11,12">Hos. ii. 11, 12</A>.

 There is great weeping when their plants are transplanted, <I>have gone
 over the sea</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),
 
 are carried into other countries, to be planted there. <I>The spoiler 
 has fallen upon thy summer-fruits and upon thy vintage,</I> and it is 
 this that makes <I>the cry of Heshbon</I> to reach <I>even to 
 Elealeh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 <I>Take joy and gladness from the plentiful field, and</I> you take it 
 <I>from the land of Moab,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 If <I>the wine fail from the wine-presses,</I> that used to be trodden 
 with acclamations of joy, all their gladness is cut off. Take away that 
 shouting, and there shall be no shouting. Note, Those who make the 
 delights of sense their chief joy, their exceeding joy, since these are 
 things they may easily be deprived of in a little time subject 
 themselves to the tyranny of the greatest grief; whereas those who 
 rejoice in God may do that even when <I>the fig-tree does not blossom 
 and there is no fruit in the vine.</I> These Moabites lost not only 
 their wine, but their water too: Even <I>the waters of Nimrim shall be 
 desolate</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 and therefore their grief grew extravagantly loud and noisy, and their 
 lamentations were heard in all placed like the lowing of <I>a heifer of 
 three years old.</I> The expressions here are borrowed from 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+15:5,6">Isa. xv. 5, 6</A>.

 3. All their neighbours are called to mourn with them, and to condole
 with them on their ruin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>All you that are about him bemoan him,</I> Let him have that allay 
 to his grief, let him see himself pities by the adjoining countries. 
 Nay, let those at a distance, who do but <I>know his name</I> and have 
 heard of his reputation, take notice of his fall, and say, <I>How is 
 the strong staff broken,</I> whose strength was the terror of its 
 enemies, <I>and the beautiful rod,</I> whose beauty was the pride of 
 its friends! Let the nations take notice of this and receive 
 instruction. Let none be puffed up with or put confidence in their 
 strength or beauty, for neither will be a security against the 
 judgments of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. It is a shameful destruction and such as shall expose them to 
 contempt: <I>Moab is made drunk</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 and he that is made drunk is made vile; he <I>shall wallow in his 
 vomit,</I> and become an odious spectacle, <I>and shall</I>justly <I>be 
 in derision.</I> Let the Moabites be intoxicated with the cup of God's 
 wrath till they stagger and fall, and be brought to <I>their wits' 
 end,</I> and make themselves ridiculous by the wildness not only of 
 their passions but of their counsels. And again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>):

 <I>Moab shall be a derision and a dismaying to all about him;</I> they 
 shall laugh at the fall of the pomp and power he was so proud of. Note, 
 Those that are haughty are preparing reproach and ignominy for 
 themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. It is the destruction of that which is dear to them, not only of 
 their summer fruits and their vintage, but of their wealth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>):
 
 <I>The riches that he has gotten have perished,</I> though he thought 
 he had laid them up very safely, and promised himself a long enjoyment 
 of them, yet they are gone. Note, The money that is hoarded in the 
 chest is as liable to perishing as the summer-fruits that lie exposed 
 in the open field. Riches are shedding things, and, like dust as they 
 are, slip through our fingers even when we are in most care to hold 
 them fast and gripe them hard. Yet this is not the worst; even those 
 whose religion was false and foolish were fond of it above any thing, 
 and, such as it was, would not part with it; and therefore, though it 
 was really a promise, yet to them it was a threatening 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>),

 that God <I>will cause to cease him that offers in the high places,</I> 
 for the high places shall be destroyed, and the fields of offerings 
 shall be laid waste, and the priests themselves, <I>who burnt incense 
 to their gods,</I> shall be slain or carried into captivity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 Note, It is only the true religion, and the worship and service of the 
 true God, that will stand us in stead in a day of trouble.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. It is a just and righteous destruction, and that which they have 
 deserved and brought upon themselves by sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The sin which they had been most notoriously guilty of, and for 
 which God now reckoned with them, was pride. It is mentioned six times, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 <I>We have</I> all <I>heard of the pride of Moab;</I> his neighbours 
 took notice of it; it has testified to his face, as Israel's did; <I>he 
 is exceedingly proud,</I> and grows worse and worse. Observe <I>his 
 loftiness, his arrogancy, his pride, his haughtiness;</I> the 
 multiplying of words to the same purport intimates in how many 
 instances he discovered his pride, and how offensive it was both to God 
 and man. It was charged upon them 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+16:6">Isa. xvi. 6</A>,

 but here it is expressed more largely that there. Since then they had
 been under humbling providences, and yet were unhumbled; nay, they grew 
 more arrogant and haughty, which plainly marked them for that utter 
 destruction of which pride is the forerunner. Two instances are here 
 given of the pride of Moab:--

 (1.) He had conducted himself insolently towards God. He must be
 brought down with shame

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 for <I>he</I> has <I>magnified himself against the Lord;</I> and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>),

 he <I>shall be destroyed from being a people,</I> for this very reason. 
 The Moabites preferred Chemosh before Jehovah, and thought themselves a 
 match for the God of Israel, whom they set at defiance.

 (2.) He had conducted himself scornfully towards Israel, particularly
 in their late troubles; therefore Moab shall fall into the same 
 troubles; into the same hands, and be a derision, for Israel was <I>a 
 derision to him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>.

 The generality of the Moabites, when they heard of the calamities and 
 desolations of their neighbours the Jews, instead of lamenting them, 
 rejoiced in them, they <I>skipped for joy.</I> Many, in such a case, 
 entertain in their minds a secret pleasure at the fall of those they 
 had a dislike to, who yet have so much discretion as to conceal it; it 
 is so invidious a thing. But the Moabites industriously proclaimed 
 their joy, and avowed the enmity they had to Israel, triumphing over 
 every Israelite they met with in distress and laughing at him, which 
 was as inhuman as it was impious and an impudent affront both to man, 
 whose nature they were of, and to God, whose name they were called by.
 Note, Those that deride others in distress will justly and certainly, 
 sooner or later, come into distress themselves, and be had in derision.
 Those that are <I>glad at calamities,</I> especially the calamities of 
 God's church, <I>shall not</I> long <I>go unpunished.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Besides this they had been guilty of malice against God's people, 
 and treachery in their dealings with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 They made a jest of the desolations of Judah and Jerusalem, and 
 pretended, when they laughed at them, that it was but in sport and to 
 make themselves merry; but, says God, "<I>I know his wrath;</I> I know 
 it comes from the old enmity he has to the seed of Abraham and the 
 worshippers of the true God. <I>I know</I> he thinks these calamities 
 of the Jewish nation will end in their utter extirpation. He now tells 
 the Chaldeans what bad people the Jews are, and irritates them against 
 them; <I>but it shall not be so</I> as he expects; <I>his lies shall 
 not so effect it.</I> The nation, whose fall they triumph in, shall 
 recover itself." Some read it, <I>I know his rage. Is it not so?</I> Is 
 he not very furious against the people of God? And <I>his lies I 
 know</I> also. <I>Do they not do so?</I> Do they not belie them? Note, 
 All the fury and all the falsehood of the church's enemies are 
 perfectly known to God, whatever the pretenses are with which they 
 think to cover them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:28">Isa. xxxvii. 28</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. It is a complicated destruction, and by one instance after another 
 will at length be completed; for those that make their escape from one 
 judgment shall perish by another: <I>Fear, and the pit, and the snare, 
 shall be upon them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>.

 There shall be fear to drive them into the pit, and a snare to hold 
 them fast in it when they are in it; so that they shall neither escape 
 from the destruction nor escape out of it. What was said of sinners in 
 general 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:17,18">Isa. xxiv. 17, 18</A>),

 that those who <I>flee from the fear shall fall into the pit</I> and
 those who come <I>up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare,</I> is 
 here particularly foretold concerning the sinners of Moab

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>);

 for it is <I>the year of their visitation,</I> when God comes to reckon 
 with them, and will be <I>known by the judgments which he executes,</I> 
 for he is <I>the King whose name is the Lord of hosts</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);

 he is not only <I>the King</I> who has authority to give judgment, but 
 he is <I>the Lord of hosts,</I> who is able to do what he has 
 determined. The figurative expressions used
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>

 are explained in one instance 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>):

 <I>Those that fled</I> out of the villages for fear of the enemy's 
 forces put themselves <I>under the shadow of Heshbon,</I> stood there, 
 and supposed they stood safely, as now armies sometimes retire under 
 the cannon of a fortified city, and it is their protection; but here 
 they should be disappointed, for, when <I>they flee out of the pit, 
 they fall into the snare;</I> Heshbon, which they thought would shelter 
 them, devours them as Moses had foretold long since 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:28">Num. xxi. 28</A>):

 <I>A fire has gone out of Heshbon,</I> and <I>a flame from the city of
 Sihon,</I> and devours those that come from all <I>the corners of 
 Moab,</I> and fastens upon <I>the crown of the head of the 
 tumultuous</I> noisy <I>ones,</I> or of the revellers, or children of 
 noise, not meant of the rude clamorous multitude, but of the great men, 
 who bluster, and hector, and make a noise; the judgments of God shall 
 light on them. Shall we hear the conclusion of this whole matter? We 
 have it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>):

 "<I>Woe be to thee, O Moab!</I> thou art undone; <I>the people</I> that 
 worship <I>Chemosh perish,</I> and are gone; farewell, Moab. <I>Thy 
 sons</I> and <I>daughters,</I> the hopes of the next generation, have 
 gone into captivity after the Jews, whose calamities they rejoiced 
 in."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. Yet it is not a perpetual destruction. The chapter concludes with 
 a short promise of their return out of <I>captivity in the latter 
 days.</I> God, who brings them into captivity, <I>will bring again</I> 
 their <I>captivity,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>.

 Thus tenderly does God deal with Moabites, much more with his own 
 people! Even with Moabites he <I>will not contend for ever, nor be 
 always wrath.</I> When Israel returned, Moab did; and perhaps the 
 prophecy was intended chiefly for the encouragement of God's people to 
 hope for that salvation which even Moabites shall share in. Yet it 
 looks further, to gospel times; the Jews themselves refer it to the 
 days of the Messiah; then the captivity of the Gentiles, under the yoke 
 of sin and Satan, shall be brought back by divine grace, which shall

 judgment of Moab.</I></P>
