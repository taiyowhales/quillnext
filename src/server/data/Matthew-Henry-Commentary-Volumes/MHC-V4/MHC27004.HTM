 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The penman of this chapter is Nebuchadnezzar himself: the story here
 recorded concerning him is given us in his own words, as he himself 
 drew it up and published it; but Daniel, a prophet, by inspiration, 
 inserts it in his history, and so it has become a part of sacred writ 
 and a very memorable part. Nebuchadnezzar was as daring a rival with 
 God Almighty for the sovereignty as perhaps any mortal man ever was; 
 but here he fairly owns himself conquered, and gives it under his hand 
 that the God of Israel is above him. Here is, 

 I. The preface to his narrative, wherein he acknowledges God's dominion
 over him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. The narrative itself, wherein he relates, 

 1. His dream, which puzzled the magicians,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:1-18">ver. 1-18</A>.

 2. The interpretation of his dream by Daniel, who showed him that it
 was a prognostication of his own fall, advising him therefore to repent
 and reform, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:19-27">ver. 19-27</A>.

 3. The accomplishment of it in his running stark mad for seven years, 
 and then recovering the use of his reason again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:28-36">ver. 28-36</A>.

 4. The conclusion of the narrative, with a humble acknowledgment and 
 adoration of God as Lord of all, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:37">ver. 37</A>.

 This was extorted from him by the overruling power of that God who has 
 all men's hearts in his hand, and stands upon record a lasting proof of 
 God's supremacy, a monument of his glory, a trophy of his victory, and 
 a warning to all not to think of prospering while they lift up or 
 harden their hearts against God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and
 languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto
 you.
 &nbsp; 2  I thought it good to show the signs and wonders that the high
 God hath wrought toward me.
 &nbsp; 3  How great <I>are</I> his signs! and how mighty <I>are</I> his wonders!
 his kingdom <I>is</I> an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion <I>is</I>
 from generation to generation.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Something of form, which was usual in writs, proclamations, or 
 circular letters, issued by the king, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 The royal style which Nebuchadnezzar makes use of has nothing in it of
 pomp or fancy, but is plain, short, and unaffected--<I>Nebuchadnezzar
 the king.</I> If at other times he made use of great swelling words of
 vanity in his title, how he laid them all aside; for he was old, he had 
 lately recovered from a distraction which had humbled and mortified 
 him, and was now in the actual contemplation of God's greatness and 
 sovereignty. The declaration is directed not only to his own subjects, 
 but to all to whom this present writing shall come--<I>to all people, 
 nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth.</I> He is not only 
 willing that they should all hear of it, though it carry the account if 
 his own infamy (which perhaps none durst have published if he had not 
 done it himself, and therefore Daniel published the original paper), 
 but he strictly charges and commands all manner of persons to take 
 notice of it; for all are concerned, and it may be profitable to all. 
 He salutes those to whom he writes, in the usual form, <I>Peace be 
 multiplied unto you.</I> Note, It becomes kings with their commands to 
 disperse their good wishes, and, as fathers of their country, to bless 
 their subjects. So the common form with us. We send greeting,
 <I>Omnibus quibus h&aelig; pr&aelig;sentes liter&aelig; pervenerint, 
 salutem--To all to whom these presents shall come, health;</I> and 
 sometimes <I>Salutem sempiternam--Health and salvation 
 everlasting.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Something of substance and matter. He writes this, 

 1. To acquaint others with the providences of God that had related to
 him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>I thought it good to show the signs and wonders that the high 
 God</I> (so he calls the true God) <I>has wrought towards me.</I> He 
 thought it <I>seemly</I> (so the word is), that it was his duty, and 
 did well become him, that it was a debt he owed to God and the world, 
 now that he had recovered from his distraction, to relate to distant 
 places, and record for future ages, how justly God had humbled him and 
 how graciously he had at length restored him. All the nations, no 
 doubt, had heard what befell Nebuchadnezzar, and rang of it; but he 
 thought it fit that they should have a distinct account of it from 
 himself, that they might know the hand of God in it, and what 
 impressions were made upon his own spirit by it, and might speak of it 
 not as a matter of news, but as a matter of religion. The events 
 concerning him were not only wonders to be admired, but signs to be 
 instructed by, signifying to the world that Jehovah is greater than all 
 gods. Note, We ought to show to others God's dealings with us, both the 
 rebukes we have been under and the favours we have received; and though 
 the account hereof may reflect disgrace upon ourselves, as this did 
 upon Nebuchadnezzar, yet we must not conceal it, as long as it may 
 redound to the glory of God. Many will be forward to tell what God has 
 done <I>for their souls,</I> because that turns to their own praise, 
 who care not for telling what God has done against them, and how they 
 deserved it; whereas we ought to give glory to God, not only by 
 praising him for his mercies, but by confessing our sins, accepting the 
 punishment of our iniquity, and in both taking shame to ourselves, as 
 this mighty monarch here does. 

 2. To show how much he was himself affected with them and convinced by
 them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 We should always speak of the word and works of God with concern and 
 seriousness and show ourselves affected with those great things of God 
 which we desire others should take notice of.

 (1.) He admires God's doings. He speaks of them as one amazed: <I>How
 great are his signs, and how mighty are his wonders!</I> Nebuchadnezzar 
 was now old, had reigned above forty years, and had seen as much of the 
 world and the revolutions of it as most men ever did; and yet never 
 till now, when himself was nearly touched, was he brought to admire 
 surprising events as God's signs and his wonders. Now, <I>How great, 
 how mighty,</I> are they! Note, The more we see events to be <I>the 
 Lord's doing,</I> and see in them the product of a divine power and the 
 conduct of a divine wisdom, the more marvellous they will appear in our 
 eyes,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+118:23,Ps+66:2">Ps. cxviii. 23; lxvi. 2</A>.

 (2.) He thence infers God's dominion. This is that which he is at
 length brought to subscribe to: <I>His kingdom is an everlasting 
 kingdom;</I> and not like his own kingdom, which he saw, and long since 
 foresaw, in a dream, hastening towards a period. He now owns that there 
 is a God that governs the world and has a universal, incontestable, 
 absolute dominion in and over all the affairs of the children of men.
 And it is the glory of this kingdom that it is everlasting. Other 
 reigns are confined to one generation, and other dynasties to a few 
 generations, but God's <I>dominion is from generation to 
 generation.</I> It should seem, Nebuchadnezzar here refers to what 
 Daniel had foretold of a kingdom which the God of heaven would set up, 
 that should <I>never be destroyed</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:44"><I>ch.</I> ii. 44</A>),

 which, though meant of the kingdom of the Messiah, he understood of the
 providential kingdom. Thus we may make a profitable practical use and 
 application of those prophetical scriptures which yet we do not fully, 
 and perhaps not rightly, comprehend the meaning of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing
 in my palace:
 &nbsp; 5  I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my
 bed and the visions of my head troubled me.
 &nbsp; 6  Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise <I>men</I> of
 Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the
 interpretation of the dream.
 &nbsp; 7  Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans,
 and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they
 did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.
 &nbsp; 8  But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name <I>was</I>
 Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom <I>is</I>
 the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream,
 <I>saying,</I>
 &nbsp; 9  O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that
 the spirit of the holy gods <I>is</I> in thee, and no secret troubleth
 thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the
 interpretation thereof.
 &nbsp; 10  Thus <I>were</I> the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and
 behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof
 <I>was</I> great.
 &nbsp; 11  The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof
 reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the
 earth:
 &nbsp; 12  The leaves thereof <I>were</I> fair, and the fruit thereof much,
 and in it <I>was</I> meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow
 under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs
 thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.
 &nbsp; 13  I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a
 watcher and a holy one came down from heaven;
 &nbsp; 14  He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut
 off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit:
 let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his
 branches:
 &nbsp; 15  Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even
 with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field;
 and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and <I>let</I> his portion
 <I>be</I> with the beasts in the grass of the earth:
 &nbsp; 16  Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart
 be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.
 &nbsp; 17  This matter <I>is</I> by the decree of the watchers, and the
 demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the
 living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men,
 and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the
 basest of men.
 &nbsp; 18  This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O
 Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as
 all the wise <I>men</I> of my kingdom are not able to make known unto
 me the interpretation: but thou <I>art</I> able; for the spirit of the
 holy gods <I>is</I> in thee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Nebuchadnezzar, before he relates the judgments of God that had been 
 wrought upon him for his pride, gives an account of the fair warning he 
 had of them before they came, a due regard to which might have 
 prevented them. But he was <I>told of them,</I> and of the issue of 
 them, <I>before they came to pass, that, when they did come to 
 pass,</I> by comparing them with the prediction of them, he might see, 
 and say, that they were the Lord's doing, and might be brought to 
 believe that there is a divine revelation in the world, as well as a 
 divine Providence, and that the works of God agree with his word.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, in the account he here gives of his dream, by which he had notice 
 of what was coming, we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The time when this alarm was given to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 it was when he was <I>at rest in his house, and flourishing in his 
 palace.</I> He had lately conquered Egypt, and with it completed his 
 victories, and ended his wars, and made himself monarch of all those 
 parts of the world, which was about the thirty-fourth or thirty-fifth 
 year of his reign, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:17">Ezek. xxix. 17</A>.

 Then he had this dream, which was accomplished about a year after.
 Seven years his distraction continued, upon his recovery from which he 
 penned this declaration, lived about two years after, and died in his 
 forty-fifth year. He had undergone a long fatigue in his wars, had made 
 many a tedious and dangerous campaign in the field; but now at length 
 he is <I>at rest in his house,</I> and there is <I>no adversary, nor 
 any evil occurrent.</I> Note, God can reach the greatest of men with 
 his terrors even when they are most secure, and think themselves at 
 rest and flourishing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The impression it made upon him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>I saw a dream which made me afraid.</I> One would think no little 
 thing would frighten him that had been a man of war from his youth, and 
 used to look the perils of war in the face without change of 
 countenance; yet, when God pleases, a dream strikes a terror upon him. 
 His bed, no doubt, was soft, and easy, and well-guarded, and yet his 
 own <I>thoughts upon his bed</I> made him uneasy, and the <I>visions of 
 his head,</I> the creatures of his own imagination, <I>troubled 
 him.</I> Note, God can make the greatest of men uneasy even when they 
 say to their souls, <I>Take your ease, eat, drink, and be merry;</I> he 
 can make those that have been the troublers of the world, and have 
 tormented thousands, to be their own troublers, their own tormentors, 
 and those that have been <I>the terror of the mighty</I> a terror to 
 themselves. By the consternation which this dream put him into, and the 
 impression it made upon him, he perceived it to be, not an ordinary 
 dream, but sent of God on a special errand.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His consulting, in vain, with the magicians and astrologers 
 concerning the meaning of it. He had not now forgotten the dream, as 
 before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:1-21"><I>ch.</I> ii.</A>

 He had it ready enough, but he wanted to know the
 interpretation of it and what was prefigured by it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Orders are immediately given to summon <I>all the wise men of 
 Babylon</I> that were such fools as to pretend by magic, divination, 
 inspecting the entrails of beasts, or observations of the stars, to 
 predict things to come: they must all come together, to see if any, or 
 all of them in consultation, could interpret the king's dream. It is 
 probable that these people had sometimes, in a like case, given the 
 king some sort of satisfaction, and by the rules of their art had 
 answered the king's queries so as to please him, whether it were right 
 or wrong, hit or missed; but now his expectation from them was 
 disappointed: He <I>told them the dream</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 but they <I>could not tell him the interpretation of it,</I> though 
 they had boasted, with great assurance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:4,7"><I>ch.</I> ii. 4, 7</A>),

 that, if they had but the dream told them, they would without fail
 interpret it. But the key of this dream was in a sacred prophecy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:3">Ezek. xxxi. 3</A>,

 &c.), where the Assyrian is compared, as Nebuchadnezzar here, to a
 <I>tree cut down,</I> for his pride; and that was a book they had not 
 studied, nor acquainted themselves with, else they might have been let 
 into the mystery of this dream. Providence ordered it so that they 
 should be first puzzled with it, that Daniel's interpreting it
 afterwards might redound to the glory of the God of Daniel. Now was
 fulfilled what Isaiah foretold

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:12,13"><I>ch.</I> xlvii. 12, 13</A>),

 that when the ruin of Babylon was drawing on her <I>enchantments and
 sorceries,</I> her <I>astrologers</I> and <I>star-gazers,</I> should 
 not be able to do her any service.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The court he made to Daniel, to engage him to expound his dream to 
 him: <I>At the last Daniel came in.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Either he declined associating with the rest because of their badness, 
 or they declined his company because of his goodness; or perhaps the 
 king would rather that his own magicians should have the honour of 
 doing it if they could than that Daniel should have it; or Daniel, 
 being <I>governor</I> of the wise men

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:48"><I>ch.</I> ii. 48</A>),

 was, as is usual, last consulted. Many make God's word their last
 refuge, and never have recourse to it till they are driven off from all 
 other succours. He compliments Daniel very highly, takes notice of the 
 name which he had himself given him, in the choice of which he thinks 
 he was very happy and that it was a good omen: "His <I>name was 
 Belteshazzar,</I> from <I>Bel, the name of my god.</I>" He applauds his 
 rare endowments: He has <I>the spirit of the holy gods,</I> so he tells 
 him to his face 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 with which we may suppose that Daniel was so far from being puffed up 
 that he was rather very much grieved to hear that which he had by gift 
 from the God of Israel, the true and living God, ascribed to 
 Nebuchadnezzar's god, a dunghill deity. Here is a strange medley in 
 Nebuchadnezzar, but such as is commonly found in those that side with 
 their corruptions against their convictions. 

 1. He retains the language and dialect of his idolatry, and therefore,
 it is to be feared, is no convert to the faith and worship of the 
 living God. He is an idolater, and his speech betrayeth him. For he
 speaks of many gods, and is brought to acquiesce in one as sufficient, 
 no, not in him who is all-sufficient. And some think, when he speaks of 
 <I>the spirit of the holy gods,</I> that he supposes there are some 
 evil malignant deities, whom men are concerned to worship, only to 
 prevent their doing them a mischief, and some who are good beneficent 
 deities, and that by the spirit of the latter Daniel was animated. He 
 also owns that Bel was his god still, though he had once and again 
 acknowledged the <I>God of Israel</I> to be Lord of all,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:47,3:29"><I>ch.</I> ii. 47; iii. 29</A>.

 He also applauds Daniel, not as <I>a servant of God,</I> but as
 <I>master of the magicians</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 supposing his knowledge to differ from theirs, not in kind, but only in 
 degree; and he consulted him not as a prophet, but as a celebrated 
 magician, so endeavouring to save the credit of the art when those 
 blundered and were nonplussed who were masters of the art. See how 
 close his idolatry sat to him. He has got a notion of many gods, and 
 has chosen Bel for his god, and he cannot persuade himself to quit 
 either his notion or his choice, though the absurdity of both had been 
 evidenced to him, more than once, beyond contradiction. He, like other 
 heathens, would not change his gods, though they were no gods, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:11">Jer. ii. 11</A>.

 Many persist in a false way only because they think they cannot in
 honour leave it. See how loose his convictions sat, and how easily he
 had dropped them. He once called the God of Israel a <I>God of
 gods,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:47"><I>ch.</I> ii. 47</A>.

 Now he sets him upon a level with the rest of those whom he calls the
 <I>holy gods.</I> Note, If convictions be not speedily prosecuted, it 
 is a thousand to one but in a little time they will be quite lost and 
 forgotten. Nebuchadnezzar, not going forward with the acknowledgements 
 he had been brought to make of the sovereignty of the true God, soon 
 <I>went backwards,</I> and relapsed to the same veneration he had 
 always had for his false gods. And yet, 

 2. He professes a great opinion of Daniel, whom he knows to be a
 servant of the true God, and of him only. He looked upon him as one 
 that had such an insight, such a foresight, as none of his magicians 
 had: <I>I know that no secret troubles thee.</I> Note, The spirit of 
 prophecy quite outdoes the spirit of divination, even the enemies 
 themselves being judges; for so it was adjudged here, upon a fair trial 
 of skill.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The particular account he gives him of his dream.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He saw a stately flourishing tree, remarkable above all the trees of 
 the wood. This tree was <I>planted in the midst of the earth</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 fitly representing him who reigned in Babylon, which was about the 
 midst of the then known world. His dignity and eminency above all his 
 neighbours were signified by the height of this tree, which was 
 <I>exceedingly great;</I> it <I>reached unto heaven.</I> He over-topped 
 those about him, and aimed to have divine honours given him; nay, he 
 over-powered those about him, and the potent armies he had the command 
 of, with which he carried all before him, are signified by the strength 
 of this tree: it <I>grew and was strong.</I> And so much were 
 Nebuchadnezzar and his growing greatness the talk of the nations, so 
 much had they their eye upon him (some a jealous eye, all a wondering 
 eye), that the sight of this tree is said to be <I>to the end of all 
 the earth.</I> This tree had every thing in it that was pleasant to the 
 eye and good for food 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 <I>The leaves thereof were fair,</I> denoting the pomp and splendour of 
 Nebuchadnezzar's court, which was the wonder of strangers and the glory 
 of his own subjects. Nor was this tree for sight and state only, but 
 for use. 

 (1.) For protection; the boughs of it were for shelter both to the
 beasts and to the fowls. Princes should be a screen to their subjects
 <I>from the heat</I> and <I>from the storm,</I> should expose 
 themselves to secure them, and study how to make them safe and easy. If 
 the bramble be <I>promoted over the trees,</I> he invites them to come 
 and <I>trust in his shadow,</I> such as it is, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:15">Judg. ix. 15</A>.

 It is protection that draws allegiance. The kings of the earth are to
 their subjects but as the shadow of a great tree; but Christ is to his 
 subjects as the <I>shadow of a great rock,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:2">Isa. xxxii. 2</A>.

 Nay, because that, though strong, may be cold, they are said to be
 hidden under the <I>shadow of his wings</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:8">Ps. xvii. 8</A>),

 where they are not only safe, but warm.

 (2.) For provision, The Assyrian was compared to a <I>cedar</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:6">Ezek. xxxi. 6</A>),

 which affords shadow only; but this tree here had much fruit--in it was
 <I>meat for all</I> and <I>all flesh was fed of it.</I> This mighty 
 monarch, it should seem by this, not only was great, but did good; he 
 did not impoverish, but enrich his country, and by his power and 
 interest abroad brought wealth and trade to it. Those that <I>exercise 
 authority</I> would be called <I>benefactors</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:25">Luke xxii. 25</A>),

 and the most effectual course they can take to support their authority
 is to be really benefactors. And see what is the best that great men, 
 with their wealth and power can attain to, and that is to have the 
 honour of having many to live upon them and to be maintained by them; 
 for, <I>as goods are increased, those are increased that eat 
 them.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He heard the doom of this tree read, which he perfectly remembered, 
 and related here, perhaps word for word as he heard it. The sentence 
 was passed upon it by an angel, whom he saw <I>come down from 
 heaven,</I> and heard proclaim this sentence aloud. This angel is here 
 called a <I>watcher,</I> or <I>watchman,</I> not only because angels by 
 their nature are spirits, and therefore neither slumber nor sleep, but 
 because by their office they are <I>ministering spirits,</I> and attend 
 continually to their ministrations, watching all opportunities of 
 serving their great Master. They, as watchers, encamp round those that 
 fear God, to deliver them, and <I>bear them up in their hands.</I> This 
 angel was a <I>messenger,</I> or <I>ambassador</I> (so some read it), 
 and a <I>holy one. Holiness becomes God's house;</I> therefore angels 
 that attend and are employed by him are <I>holy ones;</I> they preserve 
 the purity and rectitude of their nature, and are in every thing 
 conformable to the divine will. Let us review the doom passed upon the 
 tree.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Orders are given that it be cut down 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);

 now also <I>the axe is laid to the root</I> of this tree. Though it is 
 ever so high, ever so strong, that cannot secure it when its day comes 
 to fall; the beasts and fowls, that are sheltered in and under the 
 boughs of it, are driven away and dispersed; the branches are cropped, 
 the leaves shaken off, and the fruit scattered. Note, Worldly 
 prosperity in its highest degree is a very uncertain thing; and it is 
 no uncommon thing for those that have lived in the greatest pomp and 
 power to be stripped of all that which they trusted to and gloried in. 
 By the turns of providence, those who made a figure become captives, 
 those who lived in plenty, and above what they had, are reduced to 
 straits, and live far below what they had, and those perhaps are 
 brought to be beholden to others who once had many depending upon them 
 and making suit to them. But the <I>trees of righteousness,</I> that 
 are <I>planted in the house of the Lord</I> and bring forth fruit to 
 him, shall not be cut down, nor shall their leaf wither.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Care is taken that the root be preserved 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);

 "<I>Leave the stump of it in the earth,</I> exposed to all weathers. 
 There let it lie neglected and buried in the grass. Let the beasts that 
 formerly sheltered themselves under the boughs now repose themselves 
 upon the stump; but that it may not be raked to pieces, nor trodden to 
 dirt, and to show that it is yet reserved for better days, let it be 
 hooped round with <I>a band of iron and brass,</I> to keep it firm." 
 Note, God in judgment remembers mercy; and may yet have good things in 
 store for those whose condition seems most forlorn. There is <I>hope of 
 a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, that through the 
 scent of water it will bud,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+14:7-9">Job xiv. 7-9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The meaning of this is explained by the angel himself to 
 Nebuchadnezzar, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Whoever is the person signified by this tree he is sentenced to be 
 deposed from the honour, state, and dignity of a man, to be deprived of 
 the use of his reason, and to be and live like a brute, till <I>seven 
 times pass over him. Let a beast's heart be given unto him.</I> This is 
 surely the saddest and sorest of all temporal judgments, worse a 
 thousand times than death, and though, like it, least felt by those 
 that lie under it, yet to be dreaded and deprecated more than any 
 other. Nay, whatever outward affliction God is pleased to lay upon us, 
 we have reason to bear it patiently, and to be thankful that he 
 continues to us the use of our reason and the peace of our consciences.
 But those proud tyrants who <I>set their heart as the heart of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:2">Ezek. xxvii. 2</A>)

 may justly be deprived of the heart of man, and have a beast's heart
 given them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The truth of it is confirmed
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);

 <I>This matter is by the decree of the watchers and the demand by the 
 word of the holy ones.</I> God has determined it, as a righteous Judge; 
 he has signed this edict; pursuant to his eternal counsel, the decree 
 has gone forth, And, 

 [1.] The angels of heaven have subscribed to it, as attesting it,
 approving it, and applauding it. It is by <I>the decree of the 
 watchers;</I> not that the great God needs the counsel or concurrence 
 of the angels in any thing he determines or does, but, as he uses their 
 ministration in executing his counsels, so he is sometimes represented, 
 after the manner of men, as if he consulted them. <I>Whom shall I 
 send?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:8">Isa. vi. 8</A>.

 <I>Who shall persuade Ahab?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+22:20">1 Kings xxii. 20</A>.

 So it denotes the solemnity of this sentence. The king's breves, or
 short writs, pass, <I>Teste me ipso--in my presence;</I> but charters 
 used to be signed, <I>His testibus--In the presence of us whose names 
 are under-written;</I> such was Nebuchadnezzar's doom; it was by the 
 <I>decree of the watchers.</I>

 [2.] The saints on earth petitioned for it, as well as the angels in
 heaven: <I>The demand is by the word of the holy ones.</I> God's 
 suffering people, that had long groaned under the heavy yoke of 
 Nebuchadnezzar's tyranny, cried to him for vengeance; they made the 
 demand, and God gave this answer to it; for, when the <I>oppressed cry 
 to God, he will hear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:27">Exod. xxii. 27</A>.

 Sentence was passed, in Ahab's time, that there should be no more rain,
 at Elijah's word, when he <I>made intercession against Israel,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:1">1 Kings xvii. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) The design of it is declared. Orders are given for the cutting 
 down of this tree, <I>to the intent that the living may know that the 
 Most High rules.</I> This judgment must be executed, to convince the 
 unthinking, unbelieving, world, that <I>verily there is a God that 
 judges in the earth,</I> a God that governs the world, that not only 
 has a kingdom of his own in it, and administers the affairs of that 
 kingdom, but rules also <I>in the kingdom of men,</I> in the dominion 
 that one man has over another, and <I>gives</I> that <I>to whomsoever 
 he will;</I> from him promotion comes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+75:6,7">Ps. lxxv. 6, 7</A>.

 He advances men to power and dominion that little expected it, and
 crosses the projects of the ambitious and aspiring. Sometimes he 
 <I>sets up the basest of men,</I> and serves his own purposes by them. 
 He sets up mean men, as David from the sheepfold; <I>he raises the poor 
 out of the dust,</I> to <I>set them among princes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+113:7,8">Ps. cxiii. 7, 8</A>.
 
 Nay, sometimes he sets up bad men, to be a scourge to a provoking
 people. Thus he can do, thus he may do, thus he often does, and 
 <I>gives not account of any of his matters.</I> By humbling 
 Nebuchadnezzar it was designed that the living should be made to know 
 this. The dead know it, that have gone to the world of spirits, the 
 world of retribution; they know that <I>the Most High rules;</I> but 
 the living must be made to know it and lay it to heart, that they may 
 make their peace with God before it be too late.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Thus has Nebuchadnezzar fully and faithfully related his dream, what he 
 saw and what he heard, and then demands of Daniel the interpretation of 
 it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 for he found that no one else was able to interpret it, but was 
 confident that he was: <I>For the spirit of the holy gods is in 
 thee,</I> or of the <I>Holy God,</I> the proper title of the God of 
 Israel. Much may be expected from those that have in them the <I>Spirit 
 of the Holy God.</I> Whether Nebuchadnezzar had any jealousy that it 
 was his own doom that was read by this dream does not appear; perhaps 
 he was so vain and secure as to imagine that it was some other prince 
 that was a rival with him, whose fall he had the pleasing prospect of
 given him in this dream; but, be it for him or against him, he is very 
 solicitous to know the true meaning of it and depends upon Daniel to 
 give it to him. Now, When God gives us general warnings of his 
 judgments we should be desirous to understand his mind in them, to hear 
 <I>the Lord's voice crying in the city.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  Then Daniel, whose name <I>was</I> Belteshazzar, was astonied for
 one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and
 said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation
 thereof, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord,
 the dream <I>be</I> to them that hate thee, and the interpretation
 thereof to thine enemies.
 &nbsp; 20  The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose
 height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the
 earth;
 &nbsp; 21  Whose leaves <I>were</I> fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in
 it <I>was</I> meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt,
 and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their
 habitation:
 &nbsp; 22  It <I>is</I> thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for
 thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy
 dominion to the end of the earth.
 &nbsp; 23  And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming
 down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it;
 yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with
 a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and
 let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and <I>let</I> his portion <I>be</I>
 with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;
 &nbsp; 24  This <I>is</I> the interpretation, O king, and this <I>is</I> the
 decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king:
 &nbsp; 25  That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall
 be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat
 grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven,
 and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the
 most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to
 whomsoever he will.
 &nbsp; 26  And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree
 roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt
 have known that the heavens do rule.
 &nbsp; 27  Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee,
 and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by
 showing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy
 tranquillity.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar's dream; and when 
 once it is applied to himself, and it is declared that he is the tree 
 in the dream (<I>Mutato nomine de te fabula narratur--Change but the
 name, the fable speaks of thee</I>), when once it is said, <I>Thou art 
 the man,</I> there needs little more to be said for the explication of 
 the dream. <I>Out of his own mouth he is judged; so shall his doom be, 
 he himself has decided it.</I> The thing was so plain that Daniel, upon 
 hearing the dream, was <I>astonished for one hour,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 He was struck with amazement and terror at so great a judgment coming 
 upon so great a prince. <I>His flesh trembled for fear of God.</I> He 
 was likewise struck with confusion when he found himself under a 
 necessity of being the man that must bring to the king <I>these heavy 
 tidings,</I> which, having received so many favours from the king, he 
 had rather he should have heard from any one else; so far is he from 
 desiring the woeful day that he dreads it, and the thoughts of it 
 trouble him. Those that come after the ruined sinner are said to be 
 <I>astonished at his day,</I> as <I>those that went before,</I> and saw 
 it coming (as Daniel here), <I>were affrighted,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:20">Job xviii. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The preface to the interpretation is a civil compliment which, as a 
 courtier, he passes upon the king. The king observed him to stand as 
 one astonished, and, thinking he was loth to speak out for fear of 
 offending him, he encouraged him to deal plainly and faithfully with 
 him; <I>Let not the dream, nor the interpretation thereof, trouble 
 thee.</I> This he speaks either, 

 1. As one that sincerely desired to know this truth. Note, Those that
 consult the oracles of God must be ready to receive them as they are, 
 whether they be for them or against them, and must accordingly give 
 their ministers leave to be free with them. Or, 

 2. As one that despised the truth, and set it at defiance. When we see
 how regardless he was of this warning afterwards we are tempted to 
 think that this was his meaning; "<I>Let it not trouble thee,</I> for I 
 am resolved it shall not trouble me; nor will I lay it to heart." But, 
 whether he have any concern for himself or no, Daniel is concerned for 
 him, and therefore wishes, "<I>The dream be to those that hate 
 thee.</I> Let the ill it bodes light on the head of thy enemies, not on 
 thy head." Though Nebuchadnezzar was an idolater, a persecutor, and an 
 oppressor of the people of God, yet he was, at present, Daniel's 
 prince; and therefore, though Daniel foresees, and is now going to 
 foretell, ill concerning him, he dares not wish ill to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The interpretation itself is only a repetition of the dream, with 
 application to the king. "As for <I>the tree</I> which thou sawest 
 <I>flourishing</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>),

 <I>it is thou, O king!</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 And willing enough would the king be to hear this (as, before, to hear, 
 <I>Thou art the head of gold</I>), but for that which follows. He shows 
 the king his present prosperous state in the glass of his own dream; 
 "<I>Thy greatness has grown and reaches</I> as near <I>to heaven</I> as 
 human greatness can do, and <I>thy dominion is to the end of the 
 earth,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:37,38"><I>ch.</I> ii. 37, 38</A>.
 
 "As for the doom passed upon the tree 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 it is <I>the decree of the Most High, which comes upon my lord the
 king,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 He must not only be deposed from his throne, <I>but driven from
 men,</I> and being deprived of his reason, and having a beast's heart 
 given him, his dwelling shall be <I>with the beasts of the field,</I> 
 and with them he shall be a fellow-commoner: he shall <I>eat grass as 
 oxen,</I> and, like them, lie out all weathers, and be <I>wet with the 
 dew of heaven,</I> and this till <I>seven times</I> pass over him, that 
 is, <I>seven years;</I> and then he shall know that the <I>Most High 
 rules,</I> and when he is brought to know and own this he shall be 
 restored to his dominion again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 "<I>Thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee,</I> shall remain as firm as 
 the <I>stump of the tree</I> in the ground, and thou shalt have it, 
 <I>after thou shalt have known</I> that <I>the heavens do rule.</I>" 
 God is here called <I>the heavens,</I> because it is in heaven that he 
 has <I>prepared his throne</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:19">Ps. ciii. 19</A>),

 thence he <I>beholds all the sons of men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+33:13">Ps. xxxiii. 13</A>.

 The <I>heavens, even the heavens, are the Lord's;</I> and the influence
 which the visible heavens have upon this earth is intended as a faint 
 representation of the dominion the God of heaven has over this lower 
 world; we are said to <I>sin against heaven,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:18">Luke xv. 18</A>.

 Note, Then only we may expect comfortably to enjoy our right in, and
 government of, both ourselves and others, when we dutifully acknowledge 
 God's title to, and dominion over, us and all we have.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The close of the interpretation is the pious counsel which Daniel, 
 as a prophet, gave the king, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Whether he appeared concerned or not at the interpretation of the 
 dream, a word of advice would be very seasonable--if careless, to 
 awaken him, if troubled, to comfort him; and it is not inconsistent 
 with the dream and the interpretation of it, for Daniel knew not but it 
 might be conditional, like the prediction of Nineveh's destruction. 
 Observe, 

 1. How humbly he gives his advice, and with what tenderness and
 respect: "<I>O king! let my counsel be acceptable unto thee;</I> take 
 it in good part, as coming from love, and well-meant, and let it not be 
 misinterpreted." Note, Sinners need to be courted to their own good, 
 and respectfully entreated to do well for themselves. The apostle 
 beseeches men to <I>suffer the word of exhortation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:22">Heb. xiii. 22</A>.

 We think it a good point gained if people will be persuaded to take
 good counsel kindly; nay, if they will take it patiently. 

 2. What his advice is. He does not counsel him to enter into a course
 of physic, for the preventing of the distemper in his head, but to 
 break off a course of sin that he was in, to reform his life. He 
 wronged his own subjects, and dealt unfairly with his allies; and he 
 must <I>break off</I> this <I>by righteousness,</I> by rendering to all 
 their due, making amends for wrong done, and not triumphing over right 
 with might. He had been cruel to the poor, to God's poor, to the poor
 Jews; and he must <I>break off</I> this <I>iniquity</I> by <I>showing 
 mercy </I>to those poor, pitying those oppressed ones, setting them at 
 liberty or making their captivity easy to them. Note, It is necessary, 
 in repentance, that we not only <I>cease to do evil, but learn to do 
 well,</I> not only do no wrong to any, but do good to all. 

 3. What the motive is with which he backs this advice: <I>If it may be
 a lengthening of thy tranquility.</I> Though it should not wholly 
 prevent the judgment, yet by this means a reprieve may be obtained, as 
 by <I>Ahab's humbling himself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:29">1 Kings xxi. 29</A>.

 Either the trouble may be the longer before it comes or the shorter
 when it does come; yet he cannot assure him of this, but <I>it may 
 be,</I> it may prove so. Note, The mere probability of preventing a 
 temporal judgment is inducement enough to a work so good in itself as 
 the leaving off of our sins and reforming of our lives, much more the 
 certainty of preventing our eternal ruin. "<I>That will be a healing of 
 thy error</I>" (so some read it); "thus the quarrel will be taken up, 
 and all will be well again."</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>28  All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.
 &nbsp; 29  At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the
 kingdom of Babylon.
 &nbsp; 30  The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I
 have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power,
 and for the honour of my majesty?
 &nbsp; 31  While the word <I>was</I> in the king's mouth, there fell a voice
 from heaven, <I>saying,</I> O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is
 spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee.
 &nbsp; 32  And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling <I>shall
 be</I> with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat
 grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou
 know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth
 it to whomsoever he will.
 &nbsp; 33  The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar:
 and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his
 body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown
 like eagles' <I>feathers,</I> and his nails like birds' <I>claws.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Nebuchadnezzar's dream accomplished, and Daniel's 
 application of it to him justified and confirmed. How he took it we are 
 not told, whether he was pleased with Daniel or displeased; but here we 
 have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God's patience with him: <I>All this came upon him,</I> but not till 
 <I>twelve months after</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 so long there was a <I>lengthening of his tranquility,</I> though it 
 does not appear that he <I>broke off his sins,</I> or showed any 
 <I>mercy to the poor</I> captives, for this was still God's quarrel 
 with him, that he <I>opened not the house of his prisoners,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:17">Isa. xiv. 17</A>.

 Daniel having counselled him to repent, God so far confirmed his word
 that he gave him space to repent; he <I>let him alone this year 
 also,</I> this <I>one</I> year more, before he brought this judgment 
 upon him. Note, God is long-suffering with provoking sinners, because 
 he is not willing that <I>any should perish, but that all should come 
 to repentance,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:9">2 Pet. iii. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His pride, and haughtiness, and abuse of that patience. He walked 
 <I>in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon,</I> in pomp and pride, 
 pleasing himself with the view of that vast city, which, with all the 
 territories thereunto belonging, was under his command, and <I>he 
 said,</I> either to himself or to those about him, perhaps some 
 foreigners to whom he was showing his kingdom and the glory of it, 
 <I>Is not this great Babylon?</I> Yes, it is great, of vast extent, no 
 less that forty-five miles compass within the walls. It is full of 
 inhabitants, and they are full of wealth. It is a <I>golden city,</I> 
 and that is enough to proclaim it great, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:4">Isa. xiv. 4</A>.

 See the grandeur of the houses, walls, towers, and public edifices.
 Every thing in Babylon he thinks looks great; "and this <I>great 
 Babylon I have built.</I>" Babylon was built many ages before he was 
 born, but because he fortified and beautified it, and we may suppose 
 much of it was rebuilt during his long and prosperous reign, he boasts 
 that he has built it, as Augustus C&aelig;sar boasted concerning Rome, 
 <I>Lateritiam inveni, marmoream reliqui--I found it brick, but I left 
 it marble.</I> He boasts that he built it <I>for the house of the 
 kingdom,</I> that is, the metropolis of his empire. This vast city, 
 compared with the countries that belonged to his dominions, was but as 
 one house. He built it with the assistance of his subjects, yet boasts 
 that he did it <I>by the might of his power;</I> he built it for his 
 security and convenience, yet, as if he had no occasion for it, boasts 
 that he built it purely <I>for the honour of his majesty.</I> Note, 
 Pride and self-conceitedness are sins that most easily beset great men, 
 who have great things in the world. They are apt to take the glory to 
 themselves which is due to God only.</P>

 III. His punishment for his pride. When he was thus strutting, and 
 vaunting himself, and adoring his own shadow, <I>while the</I> proud 
 <I>word was in the king's mouth</I> the powerful word came from heaven, 
 by which he was immediately deprived, 

 1. Of his honour as a king: <I>The kingdom has departed from thee.</I>
 When he thought he had erected impregnable bulwarks for the preserving 
 of his kingdom, now, in an instant, it <I>has departed from him;</I> 
 when he thought it so well guarded that none could take it from him, 
 behold, it departs of itself. As soon as he becomes utterly incapable
 to manage it, it is of course taken out of his hands. 

 2. He is deprived of his honour as a man. He loses his reason, and by
 that means loses his dominion: <I>They shall drive thee from men,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 And it was fulfilled 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>):

 he was <I>driven from men the same hour.</I> On a sudden he fell stark 
 mad, distracted in the highest degree that ever any man was. His 
 understanding and memory were gone, and all the faculties of a rational 
 soul broken, so that he became a perfect brute in the shape of a man.
 He went naked, and on all four, like a brute, did himself shun the 
 society of reasonable creatures and run wild into the fields and woods, 
 and was driven out by his own servants, who, after some time of trial, 
 despairing of his return to his right mind, abandoned him, and looked 
 after him no more. He had not the spirit of a beast of prey (that of 
 the royal lion), but of the abject and less honourable species, for he 
 was made to <I>eat grass as oxen;</I> and, probably, he did not speak 
 with human voice, but lowed like an ox. Some think that his body was 
 all covered with hair; however, <I>the hair</I> of his head and beard, 
 being never cut nor combed, grew like <I>eagles feathers,</I> and 
 <I>his nails like birds' claws.</I> Let us pause a little, and view 
 this miserable spectacle; and let us receive instruction from it. 

 (1.) Let us see here what a mercy it is to have the use of our reason,
 how thankful we ought to be for it, and how careful we ought to be not 
 to do any thing which may either provoke God or may have a natural 
 tendency to put us out of the possession of our own souls. Let us learn 
 how to value our own reason, and to pity the case of those that are 
 under the prevailing power of melancholy or distraction, or are 
 delirious, and to be very tender in our censures of them and conduct 
 towards them, for it is a trial common to men, and a case which, some 
 time or other, may be our own.

 (2.) Let us see here the vanity of human glory and greatness. Is this 
 Nebuchadnezzar the Great? What this despicable animal that is meaner 
 than the poorest beggar? Is this he that looked so glorious on the 
 throne, so formidable in the camp, that had politics enough to subdue 
 and govern kingdoms, and now has not so much sense as to keep his own 
 clothes on his back? <I>Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, 
 that did shake kingdoms?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:16">Isa. xiv. 16</A>.

 Never let the <I>wise man</I> then <I>glory in his wisdom,</I> nor
 <I>the mighty man in his strength.</I>

 (3.) Let us see here how God resists the proud, and delights to abase
 them and put contempt upon them. Nebuchadnezzar would be more than a
 man, and therefore God justly makes him less than a man, and puts him
 upon a level with the beasts who set up for a rival with his Maker. See

 <FONT SIZE=+1>34  And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine
 eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I
 blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth
 for ever, whose dominion <I>is</I> an everlasting dominion, and his
 kingdom <I>is</I> from generation to generation:
 &nbsp; 35  And all the inhabitants of the earth <I>are</I> reputed as
 nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of
 heaven, and <I>among</I> the inhabitants of the earth: and none can
 stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?
 &nbsp; 36  At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the
 glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me;
 and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was
 established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto
 me.
 &nbsp; 37  Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of
 heaven, all whose works <I>are</I> truth, and his ways judgment: and
 those that walk in pride he is able to abase.

 We have here Nebuchadnezzar's recovery from his distraction, and his 
 return to his right mind, <I>at the end of the days</I> prefixed, that 
 is, of the seven years. So long he continued a monument of God's 
 justice and a trophy of his victory over the children of pride, and he 
 was made more so by being struck mad than if he had been in an instant 
 struck dead with a thunderbolt; yet it was a mercy to him that he was 
 kept alive, for while there is life there is hope that we may yet 
 praise God, as he did here: <I>At the end of the days</I> (says he), 
 <I>I lifted up my eyes unto heaven</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 looked no longer down towards the earth as a beast, but begun to look 
 up as a man. <I>Os homini sublime dedit--Heaven gave to man an erect 
 countenance.</I> But there was more in it than this; he looked up as a 
 devout man, as a penitent, as a humble petitioner for mercy, being 
 perhaps never till now made sensible of his own misery. And now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He has the use of his reason so far restored to him that with it he 
 glorifies God, and humbles himself under his mighty hand. He was told 
 that he should continue in that forlorn case till he should know that 
 the Most High rules, and here we have him brought to the knowledge of 
 this: <I>My understanding returned to me, and I blessed the Most 
 High.</I> Note, Those may justly be reckoned void of understanding that 
 do not bless and praise God; nor do men ever rightly use their reason 
 till they begin to be religious, nor live as men till they live to the 
 glory of God. As reason is the substratum or subject of religion (so 
 that creatures which have no reason are not capable of religion), so 
 religion is the crown and glory of reason, and we have our reason in 
 vain, and shall one day wish we had never had it, if we do not glorify 
 God with it. This was the first act of Nebuchadnezzar's returning 
 reason; and, when this became the employment of it, he was then, and 
 not till then, qualified for all the other enjoyments of it. And till 
 he was for a great while disabled to exercise it in other things he 
 never was brought to apply it to this, which is the great end for which 
 our reason is given us. His folly was the means whereby he became wise; 
 he was not recovered by his dream of this judgment (that was soon 
 forgotten like a dream), but he is made to feel it, and then his <I>ear 
 is opened to discipline.</I> To bring him to himself, he must first be 
 <I>beside himself.</I> And by this it appears that what good thoughts 
 there were in his mind, and what good work was wrought there, were not 
 of himself (for he was not his own man), but it was the gift of God. 
 Let us see what Nebuchadnezzar is now at length effectually brought to 
 the acknowledgment of; and we may learn from it what to believe 
 concerning God. 

 1. That the <I>most high</I> God <I>lives for ever,</I> and his being
 knows neither change nor period, for he has it of himself. His 
 flatterers often complimented him with, <I>O king! live for ever.</I> 
 But he is now convinced that no king lives for ever, but the God of 
 Israel only, who is still the same. 

 2. That his kingdom is like himself, <I>everlasting,</I> and his
 <I>dominion from generation to generation;</I> there is no succession, 
 no revolution, in his kingdom. As he lives, so he reigns, for ever,
 and of his government there is no end. 

 3. That <I>all nations</I> before him are <I>as nothing.</I> He has no
 need of them; he makes no account of them. The greatest of men, in 
 comparison with him, are less than nothing. Those that think highly of 
 God think meanly of themselves. 

 4. That his kingdom is universal, and both <I>the armies of heaven</I>
 and <I>the inhabitants of the earth</I> are his subjects, and under his 
 check and control. Both angels and men are employed by him, and are 
 accountable to him; the highest angel is not above his command, nor the 
 meanest of the children of men beneath his cognizance. The angels of
 heaven are his armies, the inhabitants of the earth his tenants. 

 5. That his power is irresistible, and his sovereignty uncontrollable,
 for he <I>does according to his will,</I> according to his design and 
 purpose, according to his decree and counsel; whatever he pleases that 
 he does; whatever he appoints that he performs; and none can resist his 
 will, change his counsel, nor <I>stay his hand, nor say unto him, What 
 doest thou?</I> None can arraign his proceedings, enquire into the 
 meaning of them, nor demand a reason for them. Woe to him that strives 
 with his Maker, that says to him, <I>What doest thou?</I> Or, <I>Why 
 doest thou so?</I> 

 6. That every thing which God does is well done: His <I>works are
 truth,</I> for they all agree with his word. <I>His ways are 
 judgment,</I> both wise and righteous, exactly consonant to the rules 
 both of prudence and equity, and no fault is to be found with them. 

 7. That he has power to humble the haughtiest of his enemies that act
 in contradiction to him or competition with him: <I>Those that walk in 
 pride he is able to abuse</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>);

 he is able to deal with those that are most confident of their own 
 sufficiency to contend with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He has the use of his reason so far restored to him as with it to 
 re-enjoy himself, and the pleasures of his re-established prosperity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>):

 <I>At the same time my reason returned to me;</I> he had said before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>)

 that his <I>understanding returned</I> to him, and here he mentions it 
 again, for the use of our reason is a mercy we can never be 
 sufficiently thankful for. Now his <I>lords sought to him;</I> he did 
 not need to seek to them, and they soon perceived, not only that he had 
 recovered his reason and was fit to rule, but that he had recovered it 
 with advantage, and was more fit to rule than ever. It is probable that 
 the dream and the interpretation of it were well known, and much talked 
 of, at court; and the former part of the prediction being fulfilled, 
 that he should go distracted, they doubted not but that, according to 
 the prediction, he should come to himself again at seven years' end, 
 and, in confidence of that, when the time had expired they were ready 
 to receive him; and then <I>his honour and brightness returned to 
 him,</I> the same that he had before his madness seized him. He is now 
 established in his kingdom as firmly as if there had been no 
 interruption given him. <I>He becomes a fool, that he may be wise,</I> 
 wiser than ever; and he that but the other day was in the depth of 
 disgrace and ignominy has now <I>excellent majesty added to him,</I> 
 beyond what he had when he went from kingdom to kingdom conquering and 
 to conquer. Note, 

 1. When men are brought to honour God, particularly by a penitent
 confession of sin and a believing acknowledgment of his sovereignty, 
 then, and not till then, they may expect that God will put honour upon 
 them, will not only restore them to the dignity they lost by the sin of 
 the first Adam, but <I>add excellent majesty to them</I> from the 
 righteousness and grace of the second Adam. 

 2. Afflictions shall last no longer than till they have done the work
 for which they were sent. When this prince is brought to own God's
 dominion over himself. 

 3. All the accounts we take and give of God's dealing with us ought to
 conclude with praises to him. When Nebuchadnezzar is restored to his 
 kingdom he <I>praises, and extols, and honours the King of heaven</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>),

 before he applies himself to his secular business. Therefore we have
 our reason, that we may be in a capacity of praising him, and therefore 
 our prosperity, that we may have cause to praise him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It was not long after this that Nebuchadnezzar ended his life and 
 reign. Abydenus, quoted by Eusebius (Pr&aelig;p. Evang. 1. 9), reports, from
 the tradition of the Chaldeans, that upon his death-bed he foretold the 
 taking of Babylon by Cyrus. Whether he continued in the same good mind
 that here he seems to have been in we are not told, nor does any thing 
 appear to the contrary but that he did: and, if so great a 
 <I>blasphemer and persecutor</I> did find mercy, he was not the last. 
 And, if our charity may reach so far as to hope he did, we must admire 
 free grace, by which he lost his wits for a while that he might save 
 his soul for ever.</P>
