 This chapter reads the Philistines their doom, as the former read the 
 Egyptians theirs and by the same hand, that of Nebuchadnezzar. It is 
 short, but terrible; and Tyre and Zidon, though they lay at some 
 distance from them, come in sharers with them in the destruction here 
 threatened. 

 I. It is foretold that the forces of the northern crowns should come
 upon them, to their great terror,

 II. That the war should continue long, and their endeavours to put an
 end to it should be in vain, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+47:6,7">ver. 6-7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> that came to Jeremiah the prophet
 against the Philistines, before that Pharaoh smote Gaza.
 &nbsp; 2  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Behold, waters rise up out of the north,
 and shall be an overflowing flood, and shall overflow the land,
 and all that is therein; the city, and them that dwell therein:
 then the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall
 howl.
 &nbsp; 3  At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong
 <I>horses,</I> at the rushing of his chariots, <I>and at</I> the rumbling
 of his wheels, the fathers shall not look back to <I>their</I>
 children for feebleness of hands;
 &nbsp; 4  Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines,
 <I>and</I> to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that
 remaineth: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will spoil the Philistines, the remnant
 of the country of Caphtor.
 &nbsp; 5  Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off <I>with</I> the
 remnant of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself?
 &nbsp; 6  O thou sword of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, how long <I>will it be</I> ere thou be
 quiet? put up thyself into thy scabbard, rest, and be still.
 &nbsp; 7  How can it be quiet, seeing the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath given it a charge
 against Ashkelon, and against the sea shore? there hath he
 appointed it.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As the Egyptians had often proved false friends, so the Philistines had 
 always been sworn enemies, to the Israel of God, and the more dangerous 
 and vexatious for their being such near neighbours to them. They were 
 considerably humbled in David's time, but, it seems they had got head 
 again and were a considerable people till Nebuchadnezzar cut them off 
 with their neighbours, which is the event here foretold. The date of 
 this prophecy is observable; it was <I>before Pharaoh</I> smote Gaza. 
 When this blow was given to Gaza by the king of Egypt is not certain, 
 whether in his expedition against Carchemish or in his return thence, 
 after he had slain Josiah, or when he afterwards came with design to 
 relieve Jerusalem; but this is mentioned here to show that this word of 
 the Lord came to Jeremiah against the Philistines when they were in 
 their full strength and lustre, themselves and their cities in good 
 condition, in no peril from any adversary or evil occurrent. When no 
 disturbance of their repose was foreseen by any human probabilities, 
 yet then Jeremiah foretold their ruin, which Pharaoh's smiting Gaza 
 soon after would be but an earnest of, and, as it were, the beginning 
 of sorrows to that country. It is here foretold, 

 1. That a foreign enemy and a very formidable one shall be brought upon 
 them: <I>Waters rise up out of the north,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+47:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Waters sometimes signify multitudes of people and nations 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:15">Rev. xvii. 15</A>),
 
 sometimes great and threatening calamities 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:1">Ps. lxix. 1</A>);

 here they signify both. They <I>rise out of the north,</I> whence fair
 weather and the wind that drives away rain are said to come; but now a 
 terrible storm comes out of that cold climate. The Chaldean army shall
 overflow the land like a deluge. Probably this happened before the 
 destruction of Jerusalem, for it should seem that in Gedaliah's time, 
 which was just after, the army of the Chaldeans was quite withdrawn out 
 of those parts. The country of the Philistines was but of small extent, 
 so that it would soon be overwhelmed by so vast an army.

 2. That they shall all be in a consternation upon it. The men shall
 have no heart to fight, but shall sit down and cry like children: 
 <I>All the inhabitants of the land shall howl,</I> so that nothing but 
 lamentation shall be heard in all places. The occasion of the fright is 
 elegantly described,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+47:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Before it comes to killing and slaying, the very <I>stamping of the 
 horses</I> and <I>rattling of the chariots,</I> when the enemy makes 
 his approach, shall strike a terror upon the people, to such a degree 
 that parents in their fright shall seem void of natural affection, 
 <I>for they shall not look back to their children,</I> to provide for 
 their safety, or so much as to see what becomes of them. Their
 <I>hands shall be so feeble</I> that they shall despair of carrying 
 them off with them, and therefore they shall not care for seeing them, 
 but leave them to take their lot; or they shall be in such a 
 consternation that they shall quite forget even those pieces of 
 themselves. Let none be over-fond of their children, nor dote upon 
 them, since such distress may come that they may either wish they had 
 none or forget that they have, and have no heart to look upon them.

 3. That the country of the Philistines shall be spoiled and laid
 waste, and the other countries adjoining to them and in alliance with 
 them. It is a day <I>to spoil the Philistines, for the Lord will spoil 
 them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+47:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Note, Those whom God will spoil must needs be spoiled; for, <I>if God 
 be against them, who can be for them?</I> Tyre and Zidon were strong 
 and wealthy cities, and they used to help the Philistines in a strait, 
 but now they shall themselves be involved in the common ruin, and God 
 will cut off from them every <I>helper that remains.</I> Note, Those 
 that trust to help from creatures will find it cut off when they most 
 need it and will thereby be put into the utmost confusion. Who the 
 <I>remnant of the country of Caphtor</I> were is uncertain, but we find 
 that the Caphtorim were near akin to the Philistines 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:14">Gen. x. 14</A>),

 and probably when their own country was destroyed such as remained came
 and settled with their kinsmen the Philistines, and were now spoiled 
 with them. Some particular places are here named, <I>Gaza, and 
 Ashkelon,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+47:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 <I>Baldness has come upon them;</I> the invaders have stripped them of 
 all their ornaments, or they have made themselves bald in token of 
 extreme grief, and they are <I>cut off,</I> with the other cities that 
 were in the plain or valley about them. The products of their fruitful 
 valley shall be <I>spoiled,</I> and made a prey of, by the conquerors. 
 
 4. That these calamities should continue long. The prophet, in the
 foresight of this, with his usual tenderness, asks them first 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+47:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),
 
 <I>How long will you cut yourselves,</I> as men in extreme sorrow and 
 anguish do? O how tedious will the calamity be! not only cutting, but 
 long cutting. But he turns from the effect to the cause: <I>They cut 
 themselves,</I> for the sword of the Lord cuts them. And therefore, 
 
 (1.) He bespeaks that to be still
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+47:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>O thou sword of the Lord! how long will it be ere thou be
 quiet?</I> He begs it would <I>put up itself into the scabbard,</I> 
 would devour no more flesh, drink no more blood. This expresses the 
 prophet's earnest desire to see an end of the war, looking with 
 compassion, as became a man, even upon the Philistines themselves, when 
 their country was made desolate by the sword. Note, War is the <I>sword 
 of the Lord;</I> with it he punishes the crimes of his enemies and 
 pleads the cause of his own people. When war is once begun it often
 lasts long; the sword, once drawn, does not quickly find the way into 
 the scabbard again; nay, some when they draw the sword throw away the 
 scabbard, for they <I>delight in war.</I> So deplorable are the 
 desolations of war that the blessings of peace cannot but be very 
 desirable. O that <I>swords might be beaten into ploughshares!</I> 

 (2.) Yet he gives a satisfactory account of the continuance of the war
 and stops the mouth of his own complaint

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+47:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>How can it be quiet, seeing the Lord hath given it a charge</I> 
 against such and such places, particularly specified in its commission?
 <I>There hath he appointed it.</I> Note, 

 [1.] The sword of war hath its charge from the Lord of hosts. Every 
 bullet has its charge; you call them blind bullets, but they are 
 directed by an all-seeing God. The war itself has its charge; he saith 
 to it, <I>Go, and it goes--Come, and it comes--Do this, and it does 
 it;</I> for he is commander-in-chief. 

 [2.] When the sword is drawn we cannot expect it should be sheathed
 till it has fulfilled its charge. As the word of God, so his rod and
 his sword, shall accomplish that for which he sends them.</P>
