 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HOUGH</FONT> this prophet appeared a little before
 Isaiah, yet he was not, as some have mistaken, that Amos who was the
 father of Isaiah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:1">Isa. i. 1</A>),

 for in the Hebrew their names are very different; their families too
 were of a different character, for Isaiah was a courtier, Amos a 
 country-farmer. Amos signifies a <I>burden,</I> whence the Jews have a 
 tradition that he was of a slow tongue and spoke with stammering lips; 
 we may rather, in allusion to his name, say that his speech was 
 <I>weighty</I> and his word the <I>burden of the Lord.</I> He was (as 
 most think) of Judah, yet prophesied chiefly against Israel, and at
 Bethel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:13"><I>ch.</I> vii. 13</A>.

 Some think his style savours of his extraction, and is more plain and 
 rustic than that of some other of the prophets; I do not see it so; but 
 it is plain that his matter agreed with that of his contemporary Hosea, 
 that <I>out of the mouth of these two witnesses the word might be 
 established.</I> It appears by his contest with Amaziah the priest of 
 Bethel that he met with opposition in his work, but was a man of 
 undaunted resolution in it, faithful and bold in reproving sin and
 denouncing the judgments of God for it, and pressing in his 
 exhortations to repentance and reformation. He begins with
 threatenings against the neighbouring nations that were enemies to 
 Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+1:1-2:32"><I>ch.</I> i. and ii.</A>

 He then calls Israel to account, and judges them for their idolatry,
 their unworthy walking under the favours God had bestowed upon them, 
 and their incorrigibleness under his judgments,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:1-4:13"><I>ch.</I> iii. and iv.</A>

 He calls them to repentance
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:1-27">
 <I>ch.</I> v.</A>),

 rejecting their hypocritical sacrifices unless they did repent. He 
 foretels the desolations that were coming upon them notwithstanding 
 their security 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:1-14"><I>ch.</I> vi.</A>),

 some particular judgments
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:1-17"><I>ch.</I> vii.</A>),

 particularly on Amaziah; and, after other reproofs and threatenings

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+8:1-9:15"><I>ch.</I> viii. and ix.</A>),
 
 concludes with a promise of the setting up of the Messiah's kingdom and
 the happiness of God's spiritual Israel therein, just as the prophecy 
 of Joel concluded. These prophets, having opened the wound in their 
 reproofs and threatenings, which show all wrong, in the promises of 
 gospel-grace open the remedy, which alone will set all to rights.</P>
