 In this chapter, 

 I. God convicts the Jews of the sin of idolatry by the notorious
 evidence of the fact, and condemns them to captivity for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. He shows them the folly of all their carnal confidences, which
 should stand them in no stead when God's time came to contend with 
 them, and that this was one of the sins upon which his controversy with 
 them was grounded, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:5-11">ver. 5-11</A>.

 III. The prophet makes his appeal and address to God upon occasion of
 the malice of his enemies against him, committing himself to the divine
 protection, and begging of God to appear for him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:12-18">ver. 12-18</A>.

 IV. God, by the prophet, warns the people to keep holy the sabbath day, 
 assuring them that, if they did, it should be the lengthening out of 
 their tranquility, but that, if not, God would by some desolating 
 judgment assert the honour of his sabbaths,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The sin of Judah <I>is</I> written with a pen of iron, <I>and</I> with
 the point of a diamond: <I>it is</I> graven upon the table of their
 heart, and upon the horns of your altars;
 &nbsp; 2  Whilst their children remember their altars and their groves
 by the green trees upon the high hills.
 &nbsp; 3  O my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance <I>and</I>
 all thy treasures to the spoil, <I>and</I> thy high places for sin,
 throughout all thy borders.
 &nbsp; 4  And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage
 that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in
 the land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in
 mine anger, <I>which</I> shall burn for ever.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The people had asked 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:10"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 10</A>),

 <I>What is our iniquity, and what is our sin?</I> as if they could not
 be charged with any thing worth speaking of, for which God should enter 
 into judgment with them; their challenge was answered there, but here 
 we have a further reply to it, in which,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The indictment is fully proved upon the prisoners, both the fact and 
 the fault; their sin is too plain to be denied and too bad to be 
 excused, and they have nothing to plead either in extenuation of the 
 crime or in arrest and mitigation of the judgment. 

 1. They cannot plead, <I>Not guilty,</I> for their sins are upon record
 in the book of God's omniscience and their own conscience; nay, and 
 they are obvious to the eye and observation of the world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 They are <I>written</I> before God in the most legible and indelible 
 characters, and <I>sealed among his treasures,</I> never to be 
 forgotten, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:34">Deut. xxxii. 34</A>.

 They are written there with <I>a pen of iron and with the point of a
 diamond;</I> what is so written will not be worn out by time, but is, 
 as Job speaks, <I>graven in the rock for ever.</I> Note, The sin of
 sinners is never forgotten till it is forgiven. It is ever before God, 
 till by repentance it comes to be ever before us. <I>It is graven upon 
 the table of their heart;</I> their own consciences witness against 
 them, and are instead of a thousand witnesses. What is <I>graven on the 
 heart,</I> though it may be covered and closed up for a time, yet, 
 being graven, it cannot be erased, but will be produced in evidence 
 when the books shall be opened. Nay, we need not appeal to the tables 
 of the heart, perhaps they will not own the convictions of their 
 consciences. We need go no further, for proof of the charge, than 
 <I>the horns of their altars,</I> on which the blood of their 
 idolatrous sacrifices was sprinkled, and perhaps the names of the idols 
 to whose honour they were erected were inscribed. Their neighbours
 will witness against them, and all the creatures they have abused by 
 using them in the service of their lusts. To complete the evidence, 
 their own children shall be witnesses against them; they will tell 
 truth when their fathers dissemble and prevaricate; they <I>remember 
 the altars and the groves</I> to which their parents took them when 
 they were little,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 It appears that they were full of them, and acquainted with them 
 betimes, they talked of them so frequently, so familiarly, and with so 
 much delight. 

 2. They cannot plead that they repent, or are brought to a better mind. 
 No, as the guilt of their sin is undeniable, so their inclination to 
 sin is invincible and incurable. In this sense many understand 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.
 
 Their sin is deeply <I>engraven</I> as with <I>a pen of iron in the 
 tables of their hearts.</I> They have a rooted affection to it; it is 
 woven into their very nature; their sin is dear to them, as that is 
 dear to us of which we say, It is <I>engraven on our hearts.</I> The 
 bias of their minds is still as strong as ever towards their idols, and 
 they are not wrought upon either by the word or rod of God to forget 
 them and abate their affection to them. It is written <I>upon the horns 
 of their altars,</I> for they have given up their names to their idols 
 and resolve to abide by what they have done; they have bound 
 themselves, as with cords, to the horns of their altars. And 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>

 may be read fully to this sense: <I>As they remember their children, so
 remember they their altars and their groves;</I> they are as fond of 
 them and take as much pleasure in them as men do in their own children, 
 and are as loth to part with them; they will live and die with their 
 idols, and can no more forget them than <I>a woman</I> can <I>forget 
 her sucking child.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The indictment being thus fully proved, the judgment is affirmed 
 and the sentence ratified, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 Forasmuch as they are thus wedded to their sins, and will not part with 
 them,

 1. They shall be made to part with their treasures, and those shall be
 given into the hands of strangers. Jerusalem is God's <I>mountain in 
 the field;</I> it was built on a hill in the midst of a plain. <I>All 
 the treasures</I> of that wealthy city will God <I>give to the 
 spoil.</I> Or, <I>My mountains with the fields, thy wealth and all thy 
 treasures will I expose to spoil;</I> both the products of the country 
 and the stores of the city shall be seized by the Chaldeans. Justly are 
 men stripped of that which they have served their idols with and have 
 made the food and the fuel of their lusts. <I>My mountain</I> (so the 
 whole land was, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:54,De+11:11">Ps. lxxviii. 54, Deut. xi. 11</A>)

 you have turned into <I>your high places for sin,</I> have worshipped
 your idols upon <I>the high hills</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),
 
 and now they shall be <I>give for a spoil in all your borders.</I> What 
 we make for a sin God will make for a spoil; for what comfort can we 
 expect in that wherewith God is dishonoured? 

 2. They shall be made to part with their inheritance, and shall be 
 carried captives into a strange land

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Thou, even thyself</I> (or <I>thou thyself and those that are in 
 thee,</I> all the inhabitants), <I>shall discontinue from thy heritage 
 that I gave thee.</I> God owns that it was their heritage, and that he 
 gave it to them; they had an unquestionable title to it, which was an 
 aggravation of their folly in throwing themselves out of the possession 
 of it. It is <I>through thyself</I> (so some read it), through thy own 
 default, that thou art disseised. <I>Thou shalt discontinue,</I> or 
 <I>intermit,</I> the occupation of thy land. The law appointed them to 
 <I>let their land rest</I> (it is the word here used) one year in 
 seven, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:11">Exod. xxiii. 11</A>.

 They did not observe that law, and now God would compel them to <I>let
 it rest</I> (the land shall <I>enjoy her sabbaths,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:34">Lev. xxvi. 34</A>);

 and yet it shall be not rest to them; they shall <I>serve their enemies 
 in a land they know not.</I> Observe, 

 (1.) Sin works a discontinuance of our comforts and deprives us of the 
 enjoyment of that which God has given us. Yet, 

 (2.) A discontinuance of the possession is not a defeasance of the 
 right, but it is intimated that upon their repentance they shall 
 recover possession again. For the present, <I>you have kindled a fire 
 in my anger,</I> which burns so fiercely that it seems as if it would 
 burn <I>for ever;</I> and so it will unless you repent, for it is the 
 anger of an everlasting God fastening upon the immortal souls, and 
 <I>who knows the power of that anger?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is excellent doctrine that is preached in these verses, and of 
 general concern and use to us all, and it does not appear to have any 
 particular reference to the present state of Judah and Jerusalem. The 
 prophet's sermons were not all prophetical, but some of them practical; 
 yet this discourse, which probably we have here only the heads of, 
 would be of singular use to them by way of caution not to misplace 
 their confidence in the day of their distress. Let us all learn what we 
 are taught here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Concerning the disappointment and vexation those will certainly meet 
 with who depend upon creatures for success and relief when they are in 
 trouble 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>):

 <I>Cursed be the man that trusts in man.</I> God pronounces him cursed 
 for the affront he thereby puts upon him. Or, <I>Cursed</I> (that is, 
 miserable) <I>is the man</I> that does so, for he leans upon a broken 
 reed, which will not only fail him, but will <I>run into his hand and 
 pierce it.</I> Observe, 

 1. The sin here condemned; it is <I>trusting in man,</I> putting that
 confidence in the wisdom and power, the kindness and faithfulness, of 
 men, which should be placed in those attributes of God only, making our 
 applications to men and raising our expectations from them as principal 
 agents, whereas they are but instruments in the hand of Providence. It 
 is <I>making flesh the arm</I> we stay upon, the arm we work with and 
 with which we hope to work our point, the arm under which we shelter 
 ourselves and on which we depend for protection. God is his people's
 <I>arm,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:2">Isa. xxxii. 2</A>.

 We must not think to make any creature to be that to us which God has
 undertaken to be. Man is called <I>flesh,</I> to show the folly of 
 those that make him their confidence; he is flesh, weak and feeble as 
 flesh without bones or sinews, that has no strength at all in it; he is 
 inactive as flesh without spirit, which is a dead thing; he is mortal 
 and dying as flesh, which soon putrefies and corrupts, and is 
 continually wasting. Nay, he is false and sinful, and has lost his 
 integrity; so his being flesh signifies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:3">Gen. vi. 3</A>.

 The great malignity there is in this sin; it is the <I>departure of the
 evil heart of unbelief from the living God.</I> Those that trust in man 
 perhaps draw nigh to God with their mouth and honour him with their 
 lips, they call him their hope and say that they trust in him, but 
 really <I>their heart departs from him;</I> they distrust him, despise 
 him, and decline a correspondence with him. Cleaving to the cistern is
 leaving the fountain, and is resented accordingly.

 3. The fatal consequences of this sin. He that puts a confidence in man
 puts a cheat upon himself; for

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 <I>he shall be like the heath in the desert,</I> a sorry shrub, the 
 product of barren ground, sapless, useless, and worthless; his comforts 
 shall all fail him and his hopes be blasted; he shall wither, be 
 dejected in himself and trampled on by all about him. <I>When good
 comes</I> he <I>shall not see it,</I> he shall not share in it; when 
 the times mend they shall not mend with him, but he shall <I>inhabit 
 the parched places in the wilderness;</I> his expectation shall be 
 continually frustrated; when others have a harvest he shall have none. 
 Those that trust to their own righteousness and strength, and think 
 they can do well enough without the merit and grace of Christ, thus 
 <I>make flesh their arm,</I> and their souls cannot prosper in graces 
 or comforts; they can neither produce the fruits of acceptable services 
 to God nor reap the fruits of saving blessings from him; they <I>dwell 
 in a dry land.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Concerning the abundant satisfaction which those have, and will 
 have, who make God their confidence, who live by faith in his 
 providence and promise, who refer themselves to him and his guidance at 
 all times and repose themselves in him and his love in the most unquiet 
 times, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. The duty required of us--to <I>trust in the Lord,</I> to do our duty 
 to him and then depend upon him to bear us out in doing it--when 
 creatures and second causes either deceive or threaten us, either are 
 false to us or fierce against us, to commit ourselves to God as 
 all-sufficient both to fill up the place of those who fail us and to 
 protect us from those who set upon us. It is to <I>make the Lord our 
 hope,</I> his favour the good we hope for and his power the strength we 
 hope in. 

 2. The comfort that attends the doing of this duty. He that does so 
 shall be <I>as a tree planted by the waters,</I> a choice tree, about 
 which great care has been taken to set it in the best soil, so far from 
 being like <I>the heath in the wilderness;</I> he shall be like a tree 
 that <I>spreads out its roots,</I> and thereby is firmly fixed, spreads 
 them out <I>by the rivers,</I> whence it draws abundance of sap, which 
 denotes both the establishment and the comfort which those have who 
 make God their hope; they are easy, they are pleasant, and enjoy a 
 continual security and serenity of mind. A tree thus planted, thus 
 watered, shall <I>not see when heat comes,</I> shall not sustain any 
 damage from the most scorching heats of summer; it is so well moistened 
 from its roots that it shall be sufficiently guarded against drought. 
 Those that make God their hope,

 (1.) They shall flourish in credit and comfort, like a tree that is 
 <I>always green,</I> whose leaf does not wither; they shall be cheerful 
 to themselves and beautiful in the eyes of others. Those who thus give 
 honour to God by giving him credit God will put honour upon, and make 
 them the ornament and delight of the places where they live, as green 
 trees are. 

 (2.) They shall be fixed in an inward peace and satisfaction: They 
 <I>shall not be careful in a year of drought,</I> when there is want of 
 rain; for, as the tree has <I>seed in itself,</I> so it has <I>its 
 moisture.</I> Those who make God their hope have enough in him to make 
 up the want of all creature-comforts. We need not be solicitous about 
 the breaking of a cistern as long as we have the fountain. 

 (3.) They shall be fruitful in holiness, and in all good works. Those 
 who trust in God, and by faith derive strength and grace from him, 
 <I>shall not cease from yielding fruit;</I> they shall still be enabled 
 to do that which will redound to the glory of God, the benefit of 
 others, and their own account.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Concerning the sinfulness of man's heart, and the divine 
 inspection it is always under, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 It is folly to trust in man, for he is not only frail, but false and 
 deceitful. We are apt to think that we trust in God, and are entitled 
 to the blessings here promised to those who do so. But this is a thing 
 about which our own hearts deceive us as much as any thing. We think 
 that we trust in God when really we do not, as appears by this, that 
 our hopes and fears rise or fall according as second causes smile or 
 frown.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is true in general. 

 (1.) There is that wickedness in our hearts which we ourselves are not 
 aware of and do not suspect to be there; nay, it is a common mistake 
 among the children of men to think themselves, their own hearts at 
 least, a great deal better than they really are. <I>The heart,</I> the 
 conscience of man, in his corrupt and fallen state, <I>is deceitful 
 above all things.</I> It is subtle and false; it is apt to 
 <I>supplant</I> (so the word properly signifies); it is that from which 
 Jacob had his name, a <I>supplanter.</I> It calls evil good and good 
 evil, puts false colours upon things, and cries peace to those to whom 
 peace does not belong. When men say in their hearts (that is, suffer 
 their hearts to whisper to them) that there is no God, or he does not 
 see, or he will not require, or they shall have peace though they go 
 on; in these, and a thousand similar suggestions the heart is 
 deceitful. It cheats men into their own ruin; and this will be the 
 aggravation of it, that they are self-deceivers, self-destroyers. 
 Herein the heart is <I>desperately wicked;</I> it is deadly, it is 
 desperate. The case is bad indeed, and in a manner deplorable and past 
 relief, if the conscience which should rectify the errors of the other 
 faculties is itself a mother of falsehood and a ring-leader in the 
 delusion. What will become of a man if that in him which should be 
 <I>the candle of the Lord</I> give a false light, if God's deputy in 
 the soul, that is entrusted to support his interests, betrays them?
 Such is the deceitfulness of the heart that we may truly say, <I>Who 
 can know it?</I> Who can describe how bad the heart is? We cannot know 
 our own hearts, not what they will do in an hour of temptation 
 (Hezekiah did not, Peter did not), not what corrupt dispositions there 
 are in them, nor in how many things they have turned aside; who can 
 understand his errors? Much less can we know the hearts of others, or 
 have any dependence upon them. But, 

 (2.) Whatever wickedness there is in the heart God sees it, and knows 
 it, is perfectly acquainted with it and apprised of it: <I>I the Lord 
 search the heart.</I> This is true of all that is in the heart, all the 
 thoughts of it, the quickest, and those that are most carelessly 
 overlooked by ourselves--all the intents of it, the closest, and those 
 that are most artfully disguised, and industriously concealed from 
 others. Men may be imposed upon, but God cannot. He not only searches 
 the heart with a piercing eye, but he tries the reins, to pass a 
 judgment upon what he discovers, to give every thing its true character 
 and due weight. He tries it, as the gold is tried whether it be 
 standard or no, as the prisoner is tried whether he be guilty or no.
 And this judgment which he makes of the heart is in order to his 
 passing judgment upon the man; it is <I>to give to every man according 
 to his ways</I> (according to the desert and the tendency of them, life 
 to those that walked in the ways of life, and death to those that 
 persisted in <I>the paths of the destroyer) and according to the fruit 
 of his doings,</I> the effect and influence his doings have had upon 
 others, or according to what is settled by the word of God to be the 
 fruit of men's doings, blessings to the obedient and curses to the 
 disobedient. Note, <I>Therefore</I> God is <I>Judge himself,</I> and he 
 alone, because he, and none besides, knows the hearts of the children 
 of men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It is true especially of all the deceitfulness and wickedness of the 
 heart, all its corrupt devices, desires, and designs. God observes and 
 discerns them; and (which is more than any man can do) he judges of the 
 overt act by the heart. Note, God knows more evil of us than we do of 
 ourselves, which is a good reason why we should not flatter ourselves, 
 but always stand in awe of the judgment of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Concerning the curse that attends wealth unjustly gotten. Fraud and 
 violence had been reigning crying sins in Judah and Jerusalem; now the 
 prophet would have those who had been guilty of these sins, and were 
 now stripped of all they had, to read their sin in their punishment 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>He that gets riches and not by right,</I> though he may make them 
 his hope, shall never have joy of them. Observe, It is possible that 
 those who use unlawful means to get wealth may succeed therein and 
 prosper for a time; and it is a temptation to many to defraud and 
 oppress their neighbours when there is money to be got by it. He who 
 has got <I>treasures</I> by <I>vanity</I> and a <I>lying tongue</I> may 
 hug himself in his success, and say, <I>I am rich;</I> nay, and I am 
 innocent too 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:8">Hos. xii. 8</A>),

 but <I>he shall leave them in the midst of his days;</I> they shall be
 taken from him, or he from them; God shall cut him off with some 
 surprising stroke then when he says, <I>Soul, take thy ease, thou hast 
 goods laid up for many years,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:19,20">Luke xii. 19, 20</A>.

 He shall leave them to he knows not whom, and shall not be able to take
 any of his riches away with him. It intimates what a great vexation it 
 is to a worldly man at death that he must leave his riches behind him; 
 and justly may it be a terror to those who got them unjustly, for, 
 though the wealth will not follow them to another world, the guilt 
 will, and the torment of an everlasting, <I>Son, remember,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:25">Luke xvi. 25</A>.

 Thus, <I>at his end, he shall be a fool,</I> a Nabal, whose wealth did
 him no good, which he had so sordidly hoarded, when <I>his heart</I> 
 became <I>dead as a stone.</I> He was a fool all along; sometimes 
 perhaps his own conscience told him so, but <I>at his end</I> he will 
 appear to be so. Those are fools indeed who are fools in <I>their
 latter end;</I> and such multitudes will prove who were applauded as 
 <I>wise men,</I> that did <I>well for themselves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:13,18">Ps. xlix. 13, 18</A>.
 
 Those that get grace will be wise <I>in the latter end,</I> will have
 the comfort of it in death and the benefit of it to eternity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+19:20">Prov. xix. 20</A>);

 but those that place their happiness in the wealth of the world, and, 
 right or wrong, <I>will be rich,</I> will rue the folly of it when it 
 is too late to rectify the fatal mistake. This is like <I>the partridge 
 that sits on eggs and hatches them not,</I> but they are broken (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:15">Job xxxix. 15</A>),
 
 or stolen (as
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:14">Isa. x. 14</A>),

 or they become addle: some sort of fowl there was, well known among the
 Jews, whose case this commonly was. The rich man takes a great deal of 
 pains to get an estate together, and sits brooding upon it, but never 
 has any comfort nor satisfaction in it; his projects to enrich himself 
 by sinful courses miscarry and come to nothing. Let us therefore be 
 wise in time--what we get to get it honestly, and what we have to use 
 it charitably, that we may lay up in store a good foundation and be 
 wise for eternity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, as often before, we have the prophet retired for private 
 meditation, and <I>alone with God.</I> Those ministers that would have 
 comfort in their work must be much so. In his converse here with God 
 and his own heart he takes the liberty which devout souls sometimes use 
 in their soliloquies, to pass from one thing to another, without tying 
 themselves too strictly to the laws of method and coherence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He acknowledges the great favour of God to his people in setting up 
 a revealed religion among them, and dignifying them with divine 
 institutions 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>A glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our 
 sanctuary.</I> The temple at Jerusalem, where God manifested his 
 special presence, where the lively oracles were lodged, where the 
 people paid their homage to their Sovereign, and whither they fled for 
 refuge in distress, was the <I>place of their sanctuary.</I> That was a 
 <I>glorious high throne.</I> It was a throne of holiness, which made it 
 truly glorious; it was God's throne, which made it truly high. 
 Jerusalem is called <I>the city of the great King,</I> not only 
 Israel's King, but the King of the whole earth, so that it might justly 
 be deemed the metropolis, or royal city, of the world. It was <I>from 
 the beginning,</I> so, from the first projecting of it by David and 
 building of it by Solomon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+2:9">2 Chron. ii. 9</A>.

 It was the honour of Israel that God set up such a glorious throne
 among them. <I>As the glorious and high throne</I> (that is, heaven) 
 <I>is the place of our sanctuary;</I> so some read it. Note, All good 
 men have a high value and veneration for the ordinances of God, and 
 reckon the place of the sanctuary a glorious high throne. Jeremiah here 
 mentions this either as a plea with God for mercy to their land, in 
 honour of the <I>throne of his glory</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:21"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 21</A>),

 or as an aggravation of the sin of his people in forsaking God though
 his throne was among them, and so profaning his crown and the place of 
 his sanctuary.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He acknowledges the righteousness of God in abandoning those to 
 ruin that forsook him and revolted from their allegiance to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 He speaks it to God, as subscribing both to the certainty and to the 
 equity of it: <I>O Lord! the hope of</I> those in Israel that adhere to 
 thee, <I>all that forsake thee shall be ashamed.</I> They must of 
 necessity be so, for they forsake thee for lying vanities, which will 
 deceive them and make them ashamed. They will be ashamed, for they 
 shame themselves. They will justly be put to shame, for they have 
 forsaken him who alone can keep them in countenance when troubles come. 
 <I>Let them be ashamed</I> (so some read it); and so it is a pious 
 imprecation of the wrath of God upon them, or a petition for his grace, 
 to make them penitently ashamed. "<I>Those that depart from me,</I> 
 from the word of God which I have preached, do in effect depart from 
 God;" as those that return to God are said to return to the prophet, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:19"><I>ch.</I> xv. 19</A>.

 <I>Those that depart from thee</I> (so some read it) shall be
 <I>written in the earth.</I> They shall soon be blotted out, as that is 
 which is written in the dust. They shall be trampled upon and exposed 
 to contempt. They belong to the earth, and shall be numbered among 
 earthly people, who lay up their treasure on earth and whose names are 
 not <I>written in heaven.</I> And they deserve to be thus written with 
 the fools in Israel, that their folly may be made manifest unto all, 
 because they have <I>forsaken the Lord, the fountain of living 
 waters</I> (that is, spring waters), and that for broken cisterns. 
 Note, God is to all that are his a <I>fountain of living waters.</I> 
 There is a fulness of comfort in him, an over-flowing ever-flowing 
 fulness, like that of a fountain; it is always fresh, and clear, and 
 clean, like spring water, while the pleasures of sin are puddle-waters. 
 They are free to it; it is not a <I>fountain sealed.</I> They deserve 
 therefore to be condemned, as Adam, to <I>red earth,</I> to which by 
 the corruption of their nature they are allied, because they have 
 forsaken the <I>garden of the Lord,</I> which is so well-watered. Those 
 that depart from God are <I>written in the earth.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He prays to God for healing saving mercy for himself. "If the case 
 of those that depart from God be so miserable, let me always draw nigh 
 to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:27,28">Ps. lxxiii. 27, 28</A>),

 and, in order to do that, Lord, <I>heal me,</I> and <I>save me,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Heal my backslidings, my bent to backslide, and save me from being 
 carried away by the strength of the stream to forsake thee." He was 
 wounded in spirit with grief upon many accounts. "Lord, <I>heal me</I>
 with thy comforts, and make me easy." He was continually exposed to the 
 malice of unreasonable men. "Lord, <I>save me</I> from them, and let me 
 not fall into their wicked hands. <I>Heal me,</I> that is, sanctify me 
 by thy grace; <I>save me,</I> that is, bring me to thy glory." All that 
 shall be saved hereafter are sanctified now; unless the disease of sin 
 be purged out the soul cannot live. To enforce this petition he pleads, 

 1. The firm belief he had of God's power: <I>Heal thou me, and then I 
 shall be healed;</I> the cure will certainly be wrought if thou 
 undertake it; it will be a thorough cure and not a palliative one. 
 Those that come to God to be healed ought to be abundantly satisfied in 
 the all-sufficiency of their physician. <I>Save me,</I> and <I>then I 
 shall</I> certainly <I>be saved,</I> be my dangers and enemies ever so 
 threatening. If God hold us up, we shall live; if he protect us, we 
 shall be safe. 

 2. The sincere regard he had to God's glory: "<I>For thou art my 
 praise,</I> and for that reason I desire to be healed and saved, 
 <I>that I may live and praise thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:175">Ps. cxix. 175</A>.

 Thou art he whom I praise, and the praise due to thee I never gave to
 another. Thou art he whom I glory in, and boast of, for on thee do I 
 depend. Thou art he that furnishes me with continual matter for praise, 
 and I have given thee the praise of the favours already bestowed upon 
 me. <I>Thou shalt be my praise</I>" (so some read it); "heal me, and 
 save me, and thou shalt have the glory of it. <I>My praise shall be 
 continually of thee,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:6,79:13">Ps. lxxi. 6; lxxix. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He complains of the infidelity and daring impiety of the people to 
 whom he preached. It greatly troubled him, and he shows before God this 
 trouble, as the servant that had slights put upon him by the guests he 
 was sent to invite <I>came and showed his Lord these things.</I> He had 
 faithfully delivered God's message to them; and what answer has he to 
 return to him that sent him? <I>Behold, they say unto me, Where is the 
 word of the Lord? Let it come now,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:15,Isa+5:19"><I>v.</I> 15, Isa. v. 19</A>.

 They bantered the prophet, and made a jest of that which he delivered 
 with the greatest seriousness. 

 1. They denied the truth of what he said: "If that be the <I>word of
 the Lord</I> which thou speakest to us, <I>where is it?</I> Why is it 
 not fulfilled?" Thus the patience of God was impudently abused as a 
 ground to question his veracity. 

 2. They defied the terror of what he said. "Let God Almighty do his 
 worst; let all he has said come to pass; we shall do well enough; the 
 lion is not so fierce as he is painted," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:18">Amos v. 18</A>.

 "Lord, to what purpose is it to speak to men that will neither believe
 nor fear?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He appeals to God concerning his faithful discharge of the duty to 
 which he was called, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 The people did all they could to make him weary of his work, to 
 exasperate him and make him uneasy, and to tempt him to prevaricate and 
 alter his message for fear of displeasing them; but, "Lord," says he, 
 "<I>thou knowest</I> I have not yielded to them." 

 1. He continued constant to his work. His office, instead of being his
 credit and protection, exposed him to reproach, contempt, and injury.
 "Yet," says he, "<I>I have not hastened from being a pastor after 
 thee;</I> I have not left my work, nor sued for a discharge or a 
 <I>quietus.</I>" Prophets were pastors to the people, to feed them with 
 the good word of God; but they were to be <I>pastors after God,</I> and 
 all ministers must be so, <I>according to his heart</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:15"><I>ch.</I> iii. 15</A>),

 to follow him and the directions and instructions he gives. Such a
 pastor Jeremiah was; and, though he met with as much difficulty and 
 discouragement as ever any man did, yet he did not fly off as Jonah 
 did, nor desire to be excused from going any more on God's errands.
 Note, Those that are employed for God, though their success answer nor 
 their expectations, must not therefore throw up their commission. but 
 continue to follow God, though the storm be in their faces. 

 2. He kept up his affection to the people. Though they were very 
 abusive to him, he was compassionate to them: <I>I have not desired the 
 woeful day.</I> The day of the accomplishment of his prophecies would 
 be a woeful day indeed to Jerusalem, and therefore he deprecated it, 
 and wished it might never come, though, as to himself, it would be the 
 avenging of him upon his persecutors and the proving of him a true 
 prophet (which they had questioned,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 and upon those accounts he might be tempted to desire it. Note, God 
 does not, and therefore ministers must not, desire the death of 
 sinners, but rather that they may turn and live. Though we warn of the 
 woeful day, we must not wish for it, but rather weep because of it, as 
 Jeremiah did. 

 3. He kept closely to his instructions. Though he might have curried
 favour with the people, or at least have avoided their displeasure, if 
 he had not been so sharp in his reproofs and severe in his 
 threatenings, yet he would deliver his message faithfully; and that he 
 had done so was a comfort to him. "Lord, <I>thou knowest that that
 which came out of my lips was right before thee;</I> it exactly agreed 
 with what I received from thee, and therefore thou art reflected upon 
 in their quarrelling with me." Note, If what we say and do be right 
 before God, we may easily despise the reproaches and censures of men.
 <I>It is a small thing to be judged of their judgment.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. He humbly begs of God that he would own him, and protect him, and 
 carry him on cheerfully in that work to which God had so plainly called 
 him and to which he had so sincerely devoted himself. Two things he 
 here desires:--

 1. That he might have comfort in serving the God that sent him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>Be not thou a terror to me.</I> Surely more is implied than is 
 expressed. "Be thou a comfort to me, and let thy favour rejoice my 
 heart and encourage me, when my enemies do all they can to terrify me 
 and either to drive me from my work or to make me drive on heavily in 
 it." Note, The best have that in them which might justly make God a 
 terror to them, as he was for some time to Job

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:4"><I>ch.</I> vi. 4</A>),

 to Asaph 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+77:3">Ps. lxxvii. 3</A>),
 
 to Heman, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+88:15">Ps. lxxxviii. 15</A>.

 And this is that which good men, <I>knowing the terrors of the
 Lord,</I> dread and deprecate more than any thing; nay, whatever 
 frightful accidents may befal them, or how formidable soever their 
 enemies may appear to them, they can do well enough so long as God is 
 not a terror to them. He pleads, "<I>Thou art my hope;</I> and then 
 nothing else is my fear, no, not <I>in the day of evil,</I> when it is 
 most threatening, most pressing. My dependence is upon thee; and 
 therefore <I>be not a terror to me.</I>" Note, Those that by faith make 
 God their confidence shall have him for their comfort in the worst of 
 times, if it be not their own fault: if we make him our trust, we shall 
 not find him our terror. 

 2. That he might have courage in dealing with the people to whom he was 
 sent,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Those persecuted him who should have entertained and encouraged him. 
 "Lord," says he, "<I>let them be confounded</I> (let them be 
 overpowered by the convictions of the word and made ashamed of their 
 obstinacy, or else let the judgments threatened be at length executed 
 upon them), <I>but let not me confounded,</I> let not me be terrified 
 by their menaces, so as to betray my trust." Note, God's ministers have 
 work to do which they need not be either ashamed or afraid to go on in, 
 but they do need to be helped by the divine grace to go on in it 
 without shame or fear. Jeremiah had not desired the woeful day upon
 his country in general; but as to his persecutors, in a just and holy 
 indignation at their malice, he prays, <I>Bring upon them the day of 
 evil,</I> in hope that the bringing of it upon them might prevent the 
 bringing of it upon the country; if they were taken away, the people 
 would be better; "therefore <I>destroy them with a double 
 destruction;</I> let them be utterly destroyed, root and branch, and 
 let the prospect of that destruction be their present confusion." This 
 the prophet prays, not at all that he might be avenged, nor so much 
 that he might be eased, but that <I>the Lord</I> may be <I>known by the 
 judgments which he executes.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  Thus said the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> unto me; Go and stand in the gate of the
 children of the people, whereby the kings of Judah come in, and
 by the which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem;
 &nbsp; 20  And say unto them, Hear ye the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, ye kings of
 Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that
 enter in by these gates:
 &nbsp; 21  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no
 burden on the sabbath day, nor bring <I>it</I> in by the gates of
 Jerusalem;
 &nbsp; 22  Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the
 sabbath day, neither do ye any work, but hallow ye the sabbath
 day, as I commanded your fathers.
 &nbsp; 23  But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made
 their neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive
 instruction.
 &nbsp; 24  And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me,
 saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to bring in no burden through the gates of this
 city on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day, to do no
 work therein;
 &nbsp; 25  Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and
 princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and
 on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the
 inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall remain for ever.
 &nbsp; 26  And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the
 places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from
 the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing
 burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and incense,
 and bringing sacrifices of praise, unto the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 27  But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath
 day, and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of
 Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the
 gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and
 it shall not be quenched.

 These verses are a sermon concerning sabbath-sanctification. It is a 
 word which the prophet <I>received from the Lord,</I> and was ordered 
 to deliver in the most solemn and public manner to the people; for they 
 were sent not only to reprove sin, and to press obedience, in general, 
 but they must descend to particulars. This message concerning the 
 sabbath was probably sent in the days of Josiah, for the furtherance of 
 that work of reformation which he set on foot; for the promises here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>)

 are such as I think we scarcely find when things come nearer to the 
 extremity. This message must be proclaimed in all the places of 
 concourse, and therefore in<I>the gates,</I> not only because through 
 them people were continually passing and repassing, but because in them 
 they kept their courts and laid up their stores. It must be proclaimed 
 (as the king or queen is usually proclaimed) at the court-gate first, 
 the gate <I>by which the kings of Judah come in and go out,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.
 
 Let them be told their duty first, particularly this duty; for, if 
 sabbaths be not sanctified as they should be, <I>the rulers of Judah 
 are to be contended with</I> (so they were, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:17">Neh. xiii. 17</A>),

 for they are certainly wanting in their duty. He must also preach it
 <I>in all the gates of Jerusalem.</I> It is a matter of great and 
 general concern; therefore let all take notice of it. Let the <I>kings 
 of Judah</I> hear the <I>word of the Lord</I> (for, high as they are, 
 he is above them), <I>and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem,</I> for, 
 mean as they are, he takes notice of them, and of what they say and do 
 on sabbath days. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How the sabbath is to be sanctified, and what is the law concerning 
 it, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.

 1. They must rest from their worldly employment on the sabbath day, 
 must do no servile work. They must <I>bear no burden</I> into the city 
 nor out of it, into their houses nor out of them; husbandmen's burdens 
 of corn must not be carried in, nor manure carried out; nor must 
 tradesmen's burdens of wares or merchandises be imported or exported. 
 There must not a loaded horse, or cart, or wagon, be seen on the 
 sabbath day either in the streets or in the roads; the porters must not 
 ply on that day, nor must the servants be suffered to fetch in 
 provisions or fuel. It is a day of rest, and must not be made a day of 
 labour, unless in case of necessity. 

 2. They must apply themselves to that which is the proper work and 
 business of the day: "<I>Hallow you the sabbath,</I> that is, 
 consecrate it to the honour of God and spend it in his service and 
 worship." It is in order to this that worldly business must be laid 
 aside, that we may be entire for, and intent upon, that work, which 
 requires and deserves the whole man. 

 3. They must herein be very circumspect: "<I>Take heed to
 yourselves,</I> watch against every thing that borders upon the 
 profanation of the sabbath." Where God is jealous we must be cautious. 
 "<I>Take heed to yourselves,</I> for it is at your peril if you rob God 
 of that part of your time which he has reserved to himself." <I>Take 
 heed to your souls</I> (so the word is); in order to the right 
 sanctifying of sabbaths, we must look well to the frame of our spirits 
 and have a watchful eye upon all the motions of the inward man. Let not 
 the soul be burdened with the cares of this world on sabbath days, but 
 let that be employed, even all that is within us, in the work of the 
 day. And, 

 4. He refers them to the law, the statute in this case made and 
 provided: "This is no new imposition upon you, but is what <I>I 
 commanded your fathers;</I> it is an ancient law; it was an article of 
 the original contract; nay, it was a command to the patriarchs."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How the sabbath had been profaned 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 "Your fathers were required to keep holy the sabbath day, <I>but they 
 obeyed not;</I> they <I>hardened their necks</I> against this as well 
 as other commands that were given them." This is mentioned to show that 
 there needed a reformation in this matter, and that God had a just 
 controversy with them for the long transgression of this law which they 
 had been guilty of. They hardened their necks against this command, 
 that they might not hear and receive instruction concerning other 
 commands. Where sabbaths are neglected all religion sensibly goes to 
 decay.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What blessings God had in store for them if they would make 
 conscience of sabbath-sanctification. Though their fathers had been 
 guilty of the profanation of the sabbath they should not only not smart 
 for it, but their city and nation should recover its ancient glory, if 
 they would keep sabbaths better, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:24-26"><I>v.</I> 24-26</A>.

 Let them take care to <I>hallow the sabbath</I> and <I>do no work 
 therein;</I> and then, 

 1. The court shall flourish. <I>Kings</I> in succession, or the many
 branches of the royal family at the same time, all as great as kings, 
 with the other <I>princes</I> that <I>sit upon the thrones</I> of 
 judgment, <I>the thrones of the house of David</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+122:5">Ps. cxxii. 5</A>),

 shall ride in great pomp <I>through the gates of Jerusalem,</I> some in
 chariots and some on horses, attended with a numerous retinue of the 
 men of Judah. Note, The honour of the government is the joy of the 
 kingdom; and the support of religion would contribute greatly to both.

 2. The city shall flourish. Let there be a face of religion kept up in 
 Jerusalem, by sabbath-sanctification, that it may answer to its title, 
 <I>the holy city,</I> and then it <I>shall remain for ever, shall for 
 ever be inhabited</I> (so the word may be rendered); it shall not be 
 destroyed and dispeopled, as it is threatened to be. Whatever supports 
 religion tends to establish the civil interests of a land. 

 3. The country shall flourish: <I>The cities of Judah and the land of
 Benjamin</I> shall be replenished with vast numbers of inhabitants, and 
 those abounding in plenty and living in peace, which will appear by the 
 multitude and value of their offerings, which they shall present to 
 God. By this the flourishing of a country may be judged of, What does 
 it do for the honour of God? Those that starve their religion either 
 are poor or are in a fair way to be so. 

 4. The church shall flourish: <I>Meat-offerings, and incense, and
 sacrifices of praise,</I> shall be brought <I>to the house of the 
 Lord,</I> for the maintenance of the service of that house and the 
 servants that attend it. God's institutions shall be conscientiously 
 observed; no sacrifice nor incense shall be offered to idols, nor 
 alienated from God, but every thing shall go in the right channel. They 
 shall have both occasion and hearts to bring sacrifices of praise to 
 God. This is made an instance of their prosperity. Then a people truly 
 flourish when religion flourishes among them. And this is the effect of 
 sabbath-sanctification; when that branch of religion is kept up other 
 instances of it are kept up likewise; but, when that is lost, devotion 
 is lost either in superstition or in profaneness. It is a true 
 observation, which some have made, that the streams of all religion run 
 either deep or shallow according as the banks of the sabbath are kept 
 up or neglected.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. What judgments they must expect would come upon them if they 
 persisted in the profanation of the sabbath 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 "<I>If you will not hearken to me</I> in this matter, to keep the gates 
 shut on sabbath days, so that there may be no unnecessary <I>entering 
 in,</I> or going out, on that day--if you will break through the 
 enclosure of the divine law, and lay that day in common with other 
 days--know that God will <I>kindle a fire in the gates</I> of your 
 city," intimating that it shall be kindled by an enemy besieging the 
 city and assaulting the gates, who shall take this course to force an 
 entrance. Justly shall those gates be fired that are not used as they 
 ought to be to shut out sin and to keep people in to an attendance on 
 their duty. This fire shall devour even <I>the palaces of 
 Jerusalem,</I> where the princes and nobles dwelt, who did not use 
 their power and interest as they ought to have done to keep up the 
 honour of God's sabbaths; but <I>it shall not be quenched</I> until it 
 has laid the whole city in ruins. This was fulfilled by the army of
 the Chaldeans,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:13"><I>ch.</I> lii. 13</A>.

 The profanation of the sabbath is a sin for which God has often
 contended with a people by fire.</P>
