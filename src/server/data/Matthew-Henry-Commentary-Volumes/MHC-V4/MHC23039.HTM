 The story of this chapter likewise we had before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+20:12">2 Kings xx. 12</A>,

 &c. It is here repeated, not only as a very memorable and improvable
 passage, but because it concludes with a prophecy of the captivity in 
 Babylon; and as the former part of the prophecy of this book frequently 
 referred to Sennacherib's invasion and the defeat of that, to which 
 therefore the history of that was very fitly subjoined, so the latter 
 part of this book speaks much of the Jews' captivity in Babylon and 
 their deliverance out of that, to which therefore the first prediction 
 of it, with the occasion thereof, is very fitly prefixed. We have here, 
 
 I. The pride and folly of Hezekiah, in showing his treasures to the
 king of Babylon's ambassadors that were sent to congratulate him on his 
 recovery, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+39:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. Isaiah's examination of him concerning it, in God's name, and his
 confession of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+39:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>.

 III. The sentence passed upon him for it, that all his treasures 
 should, in process of time, be carried to Babylon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+39:5-7">ver. 5-7</A>.

 IV. Hezekiah's penitent and patient submission to this sentence,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+39:8">ver. 8</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  At that time Merodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of
 Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard
 that he had been sick, and was recovered.
 &nbsp; 2  And Hezekiah was glad of them, and showed them the house of
 his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices,
 and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and
 all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his
 house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not.
 &nbsp; 3  Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said
 unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto
 thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto
 me, <I>even</I> from Babylon.
 &nbsp; 4  Then said he, What have they seen in thine house? And
 Hezekiah answered, All that <I>is</I> in mine house have they seen:
 there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Hence we may learn these lessons:--

 1. That humanity and common civility teach us to rejoice with our
 friends and neighbours when they rejoice, and to congratulate them on 
 their deliverances, and particularly their recoveries from sickness. 
 The king of Babylon, having heard that Hezekiah had been sick, and had 
 recovered, sent to compliment him upon the occasion. If Christians be 
 unneighbourly, heathens will shame them.

 2. It becomes us to give honour to those whom our God puts honour upon. 
 The sun was the Babylonians' god; and when they understood that it was 
 with a respect to Hezekiah that the sun, to their great surprise, went 
 back ten degrees, on such a day, they thought themselves obliged to do 
 Hezekiah all the honour they could. Will all people thus walk in the 
 name of their God, and shall not we? 

 3. Those that do not value good men for their goodness may yet be 
 brought to pay them great respect by other inducements, and for the 
 sake of their secular interests. The king of Babylon made his court to 
 Hezekiah, not because he was pious, but because he was prosperous, as 
 the Philistines coveted an alliance with Isaac because they saw the 
 Lord was with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:28">Gen. xxvi. 28</A>.

 The king of Babylon was an enemy to the king of Assyria, and therefore
 was fond of Hezekiah, because the Assyrians were so much weakened by 
 the power of his God.

 4. It is a hard matter to keep the spirit low in the midst of great 
 advancements. Hezekiah is an instance of it: he was a wise and good
 man, but, when one miracle after another was wrought in his favour, he 
 found it hard to keep his heart from being lifted up, nay, a little 
 thing then drew him into the snare of pride. Blessed Paul himself 
 needed a thorn in the flesh, to keep him from being <I>lifted up with 
 the abundance of revelations.</I> 

 5. We have need to watch over our own spirits when we are showing our
 friends our possessions, what we have done and what we have got, that 
 we be not proud of them, as if our might or our merit had purchased and 
 procured us this wealth. When we look upon our enjoyments, and have 
 occasion to speak of them, it must be with humble acknowledgments of 
 our own unworthiness and thankful acknowledgments of God's goodness, 
 with a just value for the achievements of others and with an 
 expectation of losses and changes, not dreaming that our mountain 
 stands so strong but that it may soon be moved. 

 6. It is a great weakness for good men to value themselves much upon
 the civil respects that are paid them (yea, though there be something 
 particular and uncommon in them) by the children of this world, and to 
 be fond of their acquaintance. What a poor thing was it for Hezekiah, 
 whom God has so dignified, to be thus over proud of the respect paid 
 him by a heathen prince as if that added any thing to him! We ought to
 return the courtesies of such with interest, but not to be proud of 
 them. 

 7. We must expect to be called to an account for the workings of our
 pride, though they are secret, and in such instances as we thought 
 there was no harm in; and therefore we ought to call ourselves to an 
 account for them; and when we have had company with us that have paid 
 us respect, and been pleased with their entertainment, and commended 
 every thing, we ought to be jealous over ourselves with a godly 
 jealousy lest our hearts have been lifted up. As far as we see cause to 
 suspect that this sly and subtle sin of pride has insinuated itself 
 into our breasts, and mingled itself with our conversation, let us be 
 ashamed of it, and, as Hezekiah here, ingenuously confess it and take 
 shame to ourselves for it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of
 hosts:
 &nbsp; 6  Behold, the days come, that all that <I>is</I> in thine house, and
 <I>that</I> which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day,
 shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 7  And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt
 beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the
 palace of the king of Babylon.
 &nbsp; 8  Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good <I>is</I> the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be
 peace and truth in my days.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Hence let us observe, 

 1. That, if God love us, he will humble us, and will find some way or 
 other to pull down our spirits when they are lifted up above measure. A 
 mortifying message is sent to Hezekiah, that he might be humbled for 
 the pride of his heart, and be convinced of the folly of it; for though 
 God may suffer his people to fall into sin, as he did Hezekiah here, to 
 <I>prove him, that he might know all that was in his heart,</I> yet he 
 will not suffer them to lie still in it. 

 2. It is just with God to take that from us which we make the matter of 
 our pride, and on which we build a carnal confidence. When David was 
 proud of the numbers of his people God took a course to make them 
 fewer; and when Hezekiah boasts of his treasures, and looks upon them 
 with too great a complacency, he is told that he acts like the foolish 
 traveller who shows his money and gold to one that proves a thief and 
 is thereby tempted to rob him. 

 3. If we could but see things that will be, we should be ashamed of
 our thoughts of things that are. If Hezekiah had known that the seed 
 and successors of this king of Babylon would hereafter be the ruin of 
 his family and kingdom, he would not have complimented his ambassadors 
 as he did; and, when the prophet told him that it would be so, we may 
 well imagine how he was vexed at himself for what he had done. We 
 cannot certainly foresee what will be, but are told, in general, <I>All 
 is vanity,</I> and therefore it is vanity for us to take complacency 
 and put confidence in any thing that goes under that character. 

 4. Those that are fond of an acquaintance or alliance with irreligious
 men will first or last have enough of it, and will have cause to repent 
 it. Hezekiah thought himself very happy in the friendship of Babylon,
 though it was the mother of harlots and idolatries; but Babylon, who 
 now courted Jerusalem, in process of time conquered her and carried her 
 captive. Leagues with sinners, and leagues with sin too, will end thus; 
 it is therefore our wisdom to keep at a distance from them. 

 5. Those that truly repent of their sins will take it well to be
 reproved for them and will be willing to be told of their faults. 
 Hezekiah reckoned <I>that</I> word of the Lord good which discovered 
 sin to him, and made him sensible that he had done amiss, which before 
 he was not aware of. The language of true penitents is, <I>Let the
 righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness;</I> and the law is 
 <I>therefore</I> good, because, being spiritual, in it sin appears sin, 
 and exceedingly sinful. 

 6. True penitents will quietly submit, not only to the reproofs of the
 word, but to the rebukes of Providence for their sins. When Hezekiah 
 was told of the punishment of his iniquity he said, <I>Good is the word 
 of the Lord,</I> not only the mitigation of the sentence, but the 
 sentence itself; he has nothing to object against the equity of it, but 
 says <I>Amen</I> to the threatening. Those that see the evil of sin, 
 and what it deserves, will justify God in all that is brought upon them 
 for it, and own that he punishes them less than their iniquities 
 deserve. 

 7. Though we must not be regardless of those that come after us, yet we
 must reckon ourselves well done by if there be <I>peace and truth in 
 our days,</I> and better than we had reason to expect. If a storm be 
 coming, we must reckon it a favour to get into the harbour before it 
 comes, and be gathered to the grave in peace; yet we can never be 
 secure of this, but must prepare for changes in our own time, that we 
 may stand complete in all the will of God, and bid it welcome whatever 
 it is.</P>
