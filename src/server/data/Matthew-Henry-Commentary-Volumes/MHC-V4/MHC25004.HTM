 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter is another single alphabet of Lamentations for the 
 destruction of Jerusalem, like those in the first two chapters. 

 I. The prophet here laments the injuries and indignities done to those
 to whom respect used to be shown, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. He laments the direful effects of the famine to which they were
 reduced by the siege, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:3-10">ver. 3-10</A>.

 III. He laments the taking and sacking of Jerusalem and its amazing
 desolations, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:11,12">ver. 11, 12</A>.

 IV. He acknowledges that the sins of their leaders were the cause of
 all these calamities, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:13-16">ver. 13-16</A>.

 V. He gives up all as doomed to utter ruin, for their enemies were
 every way too hard for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:17-20">ver. 17-20</A>.

 VI. He foretels the destruction of the Edomites who triumphed in
 Jerusalem's fall, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:21">ver. 21</A>.

 VII. He foretels the return of the captivity of Zion at last, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:22">ver. 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  How is the gold become dim! <I>how</I> is the most fine gold
 changed! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of
 every street.
 &nbsp; 2  The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are
 they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the
 potter!
 &nbsp; 3  Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to
 their young ones: the daughter of my people <I>is become</I> cruel,
 like the ostriches in the wilderness.
 &nbsp; 4  The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his
 mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, <I>and</I> no man
 breaketh <I>it</I> unto them.
 &nbsp; 5  They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets:
 they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.
 &nbsp; 6  For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my
 people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that
 was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.
 &nbsp; 7  Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than
 milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing
 <I>was</I> of sapphire:
 &nbsp; 8  Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in
 the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered,
 it is become like a stick.
 &nbsp; 9  <I>They that be</I> slain with the sword are better than <I>they
 that be</I> slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through
 for <I>want of</I> the fruits of the field.
 &nbsp; 10  The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own
 children: they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter
 of my people.
 &nbsp; 11  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his
 fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath
 devoured the foundations thereof.
 &nbsp; 12  The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the
 world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy
 should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The elegy in this chapter begins with a lamentation of the very sad and 
 doleful change which the judgments of God had made in Jerusalem. The 
 city that was formerly <I>as gold,</I> as <I>the most fine gold,</I> so 
 rich and splendid, <I>the perfection of beauty and the joy of the whole 
 earth,</I> has become dim, and is changed, has lost its lustre, lost 
 its value, is not what it was; it has become dross. Alas! what an 
 alteration is here!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The temple was laid waste, which was the glory of Jerusalem and its 
 protection. It is given up into the hands of the enemy. And some
 understand the gold spoken of 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)

 to be the <I>gold of the temple,</I> the fine gold with which it was
 overlaid

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:22">1 Kings vi. 22</A>);

 when the temple was burned the gold of it was smoked and sullied, as if
 it had been of little value. It was thrown among the rubbish; it <I>was
 changed,</I> converted to common uses and made nothing of. <I>The 
 stones of the sanctuary,</I> which were curiously wrought, were thrown 
 down by the Chaldeans, when they demolished it, or were brought down by 
 the force of the fire, and were <I>poured out,</I> and thrown about 
 <I>in the top of every street;</I> they lay mingled without distinction 
 among the common ruins. When the God of the sanctuary was by sin 
 provoked to withdraw no wonder that the stones of the sanctuary were 
 thus profaned.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The princes and priests, who were in a special manner the <I>sons 
 of Zion,</I> were trampled upon and abused, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Both the house of God and the house of David were in Zion. The sons of 
 both those houses were upon this account precious, that they were heirs 
 to the privileges of those two covenants of priesthood and royalty. 
 They were <I>comparable to fine gold.</I> Israel was more rich in them 
 than in treasures of gold and silver. But now they are <I>esteemed as 
 earthen pitchers;</I> they are broken as <I>earthen pitchers,</I> 
 thrown by as vessels in which there is no pleasure. They have grown 
 poor, and are brought into captivity, and thereby are rendered mean and 
 despicable, and every one treads upon them and insults over them. Note, 
 The contempt put upon God's people ought to be matter of lamentation to 
 us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Little children were starved for want of bread and water, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.
 
 The nursing-mothers, having no meat for themselves, had no milk for the 
 babes at their breast, so that, though in disposition they were really 
 compassionate, yet in fact they seemed to be cruel, <I>like the 
 ostriches in the wilderness, that leave their eggs in the dust</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:14,15">Job xxxix. 14, 15</A>);

 having no food for their children, they were forced to neglect them and
 do what they could to forget them, because it was a pain to them to 
 think of them when they had nothing for them; in this they were worse 
 than the seals, or <I>sea-monsters,</I> or <I>whales</I> (as some 
 render it), for they <I>drew out the breast, and gave suck to their 
 young,</I> which <I>the daughter of my people</I> will not do. Children 
 cannot shift for themselves as grown people can; and therefore it was 
 the more painful to see <I>the tongue of the sucking-child cleave to 
 the roof of his mouth for thirst,</I> because there was not a drop of 
 water to moisten it; and to hear the young children, that could but 
 just speak, <I>ask bread</I> of their parents, who had none to give 
 them, no, nor any friend that could supply them. As doleful as our
 thoughts are of this case, so thankful should our thoughts be of the 
 great plenty we enjoy, and the food convenient we have for ourselves 
 and for our children, and for <I>those of our own house.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Persons of good rank were reduced to extreme poverty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Those who were well-born and well bred, and had been accustomed to the 
 best, both for food and clothing, who had <I>fed delicately,</I> had 
 every thing that was curious and nice (they call it <I>eating well,</I> 
 whereas those only eat well who eat to the glory of God), and <I>fared 
 sumptuously every day;</I> they had not only been <I>advanced to the 
 scarlet,</I> but from their beginning were <I>brought up in 
 scarlet,</I> and were never acquainted with any thing mean or ordinary.
 They were <I>brought up upon scarlet</I> (so the word is); their 
 foot-cloths, and the carpets they walked on, were scarlet, yet these, 
 being stripped of all by the war, are <I>desolate in the streets,</I> 
 have not a house to put their head in, nor a bed to lie on, nor clothes 
 to cover them, nor fire to warm them. They <I>embrace dunghills;</I> on 
 them they were glad to lie to get a little rest, and perhaps raked in 
 the dunghills for something to eat, as the prodigal son who <I>would 
 fain have filled his belly with the husks.</I> Note, Those who live in 
 the greatest pomp and plenty know not what straits they may be reduced 
 to before they die; as sometimes the <I>needy</I> are <I>raised out of 
 the dunghill. Those who were full have hired out themselves for 
 bread,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:5">1 Sam. ii. 5</A>.

 It is therefore the wisdom of those who have abundance not to use
 themselves too nicely, for then hardships, when they come, will be
 doubly hard, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:56">Deut. xxviii. 56</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Persons who were eminent for dignity, nay, perhaps for sanctity, 
 shared with others in the common calamity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 <I>Her Nazarites</I> are extremely charged. Some understand it only of 
 her honourable ones, the young gentlemen, who were very clean, and 
 neat, and well-dressed, washed and perfumed; but I see not why we may 
 not understand it of those devout people among them who <I>separated 
 themselves to the Lord</I> by the <I>Nazarites'</I> vow, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+6:2">Num. vi. 2</A>.

 That there were such among them in the most degenerate times appears
 from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:11">Amos ii. 11</A>,

 <I>I raised up of your young men for Nazarites.</I> These
 <I>Nazarites,</I> though they were not to cut their hair, yet by reason 
 of their temperate diet, their frequent washings, and especially the 
 pleasure they had in devoting themselves to God and conversing with 
 him, which made their faces to shine as <I>Moses's,</I> were <I>purer 
 than snow</I> and <I>whiter than milk;</I> drinking no wine nor strong 
 drink, they had a more healthful complexion and cheerful countenance 
 than those who regaled themselves daily with the blood of the grape, as 
 <I>Daniel</I> and his fellows with <I>pulse and water.</I> Or it may 
 denote the great respect and veneration which all good people had for 
 them; though perhaps to the eye they had <I>no form nor comeliness,</I> 
 yet, being separated to the Lord, they were valued as if they had been 
 <I>more ruddy than rubies and their polishing had been of sapphire.</I> 
 But now <I>their visage is marred</I> (as is said of Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:14">Isa. lii. 14</A>);

 it is <I>blacker than a coal;</I> they look miserably, partly through
 hunger and partly through grief and perplexity. <I>They are not known 
 in the streets;</I> those who respected them now take no notice of 
 them, and those who had been intimately acquainted with them now 
 scarcely knew them, their countenance was so altered by the miseries 
 that attended the long siege. <I>Their skin cleaves to their bones,</I> 
 their flesh being quite consumed and wasted away; it is 
 <I>withered;</I> it has <I>become like a stick,</I> as dry and hard as 
 a piece of wood. Note, It is a thing to be much lamented that even 
 those who are separated to God are yet, when desolating judgments are 
 abroad, often involved with others in the common calamity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Jerusalem came down slowly, and died a lingering death; for the 
 famine contributed more to her destruction than any other judgment 
 whatsoever. Upon this account the destruction of <I>Jerusalem was 
 greater than that of Sodom</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 for that was <I>overthrown in a moment;</I> one shower of fire and 
 brimstone dispatched it; <I>no hand staid on her;</I> she did not 
 endure any long siege, as Jerusalem has done; she fell immediately into 
 the <I>hands of the Lord,</I> who strikes home at a blow, and did not 
 <I>fall into the hands of man,</I> who, being weak, is long in doing 
 execution, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+8:21">Judg. viii. 21</A>.

 Jerusalem is kept many months upon the rack, in pain and misery, and
 dies by inches, dies so as to feel herself die. And, when the iniquity
 of Jerusalem is more aggravated than that of Sodom, no wonder that the 
 punishment of it is so. Sodom never had the means of grace the 
 Jerusalem had, the oracles of God and his prophets, and therefore the 
 condemnation of Jerusalem will be <I>more intolerable</I> than that of 
 Sodom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:23,24">Matt. xi. 23, 24</A>.

 The extremity of the famine is here set forth by two frightful
 instances of it:--

 1. The tedious deaths that it was the cause of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 many were slain with hunger, were famished to death, their stores being 
 spent, and the public stores so nearly spent that they could not have 
 any relief out of them. They were <I>stricken through, for want of the 
 fruits of the field;</I> those who were starved were as sure to die as 
 if they had been stabbed and stricken through; only their case was much 
 more miserable. <I>Those who are slain with the sword</I> are soon put 
 out of their pain; <I>in a moment they go down to the grave,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:13">Job xxi. 13</A>.

 They have not the terror of seeing death make its advances towards
 them, and scarcely feel it when the blow is given; it is but one sharp 
 struggle, and the work is done. And, if we be ready for another world, 
 we need not be afraid of a short passage to it; the quicker the better. 
 But those who die by famine pine away; hunger preys upon their spirits 
 and wastes them gradually; nay, and it frets their spirits, and fills 
 them with vexation, and is as great a torture to the mind as to the 
 body. There are <I>bands in their death,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:4">Ps. lxxiii. 4</A>.

 2. The barbarous murders that it was the occasion of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):
 
 <I>The hands of the pitiful women have</I> first slain and then 
 <I>sodden their own children.</I> This was lamented before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:20"><I>ch.</I> ii. 20</A>);

 and it was a thing to be greatly lamented that any should be so wicked
 as to do it and that they should be brought to such extremities as to 
 be tempted to it. But this horrid effect of long sieges had been 
 threatened in general 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:29,De+28:53">Lev. xxvi. 29, Deut. xxviii. 53</A>),

 and particularly against Jerusalem in the siege of the Chaldeans, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:9,Eze+5:10">Jer. xix. 9; Ezek. v. 10</A>.

 The case was sad enough that they had not wherewithal to feed their 
 children and make meat for them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 but much worse that they could find in their hearts to feed upon their 
 children and make meat of them. I know not whether to make it an
 instance of the power of necessity or of the power of iniquity; but, as 
 the Gentile idolaters were justly <I>given up to vile affections</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:26">Rom. i. 26</A>),

 so these Jewish idolaters, and the women particularly, who had <I>made
 cakes to the queen of heaven</I> and taught their children to do so 
 too, were <I>stripped of natural affection</I> and that to their own 
 children. Being thus left to <I>dishonour their own nature</I> was a
 righteous judgment upon them for the dishonour they had done to 
 God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. Jerusalem comes down utterly and wonderfully. 

 1. The destruction of Jerusalem is a complete destruction

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>The Lord has accomplished his fury;</I> he has made thorough work of 
 it, has executed all that he purposed in wrath against Jerusalem, and 
 has remitted no part of the sentence. He has poured out the full vials 
 of his fierce anger, poured them out to the bottom, even the dregs of 
 them. He has <I>kindled a fire in Zion,</I> which has not only consumed 
 the houses, and levelled them with the ground, but, beyond what other 
 fires do, has <I>devoured the foundations thereof,</I> as if they were 
 to be no more built upon. 
 
 2. It is an amazing destruction,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 It was a surprise to the kings of the earth, who are acquainted with, 
 and inquisitive about, the state of their neighbours; nay, it was so to 
 <I>all the inhabitants of the world</I> who knew Jerusalem, or had ever 
 heard or read of it; they <I>could not have believed that the adversary 
 and enemy would ever enter into the gates of Jerusalem;</I> for, 

 (1.) They knew that Jerusalem was strongly fortified, not only by walls
 and bulwarks, but by the numbers and strength of its inhabitants; the 
 strong hold of Zion was thought to be impregnable.

 (2.) They knew that it was the <I>city of the great King,</I> where the 
 Lord of the whole earth had in a more peculiar manner his residence; it 
 was the holy city, and therefore they thought that it was so much under 
 the divine protection that it would be in vain for any of its enemies 
 to make an attack upon it.

 (3.) They knew that many an attempt made upon it had been baffled, 
 witness that of Sennacherib. They were therefore amazed when they heard 
 of the Chaldeans making themselves masters of it, and concluded that it 
 was certainly by an immediate hand of God that Jerusalem was given up 
 to them; it was by a commission from him that the enemy broke through 
 and entered the gates of Jerusalem.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  For the sins of her prophets, <I>and</I> the iniquities of her
 priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of
 her,
 &nbsp; 14  They have wandered <I>as</I> blind <I>men</I> in the streets, they
 have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch
 their garments.
 &nbsp; 15  They cried unto them, Depart ye; <I>it is</I> unclean; depart,
 depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said
 among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn <I>there.</I>
 &nbsp; 16  The anger of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath divided them; he will no more
 regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they
 favoured not the elders.
 &nbsp; 17  As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our
 watching we have watched for a nation <I>that</I> could not save <I>us.</I>
 &nbsp; 18  They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our
 end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.
 &nbsp; 19  Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven:
 they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the
 wilderness.
 &nbsp; 20  The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, was
 taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall
 live among the heathen.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The sins they were charged with, for which God brought this 
 destruction upon them, and which served to justify God in it 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>):

 It is <I>for the sins of her prophets,</I> and the <I>iniquities of her 
 priests.</I> Not that the people were innocent; no, they <I>loved to 
 have it so</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:31">Jer. v. 31</A>),

 and it was to please them that the prophets and priests did as they
 did; but the fault is chiefly laid upon them, who should have taught 
 them better, should have reproved and admonished them, and told them 
 what would be in the end hereof; of the hands of those watchmen who did 
 not give them warning will their blood be required. Note, Nothing 
 ripens a people more for ruin, nor fills the measure faster, than the 
 sins of their priests and prophets. The particular sin charged upon 
 them is persecution; the false prophets and corrupt priests joined 
 their power and interest to <I>shed the blood of the just in the midst 
 of her,</I> the blood of God's prophets and of those that adhered to 
 them. They not only shed the blood of their innocent children, whom 
 they sacrificed to Moloch, but the blood of the righteous men that were 
 among them, whom they sacrificed to that more cruel idol of enmity to 
 the truth and true religion. This was that sin which the Lord would not 
 pardon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:4">2 Kings xxiv. 4</A>)

 and which brought the last destruction upon Jerusalem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:6">Jam. v. 6</A>):

 <I>You have condemned and killed the just.</I> And the priests and
 prophets were the ringleaders in persecution, as in Christ's time the 
 chief priests and scribes were the men that incensed the people against 
 him, who otherwise would have persisted in their hosannas. Now these 
 are those that <I>wandered as blind men in the streets,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 They strayed from the paths of justice, were blind to every thing that 
 is good, but to do evil they were quick-sighted. God says of corrupt 
 judges, <I>They know not, neither do they understand; they walk in 
 darkness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:5">Ps. lxxxii. 5</A>);

 and Christ says of the corrupt teachers, <I>They are blind leaders of
 the blind,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:14">Matt. xv. 14</A>.

 They have so <I>polluted themselves with</I> innocent <I>blood,</I> the
 blood of the saints, that <I>men could not touch their garments;</I> 
 they made themselves odious to all about them, so that good men were as 
 shy of touching them as of touching a dead body, which contracted a 
 ceremonial pollution, or of touching the bloody clothes of one slain, 
 which tender spirits care not to do. There is nothing that will make 
 prophets and priests to be abhorred so much as a spirit of 
 persecution.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The testimony of their neighbours produced in evidence against 
 them, both to convict them of sin and to show the equity of God's 
 proceedings against them. Some that have grown very impudent in sin 
 boast that they <I>care not what people say of them;</I> but God, by 
 the prophet, would have the Jews to take notice of what people said of 
 them and what was the opinion of the standers by concerning them 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>),

 what they said, nay, what <I>they cried unto them,</I> especially to 
 the corrupt priests and prophets, <I>among the heathen.</I> 

 1. They upbraided them with their pretended purity, while they lived in
 all manner of real iniquity. They cried to them, "<I>Depart you; it is 
 unclean.</I> You were so precise that you would not touch a Gentile, by 
 cried, <I>Depart, depart; stand by thyself; I am holier than thou,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:5">Isa. lxv. 5</A>.

 Thus the prosecutors of Christ would not go <I>into the judgment-hall,
 lest they should be defiled.</I> "But can you now keep the Gentiles 
 from touching you, when God has delivered you into their hands? When 
 you flee away and wander you will bid them stand off and not touch you, 
 because they are unclean. But in vain; these serpents will not be 
 charmed or enchanted thus; no, they will no <I>respect the persons of 
 the priests,</I> nor <I>favour the elders;</I> the most venerable 
 persons will to them be despicable."

 2. They upbraided them with their sins, and the anger of God against
 them for their sins, and the direful effects of that anger. <I>They 
 cried to them, Depart you; it is unclean.</I> They all cried out shame 
 on them, and could easily foresee that God would not long suffer so 
 provoking a people to continue in so good a land. They knew their 
 <I>statutes and judgments were righteous,</I> and expected they should 
 be <I>a wise and understanding people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:6">Deut. iv. 6</A>.

 But, when they saw them quite otherwise, they cried, <I>Depart,
 depart;</I> they soon read their doom, that the land would spue them 
 out, as it had done their predecessors, and, when they saw the 
 dispersed of <I>Jacob fleeing and wandering,</I> they told them of it. 
 They said, Now <I>the anger of the Lord has divided them,</I> has 
 dispersed them into all countries, because <I>they respected not the 
 persons of the priests,</I> the pious priests that were among them, 
 such as Zechariah the son of Jehoiada, Jeremiah, and others; neither 
 did they <I>favour the elders,</I> but despised them and their 
 authority when they went about to check them for their vicious courses. 
 The very heathen foresaw that this would ruin them.

 3. They triumphed in their ruin as irrecoverable. They said, when they
 saw them expelled out of their own land, "Now <I>they shall no more 
 sojourn there;</I> they have bidden it a final farewell, never more to 
 return to it, for <I>God will no more regard them,</I> and how then can 
 they help themselves?" Herein they were mistaken. God had not cast them 
 off, for all this. Yet thus much is intimated, that all about them
 observed them to be so very provoking to their God that there was not 
 reason to expect any other than that they should be quite 
 abandoned.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The despair which they themselves were almost brought to under 
 their calamities. Having heard what they said concerning them <I>among 
 the heathen,</I> let us now hear what they say concerning themselves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 "<I>As for us,</I> we look upon our case to be in a manner helpless. 
 <I>Our end is near</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 the end both of our church and of our state; we are just at the brink 
 of the ruin of both; nay, <I>our end has come;</I> we are utterly 
 undone; a fatal final period is put to all our comforts; the days of 
 our prosperity are fulfilled; they are numbered and finished." Thus 
 their fears concurred with the hopes of their enemies that the <I>Lord 
 would no more regard them.</I> For, 

 1. The refuges they fled to disappointed them. They looked for help
 from this and the other powerful ally, but to no purpose; it proved 
 vain help. The succours they expected did not come in, or at least they 
 had not the success they expected, and their eyes failed with looking 
 for that which never came

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);

 they <I>watched in watching;</I> they watched long, and with a great 
 deal of earnestness and impatience, <I>for a nation</I> that promised 
 them assistance, but failed the, and frustrated their expectation. They 
 <I>could not save them;</I> they were too weak to contend with the 
 Chaldean army and therefore retired. Help from creatures is vain help
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+60:11">Ps. lx. 11</A>),

 and we may look for it till our eyes fail, till our hearts fail, and
 come short of it at last. 

 2. The persecutors they fled from overtook them and overcame them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets.</I> When the 
 Chaldeans besieged the city they raised their batteries so high above 
 the walls that they could command the town, and shoot at people as they 
 went along the streets. They <I>hunted them</I> with their arrows from
 place to place. When the city was broken up, and all the men of war 
 fled, their <I>persecutors were swifter than the eagles of heaven</I> 
 when they fly upon their prey, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 There was no escaping them; they <I>pursued them upon the 
 mountains,</I> and, when they thought they had got clear of them, they 
 fell into the hands of those that <I>laid wait for them in the 
 wilderness,</I> to cut off their retreat, and to pick up stragglers.
 nay, the king himself, though he may be supposed to have had all the 
 advantages the exigence of the case would admit to favour his flight, 
 yet could not escape, for divine vengeance pursued him with them, and 
 then 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 <I>The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the Lord, was taken in 
 their pits.</I> Some apply it to Josiah, who was killed in battle by 
 the king of Egypt; but it is rather to be understood of Zedekiah, who 
 was the last king of the house of David, and who was pursued by the 
 Chaldeans and seized in the plains of Jericho, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+39:5">Jer. xxxix. 5</A>.

 He was <I>the anointed of the Lord,</I> heir of that family which God
 had appointed to the government. He was very much confided in by the
 Jewish state: <I>They said, Under his shadow we shall live among the 
 heathen.</I> They promised themselves that the remnant which were left 
 after Jeconiah's captivity should, under the protection of his 
 government, yet again <I>take root downward and bear fruit upward.</I> 
 They thought, though they were so reduced that they could not think of 
 reigning over the heathen, as they had done, yet they might make a 
 shift to live among them and not be insulted and pulled to pieces by 
 them. Thus apt are sinking interests not only to catch at every twig, 
 but to think it will recover them. Jerusalem died of a consumption, a 
 flattering distemper. Even when she was ready to expire she formed some 
 hopeful symptoms to herself, and on them grounded a hope that she 
 should recover; but what came of it? The shadow under which they 
 thought they should live proved like that of Jonah's gourd, which 
 <I>withered in a night.</I> He that was <I>the anointed of the Lord was 
 taken in their pits,</I> as if he had been but a beast of prey; so 
 little account did they make of a person deemed sacred and not to be 
 violated. Note, When we make any creature <I>the breath of our 
 nostrils,</I> and promise ourselves that we shall live by it, it is 
 just with God to stop that breath, and deprive us of the life we 
 expected by it; for God will have the honour of being himself along 
 <I>our life and the length of our days.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David's psalms of lamentation commonly conclude with some word of 
 comfort, which is as life from the dead and light shining out of 
 darkness; so does this lamentation here in this chapter. The people of 
 God are now in great distress, their aspects all doleful, their 
 prospects all frightful, and their ill-natured neighbours the Edomites 
 insult over them and do all they can to exasperate their destroyers 
 against them. Such was their violence against their brother Jacob 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:10">Obad. 10</A>),

 such their spleen at Jerusalem, of which they cried, <I>Rase it, rase
 it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:7">Ps. cxxxvii. 7</A>.

 Now it is here foretold, for the encouragement of God's people,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That an end shall be put to Zion's troubles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>The punishment of they iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of 
 Zion!</I> not the fulness of that punishment which it deserves, but of 
 that which God has designed and determined to inflict, and which was 
 necessary to answer the end, the glorifying of God's justice and the 
 taking away of their sin. The captivity, which is <I>the punishment of 
 thy iniquity, is accomplished</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:2">Isa. xl. 2</A>),

 and <I>he will no longer keep thee in captivity;</I> so it may be read,
 as well as, <I>he will no more carry thee into captivity;</I> he will 
 turn again thy captivity and work a glorious release for thee. Note, 
 The troubles of God's people shall be continued no longer than till 
 they have done their work for which they were sent.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That an end shall be put to Edom's triumphs. It is spoken 
 ironically 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 "<I>Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom!</I> go on to insult over 
 Zion in distress, till thou hast filled up the measure of thy iniquity. 
 Do so; rejoice in thy own present exemption from the common fate of thy 
 neighbours." This is like Solomon's upbraiding the young man with his 
 ungoverned mirth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+11:9">Eccl. xi. 9</A>):

 "<I>Rejoice, O young man! in thy youth;</I> rejoice, if thou canst,
 when God comes to reckon with thee, and that he will do ere long.
 <I>The cup</I> of trembling, which it is now Jerusalem's turn to drink 
 deeply of, <I>shall pass through unto thee;</I> it shall go round till 
 it comes to be thy lot to pledge it." Note, This is a good reason why 
 we should not insult over any who are in misery, because we ourselves 
 also are in the body, and we know not how soon their case may be ours.
 But those who please themselves in the calamities of God's church must 
 expect to have their doom, as aiders and abettors, with those that are 
 instrumental in those calamities. The destruction of the Edomites was 
 foretold by this prophet

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:7">Jer. xlix. 7</A>.

 &c.), and the people of God must encourage themselves against their
 present rudeness and insolence with the prospect of it. 

 1. It will be a shameful destruction: "<I>The cup</I> that <I>shall
 pass unto thee</I> shall intoxicate thee" (and that is shame enough to 
 any man); "<I>thou shalt be drunken,</I> quite infatuated, and at thy 
 wits' end, shalt stagger in all thy counsels and stumble in all thy 
 enterprises, and then, as Noah when he was drunk, <I>thou shalt make 
 thyself naked</I> and expose thyself to contempt." Note, Those who 
 ridicule God's people will justly be left to themselves to do that, 
 some time or other, by which they will be made ridiculous. 

 2. It will be a righteous destruction. God will herein <I>visit thy
 iniquity</I> and <I>discover thy sins;</I> he will punish them, and, to 
 justify himself therein, he will discover them, and make it to appear 
 that he has just cause thus to proceed against them. Nay, the 
 punishment of the sin shall so exactly answer the sin that it shall 
 itself plainly discover it. Sometimes God does so visit the iniquity
 that he that runs may read the sin in the punishment. But, sooner or 
 later, sin will be visited and discovered, and all the hidden works of 
 darkness brought to light.</P>
