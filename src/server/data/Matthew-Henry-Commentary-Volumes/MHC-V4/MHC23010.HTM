 The prophet, in this chapter, is dealing, 

 I. With the proud oppressors of his people at home, that abused their
 power, to pervert justice, whom he would reckon with for their tyranny, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. With a threatening invader of his people from abroad, Sennacherib
 king of Assyria, concerning whom observe, 

 1. The commission given him to invade Judah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:5,6">ver. 5, 6</A>.

 2. His pride and insolence in the execution of that commission,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:7-11,13,14">ver. 7-11, 13, 14</A>.

 3. A rebuke given to his haughtiness, and a threatening of his fall and
 ruin, when he had served the purposes for which God raised him up, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:12,15-19">ver. 12, 15-19</A>.

 4. A promise of grace to the people of God, to enable them to bear up 
 under the affliction, and to get good by it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:20-23">ver. 20-23</A>.

 5. Great encouragement given to them not to fear this threatening
 storm, but to hope that, though for the present all the country was put 
 into a great consternation by it, yet it would end well, in the 
 destruction of this formidable enemy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:24-34">ver. 24-34</A>.

 And this is intended to quiet the minds of good people in reference to 
 all the threatening efforts of the wrath of the church's enemies. If 
 God be for us, who can be against us? None to do us any harm.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write
 grievousness <I>which</I> they have prescribed;
 &nbsp; 2  To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the
 right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey,
 and <I>that</I> they may rob the fatherless!
 &nbsp; 3  And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the
 desolation <I>which</I> shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for
 help? and where will ye leave your glory?
 &nbsp; 4  Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they
 shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned
 away, but his hand <I>is</I> stretched out still.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Whether they were the princes and judges of Israel of Judah, or both, 
 that the prophet denounced this woe against, is not certain: if those 
 of Israel, these verses are to be joined with the close of the 
 foregoing chapter, which is probable enough, because the burden of that 
 prophecy (<I>for all this his anger is not turned away</I>) is repeated 
 here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 if those of Judah, they then show what was the particular design with
 which God brought the Assyrian army upon them--to punish their 
 magistrates for mal-administration, which they could not legally be 
 called to account for. To them he speaks woes before he speaks comfort 
 to God's own people. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The indictment drawn up against these oppressors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 They are charged,

 1. With making wicked laws and edicts: They <I>decree unrighteous
 decrees,</I> contrary to natural equity and the law of God: and what 
 mischief they <I>prescribe</I> those under them <I>write</I> it, enrol 
 it, and put it into the formality of a law. "Woe to the superior powers 
 that devise and decree these decrees! they are not too high to be under 
 the divine check. And woe to the inferior officers that draw them up, 
 and enter them upon record--<I>the writers that write the 
 grievousness,</I> they are not too mean to be within the divine 
 cognizance. Principal and accessaries shall fall under the same woe." 
 Note, It is bad to do hurt, but it is worse to do it with design and 
 deliberation, to do wrong to many, and to involve many in the guilt of 
 doing wrong. 

 2. With perverting justice in the execution of the laws that were made.
 No people had statutes and judgments to righteous as they had, and yet 
 corrupt judges found ways to <I>turn aside the needy from judgment,</I> 
 to hinder them from coming at their right and recovering what was their 
 due, because they were needy and poor, and such as they could get 
 nothing by nor expect any bribes from. 

 3. With enriching themselves by oppressing those that lay at their
 mercy, whom they ought to have protected. They make widows' houses and 
 estates their prey, and they <I>rob the fatherless</I> of the little 
 that is left them, because they have no friend to appear for them. Not 
 to relieve them if they had wanted, not to right them if they were 
 wronged, would have been crime enough in men that had wealth and power; 
 but to rob them because on the side of the oppressors there was power, 
 and the oppressed had no comforter

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+4:1">Eccl. iv. 1</A>),

 was such apiece of barbarity as one would think none could ever be
 guilty of that had either the nature of a man or the name of an 
 Israelite.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A challenge given them with all their pride and power to outface 
 the judgments of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>What will you do? To whom will you flee?</I> You can trample upon
 the widows and fatherless; but <I>what will you do when God riseth 
 up?</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:14">Job xxxi. 14</A>.

 Great men, who tyrannise over the poor, think they shall never be
 called to account for their tyranny, shall never hear of it again, or 
 fare the worse for it; but <I>shall not God visit for these things?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:29">Jer. v. 29</A>.

 Will there not come a desolation upon those that have made others
 desolate? Perhaps it may <I>come from far,</I> and therefore may be
 long in coming; but it will come at last (reprieves are not pardons), 
 and coming from far, from a quarter whence it was least expected, it 
 will be the greater surprise and the more terrible. What will then 
 become of these unrighteous judges? Now they <I>see their help in the 
 gate</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:21">Job xxxi. 21</A>);

 but to whom will they then flee for help? Note, 

 1. There is a day of visitation coming, a day of enquiry and discovery,
 a searching day, which will bring to light, to a true light, every man, 
 and every man's work. 

 2. The day of visitation will be a day of desolation to all wicked
 people, when all their comforts and hopes will be lost and gone, and 
 buried in ruin, and themselves left desolate. 

 3. Impenitent sinners will be utterly at a loss, and will no know what
 to do in the day of visitation and desolation. They cannot fly and hide 
 themselves, cannot fight it out and defend themselves; they have no 
 refuge in which either to shelter themselves from the present evil 
 (<I>to whom will you flee for help?</I>) or to secure to themselves 
 better times hereafter: "<I>Where will you leave your glory,</I> to 
 find it again when the storm is over?" The wealth they had got was 
 their glory, and they had no place of safety in which to deposit that, 
 but they should certainly see it flee away. If our souls be our glory, 
 as they ought to be, and we make them our chief care, we know where to 
 leave them, and into whose hands to commit them, even those of a 
 faithful Creator. 

 4. It concerns us all seriously to consider what we shall do in the day
 of visitation, in a day of affliction, in the day of death and 
 judgment, and to provide that we may do well.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Sentence passed upon them, by which they are doomed, some to 
 imprisonment and captivity (<I>they shall bow down among the 
 prisoners,</I> or <I>under them</I>--those that were most highly
 elevated in sin shall be most heavily loaded and most deeply sunk in 
 trouble), others to death: they shall fall first, and so shall fall 
 under the rest of the slain. Those that had trampled upon the widows 
 and fatherless shall themselves be trodden down, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 "This it will come to," says God, "<I>without me,</I> that is, because 
 you have deserted me and driven me away from you." Nothing but utter 
 ruin can be expected by those that live without God in the world, that 
 cast him behind their back, and so cast themselves out of his 
 protection.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 And yet, <I>for all this, his anger is not turned away,</I> which 
 intimates not only that God will proceed in his controversy with them, 
 but that they shall be in a continual dread of it; they shall, to their 
 unspeakable terror, see his hand still stretched out against them, and 
 there shall remain nothing but <I>a fearful looking for of 
 judgment.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their
 hand is mine indignation.
 &nbsp; 6  I will send him against a hypocritical nation, and against
 the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the
 spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire
 of the streets.
 &nbsp; 7  Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so;
 but <I>it is</I> in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a
 few.
 &nbsp; 8  For he saith, <I>Are</I> not my princes altogether kings?
 &nbsp; 9  <I>Is</I> not Calno as Carchemish? <I>is</I> not Hamath as Arpad? <I>is</I>
 not Samaria as Damascus?
 &nbsp; 10  As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose
 graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;
 &nbsp; 11  Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so
 do to Jerusalem and her idols?
 &nbsp; 12  Wherefore it shall come to pass, <I>that</I> when the Lord hath
 performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will
 punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and
 the glory of his high looks.
 &nbsp; 13  For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done <I>it,</I>
 and by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds
 of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put
 down the inhabitants like a valiant <I>man:</I>
 &nbsp; 14  And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people:
 and as one gathereth eggs <I>that are</I> left, have I gathered all
 the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the
 mouth, or peeped.
 &nbsp; 15  Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth
 therewith? <I>or</I> shall the saw magnify itself against him that
 shaketh it? as if the rod should shake <I>itself</I> against them that
 lift it up, <I>or</I> as if the staff should lift up <I>itself, as if it
 were</I> no wood.
 &nbsp; 16  Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his
 fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning
 like the burning of a fire.
 &nbsp; 17  And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy
 One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his
 briers in one day;
 &nbsp; 18  And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his
 fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a
 standard-bearer fainteth.
 &nbsp; 19  And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a
 child may write them.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The destruction of the kingdom of Israel by Shalmaneser king of Assyria 
 was foretold in the foregoing chapter, and it had its accomplishment in 
 the sixth year of Hezekiah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:10">2 Kings xviii. 10</A>.

 It was total and final, head and tail were all cut off. Now the
 correction of the kingdom of Judah by Sennacherib king of Assyria is 
 foretold in this chapter; and this prediction was fulfilled in the 
 fourteenth year of Hezekiah, when that potent prince, encouraged by the 
 successes of his predecessor against the ten tribes, <I>came up against 
 all the fenced cities of Judah and took them, and laid siege to 
 Jerusalem</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:13,17">2 Kings xviii. 13, 17</A>),

 in consequence of which we may well suppose Hezekiah and his kingdom
 were greatly alarmed, though there was a good work of reformation 
 lately begun among them: but it ended well, in the confusion of the 
 Assyrians and the great encouragement of Hezekiah and his people in 
 their return to God. Now let us see here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How God, in his sovereignty, deputed the king of Assyria to be his 
 servant, and made use of him as a mere tool to serve his own purposes 
 with 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>):

 "<I>O Assyrian!</I> know this, that thou art <I>the rod of my
 anger;</I> and I will send thee to be a scourge to <I>the people of my 
 wrath.</I>" Observe here, 

 1. How bad the character of the Jews was, though they appeared very
 good. They were <I>a hypocritical nation,</I> that made a profession of 
 religion, and at this time particularly of reformation, but were not 
 truly religious, not truly reformed, not so good as they pretended to 
 be now that Hezekiah had brought goodness into fashion. When rulers are 
 pious, and so religion is in reputation, it is common for nations to be 
 hypocritical. They are <I>a profane nation;</I> so some read it. 
 Hezekiah had in a great measure cured them of their idolatry, and now 
 they ran into profaneness; nay, hypocrisy is profaneness: none profane 
 the name of God so much as those who are called by that name and call 
 upon it, and yet live in sin. Being a profane hypocritical nation, they 
 are the people of God's wrath; they lie under his wrath, and are likely 
 to be consumed by it. Note, Hypocritical nations are the people of 
 God's wrath: nothing is more offensive to God than dissimulation in 
 religion. See what a change sin made: those that had been God's chosen
 and hallowed people, above all people, had now become the <I>people of 
 his wrath.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:2">Amos iii. 2</A>.

 2. How mean the character of the Assyrian was, though he appeared very
 great. He was but <I>the rod of God's anger,</I> an instrument God was 
 pleased to make use of for the chastening of his people, that, being 
 thus <I>chastened of the Lord, they might not be condemned with the 
 world.</I> Note, The tyrants of the world are but the tools of 
 Providence. Men are God's hand, his sword sometimes, to kill and slay

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:13,14">Ps. xvii. 13, 14</A>),

 at other times his rod to correct. <I>The staff in their hand,</I>
 wherewith they smite his people, <I>is his indignation;</I> it is his 
 wrath that puts the staff into their hand and enables them to deal 
 blows at pleasure among such as thought themselves a match for them. 
 Sometimes God makes an idolatrous nation, that serves him not at all, a 
 scourge to a hypocritical nation, that serves him not in sincerity and 
 truth. The Assyrian is called the <I>rod of God's anger</I> because he 
 is employed by him.

 (1.) From him his power is derived: <I>I will send him; I will give him
 a charge.</I> Note, All the power that wicked men have, though they 
 often use it against God, they always receive from him. Pilate could 
 have no power against Christ unless it were <I>given him from 
 above,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:11">John xix. 11</A>.

 (2.) By him the exercise of that power is directed. The Assyrian is
 <I>to take the spoil and to take the prey,</I> not to shed any blood. 
 We read not of any slain, but he is to plunder the country, rifle the 
 houses, drive away the cattle, strip the people of all their wealth and 
 ornaments, and <I>tread them down like the mire of the streets.</I> 
 When God's professing people wallow in the mire of sin it is just with 
 God to suffer their enemies to tread upon them like mire. But why must 
 the Assyrian prevail thus against them? Not that they might be ruined,
 but that they might be thoroughly reformed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. See how the king of Assyria, in his pride, magnified himself as his 
 own master, and pretended to be absolute and above all control, to act 
 purely according to his own will and for his own honour. <I>God 
 ordained him for judgment,</I> even the <I>mighty God established him 
 for correction</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:12">Hab. i. 12</A>),

 to be an instrument of bringing his people to repentance, <I>howbeit he
 means not so, nor does his heart think so,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He does not think that he is either God's servant or Israel's 
 friend, either that he <I>can</I> do no more than God will let him or 
 that he <I>shall</I> do no more than God will make to work for the good 
 of his people. God designs to correct his people for, and so to cure 
 them of, their hypocrisy, and bring them nearer to himself; but was 
 that Sennacherib's design? No, it was the furthest thing from his 
 thoughts--<I>he means not so.</I> Note, 

 (1.) The wise God often makes even the sinful passions and projects of
 men subservient to his own great and holy purposes.

 (2.) When God makes use of men as instruments in his hand to do his
 work it is very common for <I>him</I> to mean one thing and <I>them</I> 
 to mean another, nay, for them to mean quite the contrary to what he 
 intends. What Joseph's brethren designed for hurt God overruled for 
 good, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+50:20">Gen. l. 20</A>.
 
 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+4:11,12">Mic. iv. 11, 12</A>.

 Men have their ends and God has his, but we are sure <I>the counsel of
 the Lord shall stand.</I> But what is it the proud Assyrian aims at? 
 The heart of kings is unsearchable, but God knew what was in his 
 heart.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He designs nothing but <I>to destroy and to cut off nations not a 
 few,</I> and to make himself master of them. 

 [1.] He designs to gratify his own cruelty; nothing will serve but to 
 destroy and cut off. He hopes to regale himself with blood and 
 slaughter; that of particular persons will not suffice, he must cut off 
 nations. It is below him to deal by retail; he traffics in murders by 
 wholesale. Nations, and those not a few, must have but one neck, which 
 he will have the pleasure of cutting off. 

 [2.] He designs to gratify his own covetousness and ambition, to set up 
 for a universal monarch, <I>and to gather unto him all nations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:5">Hab. ii. 5</A>.

 An insatiable desire of wealth and dominion is that which carries him
 on in this undertaking.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The prophet here brings him in vaunting, and hectoring; and by his 
 general's letter to Hezekiah, written in his name, vainglory and 
 arrogance seem to have entered very far into the spirit and genius of 
 the man. His haughtiness and presumption are here described very 
 largely, and his very language copied out, partly to represent him as 
 ridiculous and partly to assure the people of God that he would be 
 brought down; for that maxim generally holds true, that pride goes 
 before destruction. It also intimates that God takes notice, and keeps 
 an account, of all men's proud and haughty words, with which they set 
 heaven and earth at defiance. Those that speak <I>great swelling words 
 of vanity</I> shall hear of them again.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He boasts of the great things he had done to other nations. 

 [1.] He had made their kings his courtiers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>My princes are altogether kings.</I> Those that are now my princes
 are such as have been kings." Or he means that he had raised his throng 
 to such a degree that his servants, and those that were in command 
 under him, were as great, and lived in as much pomp, as the kings of 
 other countries. Or those that were absolute princes in their own 
 dominions held their crowns under him, and did him homage. This was a 
 vainglorious boast; but how great is our God whom we serve, who is 
 indeed King of kings, and whose subjects are made to him kings! 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:6">Rev. i. 6</A>.

 [2.] He had made himself master of their cities. He names several

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 that were all alike reduced by him. <I>Calno</I> soon yielded <I>as
 Carchemish</I> did, <I>Hamath</I> could not hold out any more than 
 <I>Arpad,</I> and <I>Samaria</I> had become his as well as 
 <I>Damascus.</I> To support his boasts he is obliged to bring the 
 victories of his predecessor into the account; for it was he that 
 conquered Samaria, not Sennacherib.

 [3.] He had been too hard for their idols, their tutelar gods, <I>had 
 found out the kingdoms of the idols</I> and found out ways to make them 
 his own, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Their kingdoms took denomination from the idols they worshipped; the 
 Moabites are called <I>the people of Chemosh</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:46">Jer. xlviii. 46</A>),

 because they imagined their gods were their patrons and protectors; and
 therefore Sennacherib vainly imagined that every conquest of a kingdom 
 was the conquest of a god. 

 [4.] He had enlarged his own dominions, and <I>removed the bounds of 
 the people</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),
 
 enclosing many large territories within the limits of his own kingdom
 and shifting a great way further the ancient land-marks which his 
 fathers had set; he could not bear to be hemmed in so closely, but must 
 have more room to thrive. By his <I>removing the border of the 
 people</I> Mr. White understands his arbitrarily transplanting colonies 
 from place to place, which was the constant practice of the Assyrians 
 in all their conquests; and this is a probable interpretation. 

 [5.] He had enriched himself with their wealth, and brought it into his 
 own exchequer: <I>I have robbed their treasures.</I> In this he said 
 truly, Great conquerors are often no better than great robbers. 

 [6.] He had mastered all the opposition he met with: "<I>I have put 
 down the inhabitants as a valiant man.</I> Those that sat high, and 
 thought they say firmly, I have humbled and made to come down."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He boasts of the manner in which he had done them. 

 [1.] That he had done all this by his own policy and power

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 "<I>By the strength of my hand,</I> for I am valiant; <I>and by my
 wisdom, for I am prudent;</I>" not by the permission of Providence and 
 the blessing of God. He knows not that it is God that makes him what he 
 is, and puts the staff into his hand, but <I>sacrifices to his own 
 net,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:16">Hab. i. 16</A>.

 "This wealth is all gotten by <I>my might and the power of my
 hand,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:17">Deut. viii. 17</A>.

 Downright atheism and profaneness, as well as pride and vanity, are at
 the bottom of men's attributing their prosperity and success thus to 
 themselves and their own conduct, and raising their own character upon 
 it.

 [2.] That he had done all this with a great deal of ease, and had made 
 but a sport and diversion of it, as if he had been taking birds' nests

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>my hand has found as a nest the riches of the people;</I> and when
 he had found them there was no more difficulty in taking them than in 
 rifling a nest, nor any more reluctance or regret within his own breast 
 in destroying families and cities than in destroying crows'-nests; 
 killing children was no more to him than killing birds. "<I>As one 
 gathers the eggs that are left</I> in the nest by the dam, so easily 
 <I>have I gathered all the earth.</I>" Like Alexander, he thought he 
 had conquered the world; and whatever prey he seized there was none 
 that <I>moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped,</I> as birds do 
 when their nests are rifled. They durst not make any opposition, no,
 nor any complaint; such awe did they stand in of this mighty conqueror. 
 They were so weak that they knew it was to no purpose to resist, and he 
 was so arbitrary that they knew it was to no purpose to complain.
 Strange that ever men who were made to do good should take a pride and 
 a pleasure in doing wrong, and doing mischief to all about them without 
 control, and should reckon that their glory which is their shame! But 
 <I>their</I> day will come to fall who thus make themselves <I>the 
 terror of thy mighty,</I> and much more of the feeble, <I>in the land 
 of the living.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He threatens what he will do to Jerusalem, which he was now about 
 to lay siege to, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 He would master Jerusalem and her idols, as he had subdued other places 
 and their idols, particularly Samaria.

 [1.] He blasphemously calls the God of Israel an <I>idol,</I> and sets 
 him on a level with the false gods of other nations, as if none were 
 the true God but Mithras, the sun, whom he worshipped. See how ignorant 
 he was, and then we shall the less wonder that he was so proud. 

 [2.] He prefers the graven images of other countries before those of 
 Jerusalem and Samaria, when he might have known that the worshippers of 
 the God of Israel were expressly forbidden to make any graven images, 
 and if any did it must be by stealth, and therefore they could not be 
 so rich and pompous as those of other nations. If he means the ark and 
 the mercy-seat, he speaks like himself, very foolishly, and as one that 
 judged by the sight of the eye, and might therefore be easily deceived 
 in matters of spiritual concern. Those who make external pomp and
 splendour a mark of the true church go by the same rule. 

 [3.] Because he had conquered Samaria, he concluded Jerusalem would 
 fall of course: "<I>Shall not I do so to Jerusalem?</I> can I not as 
 easily, and may I not as justly?" But it did not follow; for Jerusalem 
 adhered to her God, whereas Samaria had forsaken him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. See how God, in his justice, rebukes his pride and reads his doom. 
 We have heard what the great king, the king of Assyria, says, and how 
 big he talks. Let us now hear what the great God has to say by his 
 servant the prophet, and we shall find that, wherein he deals proudly, 
 God is above him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He shows the vanity of his insolent and audacious boasts 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):
 
 <I>Shall the axe boast itself against him that hews therewith? or shall
 the saw magnify itself against him that draws it?</I> So absurd are the 
 boasts of this proud man. "O what a dust do I make!" said the fly upon 
 the cart-wheel in the fable. "What destruction do I make among the 
 trees!" says the axe. Two ways the axe may be said to <I>boast itself 
 against him that hews with it:</I>--

 (1.) By way of resistance and opposition. Sennacherib blasphemed God,
 insulted him, threatened to serve him as he had served the gods of the 
 nations; now this was as if the axe should fly in the face of him that 
 hews with it. The tool striving with the workman is no less absurd than 
 the clay striving with the potter; and as it is a thing not to be 
 justified that men should fight against God with the wit, and wealth, 
 and power, which he gives them, so it is a thing not to be suffered. 
 But if men will be thus proud and daring, and bid defiances to all that 
 is just and sacred, let them expect that God will reckon with them; the 
 more insolent they are the surer and sorer will their ruin be.

 (2.) By way of rivalship and competition. Shall the axe take to itself
 the praise of the work it is employed in? So senseless, so absurd was 
 it for Sennacherib to say, <I>By the strength of my hand I have done 
 it, and by my wisdom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 It is as if the rod, when it is shaken, should boast that it guides the 
 hand which shakes it; whereas, <I>when the staff is lifted up, is it 
 not wood still?</I> so the last clause may be read. If it be an ensign 
 of authority (as the nobles of the people carried staves,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:18">Num. xxi. 18</A>),

 if it be an instrument of service, either to support a weak man or to
 correct a bad man, still it is wood, and can do nothing but as it is 
 directed by him that uses it. The psalmist prays that God would make 
 the nations to know that they <I>were but men</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:20">Ps. ix. 20</A>),

 the staff to know that it is but wood.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He foretels his fall and ruin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That when God had done his work by him he would then do his work 
 upon him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 For the comfort of the people of God in reference to Sennacherib's 
 invasion, though it was a dismal time with them, let them know,

 [1.] That God designed to do good to Zion and Jerusalem by this 
 providence. There is a work to be done upon them, which God intends, 
 and which he will perform. Note, When God lets loose the enemies of his 
 church and people, and suffers them for a time to prevail, it is in 
 order to the performing of some great good work upon them; and, when 
 that is done, then, and not till then, he will work deliverance for 
 them. When God brings his people into trouble it is to try them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:35">Dan. xi. 35</A>),

 to bring sin to their remembrance and humble them for it, and to awaken
 them to a sense of their duty, to teach them to pray and to love and 
 help one another; and <I>this must be the fruit, even the taking away 
 of sin,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:9"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 9</A>.

 When these points are, in some measure, gained by the affliction, it
 shall be removed, in mercy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:41,42">Lev. xxvi. 41, 42</A>),

 otherwise not; for, as the word, so the rod shall <I>accomplish that
 for which God sends it.</I> 

 [2.] That when God had wrought this work of grace for his people he 
 would work a work of wrath and vengeance upon their invaders: <I>I will 
 punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria.</I> His big 
 words are here said to come from his stout heart, and they are the 
 fruit of it; for <I>out of the abundance of the heart the mouth 
 speaks.</I> Notice is taken too of the <I>glory of his high looks,</I> 
 for a proud look is the indication of a proud spirit. The enemies of
 the church are commonly very high and haughty; but, sooner or later, 
 God will reckon for their haughtiness. He glories in it as an
 incontestable proof of his power and sovereignty that he <I>looks upon 
 proud men and abases them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:11">Job xl. 11</A>,

 &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That, how threatening soever this attempt was upon Zion and 
 Jerusalem, it should certainly be baffled, and broken, and come to 
 nothing, and he should not be able to bring to pass his enterprise, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:16,19"><I>v.</I> 16, 19</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Who it is that undertakes his destruction, and will be the author 
 of it; not Hezekiah, or his princes, or the militia of Judah and 
 Jerusalem (what can they do against such a potent force?), but God 
 himself will do it, as <I>the Lord of hosts,</I> and as <I>the light of 
 Israel. First,</I> We are sure he can do it, for he is <I>the Lord of 
 hosts,</I> of all the hosts of heaven and earth. All the creatures are 
 at his command; he makes what use he pleases on them. He is the Lord of 
 the hosts both of Judah and of Assyria, and can give the victory to 
 which he pleases. Let us not fear the hosts of any enemy if we have the 
 Lord of hosts for us. <I>Secondly,</I> We have reason to hope he will 
 do it, for he is <I>the light of Israel, and his Holy One.</I> God is 
 light; in him are perfect brightness, purity, and happiness. He is 
 light, for he is the Holy One; his holiness is his glory. He is 
 Israel's light, to direct and counsel his people, to favour and 
 countenance them, and so to gladden and comfort them in the worst of 
 times. He is their Holy One, for he is in covenant with them; his 
 holiness is engaged and employed for them. God's holiness is the 
 saints' comfort; they <I>give thanks at the remembrance</I> of it, and 
 with a great deal of pleasure call him <I>their Holy One,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:12">Hab. i. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] How this destruction is represented. It shall be, <I>First,</I> As 
 a consumption of the body by a disease: <I>The Lord shall send leanness 
 among his fatnesses,</I> or <I>his fat ones.</I> His numerous army, 
 that was like a body covered with fatness, shall be diminished, and 
 waste away, and become like a skeleton. <I>Secondly,</I> As a 
 consumption of buildings, or trees and bushes, by fire: <I>Under his 
 glory,</I> that very thing which he glories in, <I>he will kindle a 
 burning, as the burning of a fire,</I> which shall lay his army in 
 ruins as suddenly as a raging fire lays a stately house in ashes. Some 
 make it an allusion to the fire kindled under the sacrifices; for proud 
 sinners fall as sacrifices to divine justice. Observe, 

 1. How this fire shall be kindled,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 The same God that is a rejoicing light to those that serve him 
 faithfully will be a consuming fire to those that trifle with him or 
 rebel against him. <I>The light of Israel shall be for a fire</I> to 
 the Assyrians, as the same pillar of cloud was a light to the 
 Israelites and a terror to the Egyptians in the Red Sea. What can
 oppose, what can extinguish, such a fire? 

 2. What desolation it shall make: <I>it shall burn and devour its
 thorns and briers,</I> his officers and soldiers, which are of little 
 worth, and vexations to God's Israel, as thorns and briers, whose end 
 is to be burned, and which are easily and quickly consumed by a 
 devouring fire. "<I>Who would set the briers and thorns against me in 
 battle?</I> They would be so far from stopping the fire that they would 
 inflame it. <I>I would go through them and burn them together</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:4"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 4</A>);

 they shall be devoured in one day, all cut off in an instant." When
 they cried not only Peace and safety, but Victory and triumph, then 
 sudden destruction came; it came surprisingly, and was completed in a 
 little time. "Even <I>the glory of his forest</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 the choice troops of his army, the veterans, the troops of the
 household, the bravest regiments he had, that he was most proud of and 
 depended most upon, that he valued as men do their timber-trees (the 
 glory of their forest) or their fruit-trees (the glory of the Carmel), 
 shall be put as briers and thorns before the fire; they shall be 
 consumed both soul and body, entirely consumed, not only a limb burned, 
 but life taken away." Note, God is able to destroy both soul and body, 
 and therefore we should fear him more than man, who can but kill the 
 body. Great armies before him are but as great woods, which he can fell 
 or fire when he pleases.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] What would be the effect of this great slaughter. The prophet 
 tells us, <I>First,</I> That the army would hereby be reduced to a very 
 small number: <I>The rest of the trees of his forest shall be few;</I> 
 very few shall escape the sword of the destroying angel, so few that 
 there needs no artist, no muster-master or secretary of war, to take an 
 account of them, for even <I>a child may</I> soon reckon the numbers of 
 them, and <I>write</I> the names of <I>them. Secondly,</I> That those 
 few who remained should be quite dispirited: <I>They shall be as when a 
 standard-bearer fainteth.</I> When he either falls or flees, and his 
 colours are taken by the enemy, this discourages the whole army, and 
 puts them all into confusion. Upon the whole matter we must say, <I>Who 
 is able to stand before this great and holy Lord God?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  And it shall come to pass in that day, <I>that</I> the remnant of
 Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no
 more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.
 &nbsp; 21  The remnant shall return, <I>even</I> the remnant of Jacob, unto
 the mighty God.
 &nbsp; 22  For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea,
 <I>yet</I> a remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed
 shall overflow with righteousness.
 &nbsp; 23  For the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> of hosts shall make a consumption, even
 determined, in the midst of all the land.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>)

 that <I>the Lord would perform his whole work upon Mount Zion and upon
 Jerusalem,</I> by Sennacherib's invading the land. Now here we are told 
 what that work should be, a twofold work:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The conversion of some, to whom this providence should be sanctified 
 and yield the peaceable fruit of righteousness, though for the present 
 it was not joyous, but grievous; these are but a remnant 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),
 
 <I>the remnant of Israel</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),
 
 <I>the remnant of Jacob</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 but a very few in comparison with the vast numbers of the people of
 Israel, who were as the sand of the sea. Note, Converting work is 
 wrought but on a remnant, who are distinguished from the rest and set 
 apart for God. When we see how populous Israel is, how numerous the
 members of the visible church are, as the sand of the sea, and yet 
 consider that of these a remnant only shall be saved, that of the many 
 that are called there are but few chosen, we shall surely <I>strive to 
 enter in at the strait gate</I> and fear lest we <I>seem to come 
 short.</I> This remnant of Israel are said to be <I>such as had escaped 
 of the house of Jacob,</I> such as escaped the corruptions of the house 
 of Jacob, and kept their integrity in times of common apostasy; and 
 that was a fair escape. And therefore they escape the desolations of 
 that house, and shall be preserved in safety in times of common 
 calamity; and that also will be a fair and narrow escape. Their 
 <I>lives shall be given them for a prey,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+45:5">Jer. xlv. 5</A>.

 The <I>righteous scarcely are saved.</I> Now,

 1. This remnant shall come off from all confidence in an arm of flesh,
 this providence shall cure them of that: "They <I>shall no more again 
 stay upon him that smote them,</I> shall never depend upon the 
 Assyrians, as they have done, for help against their other enemies, 
 finding that they are themselves their worst enemies." <I>Ictus 
 piscator sapit--sufferings teach caution.</I> "They have now learned by 
 dear-bought experience the folly of leaning upon that staff as a stay 
 to them which may perhaps prove a staff to beat them." It is part of 
 the covenant of a returning people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:3">Hos. xiv. 3</A>),

 <I>Assyria shall not save us.</I> Note, By our afflictions we may learn
 not to make creatures our confidence. 

 2. They shall come home to God, to the mighty God (one of the names
 given to the Messiah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:6"><I>ch.</I> ix. 6</A>),

 to the Holy One of Israel: "<I>The remnant shall return</I> (that was
 signified by the name of the prophet's son, <I>Shear-jashub,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:3"><I>ch.</I> vii. 3</A>),

 <I>even the remnant of Jacob.</I> They shall return, after the raising
 of the siege of Jerusalem, not only to the quiet possession of their 
 houses and lands, but to God and to their duty; they shall repent, and 
 pray, and seek his face, and reform their lives." The remnant that 
 escape are a returning remnant: they shall return to God, and shall 
 stay upon him. Note, Those only may with comfort stay upon God that 
 return to him; then may we have a humble confidence in God when we make 
 conscience of our duty to him. They <I>shall stay upon the Holy One of 
 Israel, in truth,</I> and not in pretence and profession only. This 
 promise of the conversion and salvation of a remnant of Israel is 
 applied by the apostle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:27">Rom. ix. 27</A>)

 to the remnant of the Jews which at the first preaching of the gospel
 received and entertained it, and sufficiently proves that it was no new 
 thing for God to abandon to ruin a great many of the seed of Abraham in 
 full force and virtue; for so it was now. The number of the children of 
 Israel was <I>as the sand of the sea</I> (according to the promise,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:17">Gen. xxii. 17</A>),

 and yet only a remnant shall be saved.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The consumption of others: <I>The Lord God of hosts shall make a 
 consumption,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 This is not meant (as that

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>)

 of the consumption of the Assyrian army, but of the consumption of the
 estates and families of many of the Jews by the Assyrian army. This is 
 taken notice of to magnify the power and goodness of God in the escape 
 of the distinguished remnant, and to let us know what shall become of 
 those that will not return to God; they shall be wasted away by this 
 consumption, this general decay <I>in the midst of the land.</I> 
 Observe, 

 1. It is a consumption of God's own making; he is the author of it. The
 Lord God of hosts, whom none can resist, shall make this consumption.
 
 2. It is <I>decreed.</I> It is not the product of a sudden resolve, but
 was before ordained. It is <I>determined,</I> not only that there shall 
 be such a consumption, but it is <I>cut out</I> (so the word is); it is 
 particularly appointed how far it shall extend and how long it shall 
 continue, who shall be consumed by it and who not. 

 3. It is an overflowing consumption, that shall overspread the land,
 and, like a mighty torrent or inundation, bear down all before it. 

 4. Though it overflows, it is not at random, but in
 <I>righteousness,</I> which signifies both wisdom and equity. God will 
 justly bring this consumption upon a provoking people, but he will 
 wisely and graciously set bounds to it. <I>Hitherto it shall come, and 
 no further.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>24  Therefore thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> of hosts, O my people that
 dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite
 thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after
 the manner of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 25  For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall
 cease, and mine anger in their destruction.
 &nbsp; 26  And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him
 according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and
 <I>as</I> his rod <I>was</I> upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after the
 manner of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 27  And it shall come to pass in that day, <I>that</I> his burden
 shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off
 thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the
 anointing.
 &nbsp; 28  He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he
 hath laid up his carriages:
 &nbsp; 29  They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their
 lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.
 &nbsp; 30  Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be
 heard unto Laish, O poor Anathoth.
 &nbsp; 31  Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather
 themselves to flee.
 &nbsp; 32  As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his
 hand <I>against</I> the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of
 Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 33  Behold, the Lord, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, shall lop the bough
 with terror: and the high ones of stature <I>shall be</I> hewn down,
 and the haughty shall be humbled.
 &nbsp; 34  And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron,
 and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet, in his preaching, distinguishes between the precious and 
 the vile; for God in his providence, even in the same providence, does 
 so. He speaks terror, in Sennacherib's invasion, to the hypocrites, who 
 were the <I>people of God's wrath,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 But here he speaks comfort to the sincere, who were the people of God's 
 love. The judgment was sent for the sake of the former; the deliverance 
 was wrought for the sake of the latter. Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. An exhortation to God's people not to be frightened at this 
 threatening calamity, nor to be put into any confusion or consternation 
 by it. <I>Let the sinners in Zion be afraid</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:14"><I>ch.</I> xxxiii. 14</A>):

 but <I>O my people, that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the
 Assyrian,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Note, It is against the mind and will of God that his people, whatever 
 may happen, should give way to that fear which has torment and 
 amazement. Those that dwell in Zion, where God dwells and where his 
 people attend him, and are employed in his service, that are under the 
 protection of the bulwarks that are <I>round about Zion</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:13">Ps. xlviii. 13</A>),

 need not be afraid of any enemy. Let their souls dwell at ease in
 God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Considerations offered for the silencing of their fear.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The Assyrian shall do nothing against them but what God has 
 appointed and determined. They are here told before hand what he shall 
 do, that it may be no surprise to them: "<I>He shall smite thee</I> by 
 the divine permission, but it shall be only <I>with a rod</I> to 
 correct thee, not with a sword to wound and kill; nay, <I>he shall but 
 lift up his staff against thee,</I> threaten thee, and frighten thee, 
 and shake the rod at thee, <I>after the manner of Egypt,</I> as the 
 Egyptians shook their staff against your fathers at the Red Sea, when 
 they said, <I>We will pursue, we will overtake</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:9">Exod. xv. 9</A>),

 but could not reach to do them any hurt." Note, We should not be
 frightened at those enemies that can do no more than frighten us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The storm shall soon blow over 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>Yet a very little while--a little, little while</I> (so the word
 is), <I>and the indignation shall cease, even my anger,</I> which is 
 <I>the staff in their hand</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 so that when that ceases they are disarmed and disabled to do any
 further mischief. Note, God's anger against his people is but for a 
 moment

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+30:5">Ps. xxx. 5</A>),

 and when that ceases, and is turned away from us, we need not fear the
 fury of any man, for it is impotent passion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The enemy that threatens them shall himself be reckoned with. God's 
 anger against his people <I>shall cease in the destruction</I> of their 
 enemies; when he turns away his wrath from Israel he shall turn it 
 against the Assyrian; and the rod with which he corrected his people 
 shall not only be laid aside, but thrown into the fire. He <I>lifted up 
 his staff</I> against Zion, but God <I>shall stir up a scourge for 
 him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>);

 he is a terror to God's people, but God will be a terror to him. The
 destroying angel shall be this scourge, which he can neither flee from 
 nor contend with. The prophet, for the encouragement of God's people, 
 quotes precedents, and puts them in mind of what God had done formerly 
 against the enemies of his church, who were very strong and formidable, 
 but were brought to ruin. The destruction of the Assyrian shall be,

 (1.) <I>According to the slaughter of Midian</I> (which was effected by
 an invisible power, but effected suddenly, and it was a total rout); 
 and as, <I>at the rock of Oreb,</I> one of the princes of Midian, after 
 the battle, was slain, so shall Sennacherib be in the temple of his god 
 Nisroch, after the defeat of his forces, when he thinks the bitterness 
 of death is past. Compare with this 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:11">Ps. lxxxiii. 11</A>,

 <I>Make their nobles like Oreb and like Zeeb;</I> and see how God's
 promises and his people's prayers agree.

 (2.) <I>As his rod was upon the sea,</I> the Red Sea, as Moses' rod was
 upon that, to divide it first for the escape of Israel and then to 
 close it again for the destruction of their pursuers, so shall his rod 
 now be <I>lifted up, after the manner of Egypt,</I> for the deliverance 
 of Jerusalem and the destruction of the Assyrian. Note, It is good to 
 observe a resemblance between God's latter and former appearances for 
 his people, and against his and their enemies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They shall be wholly delivered from the power of the Assyrian, and 
 from the fear of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 "They shall not only be eased of the Assyrian army, which is now 
 quartered upon them and which is a grievous yoke and burden to them, 
 but they shall no more pay that tribute to the king of Assyria which 
 before this invasion he exacted from them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:14">2 Kings xviii. 14</A>),

 shall be no longer at his service, nor lie at his mercy, as they have
 done; nor shall he ever again put the country under contribution." Some 
 think it looks further, to the deliverance of the Jews out of their 
 captivity in Babylon; and further yet, to the redemption of believers 
 from the tyranny of sin and Satan. The yoke shall not only be taken 
 away, but it <I>shall be destroyed.</I> The enemy shall no more recover 
 his strength, to do the mischief he has done; and this <I>because of 
 the anointing,</I> for their sakes who were partakers of the anointing.

 (1.) For Hezekiah's sake, who was the anointed of the Lord, who had
 been an active reformer, and was dear to God.

 (2.) For David's sake. This is particularly given as the reason why God
 would defend Jerusalem from Sennacherib

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:35"><I>ch.</I> xxxvii. 35</A>),

 <I>For my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.</I> 

 (3.) For his people Israel's sake, the good people among them that had
 received the unction of divine grace.

 (4.) For the sake of the Messiah, the Anointed of God, whom God had an
 eye to in all the deliverances of the Old-Testament church, and hath 
 still an eye to in all the favours he shows to his people. It is for 
 his sake that the yoke is broken, and that we are made free indeed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A description both of the terror of the enemy and the terror with 
 which many were struck by it, and the folly of both exposed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:28-34"><I>v.</I> 28</A>,

 to the end. Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How formidable the Assyrians were and how daring and threatening 
 they affected to appear. Here is a particular description of the march 
 of Sennacherib, what course he steered, what swift advances he made: 
 <I>He has come to Aiath,</I> &c. "This and the other place he has made 
 himself master of, and has met with no opposition." <I>At Michmash he 
 has laid up his carriages,</I> as if he had no further occasion for his 
 heavy artillery, so easily was every place he came to reduced; or the 
 store-cities of Judah, which were fortified for that purpose, had now 
 become his magazines. Some remarkable pass, and an important one, he 
 had taken: <I>They have gone over the passage.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How cowardly the men of Judah were, the degenerate seed of that 
 lion's whelp. They were <I>afraid;</I> they <I>fled</I> upon the first 
 alarm, and did not offer to make any head against the enemy. Their 
 apostasy from God had dispirited them, so that one chased a thousand of 
 them. Instead of a valiant shout, to animate one another, nothing was 
 heard by lamentation, to discourage and weaken one another. And <I>poor 
 Anathoth,</I> a priests' city, that should have been a pattern of 
 courage, shrieks louder than any, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 With respect to those that <I>gathered themselves</I> together, it was 
 not to fight, but to flee by consent, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.
 
 This is designed either,

 (1.) To show how fast the news of the enemy's progress flew through the
 kingdom: <I>He has come to Aiath,</I> says one; nay, says another, 
 <I>He has passed to Migron,</I> &c. And yet, perhaps, it was not 
 altogether so bad as common fame represented it. But we must watch 
 against the fear, not only of evil things, but of evil tidings, which 
 often make things worse than really they are, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:7">Ps. cxii. 7</A>.
 
 Or,

 (2.) To show what imminent danger Jerusalem was in, when its enemies
 made so many bold advances towards it and its friends could not make 
 one bold stand to defend it. Note, The more daring the church's enemies 
 are, and the more dastardly those are that should appear for her, the 
 more will God be exalted in his own strength, when, notwithstanding 
 this, he works deliverance for her.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. How impotent his attempt upon Jerusalem shall be: <I>he shall remain 
 at Nob,</I> whence he may see Mount Zion, and there <I>he shall shake 
 his hand</I> against it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 He shall threaten it, and that shall be all; it shall be safe, and 
 shall set him at defiance. The daughter of Jerusalem, to be even with 
 him, shall <I>shake her head</I> at him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:22"><I>ch.</I> xxxvii. 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. How fatal it would prove, in the issue, to himself. When he 
 <I>shakes his hand at Jerusalem,</I> and is about to lay hands on it, 
 then is God's time to appear against him; for Zion is the place of 
 which God has said, <I>This is my rest for ever;</I> therefore those 
 who threaten it affront God himself. Then <I>the Lord shall lop the 
 bough with terror and cut down the thickets of the forest,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:33,34"><I>v.</I> 33, 34</A>.

 (1.) The pride of the enemy shall be humbled, the boughs that are
 lifted up on high shall be lopped off, the high and stately trees shall 
 be hewn down; that is, the haughty shall be humbled. Those that lift up 
 themselves in competition with God or opposition to him shall be 
 abased.

 (2.) The power of the enemy shall be broken: <I>The thickets of the
 forest he shall cut down.</I> When the Assyrian soldiers were under 
 their arms, and their spears erect, they looked like a forest, like 
 Lebanon; but, when in one night they all became as dead corpses, the 
 pikes were laid on the ground, and Lebanon was of a sudden cut down 
 <I>by a mighty one,</I> by the destroying angel, who in a little time 
 slew so many thousands of them: and, if this shall be the exit of that 
 proud invader, let not God's people be afraid of him. <I>Who art thou, 
 that thou shouldst be afraid of a man that shall die?</I></P>
