 In this chapter the prophet, in God's name, shows the people of God 
 their transgressions, even the house of Jacob their sins, and the 
 judgments which were likely to be brought upon them for their sins, 

 I. By a parable, under the similitude of an unfruitful vineyard,
 representing the great favours God had bestowed upon them, their 
 disappointing his expectations from them, and the ruin they had thereby 
 deserved, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 II. By an enumeration of the sins that did abound among them, with a
 threatening of punishments that should answer to the sins. 

 1. Covetousness, and greediness of worldly wealth, which shall be
 punished with famine, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:8-10">ver. 8-10</A>.

 2. Rioting, revelling, and drunkenness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:11,12,22,23">ver. 11, 12, 22, 23</A>),

 which shall be punished with captivity and all the miseries that attend
 it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:13-17">ver. 13-17</A>.

 3. Presumption in sin, and defying the justice of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:18,19">
 ver. 18, 19</A>.

 4. Confounding the distinctions between virtue and vice, and so
 undermining the principles of religion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:20">ver. 20</A>.

 5. Self-conceit, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:21">ver. 21</A>.

 6. Perverting justice, for which, and the other instances of reigning
 wickedness among them, a great and general desolation in threatened, 
 which should lay all waste 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:24,25">ver. 24, 25</A>),

 and which should be effected by a foreign invasion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:26-30">ver. 26-30</A>),
 
 referring perhaps to the havoc made not long after by Sennacherib's
 army.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved
 touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very
 fruitful hill:
 &nbsp; 2  And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and
 planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst
 of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked that it
 should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.
 &nbsp; 3  And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge,
 I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.
 &nbsp; 4  What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have
 not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring
 forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?
 &nbsp; 5  And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard:
 I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up;
 <I>and</I> break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:
 &nbsp; 6  And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged;
 but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command
 the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.
 &nbsp; 7  For the vineyard of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts <I>is</I> the house of
 Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked
 for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but
 behold a cry.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See what variety of methods the great God takes to awaken sinners to 
 repentance by convincing them of sin, and showing them their misery and 
 danger by reason of it. To this purport he speaks sometimes in plain 
 terms and sometimes in parables, sometimes in prose and sometimes in 
 verse, as here. "We have tried to <I>reason with you</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:18"><I>ch.</I> i. 18</A>);
 
 now let us put your case into a poem, inscribed to the honour of my
 well beloved." God the Father dictates it to the honour of Christ his 
 well beloved Son, whom he has constituted Lord of the vineyard. The 
 prophet sings it to the honour of Christ too, for he is his well 
 beloved. The Old-Testament prophets were friends of the bridegroom. 
 Christ is God's beloved Son and our beloved Saviour. Whatever is said 
 or sung of the church must be intended to his praise, even that which 
 (like this) tends to our shame. This parable was put into a song that 
 it might be the more moving and affecting, might be the more easily 
 learned and exactly remembered, and the better transmitted to 
 posterity; and it is an exposition of he song of Moses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:1-47">Deut. xxxii.</A>),

 showing that what he then foretold was now fulfilled. Jerome says,
 Christ the well-beloved did in effect sing this mournful song when he 
 beheld Jerusalem <I>and wept over it</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:41">Luke xix. 41</A>),

 and had reference to it in the parable of the vineyard

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:33">Matt. xxi. 33</A>,

 &c.), only here the fault was in the vines, there in the husbandmen. 
 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The great things which God had done for the Jewish church and 
 nation. When all the rest of the world lay in common, not cultivated by 
 divine revelation, that was his vineyard, they were his peculiar 
 people. He acknowledged them as his own, set them apart for himself. 
 The soil they were planted in was extraordinary; it was <I>a very 
 fruitful hill, the horn of the son of oil;</I> so it is in the margin. 
 There was plenty, a cornucopia; and there was dainty: they did there 
 eat the fat and drink the sweet, and so were furnished with abundance 
 of good things to honour God with in sacrifices and free-will 
 offerings. The advantages of our situation will be brought into the 
 account another day. Observe further what God did for this vineyard. 

 1. He fenced it, took it under his special protection, kept it night
 and day under his own eye, lest any should hurt it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:2,3"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 2, 3</A>.

 If they had not themselves thrown down their fence, no inroad could
 have been made upon them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+125:2,131:4">Ps. cxxv. 2; cxxxi. 4</A>.

 2. He gathered the stones out of it, that, as nothing from without 
 might damage it, so nothing within might obstruct its fruitfulness. He 
 proffered his grace to take away the stony heart. 

 3. He planted it with the choicest vine, set up a pure religion among 
 them, gave them a most excellent law, instituted ordinances very proper 
 for the keeping up of their acquaintance with God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:21">Jer. ii. 21</A>.

 4. He built a tower in the midst of it, either for defence against 
 violence or for the dressers of the vineyard to lodge in; or rather it 
 was for the owner of the vineyard to sit in, to take a view of the 
 vines 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+7:12">Cant. vii. 12</A>)--

 a summer-house. The temple was this tower, about which the priests
 lodged, and where God promised to meet his people, and gave them the 
 tokens of his presence among them and pleasure in them.

 5. He made a wine-press therein, set up his altar, to which the
 sacrifices, as the fruits of the vineyard, should be brought.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The disappointment of his just expectations from them: <I>He looked 
 that it should bring forth grapes,</I> and a great deal of reason he 
 had for that expectation. Note, God expects vineyard-fruit from those 
 that enjoy vineyard-privileges, not leaves only, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+11:12">Mark xi. 12</A>.

 A bare profession, though ever so green, will not serve: there must be
 more than buds and blossoms. Good purposes and good beginnings are good 
 things, but not enough; there must be fruit, a good heart and a good 
 life, vineyard fruit, thoughts and affections, words and actions, 
 agreeable to the Spirit, which is the fatness of the vineyard

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:22,23">Gal. v. 22, 23</A>),

 <I>answerable to the ordinances,</I> which are the dressings of the
 vineyard, acceptable to God, the Lord of the vineyard, and fruit 
 according to the season. Such fruit as this God expects from us, 
 grapes, the fruit of the vine, with which they honour God and man

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:13">Judg. ix. 13</A>);

 and his expectations are neither high nor hard, but righteous and very
 reasonable. Yet see how his expectations are frustrated: <I>It brought 
 forth wild grapes;</I> not only no fruit at all, but bad fruit, worse 
 than none, grapes of Sodom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:32">Deut. xxxii. 32</A>.

 1. Wild grapes are the fruits of the corrupt nature, fruit according to
 the crabstock, not according to the engrafted branch, from the root of
 bitterness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:15">Heb. xii. 15</A>.
 
 Where grace does not work corruption will.

 2. Wild grapes are hypocritical performances in religion, that look
 like grapes, but are sour or bitter, and are so far from being pleasing 
 to God that they are provoking, as theirs mentioned in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:11"><I>ch.</I> i. 11</A>.

 Counterfeit graces are wild grapes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. An appeal to themselves whether upon the whole matter God must not 
 be justified and they condemned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 And now the case is plainly stated: <I>O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and 
 men of Judah! judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.</I> This 
 implies that God was blamed about them. There was a controversy between 
 them and him; but the equity was so plain on his side that he could 
 venture to put the decision of the controversy to their own 
 consciences. "Let any inhabitant of Jerusalem, any man of Judah, that 
 has but the use of his reason and a common sense of equity and justice, 
 speak his mind impartially in this matter." Here is a challenge to any 
 man to show,

 1. Any instance wherein God had been wanting to them: <I>What could
 have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?</I> He 
 speaks of the external means of fruitfulness, and such as might be 
 expected from the dresser of a vineyard, from whom it is not required 
 that he should change the nature of the vine. <I>What ought to have 
 been done more?</I> so it may be read. They had everything requisite 
 for instruction and direction in their duty, for quickening them to it 
 and putting them in mind of it. No inducements were wanting to persuade 
 them to it, but all arguments were used that were proper to work either 
 upon hope or fear; and they had all the opportunities they could desire 
 for the performance of their duty, the new moons, and the sabbaths, and 
 solemn feasts; They had the scriptures, the lively oracles, a standing 
 ministry in the priests and Levites, besides what was extraordinary in 
 the prophets. No nation had statutes and judgments so righteous. 

 2. Nor could any tolerable excuse be offered for their walking thus 
 contrary to God. "Wherefore, what reason can be given why it should 
 bring forth wild grapes, when I looked for grapes?" Note, The 
 wickedness of those that profess religion, and enjoy the means of 
 grace, is the most unreasonable unaccountable thing in the world, and 
 the whole blame of it must lie upon the sinners themselves. "<I>If thou 
 scornest, thou alone shalt bear it,</I> and shalt not have a word to 
 say for thyself in the judgment of the great day." God will prove his 
 own ways equal and the sinner's ways unequal.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Their doom read, and a righteous sentence passed upon them for 
 their bad conduct towards God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>):

 "<I>And now go to,</I> since nothing can be offered in excuse of the
 crime or arrest of the judgement, <I>I will tell you what I am now 
 determined to do to my vineyard.</I> I will be vexed and troubled with 
 it no more; since it will be good for nothing, it <I>shall</I> be good 
 for nothing; in short, it shall cease to be a vineyard, and be turned 
 into a wilderness: the church of the Jews shall be unchurched; their 
 charter shall be taken away, and they shall become <I>lo-ammi--not my 
 people.</I>"

 1. "They shall no longer be distinguished as a peculiar people, but be 
 laid in common: <I>I will take away the hedge thereof,</I> and then it 
 will soon be eaten up and become as bare as other ground." They mingled 
 with the nations and therefore were justly scattered among them. 

 2. "They shall no longer be protected as God's people, but left
 exposed. God will not only suffer the wall to go to decay, but he will
 break it down, will remove all their defences from them, and then they 
 will become an easy prey to their enemies, who have long waited for an 
 opportunity to do them a mischief, and will now tread them down and 
 trample upon them." 

 3. "They shall no longer have the face of a vineyard, and the form and
 shape of a church and commonwealth, but shall be levelled and laid 
 waste." This was fulfilled when <I>Jerusalem for their sakes was 
 ploughed as a field,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+3:12">Mic. iii. 12</A>.

 4. "No more pains shall be taken with them by magistrates or ministers, 
 the dressers and keepers of their vineyard; it shall not be pruned nor 
 digged, but every thing shall run wild, and nothing shall come up but 
 briers and thorns, the products of sin and the curse," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:18">Gen. iii. 18</A>.

 When errors and corruptions, vice and immorality, go without check or
 control, no testimony borne against them, no rebuke given them or 
 restraint put upon them, the vineyard is unpruned, is not dressed, or 
 ridded; and then it will soon be like the vineyard of the man void of 
 understanding, all grown over with thorns.

 5. "That which completes its woe is that the dews of heaven shall be
 withheld; he that has the key of the clouds will command them that they 
 rain no rain upon it, and that alone is sufficient to run it into a 
 desert." Note, God in a way of righteous judgment, denies his grace to 
 those that have long received it in vain. The sum of all is that those 
 who would not bring forth good fruit should bring forth none. The curse 
 of barrenness is the punishment of the sin of barrenness, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+11:14">Mark xi. 14</A>.
 
 This had its partial accomplishment in the destruction of Jerusalem by
 the Chaldeans, its full accomplishment in the final rejection of the 
 Jews, and has its frequent accomplishment in the departure of God's 
 Spirit from those persons who have long resisted him and striven 
 against him, and the removal of his gospel from those places that have 
 been long a reproach to it, while it has been an honour to them. It is 
 no loss to God to lay his vineyard waste; for he can, when he please, 
 turn a wilderness into a fruitful field; and when he does thus 
 dismantle a vineyard, it is but as he did by the garden of Eden, which, 
 when man had by sin forfeited his place in it, was soon levelled with 
 common soil.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The explanation of this parable, or a key to it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 where we are told,

 1. What is meant by the vineyard (it is <I>the house of Israel,</I> the 
 body of the people, incorporated in one church and commonwealth), and 
 what by the vines, the pleasant plants, the plants of God's pleasure, 
 which he had been pleased in and delighted in doing good to; they are 
 <I>the men of Judah;</I> these he had dealt graciously with, and from 
 them he expected suitable returns. 

 2. What is meant by the grapes that were expected and the wild grapes 
 that were produces: <I>He looked for judgment and righteousness,</I> 
 that the people should be honest in all their dealings and the 
 magistrates should strictly administer justice. This might reasonably
 be expected among a people that had such excellent laws and rules of 
 justice given them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:8">Deut. iv. 8</A>);

 but the fact was quite otherwise; instead of judgment there was the
 cruelty of the oppressors, and instead of righteousness the cry of the 
 oppressed. Every thing was carried by clamour and noise, and not by
 equity and according to the merits of the cause. It is sad with a 
 people when wickedness has usurped the place of judgment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:16">Eccl. iii. 16</A>.
 
 It is very sad with a soul when instead of the grapes of humility,
 meekness, patience, love, and contempt of the world, which God looks 
 for, there are the wild grapes of pride, passion, discontent, malice, 
 and contempt of God--instead of the grapes of praying and praising, the 
 wild grapes of cursing and swearing, which are a great offence to God.
 Some of the ancients apply this to the Jews in Christ's time, among 
 whom God looked for righteousness (that is, that they should receive 
 and embrace Christ), but behold a cry, that cry, <I>Crucify him, 
 crucify him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The world and the flesh are the two great enemies that we are in danger 
 of being overpowered by; yet we are in no danger if we do not ourselves 
 yield to them. Eagerness of the world, and indulgence of the flesh, are 
 the two sins against which the prophet, in God's name, here denounces 
 woes. These were sins which then abounded among the men of Judah, some 
 of the wild grapes they brought forth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 and for which God threatens to bring ruin upon them. They are sins
 which we have all need to stand upon our guard against and dread the 
 consequences of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is a woe to those who set their hearts upon the wealth of the 
 world, and place their happiness in that, and increase it to themselves 
 by indirect and unlawful means 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 who <I>join house to house and lay field to field, till there be no
 place,</I> no room for anybody to live by them. If they could succeed, 
 they would be placed alone in the midst of the earth, would monopolize 
 possessions and preferments, and engross all profits and employments to 
 themselves. Not that it is a sin for those who have a house and a 
 field, of they have wherewithal, to purchase another; but</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Their fault is, 

 (1.) That they are inordinate in their desires to enrich themselves, 
 and make it their whole care and business to raise an estate, as if 
 they had nothing to mind, nothing to seek, nothing to do, in this 
 world, but that. They never know when they have enough, but the more 
 they have the more they would have; and, like the <I>daughters of the 
 horseleech,</I> they <I>cry, Give, give.</I> They cannot enjoy what 
 they have, nor do good with it, but are constantly contriving and 
 studying to make it more. They must have variety of houses, a 
 winter-house, and a summer-house, and if another man's house or field 
 lie convenient to theirs, as Naboth's vineyard to Ahab's, they must 
 have that too, or they cannot be easy. 

 (2.) That they are herein careless of others, nay, and injurious to 
 them. They would live so as to let nobody live but themselves. So that 
 their insatiable covetings may be gratified, they care not what becomes 
 of all about them, what encroachments they make upon their neighbours' 
 rights, what hardships they put upon those that they have power over or 
 advantage against, nor what base and wicked arts they use to heap up 
 treasure to themselves. They would swell so big as to fill all space,
 and yet are still unsatisfied 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:10">Eccl. v. 10</A>),

 as Alexander, who, when he fancied he had conquered the world, wept
 because he had not another world to conquer. <I>Deficiente
 terr&acirc;, non impletur avaritia--If the whole earth were 
 monopolized, avarice would thirst for more.</I> What! <I>will you be 
 placed alone in the midst of the earth?</I> (so some read it); will you 
 be so foolish as to desire it, when we have so much need of the service 
 of others and so much comfort in their society? Will you be so foolish 
 as to expect that the <I>earth shall be forsaken for us</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:4">Job xviii. 4</A>),

 when it is by multitudes that the earth is to be replenished? <I>An
 propter vos solos tanta terra creata est?--Was the wide world created 
 merely for you?</I> Lyra.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That which is threatened as the punishment of this sin is that 
 neither the houses nor the fields they were thus greedy of should turn 
 to any account, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 God whispered it to the prophet in his ear, as he speaks in a like case

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:14"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 14</A>):

 <I>It was revealed in my ears by the Lord of hosts</I> (as God told
 Samuel a thing <I>in his ear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:15">1 Sam. ix. 15</A>);

 he thought he heard it still sounding in his ears; but he proclaimed
 it, as he ought, <I>upon the house-tops,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:27">Matt. x. 27</A>.

 (1.) That the houses they were so fond of should be untenanted, should 
 stand long empty, and should yield them no rent, and go out of repair: 
 <I>Many houses shall be desolate,</I> the people that should dwell in 
 them, being cut off by sword, famine, or pestilence, or carried into 
 captivity; or trade being dead, and poverty coming upon the country 
 like an armed man, those that had been housekeepers were forced to 
 become lodgers, or shift for themselves elsewhere. Even great and fair 
 houses, that would invite tenants, and (there being a scarcity of 
 tenants) might be taken at low rates, shall stand empty without 
 inhabitants. God created not the earth in vain; he <I>formed it to be 
 inhabited,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:18"><I>ch.</I> xlv. 18</A>.

 But men's projects are often frustrated, and what they frame answers
 not the intention. We have a saying, That fools build houses for wise 
 men to live in; but sometimes, as the event proves, they are built for 
 no man to live in. God has many ways to empty the most populous cities. 
 
 (2.) That the fields they were so fond of should be unfruitful 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):
 
 <I>Ten acres of vineyard shall yield</I> only such a quantity of grapes
 as will make but <I>one bath</I> of wine (which was about eight 
 gallons), <I>and the seed of a homer,</I> a bushel's sowing of ground, 
 shall yield but an ephah, which was the tenth part of a homer; so that 
 through the barrenness of the ground, or the unreasonableness of the 
 weather, they should not have more than a tenth part of their seed 
 again. Note, Those that set their hearts upon the world will justly be 
 disappointed in their expectations from it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is a woe to those that dote upon the pleasures and delights of 
 sense, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 Sensuality ruins men as certainly as worldliness and oppression. As
 Christ pronounces a woe against those that are rich, so also against 
 those that laugh now and are full

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:24,25">Luke vi. 24, 25</A>),

 and fare sumptuously, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:19">Luke xvi. 19</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Who the sinners are against whom this woe is denounced. 

 (1.) They are such as are given to drink; they make their drinking 
 their business, have their hearts upon it, and overcharge themselves 
 with it. They rise early to follow strong drink, as husbandmen and
 tradesmen do to follow their employments; as if they were afraid of 
 losing time from that which is the greatest misspending of time. 
 Whereas commonly those that are drunken are drunken in the night, when 
 they have despatched the business of the day, these neglect business, 
 abandon it, and give up themselves to the service of the flesh; for 
 they sit at their cups all day, <I>and continue till night, till wine 
 inflame them</I>--inflame their lusts (chambering and wantonness follow 
 upon rioting and drunkenness)--inflame their passions; for who but such 
 have <I>contentions and wounds without cause?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:29-35">Prov. xxiii. 29-35</A>.

 They make a perfect trade of drinking; nor do they seek the shelter of
 the night for this work of darkness, as men ashamed of it, but <I>count 
 it a pleasure to riot in the day-time.</I> See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:13">2 Pet. ii. 13</A>.

 (2.) They are such as are given to mirth. They have their feasts, and 
 they are so merrily disposed that they cannot dine or sup without 
 music, musical instruments of all sorts, like David 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:5">Amos vi. 5</A>),

 like Solomon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:8">Eccl. ii. 8</A>);

 <I>the harp and the viol, the tabret and pipe,</I> must accompany the
 wine, that every sense may be gratified to a nicety; they <I>take the 
 timbrel and harp,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:12">Job xxi. 12</A>.

 The use of music is lawful in itself; but when it is excessive, when we
 set our hearts upon it, misspend time in it, so that it crowds our 
 spiritual and divine pleasures and draws away the heart from God, then 
 it turns into sin for us.

 (3.) They are such as never give their mind to any thing that is 
 serious: <I>They regard not the work of the Lord;</I> they observe not 
 his power, wisdom, and goodness, in those creatures which they abuse 
 and subject to vanity, nor the bounty of his providence in giving them 
 those good things which they make the food and fuel of their lusts.
 God's judgments have already seized them, and they are under the tokens 
 of his displeasure, but they regard not; they consider not the hand of 
 God in all these things; his hand is lifted up, but they will not see, 
 because they will not disturb themselves in their pleasures nor think 
 what God is doing with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What the judgments are which are denounced against them, and in part 
 executed. It is here foretold, 

 (1.) that they should be dislodged; the land should spue out these 
 drunkards 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>My people</I> (so they call themselves, and were proud of it) have
 therefore <I>gone into captivity,</I> are as sure to go as if they were 
 gone already, <I>because they have no knowledge;</I> how should they 
 have knowledge when by their excessive drinking they make sots and 
 fools of themselves? They set up for wits; but because they regard not 
 God's controversy with them, nor take any care to make their peace with 
 him, they may truly be said to have no knowledge; and the reason is 
 because they will have none; they are inconsiderate and wilful, and are 
 therefore destroyed for lack of knowledge.

 (2.) That they should be impoverished, and come to want that which they 
 had wasted and abused to excess: Even <I>their glory are men of 
 famine,</I> subject to it and slain by it; and <I>their multitude are 
 dried up with thirst.</I> Both the great men and the common people are 
 ready to perish for want of bread and water. This is the effect of the 
 failure of the corn 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 for <I>the king himself is served of the field,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:9">Eccl. v. 9</A>.

 And when the vintage fails the drunkards are called upon to weep,
 because <I>the new wine is cut off from their mouth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:5">Joel i. 5</A>),

 and not so much because now they want it as because when they had it
 they abused it. It is just with God to make men want that for necessity 
 which they have abused to excess.

 (3.) What multitudes should be cut off by famine and sword 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):
 
 <I>Therefore hell has enlarged herself.</I> Tophet, the common
 burying-place, proves too little; so many are there to be buried that 
 they shall be forced to enlarge it. The grave has opened her mouth
 without measure, <I>never saying, It is enough,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:15,16">Prov. xxx. 15, 16</A>.

 It may be understood of the place of the damned; luxury and sensuality
 fill these regions of darkness and horror; there those are tormented 
 who made a god of their belly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:25,Php+3:19">Luke xvi. 25; Phil. iii. 19</A>.

 (4.) That they should be humbled and abased, and all their honours laid 
 in the dust. This will be done effectually by death and the grave:
 <I>Their glory shall descend,</I> not only to the earth, but into it; 
 it shall not <I>descend after them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:17">Ps. xlix. 17</A>),

 to stand them in any stead on the other side death, but it shall die
 and be buried with them--poor glory, which will thus wither! Did they 
 glory in their numbers? Their multitude shall go down to the pit, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:18,32:32">Ezek. xxxi. 18; xxxii. 32</A>.

 Did they glory in the figure they made? Their pomp shall be at an end;
 their shouts with which they triumphed, and were attended. Did they 
 glory in their mirth? Death will turn it into mourning; he that 
 rejoices and revels, and never knows what it is to be serious, shall go 
 thither where there are weeping and wailing. Thus the mean man and the 
 mighty man meet together in the grave and under mortifying judgments.
 Let a man be ever so high, death will bring him low--ever so mean, 
 death will bring him lower, in the prospect of which the eyes of the 
 lofty should now be humbled, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 It becomes those to look low that must shortly be laid low.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What the fruit of these judgments shall be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) God shall be glorified, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 He that is the Lord of hosts, and the holy God, shall be exalted and
 sanctified in the judgment and righteousness of these dispensations. 
 His justice must be owned in bringing those low what exalted 
 themselves; and herein he is glorified,

 [1.] As a God is irresistible power. He will herein be exalted as the
 Lord of hosts, that is able to break the strongest, humble the 
 proudest, and tame the most unruly. Power is not exalted but in 
 judgment. It is the honour of God that, though he has a mighty arm, yet 
 <I>judgment and justice are</I> always <I>the habitation of his
 throne,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:13,14">Ps. lxxxix. 13, 14</A>.

 [2.] As a God of unspotted purity. He that is holy, infinitely holy, 
 shall be sanctified (that is, shall be owned and declared to be holy) 
 in the righteous punishment of proud men. Note, When proud men are
 humbled the great God is honoured, and ought to be honoured by us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Good people shall be relieved and succoured 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>Then shall the lambs feed after their manner;</I> the meek ones of
 the earth, who followed the Lamb, who were persecuted, and put into 
 fear by those proud oppressors, shall feed quietly, feed in the green 
 pastures, and there shall be none to make them afraid. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:14">Ezek. xxxiv. 14</A>.
 
 When the enemies of the church are cut off then have the churches rest.
 <I>They shall feed at their pleasure;</I> so some read it. <I>Blessed 
 are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth,</I> and delight 
 themselves in abundant peace. <I>They shall feed according to their 
 order or capacity</I> (so others read it), as they are able to hear the 
 word, that bread of life.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The country shall be laid waste, and become a prey to the 
 neighbours: <I>The waste places of the fats ones,</I> the possessions 
 of those rich men that lived at their ease, shall be eaten by strangers 
 that were nothing akin to them. In the captivity the poor of the land 
 were left for <I>vine-dressers and husbandmen</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+25:12">2 Kings xxv. 12</A>);

 these were the lambs that fed in the pastures of the fats ones, which
 were laid in common for strangers to eat. When the church of the Jews, 
 those fat ones, was laid waste, their privileges were transferred to 
 the Gentiles, who had been long strangers, and the lambs of Christ's 
 flock were welcome to them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and
 sin as it were with a cart rope:
 &nbsp; 19  That say, Let him make speed, <I>and</I> hasten his work, that we
 may see <I>it:</I> and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw
 nigh and come, that we may know <I>it!</I>
 &nbsp; 20  Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put
 darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for
 sweet, and sweet for bitter!
 &nbsp; 21  Woe unto <I>them that are</I> wise in their own eyes, and prudent
 in their own sight!
 &nbsp; 22  Woe unto <I>them that are</I> mighty to drink wine, and men of
 strength to mingle strong drink:
 &nbsp; 23  Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the
 righteousness of the righteous from him!
 &nbsp; 24  Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame
 consumeth the chaff, <I>so</I> their root shall be as rottenness, and
 their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away
 the law of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy
 One of Israel.
 &nbsp; 25  Therefore is the anger of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> kindled against his
 people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and
 hath smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcases
 <I>were</I> torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger
 is not turned away, but his hand <I>is</I> stretched out still.
 &nbsp; 26  And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and
 will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they
 shall come with speed swiftly:
 &nbsp; 27  None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall
 slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be
 loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:
 &nbsp; 28  Whose arrows <I>are</I> sharp, and all their bows bent, their
 horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like
 a whirlwind:
 &nbsp; 29  Their roaring <I>shall be</I> like a lion, they shall roar like
 young lions: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and
 shall carry <I>it</I> away safe, and none shall deliver <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 30  And in that day they shall roar against them like the
 roaring of the sea: and if <I>one</I> look unto the land, behold
 darkness <I>and</I> sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens
 thereof.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here are, 

 I. Sins described which will bring judgments upon a people: and this 
 perhaps is not only a charge drawn up against the men of Judah who 
 lived at that time, and the particular articles of that charge, though 
 it may relate primarily to them, but is rather intended for warning to 
 all people, in all ages, to take heed of these sins, as destructive 
 both to particular persons and to communities, and exposing men to 
 God's wrath and his righteous judgments. Those are here said to be in a 
 woeful condition,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Who are eagerly set upon sin, and violent in their sinful pursuits 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 who <I>draw iniquity with cords of vanity,</I> who take as much pains
 to sin as the cattle do that draw a team, who put themselves to the 
 stretch for the gratifying of their inordinate appetites, and, to 
 humour a base lust, offer violence to nature itself. They think 
 themselves as sure of compassing their wicked project as if they were 
 pulling it towards them with strong cart-ropes; but they will find 
 themselves disappointed, for they will prove cords of vanity, which 
 will break when they come to any stress. For <I>the righteous Lord will 
 cut in sunder the cords of the wicked,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+129:4,Job+4:8.Pr+22:8">Ps. cxxix. 4; Job iv. 8; Prov. xxii. 8</A>.

 They are by long custom and confirmed habits so hardened in sin that
 they cannot get clear of it. Those that sin through infirmity are
 drawn away by sin; those that sin presumptuously draw iniquity to them, 
 in spite of the oppositions of Providence and the checks of conscience.
 Some by sin understand the punishment of sin: they pull God's judgments 
 upon their own heads as it were, with cart-ropes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Who set the justice of God at defiance, and challenge the Almighty 
 to do his worst 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>They say, Let him make speed, and hasten his work;</I> this is the
 same language with that of the scoffers of the last days, who say, 
 <I>Where is the promise of his coming?</I> and therefore it is that, 
 like them, they <I>draw iniquity with cords of vanity,</I> are violent 
 and daring in sin, and walk after their own lusts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:3,4">2 Pet. iii. 3, 4</A>.

 (1.) They ridicule the prophets, and banter them. It is in scorn that
 they call God <I>the Holy One of Israel,</I> because the prophets used 
 with great veneration to call him so. 

 (2.) They will not believe the revelation of God's wrath from heaven 
 against their ungodliness and unrighteousness; unless they see it 
 executed, they will not know it, as if the curse were <I>brutum 
 fulmen--a mere flash,</I> and all the threatenings of the word bugbears 
 to frighten fools and children. 

 (3.) If God should appear against them, as he has threatened, yet they 
 think themselves able to make their part good with him, and provoke him 
 to jealousy, as if they were stronger than he, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:22">1 Cor. x. 22</A>.

 "We have heard his word, but it is all talk; let him hasten his work,
 we shall shift for ourselves well enough." Note, Those that wilfully 
 persist in sin consider not the power of God's anger.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Who confound and overthrow the distinctions between moral good and 
 evil, <I>who call evil good and moral evil</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 who not only live in the omission of that which is good, but condemn
 it, argue against it, and, because they will not practise it 
 themselves, run it down in others, and fasten invidious epithets upon 
 it--not only do that which is evil, but justify it, and applaud it, and 
 recommend it to others as safe and good. Note,

 (1.) Virtue and piety are good, for they are light and sweet, they are 
 pleasant and right; but sin and wickedness are evil; they are darkness, 
 all the fruit of ignorance and mistake, and will be bitterness in the 
 latter end. 

 (2.) Those do a great deal of wrong to God, and religion, and 
 conscience, to their own souls, and to the souls of others, who 
 misrepresent these, and put false colours upon them--who call 
 drunkenness good fellowship, and covetousness good husbandry, and, when 
 they persecute the people of God, think they do him good service--and, 
 on the other hand, who call seriousness ill-nature, and sober 
 singularity ill-breeding, who say all manner of evil falsely concerning 
 the ways of godliness, and do what they can to form in men's minds 
 prejudices against them, and this in defiance of evidence as plain and 
 convincing as that of sense, by which we distinguish, beyond 
 contradiction, between light and darkness, and between that which to 
 the taste is sweet and that which is bitter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Who though they are guilty of such gross mistakes as these have a 
 great opinion of their own judgments, and value themselves mightily 
 upon their understanding 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 They are <I>wise in their own eyes;</I> they think themselves able to
 disprove and baffle the reproofs and convictions of God's word, and to 
 evade and elude both the searches and the reaches of his judgments; 
 they think they can outwit Infinite Wisdom and countermine Providence 
 itself. Or it may be taken more generally: God resists the proud, those 
 particularly who are conceited of their own wisdom and lean to their 
 own understanding; such must become fools, that they may be truly wise, 
 or else, at their end they shall appear to be fools before all the 
 world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Who glory in it as a great accomplishment that they are able to bear 
 a great deal of strong liquor without being overcome by it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),
 
 <I>who are mighty to drink wine,</I> and use their strength and vigour,
 not in the service of their country, but in the service of their lusts. 
 Let drunkards know from this scripture that, 

 (1.) They ungratefully abuse their bodily strength, which God has given 
 them for good purposes, and by degrees cannot but weaken it. 

 (2.) It will not excuse them from the guilt of drunkenness that they 
 can drink hard and yet keep their feet. 

 (3.) Those who boast of their drinking down others glory in their 
 shame. 
 
 (4.) How light soever men make of their drunkenness, it is a sin
 which will certainly lay them open to the wrath and curse of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. Who, as judges, pervert justice, and go counter to all rules of 
 equity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 This follows upon the former; they <I>drink and forget the law</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:5">Prov. xxxi. 5</A>),
 
 and <I>err through wine</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:7"><I>ch.</I> xxviii. 7</A>),

 and take bribes, that they may have wherewithal to maintain their
 luxury. They <I>justify the wicked for reward,</I> and find some
 pretence or other to clear him from his guilt and shelter him from 
 punishment; and they condemn the innocent, and <I>take away their 
 righteousness from them,</I> that is, overrule their pleas, deprive 
 them of the means of clearing up their innocency, and give judgment 
 against them. In causes between man and man, might and money would at 
 any time prevail against right and justice; and he who was ever so 
 plainly in the wrong would with a small bribe carry the cause and 
 recover the costs. In criminal causes, though the prisoner ever so 
 plainly appeared to be guilty, yet for a reward they would acquit him; 
 if he were innocent, yet if he did not fee them well, nay, if they were 
 feed by the malicious prosecutor, or if they themselves had spleen 
 against him, they would condemn him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The judgments described, which these sins would bring upon them. 
 Let not those expect to live easily who live thus wickedly; for the 
 righteous God will take vengeance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:24-30"><I>v.</I> 24-30</A>.
 
 Here we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How complete this ruin will be, and how necessarily and unavoidably 
 it will follow upon their sins. He had compared this people to a vine 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 well fixed, and which, it was hoped, would be flourishing and fruitful;
 but the grace of God towards it was received in vain, and then the root 
 became rottenness, being dried up from beneath, and the blossom would 
 of course blow off as dust, as a light and worthless thing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:16">Job xviii. 16</A>.
 
 Sin weakens the strength, the root, of a people, so that they are
 easily rooted up; it defaces the beauty, the blossoms, of a people, and 
 takes away the hopes of fruit. The sin of unfruitfulness is punished 
 with the plague of unfruitfulness. Sinners make themselves as stubble 
 and chaff, combustible matter, proper fuel to the fire of God's wrath, 
 which then of course devours and consumes them, <I>as the fire devours 
 the stubble,</I> and nobody can hinder it, or cares to hinder it. Chaff 
 is consumed, unhelped and unpitied.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How just the ruin will be: <I>Because they have cast away the law of 
 the Lord of hosts,</I> and would not have him to reign over them; and, 
 as the law of Moses was rejected and thrown off, so <I>the word of the 
 Holy One of Israel</I> by his servants the prophets, putting them in 
 mind of his law and calling them to obedience, was despised and 
 disregarded. God does not reject men for every transgression of his law 
 and word; but, when his word is despised and his law cast away, what 
 can they expect but that God should utterly abandon them?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Whence this ruin should come 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 it is destruction from the Almighty.

 (1.) The justice of God appoints it; for that is <I>the anger of the 
 Lord</I> which is <I>kindled against his people,</I> his necessary 
 vindication of the honour of his holiness and authority. 

 (2.) The power of God effects it: <I>He has stretched forth his hand 
 against them.</I> That hand which had many a time been stretched out 
 for them against their enemies is now stretched out against them at 
 full length and in its full vigour; and <I>who knows the power of his 
 anger?</I> Whether they are sensible of it or no, it is God that has 
 smitten them, has blasted their vine and made it wither.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The consequences and continuance of this ruin. When God comes forth 
 in wrath against a people the hills tremble, fear seizes even their 
 great men, who are strong and high, the earth shakes under men and is 
 ready to sink; and as this feels dreadful (what does more so than an 
 earthquake?) so what sight can be more frightful than the carcases of 
 men torn with dogs, or thrown <I>as dung</I> (so the margin reads it) 
 <I>in the midst of the streets?</I> This intimates that great 
 multitudes should be slain, not only soldiers in the field of battle, 
 but the inhabitants of their cities put to the sword in cold blood, and 
 that the survivors should neither have hands nor hearts to bury them. 
 This is very dreadful, and yet such is the merit of sin that, <I>for 
 all this, God's anger is not turned away;</I> that fire will burn as 
 long as there remains any of the stubble and chaff to be fuel for it; 
 <I>and his hand,</I> which he stretched forth against his people to 
 smite them, because they do not by prayer take hold of it, nor by 
 reformation submit themselves to it, <I>is stretched out still.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The instruments that should be employed in bringing this ruin upon 
 them: it should be done by the incursions of a foreign enemy, that 
 should lay all waste. No particular enemy is named, and therefore we 
 are to take it as a prediction of all the several judgments of this 
 kind which God brought upon the Jews, Sennacherib's invasion soon 
 after, and the destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans first and at 
 last by the Romans; and I think it is to be looked upon also as a 
 threatening of the like desolation of those countries which harbour and 
 countenance those sins mentioned in the foregoing verses; it is an 
 exposition of those woes. When God designs the ruin of a provoking 
 people,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He can send a great way off for instruments to be employed in 
 effecting it; he can raise forces from afar, and summon them from the 
 end of the earth to attend his service, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Those who know him not are made use of to fulfil his counsel, when, by
 reason of their distance, they can scarcely be supposed to have any 
 ends of their own to serve. If God set up his standard, he can incline 
 men's hearts to enlist themselves under it, though perhaps they know 
 not why or wherefore. When the Lord of hosts is pleased to make a 
 general muster of the forces he has at his command, he has a great army 
 in an instant,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:2,11">Joel ii. 2, 11</A>.

 He needs not sound a trumpet, nor beat a drum, to give them notice or
 to animate them; no, he does but hiss to them, or rather whistle to 
 them, and that is enough; they hear that, and that puts courage into 
 them. Note, God has all the creatures at his beck.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He can make them come into the service with incredible expedition: 
 <I>Behold, they shall come with speed swiftly.</I> Note, 

 [1.] Those who will do God's work must not loiter, must not linger, nor 
 shall they when his time has come. 

 [2.] Those who defy God's judgments will be ashamed of their insolence 
 when it is too late; they said scornfully 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 <I>Let him make speed, let him hasten his work,</I> and they shall
 find, to their terror and confusion, that he will; <I>in one hour has 
 the judgment come.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He can carry them on in the service with amazing forwardness and 
 fury. This is described here in very elegant and lofty expressions, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:27-30"><I>v.</I> 27-30</A>.

 [1.] Though their marches be very long, yet <I>none among them shall be 
 weary;</I> so desirous they be to engage that they shall forget their 
 weariness, and make no complaints of it. 

 [2.] Though the way be rough, and perhaps embarrassed by the usual 
 policies of war, yet none among them shall <I>stumble,</I> but all the 
 difficulties in their way shall easily be got over. 

 [3.] Though they be forced to keep constant watch, yet <I>none shall 
 slumber nor sleep,</I> so intent shall they be upon their work, in 
 prospect of having the plunder of the city for their pains. 

 [4.] They shall not desire any rest of relaxation; they shall not put 
 off their clothes, nor <I>loose the girdle of their loins,</I> but 
 shall always have their belts on and swords by their sides. 

 [5.] They shall not meet with the least hindrance to retard their march 
 or oblige them to halt; not a <I>latchet of their shoes shall be 
 broken</I> which they must stay to mend, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:13">Josh. ix. 13</A>.

 [6.] Their arms and ammunition shall all be fixed, and in good posture; 
 <I>their arrows sharp,</I> to wound deep, <I>and all their bows 
 bent,</I> none unstrung, for they expect to be soon in action. 

 [7.] Their horses and chariots of war shall all be fit for service; 
 their horses so strong, so hardy, that <I>their hoofs shall be like 
 flint,</I> far from being beaten, or made tender, by their long march; 
 and the wheels of their chariots not broken, or battered, or out of 
 repair, but swift <I>like a whirlwind,</I> turning round so strongly 
 upon their axle-trees. 

 [8.] All the soldiers shall be bold and daring 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 <I>Their roaring,</I> or shouting, before a battle, <I>shall be like a
 lion,</I> who with his roaring animates himself, and terrifies all 
 about him. Those who would not hear the voice of God speaking to them
 by his prophets, but stopped their ears against their charms, shall be 
 made to hear the voice of their enemies roaring against them and shall 
 not be able to turn a deaf ear to it. <I>They shall roar like the
 roaring of the sea</I> in a storm; it roars and threatens to swallow 
 up, as the lion roars and threatens to tear in pieces.

 [9.] There shall not be the least prospect of relief or succour. The 
 enemy shall come in like a flood, and there shall be none to lift up a 
 standard against him. He shall seize the prey, and none shall deliver 
 it, none shall be able to deliver it, nay, none shall so much as dare 
 to attempt the deliverance of it, but shall give it up for lost. Let 
 the distressed look which way they will, every thing appears dismal; 
 for, if God frowns upon us, how can any creature smile? <I>First,</I>
 Look round to the earth, to the land, to that land that used to be the 
 land of light and the joy of the whole earth, and <I>behold darkness 
 and sorrow,</I> all frightful, all mournful, nothing hopeful. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> Look up to heaven, and there the light is darkened, 
 where one would expect to have found it. If the light is darkened in
 the heavens, how great is that darkness! If God hide his face, no 
 marvel the heavens hide theirs and appear gloomy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:29">Job xxxiv. 29</A>.

 It is our wisdom, by keeping a good conscience, to keep all clear
 between us and heaven, that we may have light from above even when 
 clouds and darkness are round about us.</P>
