 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have done with Mount Seir, and left it desolate, and likely to 
 continue so, and must now turn ourselves, with the prophet, to the 
 mountains of Israel, which we find desolate too, but hope before we 
 have done with the chapter to leave in better plight. Here are two 
 distinct prophecies in this chapter:--

 I. Here is one that seems chiefly to relate to the temporal estate of
 the Jews, wherein their present deplorable condition is described and 
 the triumphs of their neighbours in it; but it is promised that their 
 grievances shall be all redressed and that in due time they shall be 
 settled again in their own land, in the midst of peace and plenty, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:1-15">ver. 1-15</A>.

 II. Here is another that seems chiefly to concern their spiritual
 estate, wherein they are reminded of their former sins and God's
 judgments upon them, to humble them for their sins and under God's
 mighty hand, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:16-20">ver. 16-20</A>.
 
 But it is promised, 

 1. That God would glorify himself in showing mercy to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:21-24">ver. 21-24</A>.
 
 2. That he would sanctify them, by giving them his grace and fitting 
 them for his service; and this for his own name's sake and in answer to 
 their prayers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:25-38">ver. 25-38</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Also, thou son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel,
 and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 &nbsp; 2  Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Because the enemy hath said against
 you, Aha, even the ancient high places are ours in possession:
 &nbsp; 3  Therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Because
 they have made <I>you</I> desolate, and swallowed you up on every
 side, that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the
 heathen, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers, and <I>are</I> an
 infamy of the people:
 &nbsp; 4  Therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord
 G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> to the mountains, and to the hills,
 to the rivers, and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes, and to
 the cities that are forsaken, which became a prey and derision to
 the residue of the heathen that <I>are</I> round about;
 &nbsp; 5  Therefore thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Surely in the fire of my
 jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and
 against all Idumea, which have appointed my land into their
 possession with the joy of all <I>their</I> heart, with despiteful
 minds, to cast it out for a prey.
 &nbsp; 6  Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say
 unto the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the
 valleys, Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Behold, I have spoken in my
 jealousy and in my fury, because ye have borne the shame of the
 heathen:
 &nbsp; 7  Therefore thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; I have lifted up mine
 hand, Surely the heathen that <I>are</I> about you, they shall bear
 their shame.
 &nbsp; 8  But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your
 branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for they
 are at hand to come.
 &nbsp; 9  For, behold, I <I>am</I> for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye
 shall be tilled and sown:
 &nbsp; 10  And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel,
 <I>even</I> all of it: and the cities shall be inhabited, and the
 wastes shall be builded:
 &nbsp; 11  And I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall
 increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you after your old
 estates, and will do better <I>unto you</I> than at your beginnings:
 and ye shall know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 12  Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, <I>even</I> my people
 Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their
 inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them <I>of
 men.</I>
 &nbsp; 13  Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Because they say unto you, Thou
 <I>land</I> devourest up men, and hast bereaved thy nations;
 &nbsp; 14  Therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy
 nations any more, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 15  Neither will I cause <I>men</I> to hear in thee the shame of the
 heathen any more, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the
 people any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any
 more, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet had been ordered to set his face <I>towards the mountains 
 of Israel</I> and <I>prophesy against them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+6:2"><I>ch.</I> vi. 2</A>.

 Then God was coming forth to contend with his people; but now that God
 is returning in mercy to them he must speak good words and comfortable 
 words to these mountains, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:1,4"><I>v.</I> 1 and again <I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 <I>You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord;</I> and what he 
 says to them he says <I>to the hills, to the rivers, to the valleys, to 
 the desolate wastes</I> in the country, and to the cities <I>that are 
 forsaken,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:4,6"><I>v.</I> 4 and again <I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 The people were gone, some one way and some another; nothing remained 
 there to be spoken to but the places, the mountains and valleys; these 
 the Chaldeans could not carry away with them. <I>The earth abides for 
 ever.</I> Now, to show the mercy God had in reserve for the people, he 
 is to speak of him as having a dormant kindness for the place, which, 
 if the Lord had been pleased for ever to abandon, he would not have 
 called upon to <I>hear the word of the Lord,</I> nor <I>would he as at 
 this time have shown it such things as these.</I> Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The compassionate notice God takes of the present deplorable 
 condition of the land of Israel. It has become both a <I>prey</I> and a 
 <I>derision to the heathen that are round about,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 1. It has become a prey to them; and they are all enriched with the 
 plunder of it. When the Chaldeans had conquered them all their 
 neighbours flew to the spoil as to a shipwreck, every one thinking all 
 his own that he could lay his hands on 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>They have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, 
 that you might be a possession to the heathen,</I> to the 
 <I>residue</I> of them, even such as had themselves narrowly escaped 
 the like desolation. No one thought it any crime to strip an Israelite. 
 <I>Turba Rom&aelig; sequitur fortunam ut semper--The mob of Rome still 
 praise the elevated and despise the fallen.</I> It is the common dry, 
 when a man is down, <I>Down with him.</I> 

 2. It has become a derision to them. They took all they had and laughed 
 at them when they had done. <I>The enemy said, "Aha! even the ancient
 high places are ours in possession,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Neither the antiquity, nor the dignity, neither the sanctity nor the 
 fortifications, of the land of Israel, are its security, but we have 
 become masters of it all." The more honours that land had been adorned 
 with, and the greater figure it had made among the nations, the more 
 pride and pleasure did they take in making a spoil of it, which is an 
 instance of a base and sordid spirit; for the more glorious and 
 prosperity was the more piteous is the adversity. God takes notice of 
 it here as an aggravation of the present calamity of Israel: <I>You are 
 taken up in the lips of talkers and are an infamy of the people,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 All the talk of the country about was concerning the overthrow of the 
 Jewish nation; and every one that spoke of it had some peevish 
 ill-natured reflection or other upon them. They were the <I>scorning of 
 those that were at ease and the contempt of the proud,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+123:4">Ps. cxxiii. 4</A>.
 
 There are some that are noted for talkers, that have something to say
 of every body, but cannot find in their hearts to speak well of any 
 body; God's people, among such people, were sure to be a reproach when 
 the crown had fallen from their head. Thus it was the lot of 
 Christianity, in its suffering days, to be <I>every where spoken 
 against.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The expressions of God's just displeasure against those who 
 triumphed in the desolations of the land of Israel, as many of its 
 neighbours did, even the residue of the brethren, and Idumea 
 particularly. Let us see, 

 1. How they dealt with the Israel of God. They carved out large
 possessions to themselves out of their land, out of God's land; for so 
 indeed it was: "<I>They have appointed my land into their 
 possession</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 and so not only invaded their neighbour's property, but intrenched upon 
 God's prerogative." It was the holy land which they laid their 
 sacrilegious hands upon. They did not own any dependence upon God, as 
 the God of that land, nor acknowledge any remaining interest that 
 Israel had in it, but <I>cast it out for a prey,</I> as if they had won 
 it in a lawful war. And this they did without any dread of God and his 
 judgments and without any compassion for Israel and their calamities, 
 but with the <I>joy of all their hearts,</I> because they got by it, 
 and <I>with despiteful minds</I> to Israel that lost by it. Increasing 
 wealth, by right or wrong, is all the joy of a worldly heart; and the 
 calamities of God's people are all the joy of a despiteful mind. And 
 those that had not an opportunity of making a prey of God's people made 
 a reproach of them; so that they were <I>the shame of the heathen,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Every body ridiculed them and made a jest of them; and the truth is 
 they had by their own sin made themselves vile; so that God was 
 righteous herein, but men were unrighteous and very barbarous. 

 2. How God would deal with those who were thus in word and deed abusive 
 to his people. He has <I>spoken against the heathen;</I> he has passed 
 sentence upon them; he has determined to reckon with them for it, and 
 this <I>in the fire of his jealousy,</I> both for his own honour and 
 for the honour of his people,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Having a <I>love</I> for both as <I>strong as death,</I> he has a 
 <I>jealousy</I> for both as <I>cruel as the grave.</I> They spoke in 
 their malice against God's people, and he will speak in his jealousy 
 against them; and it is easy to say which will speak most powerfully. 
 God will speak <I>in his jealousy and in his fury,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Fury is not in God; but he will exert his power against them and handle 
 them as severely as men do when they are in a fury. He will so <I>speak 
 to them in his wrath as to vex them in his sore displeasure.</I> What 
 he says he will stand to, for it is backed with an oath. He has 
 <I>lifted up his hand</I> and sworn by himself, has sworn and will not 
 repent. And what is it that is said with so much heat, and yet with so 
 much deliberation? It is this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 <I>Surely the heathen that are about you, they shall bear their 
 shame.</I> Note, The righteous God, to whom vengeance belongs, will 
 render shame for shame. Those that put contempt and reproach upon God's 
 people will, sooner or later, have it <I>burned upon themselves,</I> 
 perhaps in this world (either their follies or their calamities, their 
 miscarriages or their mischances, shall be their reproach), at furthest 
 in that day when all the impenitent shall <I>rise to shame and 
 everlasting contempt.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The promises of God's favour to his Israel and assurances given of 
 great mercy God had in store for them. God takes occasion from the 
 outrage and insolence of their enemies to show himself so much the more 
 concerned for them and ready to do them good, as David hoped that God 
 would recompense him good for Shimei's cursing him. <I>Let them curse, 
 but bless thou.</I> In this way, as well as others, the enemies of 
 God's people do them real service, even by the injuries they do them, 
 against their will and beyond their intention. We shall have no reason 
 to complain if, the more unkind men are, the more kind God is--if, the
 more kindly he speaks to us by his word and Spirit, the more kindly he 
 acts for us in his providence. The prophet must say so to the 
 <I>mountains of Israel,</I> which were now <I>desolate and 
 despised,</I> that God is <I>for them</I> and will <I>burn to them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 As the curse of God reaches the ground for man's sake, so does the 
 blessing. Now that which is promised is, 

 1. That their rightful owners should return to the possession of them:
 <I>My people Israel are at hand to come,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Though they are at a great distance from their own country, though they 
 are dispersed in many countries, and though they are detained by the 
 power of their enemies, yet they shall <I>come again to their own 
 border,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:17">Jer. xxxi. 17</A>.

 The time is at hand for their return. Though there were above forty
 years of the seventy (perhaps fifty) yet remaining, it is spoken of as 
 near, because it is sure, and there were some among them that should 
 live to see it. A <I>thousand years are</I> with God but <I>as one 
 day.</I> The mountains of Israel are now desolate; but God will 
 <I>cause men to walk upon them</I> again, <I>even his people 
 Israel,</I> not as travellers passing over them, but as 
 inhabitants--not tenants, but freeholders: <I>They shall possess 
 thee,</I> not for term of life, but for themselves and their heirs; 
 <I>thou shalt be their inheritance.</I> It was a type of the heavenly 
 Canaan, to which all God's children are heirs, every Israelite indeed, 
 and into which they shall shortly be all brought together, out of the 
 countries where they are now scattered.

 2. That they should afford a plentiful comfortable maintenance for
 their owners at their return. When the land had <I>enjoyed her
 sabbaths</I> for so many years, it should be so much the more fruitful 
 afterwards, as we should be after rest, especially a sabbath rest: 
 <I>You shall be tilled and sown</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 and shall <I>yield your fruit to my people Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Note, It is a blessing to the earth to be made serviceable to men, 
 especially to good men, that will serve God with cheerfulness in the 
 use of those good things which the earth serves up to them. 

 3. That the people of Israel should have not only a comfortable
 sustenance, but a comfortable settlement, in their own land: The 
 <I>cities shall be inhabited; the wastes shall be builded,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 And <I>I will settle you after your old estates,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Their own sin had unsettled them, but now God's favour shall resettle 
 them. When the prodigal son has become a penitent he is settled again 
 in his father's house, according to his former estate. Bring hither
 the <I>first robe,</I> and put it on him. Nay, <I>I will do better unto 
 you</I> now <I>than at your beginnings.</I> There is more joy for the 
 sheep that is brought back than there would have been if it had never 
 gone astray. And God sometimes multiplies his people's comforts in 
 proportion to the <I>time that he has afflicted them.</I> Thus God 
 blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning, and doubled to 
 him all he had. 

 4. That the people, after their return, should be <I>fruitful, and 
 multiply, and replenish the land,</I> so that it should not only be 
 inhabited again, but as thickly inhabited, and as well peopled, as 
 ever. God will bring back to it <I>all the house of Israel, even all of 
 it</I> (observe what an emphasis is laid upon that,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 all <I>whose spirits God stirred up</I> to return; and those only were 
 reckoned of <I>the house of Israel,</I> the rest had cut themselves off 
 from it; or, though but few, in comparison, returned at first, yet 
 afterwards, at divers times, they <I>all</I> returned; and then (says 
 God) <I>I will multiply these men</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 <I>multiply man and beast; and they shall increase,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Note, God's kingdom in the world is a growing kingdom; and his church, 
 though for a time it may be diminished, shall recover itself and be 
 again replenished. 

 5. That the reproach long since cast up on the land of Israel by the
 evil spies, and of late revived, that <I>it was a land that ate up the 
 inhabitants</I> of it by famine, sickness, and the sword, should be 
 quite rolled away, and there should never be any more occasion for it.
 Canaan had got into a bad name. It had of old <I>spued out the 
 inhabitants</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:28">Lev. xviii. 28</A>),

 the natives, the aborigines, which was turned to its reproach by those 
 that should have put another construction upon it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:32">Num. xiii. 32</A>.

 It had of late devoured the Israelites, and spued them out too; so that
 it was commonly said of it, It is a land which, instead of supporting 
 its nations or tribes that inhabit it, <I>bereaves</I> them, 
 <I>overthrows</I> them, and <I>causes them to fall;</I> it is a 
 tenement which breaks all the tenants that come upon it. This character 
 it had got among the neighbours; but God now promises that it shall be 
 so no more: <I>Thou shalt no more bereave them of men</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),
 
 shalt <I>devour men no more,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 But the inhabitants shall live to a good old age, and not have the 
 number of their months cut off in the midst. Compare this with that 
 promise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:4">Zech. viii. 4</A>.

 Note, God will take away the reproach of his people by taking away that
 which was the occasion of it. When the nation is made to flourish in 
 peace, plenty, and power, then they <I>hear no more the shame of the 
 heathen</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 especially when it is reformed; when sin, which is the reproach of any 
 people, particularly of God's professing people, is taken away, then 
 they <I>hear no more the reproach of the people.</I> Note, When God 
 returns in mercy to a people that return to him in duty, all their 
 grievances will be soon redressed and their honour retrieved.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  Moreover the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 17  Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own
 land, they defiled it by their own way and by their doings: their
 way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman.
 &nbsp; 18  Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they
 had shed upon the land, and for their idols <I>wherewith</I> they had
 polluted it:
 &nbsp; 19  And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were
 dispersed through the countries: according to their way and
 according to their doings I judged them.
 &nbsp; 20  And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went,
 they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These <I>are</I>
 the people of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and are gone forth out of his land.
 &nbsp; 21  But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel
 had profaned among the heathen, whither they went.
 &nbsp; 22  Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord
 G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; I do not <I>this</I> for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for
 mine holy name's sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen,
 whither ye went.
 &nbsp; 23  And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among
 the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the
 heathen shall know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, when
 I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.
 &nbsp; 24  For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you
 out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land.

 When God promised the poor captives a glorious return, in due time, to 
 their own land, it was a great discouragement to their hopes that they 
 were unworthy, utterly unworthy, of such a favour; therefore, to remove 
 that discouragement, God here shows them that he would do it for them 
 purely <I>for his own name's sake,</I> that he might be glorified in 
 them and by them, that he might manifest and magnify his mercy and 
 goodness, that attribute which of all others is most his glory. And, 
 the restoration of that people being typical of our redemption by 
 Christ, this is intended further to show that the ultimate end aimed at 
 in our salvation, to which all the steps of it were made subservient, 
 was the glory of God. To this end Christ directed all he did in that 
 short prayer, <I>Father, glorify thy name;</I> and God declared it was 
 his end in all he did in the immediate answer given to that prayer, by 
 a voice from heaven: <I>I have glorified it, and I will glorify it yet 
 again,</I>

 Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How God's name had suffered both by the sins and by the miseries of 
 Israel; and this was more to be regretted than all their sorrow, which 
 they had brought upon themselves; for the honour of God lies nearer the 
 hearts of good men than any interests of their own. 

 1. God's glory had been injured by the sin of Israel when they were in
 their own land,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 It was a good land, a holy land, a land that had the eye of God upon 
 it. <I>But they defiled it by their own way,</I> their wicked way; that 
 is <I>our own</I> way, the way of our own choice; and we ourselves must 
 bear the blame and shame of it. The sin of a people defiles their land, 
 renders it abominable to God and uncomfortable to themselves; so that 
 they cannot have any holy communion with him nor with one another.
 What was unclean might not be made use of. By the abuse of the gifts of 
 God's bounty to us we forfeit the use of them; and, the mind and 
 conscience being defiled with guilt, no comfort is allowed us, 
 <I>nothing is pure</I> to us. Their way in the eye of God was like the
 pollution of a woman during the days of her separation, which shut her 
 out from the sanctuary and made very things she touched ceremonially 
 unclean, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+15:19">Lev. xv. 19</A>.

 Sin is that <I>abominable thing which the Lord hates,</I> and which he 
 cannot endure to look upon. They <I>shed blood</I> and <I>worshipped 
 idols</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>)

 and with those sins <I>defiled the land.</I> For this God <I>poured out 
 his fury</I> upon them, <I>scattered them among the heathen.</I> Their 
 own land was sick of them, and they were sent into other lands. Herein 
 God was righteous, and was justified in what he did; none could say 
 that he did them any wrong, nay, he did justice to his own honour, for 
 he <I>judged them according to their way and according to their 
 doings,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 And yet, the matter being not rightly understood, he was not glorified 
 in it; for the enemies did say, as Moses pleaded the Egyptians would 
 say if he had destroyed them in the wilderness, that <I>for mischief he 
 brought them forth.</I> Their neighbours considered them rather as a 
 holy people than as a sinful people, and therefore took occasion from 
 the calamities they were in, instead of glorifying God, as they might 
 justly have done, to reproach him and put contempt upon him; and God's 
 name was <I>continually every day blasphemed</I> by their oppressors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:5">Isa. lii. 5</A>.

 2. When they <I>entered into the land of the heathen</I> God had no
 glory by them there; but, on the contrary, his holy name was profaned,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 (1.) It was profaned by the sins of Israel; they were no credit to 
 their profession wherever they went, but, on the contrary, a reproach 
 to it. The <I>name of God</I> and his holy religion was <I>blasphemed 
 through them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:24">Rom. ii. 24</A>.

 When those that pretended to be in relation to God, in covenant and
 communion with him, were found corrupt in their morals, slaves to their 
 appetites and passions, dishonest in their dealings, and false to their 
 words and the trust reposed in them, the enemies of the Lord had 
 thereby great occasion given them to blaspheme, especially when they 
 quarrelled with their God for correcting them, than which nothing could 
 be more scandalous.

 (2.) It was profaned by the sufferings of Israel; for from them the 
 enemies of God took occasion to reproach God, as unable to protect his 
 own worshippers and to make good his own grants. They said, in scorn, 
 "<I>These are the people of the land,</I> these wicked people (you see 
 he could not keep them in their obedience to his precepts), these 
 <I>miserable people</I>--you see he could not keep them in the 
 enjoyment of his favours. These are <I>the people that came out of 
 Jehovah's land,</I> they are the very scum of the nations. Are these 
 those that had statues so righteous whose lives are so unrighteous? Is 
 this the nation that is so much celebrated for a <I>wise and 
 understanding people,</I> and that is said to have <I>God so nigh unto 
 them?</I> Do these belong to that brave, that holy nation, who appear 
 here so vile, so abject?" Thus God sold his people and did not 
 <I>increase his wealth by their price,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:12">Ps. xliv. 12</A>.

 The reproach they were under reflected upon him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Let us now see how God would retrieve his honour, secure it, and 
 advance it, by working a great reformation upon them and then working a 
 great salvation for them. He would have <I>scattered them among the 
 heathen, were it not that he feared the wrath of the enemy,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:26,27">Deut. xxxii. 26, 27</A>.

 But, though they were unworthy of his compassion, yet <I>he had pity
 for his own holy name,</I> and a thousand pities it was that that 
 should be trampled upon and abused. He looked with compassion on his 
 own honour, which lay bleeding among the heathen, on that jewel which 
 was trodden into the dirt, which <I>the house of Israel,</I> even in 
 the land of their captivity, <I>had profaned,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 In pity to that God brought them out from the heathen, because their 
 sins were more scandalous there than they had been in their own land. 
 "Therefore I <I>will gather you out of all countries and bring you into 
 your own land,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 <I>Not for your sake,</I> because you are worthy of such a favour, for 
 you are most unworthy, but <I>for my holy name's sake</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 that <I>I may sanctify my great name,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Observe, by the way, God's holy name is his great name. His holiness is 
 his greatness; so he reckons it himself. Nor does any thing make a man 
 truly great but being truly good, and partaking of God's holiness. God 
 will magnify his name as a holy name, for he will sanctify it: <I>I 
 will sanctify my name which you have profaned.</I> When God performs 
 that which he has sworn by his holiness, then he sanctifies his name.
 The effect of this shall be very happy: <I>The heathen shall know that 
 I am the Lord when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes</I> 
 and yours. When God proves his own holy name, and his saints praise it, 
 then he is sanctified in them, and this contributes to the propagating 
 of the knowledge of him. Observe, 

 1. God's reasons of mercy are all fetched from within himself; he will
 bring his people out of Babylon, not for their sakes, but <I>for his 
 own name's sake,</I> because he will be glorified. 

 2. God's goodness takes occasion from man's badness to appear so much 
 the more illustrious; <I>therefore</I> he will sanctify his name by the 
 pardon of sin, because it has been profaned by the commission of 
 sin.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>25  Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be
 clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I
 cleanse you.
 &nbsp; 26  A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I
 put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your
 flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.
 &nbsp; 27  And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk

 &nbsp; 28  And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers;

 you.
 &nbsp; 30  And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase
 of the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine
 among the heathen.

 desolate in the sight of all that passed by.

 &nbsp; 37  Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; I will yet <I>for</I> this be enquired
 of by the house of Israel, to do <I>it</I> for them; I will increase
 them with men like a flock.
 &nbsp; 38  As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn
 feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men:
 and they shall know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The people of God might be discouraged in their hopes of a restoration 
 by the sense not only of their unworthiness of such a favour (which was 
 answered, in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:1-24">foregoing verses</A>,

 with this, that God, in doing it, would have an eye to his own glory,
 not to their worthiness), but of their unfitness for such a favour, 
 being still corrupt and sinful; and that is answered in these verses,
 with a promise that God would by his grace prepare and qualify them for 
 the mercy and then bestow it on them. And this was in part fulfilled in 
 that wonderful effect which the captivity in Babylon had upon the Jews 
 there, that it effectually cured them of their inclination to idolatry. 
 But it is further intended as a draught of the covenant of grace, and a 
 specimen of those spiritual blessings with which we are blessed in 
 heavenly things by that covenant. As 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:1-31"><I>ch.</I> xxxiv.</A>)

 after a promise of their return the prophecy insensibly slid into a
 promise of the coming of Christ, the great Shepherd, so here it 
 insensibly slides into a promise of the Spirit, and his gracious 
 influences and operations, which we have as much need of for our 
 sanctification as we have of Christ's merit for our justification.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God here promises that he will work a good work in them, to qualify 
 them for the good work he intended to bring about for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:25-27"><I>v.</I> 25-27</A>.

 We had promises to the same purport, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:18-20"><I>ch.</I> xi. 18-20</A>.

 1. That God would cleanse them from the pollutions of sin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>I will sprinkle clean water upon you,</I> which signifies both the 
 book of Christ sprinkled upon the conscience to purify that and to take 
 away the sense of guilt (as those that were sprinkled with the water of 
 purification were thereby discharged from their ceremonial uncleanness) 
 and the grace of the Spirit sprinkled on the whole soul to purify it 
 from all corrupt inclinations and dispositions, as Naaman was cleansed 
 from his leprosy by dipping in Jordan. Christ was himself clean, else 
 his blood could not have been cleansing to us; and it is a Holy Spirit 
 that makes us holy: <I>From all your filthiness and from all your idols 
 will I cleanse you.</I> And 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>)

 <I>I will save you from all your uncleannesses.</I> Sin is defiling, 
 idolatry particularly is so; it renders sinners odious to God and 
 burdensome to themselves. When guilt is pardoned, and the corrupt 
 nature sanctified, then we are cleansed from our filthiness, and there 
 is no other way of being saved from it. This God promises his people
 here, in order to his being sanctified in them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 We cannot sanctify God's name unless he sanctify our hearts, nor live 
 to his glory, but by his grace. 

 2. That God would give them a <I>new heart,</I> a disposition of mind 
 excellent in itself and vastly different from what it was before. God 
 will work an inward change in order to a universal change. Note, All 
 that have an interest in the new covenant, and a title to the new 
 Jerusalem, have a new heart and a new spirit, and these are necessary 
 in order to their walking in <I>newness of life.</I> This is that 
 <I>divine nature</I> which believers are by the promises made partakers 
 of. 

 3. That, instead of a <I>heart of stone,</I> insensible and inflexible,
 unapt to receive any divine impressions and to return any devout 
 affections, God would give a <I>heart of flesh,</I> a soft and tender 
 heart, that has spiritual senses exercised, conscious to itself of 
 spiritual pains and pleasures, and complying in every thing with the 
 will of God. Note, Renewing grace works as great a change in the soul 
 as the turning of a dead stone into living flesh. 

 4. That since, besides our inclination to sin, we complain of an 
 inability to do our duty, God will <I>cause them to walk in his 
 statutes,</I> will not only show them the way of his statutes before 
 them, but incline them to walk in it, and thoroughly furnish them with 
 wisdom and will, and active powers, for every good work. In order to 
 this he will <I>put his Spirit within them,</I> as a teacher, guide, 
 and sanctifier. Note, God does not force men to walk in his statutes by 
 external violence, but causes them to walk in his statutes by an 
 internal principle. And observe what use we ought to make of this 
 gracious power and principle promised us, and put within us: <I>You 
 shall keep my judgments.</I> If God will do his part according to the 
 promise, we must do ours according to the precept. Note, The promise of 
 God's grace to enable us for our duty should engage and quicken our 
 constant care and endeavour to do our duty. God's promises must drive 
 us to his precepts as our rule, and then his precepts must send us back 
 to his promises for strength, for without his grace we can do 
 nothing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God here promises that he will take them into covenant with 
 himself. The sum of the covenant of grace we have, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 <I>You shall be my people, and I will be your God.</I> It is not, "If 
 you will be my people, I will be your God" (though it is very true that 
 we cannot expect to have God to be to us a God unless we be to him a 
 people), but he has chosen us, and loved us, first, not we him; 
 therefore the condition is of grace, is by promise, as well as the 
 reward; not of merit, not of works: "<I>You shall be my people;</I> I 
 will make you so; I will give you the nature and spirit of my people, 
 and then <I>I will be your God.</I>" And this is the foundation and 
 top-stone of a believer's happiness; it is heaven itself, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:3,7">Rev. xxi. 3, 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He promises that he will bring about all that good for them which 
 the exigence of their case calls for. When they are thus prepared for 
 mercy, 

 1. Then they shall return to their possessions and be settled again in
 them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 <I>You shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers.</I> God 
 will, in bringing them back to it, have an eye not to any merit of 
 theirs, but to the promise made to the fathers; for therefore he gave 
 it to them at first, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:7,8">Deut. vii. 7, 8</A>.

 <I>Therefore</I> he is gracious, because he has said that he will be
 so. This shall follow upon the blessed reformation God would work among 
 them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>):

 "<I>In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your 
 iniquities,</I> and so shall have made you meet for the inheritance, 
 <I>I will cause you to dwell in the cities,</I> and so put you in 
 possession of the inheritance." This is God's method of mercy indeed, 
 first to part men from their sins, and then to restore them to their 
 comforts. 

 2. Then they shall enjoy a plenty of all good things. When they are 
 saved <I>from their uncleanness,</I> from their sins which kept good 
 things from them, then <I>I will call for the corn and will increase 
 it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 Plenty comes at God's call, and the plenty he calls for shall be still 
 growing; and when he speaks the word the fruit both of the tree and of 
 the field shall multiply. As the inhabitants multiply the productions 
 shall multiply for their maintenance; for he that sends mouths will 
 send meat. Famine was one of the judgments which they had laboured 
 under, and it had been as much as any a reproach to them, that they 
 should be starved in a land so famed for fruitfulness. But now <I>I
 will lay no famine upon you;</I> and none are under that rod without 
 having it laid on by him. Then they <I>shall receive no more reproach 
 of famine,</I> shall never be again upbraided with that, nor shall it 
 ever be said that God is a Master that keeps his servants to short 
 allowance. Nay, they shall not only be cleared from the reproach of 
 famine, but they shall have the credit of abundance. The land that had 
 long <I>lain desolate in the sight of all that passed by,</I> that 
 looked upon it, some with contempt and some with compassion, shall 
 again <I>be tilled</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 and, having long lain fallow, it will now be the more fruitful. 
 Observe, God will <I>call for the corn</I> and yet they must <I>till 
 the ground</I> for it. Note, Even promised mercies must be laboured 
 for; for the promise is not to supersede, but to quicken and encourage 
 our industry and endeavour. And such a blessing will God command on the 
 <I>hand of the diligent</I> that all who pass by shall take notice of 
 it, with wonder, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 They shall say, "See what a blessed change here is, how <I>this land 
 that was desolate</I> has <I>become like the garden of Eden,</I> the 
 desert turned again into a paradise," Note, God has honours in reserve 
 for his people to be crowned with sufficient to counterbalance the 
 contempt they are now loaded with, and in them he will be honoured. 
 This wonderful increase both of the people of the land and of its 
 products is compared 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>)

 to the large flocks of cattle that are brought to Jerusalem, to be 
 sacrificed at one of the solemn feasts. Even the cities that now lie
 waste shall be filled with <I>flocks of men,</I> not like the flocks 
 with which the pastures are <I>covered over</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:13">Ps. lxvi. 13</A>),

 but like the holy flock which is brought to the courts of the Lord's
 house. Note, <I>Then</I> the increase of the numbers of a people is
 honourable and comfortable indeed when they are all dedicated to God as 
 a holy flock, to be presented to him for <I>living sacrifices.</I> 
 Crowds are a lovely sight in God's temple.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He shows what shall be <I>the happy effects of this blessed 
 change.</I> 

 1. It shall have a happy effect upon the people of God themselves, for
 it shall bring them to an ingenuous repentance for their sins

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 <I>Then shall you remember your own evil ways and shall loathe 
 yourselves.</I> See here what sin is; it is an <I>abomination,</I> a 
 loathsome thing, that abominable thing which the Lord hates. See what 
 is the first step towards repentance; it is <I>remembering our own evil 
 ways,</I> reflecting seriously upon the sins we have committed and 
 being particular in recapitulating them. We must remember against 
 ourselves not only our gross enormities, <I>our own evil ways,</I> but 
 our defects and infirmities, <I>our doings that were not good,</I> not 
 so good as they should have been; not only our direct violations of the 
 law, but our coming short of it. See what is evermore a companion of 
 true repentance, and that is self-loathing, a holy shame and confusion 
 of face: "You shall <I>loathe yourselves in your own sight,</I> seeing 
 how loathsome you have made yourselves in the sight of God." Self-love 
 is at the bottom of sin, which we cannot but blush to see the absurdity 
 of; but our quarrelling with ourselves is in order to our being, upon 
 good grounds, reconciled to ourselves. And, <I>lastly,</I> see what is
 the most powerful inducement to an evangelical repentance, and that is 
 a sense of the mercy of God; when God settles them in the midst of 
 plenty, <I>then they shall loathe themselves for their iniquities.</I> 
 Note, The goodness of God should overcome our badness and <I>lead us to 
 repentance.</I> The more we see of God's readiness to receive us into 
 favour upon our repentance the more reason we shall see to be ashamed 
 of ourselves that we could ever sin against so much love. That heart is 
 hard indeed that will not be thus melted. 

 2. It shall have a happy effect upon their neighbours, for it shall 
 bring them to a more clear knowledge of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>):

 "<I>Then the heathen that are left round about you,</I> that spoke 
 ignorantly of God (for so all those do that speak <I>ill</I> of him) 
 when they saw the land of Israel desolate, shall begin to know better, 
 and to speak more intelligently of God, being convinced that he is able 
 to rebuild the most desolate cities and to replant the most desolate 
 countries, and that, though the course of his favours to his people may 
 be obstructed for a time, they shall not be cut off for ever." They 
 shall be made to know the truth of divine revelation by the exact 
 agreement which they shall discern between God's word which he has 
 spoken to Israel and his works which he has done for them: <I>I the 
 Lord have spoken it, and I will do it.</I> With us saying and doing are 
 two things, but they are not so with God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He proposes these things to them, not as the <I>recompence</I> of 
 their merits, but as the return of their prayers.</P>

 1. Let them not think that they have deserved it: <I>Not for your sakes 
 do I this, be it known to you</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:22,32"><I>v.</I> 22, 32</A>);

 no, <I>be you ashamed and confounded for your own ways.</I> God is 
 <I>doing</I> this, all this which he has promised; it is as sure to be 
 done as if it were done already, and present events have a tendency 
 towards it. But then, 

 (1.) They must renounce the merit of their own good works, and be 
 brought to acknowledge that it is not for their sakes that it is done; 
 so, when God brought Israel into Canaan the first time, an express 
 <I>caveat</I> was entered against this thought.
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:4-6">Deut. ix. 4-6</A>,

 <I>It is not for thy righteousness.</I> It is not for the sake of any
 of their good qualities or good deeds, not because God had any need of 
 them, or expected any benefit by them. No, in showing mercy he acts by 
 prerogative, not for our deserts, but for his own honour. See how
 emphatically this is expressed: <I>Be it known to you,</I> it is <I>not 
 for your sakes,</I> which intimates that we are apt to entertain a high 
 conceit of our own merits and are with difficulty persuaded to disclaim 
 a confidence in them. But, one way or other, God will make all his 
 favourites to know and own that it is his grace, and not their 
 goodness, his mercy, and not their merit, that made them so; and that 
 therefore not unto them, not unto them, but unto him, is all the glory 
 due.

 (2.) They must repent of the sin of their own evil ways. They must own
 that the mercies they receive from God are not only not merited, but 
 that they are a thousand times forfeited; and therefore they must be so 
 far from boasting of their good works that they must be ashamed and 
 confounded for their evil ways, and then they are best prepared for 
 mercy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Yet let them know that they must desire and expect it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>):

 <I>I will yet for this be enquired of by the house of Israel.</I> God 
 has spoken, and he will do it, and he will be sought unto for it. He 
 requires that his people should <I>seek unto him,</I> and he will 
 incline their hearts to do it, when he is coming towards them in ways 
 of mercy. 

 (1.) They must pray for it, for by prayer God is sought unto, and 
 enquired after. What is the matter of God's promises must be the matter 
 of our prayers. By asking for the mercy promised we must give glory to
 the donor, express a value for the gift, own our dependence, and put 
 honour upon prayer which God has put honour upon. Christ himself must 
 ask, and then God will <I>give him the heathen for his inheritance,</I> 
 must <I>pray the Father,</I> and then he will <I>send the 
 Comforter;</I> much more must we ask that we may receive. 

 (2.) They must consult the oracles of God, and thus also God is sought 
 unto and enquired after. The mercy must be, not an act of providence 
 only, but a child of promise; and therefore the promise must be looked 
 at, and prayer made for it with an eye of faith fastened upon the 
 promise, which must be both the guide and the ground of our 
 expectations. Both these ways we find God enquired of by Daniel, in the 
 name of the house of Israel, when he was about to do those great things 
 for them; he consulted the oracles of God, for he <I>understood by 
 books,</I> the book of the prophet Jeremiah, both what was to be 
 expected and when; and then he <I>set his face</I> to seek God by 
 prayer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:2,3">Dan. ix. 2, 3</A>.

 Note, Our communion with God must be kept up by the word and prayer in
 all the operations of his providence concerning us and in both he must 
 be enquired of.</P>
