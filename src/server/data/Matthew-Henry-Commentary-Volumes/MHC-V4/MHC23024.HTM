 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is agreed that here begins a new sermon, which is continued to the
 end of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:1-27:13">chap. xxvii.</A>

 And in it the prophet, according to the directions he had received,
 does, in many precious promises, "say to the righteous, It shall be
 well with them;" and, in many dreadful threatenings, he says, "Woe to
 the wicked, it shall be ill with them" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:10,11"><I>ch.</I> iii. 10, 11</A>);

 and these are interwoven, that they may illustrate each other. This
 chapter is mostly threatening; and, as the judgments threatened are 
 very sore and grievous ones, so the people threatened with those 
 judgments are very many. It is not the burden of any particular city or 
 kingdom, as those before, but the burden of the whole earth. The word 
 indeed signifies only the land, because our own land is commonly to us 
 as all the earth. But it is here explained by another word that is not
 so confined; it is the world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:4">ver. 4</A>);

 so that it must at least take in a whole neighbourhood of nations. 

 1. Some think (and very probably) that it is a prophecy of the great
 havoc that Sennacherib and his Assyrian army should now shortly make of
 many of the nations in that part of the world. 

 2. Others make it to point at the like devastations which, about 100
 years afterwards, Nebuchadnezzar and his armies should make in the same
 countries, going from one kingdom to another, not only to conquer them,
 but to ruin them and lay them waste; for that was the method which
 those eastern nations took in their wars. The promises that are mixed
 with the threatenings are intended for the support and comfort of the
 people of God in those very calamitous times. And, since here are no
 particular nations names either by whom or on whom those desolations
 should be brought, I see not but it may refer to both these events.
 Nay, the scripture has many fulfillings, and we ought to give it its 
 full latitude; and therefore I incline to think that the prophet, from 
 those and the like instances which he had a particular eye to, designs 
 here to represent in general the calamitous state of mankind, and the 
 many miseries which human life is liable to, especially those that 
 attend the wars of the nations. Surely the prophets were sent, not
 only to foretel particular events, but to form the minds of men to 
 virtue and piety, and for that end their prophecies were written and 
 preserved even for our learning, and therefore ought not to be looked 
 upon as of private interpretation. Now since a thorough conviction of 
 the vanity of the world, and its insufficiency to make us happy, will 
 go far towards bringing us to God, and drawing out our affections 
 towards another world, the prophet here shows what vexation of spirit 
 we must expect to meet with in these things, that we may never take up 
 our rest in them, nor promise ourselves satisfaction any where short of 
 the enjoyment of God. In this chapter we have,

 I. A threatening of desolating judgments for sin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:1-12">ver. 1-12</A>),

 to which is added an assurance that in the midst of them good people
 should be comforted,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:13-15">ver. 13-15</A>.

 II. A further threatening of the like desolations 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:16-22">ver. 16-22</A>),

 to which is added an assurance that in the midst of all God should be
 glorified.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Behold, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste,
 and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants
 thereof.
 &nbsp; 2  And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as
 with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with
 her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the
 lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with
 the giver of usury to him.
 &nbsp; 3  The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath spoken this word.
 &nbsp; 4  The earth mourneth <I>and</I> fadeth away, the world languisheth
 <I>and</I> fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish.
 &nbsp; 5  The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof;
 because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance,
 broken the everlasting covenant.
 &nbsp; 6  Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that
 dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the
 earth are burned, and few men left.
 &nbsp; 7  The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the
 merry-hearted do sigh.
 &nbsp; 8  The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice
 endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth.
 &nbsp; 9  They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be
 bitter to them that drink it.
 &nbsp; 10  The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut
 up, that no man may come in.
 &nbsp; 11  <I>There is</I> a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is
 darkened, the mirth of the land is gone.
 &nbsp; 12  In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with
 destruction.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is a very dark and melancholy scene that this prophecy presents to 
 our view; turn our eyes which way we will, every thing looks dismal. 
 The threatened desolations are here described in a great variety of 
 expressions to the same purport, and all aggravating.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The earth is stripped of all its ornaments and looks as if it were 
 taken off its basis; it is made <I>empty and waste</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),
 
 as if it
 were reduced to its first chaos, <I>Tohu</I> and <I>Bohu,</I> nothing 
 but confusion and emptiness again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:2">Gen. i. 2</A>),

 <I>without form and void.</I> It is true earth sometimes signifies the
 <I>land,</I> and so the same word <I>eretz</I> is here translated

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>The land shall be utterly emptied and utterly spoiled;</I> but I see 
 not why it should not there, as well as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>,

 be translated <I>the earth;</I> for most commonly, if not always, where 
 it signifies some one particular land it has something joined to it, or 
 at least not far from it, which does so appropriate it; as the land (or 
 earth) of Egypt, or Canaan, or this land, or ours, or yours, or the 
 like. It might indeed refer to some particular country, and an 
 ambiguous word might be used to warrant such an application; for it is 
 good to apply to ourselves, and our own hands, what the scripture says 
 in general of the vanity and vexation of spirit that attend all things 
 here below; but it should seem designed to speak what often happens to 
 many countries, and will do while the world stands, and what may, we 
 know not how soon, happen to our own, and what is the general character 
 of all earthly things: they are empty of all solid comfort and 
 satisfaction; a little thing makes them waste. We often see numerous
 families, and plentiful estates, utterly emptied and utterly spoiled, 
 by one judgment or other, or perhaps only by a gradual and insensible 
 decay. Sin has turned the earth <I>upside down;</I> the earth has 
 become quite a different thing to man from what it was when God made it 
 to be his habitation. Sin has also <I>scattered abroad the inhabitants 
 thereof.</I> The rebellion at Babel was the occasion of the dispersion 
 there. How many ways are there in which the inhabitants both of towns 
 and of private houses are scattered abroad, so that near relations and 
 old neighbours know nothing of one another! To the same purport is

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 <I>The earth mourns, and fades away;</I> it disappoints those that 
 placed their happiness in it and raised their expectations high from 
 it, and proves not what they promised themselves it would be.
 <I>The</I> whole <I>world languishes and fades away,</I> as hastening 
 towards a dissolution. It is, at the best, like a flower, which withers 
 in the hands of those that please themselves too much with it, and lay 
 it in their bosoms. And, as the earth itself grows old, so those that 
 dwell therein are desolate; men carry crazy sickly bodies along with 
 them, are often solitary, and confined by affliction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 When the earth languishes, and is not so fruitful as it used to be, 
 then those that dwell therein, that make it their home, and rest, and 
 portion, are desolate; whereas those that by faith dwell in God can 
 rejoice in him even when the fir-tree does not blossom. If we look 
 abroad, and see in how many places pestilences and burning fevers rage, 
 and what multitudes are swept away by them in a little time, so that 
 sometimes the living scarcely suffice to bury the dead, perhaps we 
 shall understand what the prophet means when he says, <I>The 
 inhabitants of the earth are burned,</I> or consumed, some by one 
 disease, others by another, and there are but <I>few men left,</I> in 
 comparison. Note, The world we live in is a world of disappointment, a 
 vale of tears, and a dying world; and the children of men in it are but 
 of few days, and full of trouble.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It is God that brings all these calamities upon the earth. <I>The 
 Lord</I> that made the earth, and made it fruitful and beautiful, for 
 the service and comfort of man, now <I>makes it empty and waste</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 for its Creator is and will be its Judge; he has an incontestable right 
 to pass sentence upon it and an irresistible power to execute that 
 sentence. It is <I>the Lord</I> that <I>has spoken this word,</I> and 
 he will do the work 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 it is his curse that has <I>devoured the earth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 the general curse which sin brought upon <I>the ground for man's 
 sake</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:17">Gen. iii. 17</A>),

 and all the particular curses which families and countries bring upon
 themselves by their enormous wickedness. See the power of God's curse, 
 how it makes all empty and lays all waste; those whom he curses are 
 cursed indeed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Persons of all ranks and conditions shall share in these 
 calamities 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>It shall be as with the people, so with the priest,</I> &c. This is 
 true of many of the common calamities of human life; all are subject to 
 the same diseases of body, sorrows of mind, afflictions in relations, 
 and the like. There is one event to those of very different stations; 
 time and chance happen to them all. It is in a special manner true of 
 the destroying judgments which God sometimes brings upon sinful 
 nations; when he pleases he can make them universal, so that none shall 
 escape them or be exempt from them; whether men have little or much, 
 they shall lose it all. Those of the meaner rank smart first by famine; 
 but those of the higher rank go first into captivity, while the poor of 
 the land are left. It shall be all alike, 

 1. With high and low: <I>As with the people, so with the priest,</I> or
 prince. The dignity of magistrates and ministers, and the respect and
 reverence due to both, shall not secure them. <I>The faces of elders
 are not honoured,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:12">Lam. v. 12</A>.

 The priests had been as corrupt and wicked as the people; and, if their
 character served not to restrain them from sin, how can they expect it 
 should serve to secure them from judgments? In both it is <I>like
 people, like priest,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:8,9">Hosea iv. 8, 9</A>.

 2. With bond and free: <I>As with the servant, so with his master; as
 with the maid, so with her mistress.</I> They have all corrupted their 
 way, and therefore will all be made miserable when the earth is made 
 waste. 

 3. With rich and poor. Those that have money before-hand, that are
 purchasing, and letting out money to interest, will fare no better than 
 those that are so impoverished that they are forced to sell their 
 estates and take up money at interest. There are judgments short of
 the great day of judgment in which rich and poor meet together. Let not 
 those that are advanced in the world set their inferiors at too great a 
 distance, because they know not how soon they may be set upon a level 
 with them. <I>The rich man's wealth is his strong city</I> in his own
 conceit; but it does not always prove so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. It is sin that brings these calamities upon the earth. The earth is 
 made empty, and fades away, because it <I>is defiled under the 
 inhabitants thereof</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>);

 it is polluted by the sins of men, and therefore it is made desolate by 
 the judgments of God. Such is the filthy nature of sin that it defiles 
 the earth itself under the sinful inhabitants thereof, and it is 
 rendered unpleasant in the eyes of God and good men. See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:25,27,28">Lev. xviii. 25, 27, 28</A>.
 
 Blood, in particular, defiles the land, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:33">Num. xxxv. 33</A>.
 
 The earth never spues out its inhabitants till they have first defiled 
 it by their sins. Why, what have they done? 

 1. They have transgressed the laws of their creation, not answered the
 ends of it. The bonds of the law of nature have been broken by them, 
 and they have cast from them the cords of their obligations to the God 
 of nature. 

 2. <I>They have changed the ordinances</I> of revealed religion, those 
 of them that have had the benefit of that. <I>They have neglected the 
 ordinances</I> (so some read it), and have made no conscience of 
 observing them. They have passed over the laws, in the commission of 
 sin, and have passed by the ordinance, in the omission of duty. 

 3. Herein they have <I>broken the everlasting covenant,</I> which is a
 perpetual bond and will be to those that keep it a perpetual blessing.
 It is God's wonderful condescension that he is pleased to deal with men 
 in a covenant-way, to do them good, and thereby oblige them to do him 
 service. Even those that had no benefit by God's covenant with Abraham 
 had benefit by his covenant with Noah and his sons, which is called 
 <I>an everlasting covenant,</I> his covenant with day and night; but 
 they observe not the precepts of the sons of Noah, they acknowledge not 
 God's goodness in the day and night, nor study to make him any grateful 
 returns, and so break the everlasting covenant and defeat the gracious 
 designs and intentions of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. These judgments shall humble men's pride and mar their mirth. When 
 the earth is made empty, 
 
 1. It is a great mortification to men's pride
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>The haughty people of the earth do languish;</I> for they have lost 
 that which supported their pride, and for which they magnified 
 themselves. As for those that have held their heads highest, God can 
 make them hang the head. 

 2. It is a great damp to men's jollity. This is enlarged upon much

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:7-9"><I>v.</I> 7-9</A>):

 <I>All the merry-hearted do sigh.</I> Such is the nature of carnal 
 mirth, it is but <I>as the crackling of thorns under a pot,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:6">Eccl. vii. 6</A>.

 Great laughters commonly end in a sigh. Those that make the world their
 chief joy cannot rejoice ever more. When God sends his judgments into 
 the earth he designs thereby to make those serious that were wholly 
 addicted to their pleasures. <I>Let your laughter be turned into 
 mourning.</I> When the earth is emptied the <I>noise of those that 
 rejoice in it ends.</I> Carnal joy is a noisy thing; but the noise of 
 it will soon be at an end, and the end of it is heaviness. Two things 
 are made use of to excite and express vain mirth, and the jovial crew 
 is here deprived of both:--

 (1.) Drinking: <I>The new wine mourns;</I> it has grown sour for want
 of drinking; for, how proper soever it may be for the heavy heart

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:6">Prov. xxxi. 6</A>),

 it does not relish to them as it does to the merry-hearted. <I>The vine 
 languishes,</I> and gives little hopes of a vintage, and therefore 
 <I>the merry-hearted do sigh;</I> for they know no other gladness than 
 that of their corn, and wine, and oil increasing 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:7">Ps. iv. 7</A>),

 and, if you <I>destroy their vines and their fig-trees, you make all
 their mirth to cease,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:11,12">Hosea ii. 11, 12</A>.

 <I>They shall not</I> now <I>drink wine with a song</I> and with
 huzzas, as they used to, but rather drink it with a sigh; nay, 
 <I>Strong drink shall be bitter to those that drink it,</I> because 
 they cannot but mingle their tears with it; or, through sickness, they 
 have lost the relish of it. God has many ways to embitter wine and
 strong drink to those that love them and have the highest gust of them: 
 distemper of body, anguish of mind, the ruin of the estate or country, 
 will make the strong drink bitter and all the delights of sense 
 tasteless and insipid.

 (2.) Music: <I>The mirth of tabrets ceases, and the joy of the
 harp,</I> which used to be at their feasts,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:12"><I>ch.</I> v. 12</A>.

 The captives in Babylon hang their harps on the willow trees. In short,
 <I>All joy is darkened;</I> there is not a pleasant look to be seen, 
 nor has any one power to force a smile; all <I>the mirth of the land is 
 gone</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);

 and, if it was that mirth which Solomon calls <I>madness,</I> there is 
 no great loss of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The cities will in a particular manner feel from these desolations 
 of the country 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>The city of confusion is broken, is broken down</I> (so we read it); 
 it lies exposed to invading powers, not only by the breaking down of 
 its walls, but by the confusion that the inhabitants are in. <I>Every 
 house is shut up,</I> perhaps by reason of the plague, which has burned 
 or consumed the inhabitants, so that there are <I>few men left,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Houses infected are usually shut up that no man may come in. Or they 
 are shut up because they are deserted and uninhabited. <I>There is a 
 crying for wine,</I> that is, for the spoiling of the vintage, so that 
 there is likely to be no wine. <I>In the city,</I> in Jerusalem itself, 
 that had been so much frequented, there shall be left nothing but 
 <I>desolation;</I> grass shall grow in the streets, and <I>the gate is 
 smitten with destruction</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 all that used to pass and repass through the gate are smitten, and all 
 the strength of the city is cut off. How soon can God make a city of
 order a city of confusion, and then it will soon be a city of 
 desolation!</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the
 people, <I>there shall be</I> as the shaking of an olive tree, <I>and</I>
 as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done.
 &nbsp; 14  They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the
 majesty of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, they shall cry aloud from the sea.
 &nbsp; 15  Wherefore glorify ye the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in the fires, <I>even</I> the name
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel in the isles of the sea.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is mercy remembered in the midst of wrath. In Judah and Jerusalem, 
 and the neighbouring countries, when they are overrun by the enemy, 
 Sennacherib or Nebuchadnezzar, there shall be a remnant preserved from 
 the general ruin, and it shall be a devout and pious remnant. And this 
 method God usually observes when his judgments are abroad; he does not 
 make a full end, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:13"><I>ch.</I> vi. 13</A>.

 Or we may take it thus: Though the greatest part of mankind have all
 their comfort ruined by the emptying of the earth, and the making of 
 that desolate, yet there are some few who understand their interests 
 better, who have laid up their treasure in heaven and not in things 
 below, and therefore can keep up their comfort and joy in God even 
 <I>when the earth mourns and fades away.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The small number of this remnant, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 When all goes to ruin <I>there shall be as the shaking of an 
 olive-tree, and the gleaning grapes,</I> here and there one who shall 
 escape the common calamity (as Noah and his family when the old world 
 was drowned), that shall be able to sit down upon a heap of the ruins 
 of all their creature comforts, and even then rejoice in the Lord 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:16-18">Hab. iii. 16-18</A>),

 who, when all faces gather blackness, can lift up their heads with joy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:26,28">Luke xxi. 26, 28</A>.

 These few are dispersed, and at a distance from each other, like the
 gleanings of the olive-tree; and they are concealed, hid under the 
 leaves. The Lord only knows those that are his; the world does not.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The great devotion of this remnant, which is the greater for their 
 having so narrowly escaped this great destruction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>They shall lift up their voice; they shall sing.</I> 

 1. They shall sing for joy in their deliverance. When the mirth of
 carnal worldlings ceases the joy of the saints is as lively as ever; 
 when the merry-hearted do sigh because the vine languishes the 
 upright-hearted do sing because the covenant of grace, the fountain of 
 their comforts and the foundation of their hopes, never fails. Those 
 that rejoice in the Lord can rejoice in tribulation, and by faith may 
 be in triumphs when all about them are in tears. 

 2. They shall sing to the glory and praise of God, shall sing not only
 for the mercy but <I>for the majesty of the Lord.</I> Their songs are 
 awful and serious, and in their spiritual joys they have a reverend 
 regard to the greatness of God, and keep at a humble distance when they 
 attend him with their praises. The majesty of the Lord, which is matter 
 of terror to wicked people, furnishes the saints with songs of praise. 
 They shall sing for the magnificence, or transcendent excellency, of 
 the Lord, shown both in his judgments and in his mercies; for we must 
 sing, and sing unto him, of both,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+101:1">Ps. ci. 1</A>.

 Those who have made, or are making, their escape from the land (that
 being emptied and made desolate) to the sea and the isles of the sea, 
 shall thence cry aloud; their dispersion shall help to spread the 
 knowledge of God, and they shall make even remote shores to ring with 
 his praises. It is much for the honour of God if those who fear him 
 rejoice in him, and praise him, even in the most melancholy times.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Their holy zeal to excite others to the same devotion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);
 
 they encourage their fellow-sufferers to do likewise. 

 1. Those who are <I>in the fires,</I> in the furnace of affliction,
 those fires by which the <I>inhabitants of the earth are burned,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Or in the valleys, the low, dark, dirty places. 

 2. Those who are <I>in the isles of the sea,</I> whither they are
 banished, or are forced to flee for shelter, and hide themselves remote 
 from all their friends. They went <I>through fire and water</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:12">Ps. lxvi. 12</A>);

 yet in both let them glorify the Lord, and glory him as the Lord God of
 Israel. Those who through grace can glory in tribulation ought to 
 glorify God in tribulation, and give him thanks for their comforts, 
 which abound as their afflictions do abound. We must in every fire, 
 even the hottest, in every isle, even the remotest, keep up our good 
 thoughts of God. When, though he slay us, yet we trust in him--when,
 though for his sake we are killed all the day long, yet none of these 
 things move us--then we glorify the Lord in the fires. Thus the three 
 children, and the martyrs that sang at the stake.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs,
 <I>even</I> glory to the righteous. But I said, My leanness, my
 leanness, woe unto me! the treacherous dealers have dealt
 treacherously; yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very
 treacherously.
 &nbsp; 17  Fear, and the pit, and the snare, <I>are</I> upon thee, O
 inhabitant of the earth.
 &nbsp; 18  And it shall come to pass, <I>that</I> he who fleeth from the
 noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up
 out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the
 windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth
 do shake.
 &nbsp; 19  The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean
 dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly.
 &nbsp; 20  The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall
 be removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be
 heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.
 &nbsp; 21  And it shall come to pass in that day, <I>that</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall
 punish the host of the high ones <I>that are</I> on high, and the
 kings of the earth upon the earth.
 &nbsp; 22  And they shall be gathered together, <I>as</I> prisoners are
 gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and
 after many days shall they be visited.
 &nbsp; 23  Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem,
 and before his ancients gloriously.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These verses, as those before, plainly speak,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Comfort to saints. They may be driven, by the common calamities of 
 the places where they live, into <I>the uttermost parts of the 
 earth,</I> or perhaps they are forced thither for their religion; but 
 there they are singing, not sighing. Thence have we heard songs, and it 
 is a comfort to us to hear them, to hear that good people carry their 
 religion along with them even to the most distant regions, to hear that 
 God visits them there and gives encouragement to hope that he will 
 gather them thence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:4">Deut. xxx. 4</A>.

 And this is their song, <I>even glory to the righteous:</I> the word is
 singular, and may refer to <I>the righteous God,</I> who is just in all 
 he has brought upon us. This is glorifying the Lord in the fires. Or 
 the meaning may be, "These songs redound to the glory or beauty of the 
 righteous that sing them." We do the greatest honour imaginable to 
 ourselves when we employ ourselves in honouring and glorifying God. 
 This may have reference to the sending of the gospel to the uttermost 
 parts of the earth, as far as this island of ours, in the days of the 
 Messiah, the glad tidings of which are echoed back in songs heard 
 thence, from churches planted there, even glory to the righteous God, 
 agreeing with the angels' song, <I>Glory be to God in the highest,</I> 
 and glory to all righteous men; for the work of redemption was ordained 
 before the world for our glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Terror to sinners. The prophet, having comforted himself and others 
 with the prospect of a saved remnant, returns to lament the miseries he 
 saw breaking in like a mighty torrent upon the earth: "<I>But I said, 
 My leanness! my leanness! woe unto me!</I> The very thought of it frets 
 me, and makes me lean," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 He foresees,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The prevalency of sin, that iniquity should abound 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>The treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously;</I> this is itself 
 a judgment, and that which provokes God to bring other judgments. 

 (1.) Men are false to one another; there is no faith in man, but a
 universal dishonesty. Truth, that sacred bond of society, has departed, 
 and there is nothing but treachery in men's dealings. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:1,2">Jer. ix. 1, 2</A>.

 (2.) They are all false to their God; as to him, and their covenant
 with him, the children of men are all treacherous dealers, and have 
 dealt very treacherously with their God, in departing from their 
 allegiance to him. This is the original, and this the aggravation, of 
 the sin of the world; and, when men have been false to their God, how 
 should they be true to any other?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The prevalency of wrath and judgment for that sin. 

 (2.) The inhabitants of the earth will be pursued from time to time,
 from place to place, by one mischief or other

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>):

 <I>Fear, and the pit, and the snare</I> (fear of the pit and the snare) 
 are upon them wherever they are; for the sons of men know not what evil 
 they may suddenly be snared in, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:12">Eccl. ix. 12</A>.

 These three words seem to be chosen for the sake of an elegant
 paranomasia, or, as we now scornfully call it, a jungle of words: 
 <I>Pachad,</I> and <I>Pachath,</I> and <I>Pach;</I> but the meaning is 
 plain

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 that <I>evil pursues sinners</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+13:21">Prov. xiii. 21</A>),

 that the curse shall overtake the disobedient 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:15">Deut. xxviii. 15</A>),

 that those who are secure because they have escaped one judgment know 
 not how soon another may arrest them. What this prophet threatens all 
 the inhabitants of the earth with another makes part of the judgment of 
 Moab, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:43">Jer. xlviii. 43, 44</A>.

 But it is a common instance of the calamitous state of human life that
 when we seek to avoid one mischief we fall into a worse, and that the 
 end of one trouble is often the beginning of another; so that we are 
 least safe when we are most secure.

 (2.) The earth itself will be shaken to pieces. It will be literally so
 at last, when all <I>the works therein shall be burnt up;</I> and it is 
 often figuratively so before that period. <I>The windows from on high 
 are open</I> to pour down wrath, as in the universal deluge. <I>Upon 
 the wicked God shall rain snares</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+11:6">Ps. xi. 6</A>);

 and, the fountains of the great deep being broken up, <I>the
 foundations of the earth do shake</I> of course, the frame of nature is 
 unhinged, and all is in confusion. See how elegantly this is expressed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>):

 <I>The earth is utterly broken down; it is clean dissolved; it is moved 
 exceedingly,</I> moved out of its place. <I>God shakes heaven and 
 earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:6">Hag. ii. 6</A>.

 See the misery of those who lay up their treasure in the things of the
 earth and mind those things; they place their confidence in that which 
 will shortly be <I>utterly broken down and dissolved. The earth shall 
 reel to and fro like a drunkard;</I> so unsteady, so uncertain, are all 
 the motions of these things. Worldly men dwell in it as in a palace, as 
 in a castle, as in an impregnable tower; but <I>it shall be removed 
 like a cottage,</I> so easily, so suddenly, and with so little loss to 
 the great landlord. The pulling down of the earth will be but like the 
 pulling down of <I>a cottage,</I> which the country is willing to be 
 rid of, because it does but harbour beggars; and therefore no care is 
 taken to rebuild it: It <I>shall fall, and not rise again;</I> but 
 there shall be new heavens and a new earth, in which shall dwell 
 nothing but righteousness. But what is it that shakes the earth thus 
 and sinks it? It is the transgression thereof that shall be heavy upon
 it. Note, Sin is a burden to the whole creation; it is a heavy burden, 
 a burden under which it groans now and will sink at last. Sin is the 
 ruin of states, and kingdoms, and families; they fall under the weight 
 of that <I>talent of lead,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+5:7,8">Zech. v. 7, 8</A>.

 (3.) God will have a particular controversy with the kings and great
 men of the earth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>He will punish the host of the high ones.</I> Hosts of princes are 
 no more before God than hosts of common men; what can a host of high 
 ones do with their combined force when the Most High, the Lord of 
 hosts, contends with them to abase their height, and scatter their 
 hosts, and break all their confederacies? The high ones, that are on 
 high, that are puffed up with their height and grandeur, that think 
 themselves so high that they are out of the reach of any danger, God 
 will visit upon them all their pride and cruelty, with which they have 
 oppressed and injured their neighbours and subjects, and it shall now 
 return upon their own heads. <I>The kings of the earth</I> shall now be 
 reckoned with <I>upon the earth,</I> to show that verily there is a God 
 that judges in the earth and will render to the proudest of kings 
 according to the fruit of their doings. Let those that are trampled
 upon by the high ones of the earth comfort themselves with this, that 
 though they cannot, dare not, must not, resist them, yet there is a God 
 that will call them to an account, that will triumph over them upon 
 their own dunghill: for the earth they are kings of is in the eye of 
 God no better. This is general only. It is particularly foretold 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>)

 that they shall be <I>gathered together as prisoners,</I> convicted 
 condemned prisoners, are <I>gathered in the pit,</I> or dungeon, and 
 there they shall <I>be shut up</I> under close confinement. The kings 
 and high ones, who took all possible liberty themselves, and took a 
 pride and pleasure in shutting up others, shall now be themselves shut 
 up. Let not the free man glory in his freedom, any more than the strong 
 man in his strength, for he knows not what restraints he is reserved 
 for. But <I>after many days they shall be visited,</I> either, 

 [1.] They shall be visited in wrath; it is the same word, in another 
 form, that is used

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 <I>the Lord shall punish</I> them; they shall be reserved to the day of 
 execution, as condemned prisoners are, and as fallen angels are 
 <I>reserved in chains of darkness to the judgment of the great day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:6">Jude 6</A>.

 Let this account for the delays of divine vengeance; sentence is not
 executed speedily, because execution-day has not yet come, and perhaps 
 will not come till after many days; but it is certain that the wicked 
 is reserved for the day of destruction, and is therefore preserved in 
 the mean time, but <I>shall be brought forth to the day of wrath,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:30">Job xxi. 30</A>.
 
 Let us therefore judge nothing before the time.

 [2.] They shall be visited in mercy, and be discharged from their 
 imprisonment, and shall again obtain, if not their dignity, yet their 
 liberty. Nebuchadnezzar, in his conquests, made many kings and princes
 his captives, and kept them in the dungeon in Babylon, and, among the 
 rest, Jehoiachin King of Judah; but after many days, when 
 Nebuchadnezzar's head was laid, his son visited them, and granted (as 
 should seem) some reviving to them all in their bondage; for it is made 
 an instance of his particular kindness to Jehoiachin that he <I>set his 
 throne above the throne of the rest of the kings that were with 
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:32">Jer. lii. 32</A>.

 If we apply this to the general state of mankind, it imports a
 revolution of conditions; those that were high are punished, those that 
 were punished are relieved, after many days, that none in this world 
 may be secure though their condition be ever so prosperous, nor any 
 despair though their condition be ever so deplorable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Glory to God in all this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 When all this comes to pass, when the proud enemies of God's church are 
 humbled and brought down, 

 (1.) Then it shall appear, beyond contradiction, that the Lord reigns,
 which is always true, but not always alike evident. When the kings of 
 the earth are punished for their tyranny and oppression, then it is 
 proclaimed and proved to all the world that God is King of kings--King 
 above them, by whom they are accountable--that he reigns as <I>Lord of 
 hosts,</I> of all hosts, of their hosts,--that he reigns <I>in Mount 
 Zion, and in Jerusalem,</I> in his church, for the honour and welfare 
 of that, pursuant to the promises on which that is founded, reigns in 
 his word and ordinances,--that he reigns <I>before his ancients,</I> 
 before all his saints, especially before his ministers, the elders of 
 his church, who have their eye upon all the out-goings of his power and 
 providence, and, in all these events, observe his hand. God's ancients, 
 the old disciples, the experienced Christians, that have often, when 
 they have been perplexed, gone into the sanctuary of God in Zion and 
 Jerusalem, and acquainted themselves with his manifestations of himself 
 there, shall see more than others of God's dominion and sovereignty in 
 these operations of his providence.

 (2.) Then it shall appear, beyond comparison, that he reigns
 <I>gloriously,</I> in such brightness and lustre that <I>the moon shall 
 be confounded and the sun ashamed,</I> as the smaller lights are 
 eclipsed and extinguished by the greater. Great men, who thought 
 themselves to have as bright a lustre and as vast a dominion as the sun 
 and moon, shall be ashamed when God appears above them, much more when 
 he appears against them. Then shall <I>their faces be filled with 
 shame,</I> that they may seek God's name. The eastern nations 
 worshipped the sun and moon; but, when God shall appear so gloriously 
 for his people against his and their enemies, all these pretended 
 deities shall be ashamed that ever they received the homage of their 
 deluded worshippers. The glory of the Creator infinitely outshines the 
 glory of the brightest creatures. In the great day, when the Judge of 
 heaven and earth shall shine forth in his glory, <I>the sun shall</I> 
 by his transcendent lustre <I>be turned into darkness and the moon into 
 blood.</I></P>
