 Johanan and the captains being strongly bent upon going into Egypt, 
 either their affections or politics advising them to take that course, 
 they had a great desire that God should direct them to do so too like 
 Balaam, who, when he was determined to go and curse Israel, asked God 
 leave. Here is, 

 I. The fair bargain that was made between Jeremiah and them about
 consulting God in this matter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+42:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. The message at large which God sent them, in answer to their
 enquiry, in which, 

 1. They are commanded and encouraged to continue in the land of Judah,
 and assured that if they did so it should be well with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+42:7-12">ver. 7-12</A>.
 
 2. They are forbidden to go to Egypt, and are plainly told that if
 they did it would be their ruin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+42:13-18">ver. 13-18</A>.

 3. They are charged with dissimulation in their asking what God's will
 was in this matter and disobedience when they were told what it was; 
 and sentence is accordingly passed upon them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+42:19-22">ver. 19-22</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of
 Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from
 the least even unto the greatest, came near,
 &nbsp; 2  And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our
 supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, <I>even</I> for all this remnant; (for we are left <I>but</I>
 a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us:)
 &nbsp; 3  That the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God may shew us the way wherein we may
 walk, and the thing that we may do.
 &nbsp; 4  Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard <I>you;</I>
 behold, I will pray unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God according to your
 words; and it shall come to pass, <I>that</I> whatsoever thing the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall answer you, I will declare <I>it</I> unto you; I will keep
 nothing back from you.
 &nbsp; 5  Then they said to Jeremiah, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> be a true and faithful
 witness between us, if we do not even according to all things for
 the which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God shall send thee to us.
 &nbsp; 6  Whether <I>it be</I> good, or whether <I>it be</I> evil, we will obey
 the voice of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God, to whom we send thee; that it may
 be well with us, when we obey the voice of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have reason to wonder how Jeremiah the prophet escaped the sword of 
 Ishmael; it seems he did escape, and it was not the first time that the 
 Lord hid him. It is strange also that in these violent turns he was not 
 consulted before now, and his advice asked and taken. But it should 
 seem as if they knew not that a prophet was among them. Though this 
 people were <I>as brands plucked out of the fire,</I> yet have they not 
 <I>returned to the Lord.</I> This people has a <I>revolting and a 
 rebellious heart;</I> and contempt of God and his providence, God and 
 his prophets, is still <I>the sin that most easily besets</I> them. But 
 now at length, to serve a turn, Jeremiah is sought out, and <I>all the 
 captains, Johanan</I> himself not excepted, with <I>all the people from 
 the least to the greatest,</I> make him a visit; they <I>came near</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+42:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 which intimates that hitherto they had kept at a distance from the 
 prophet and had been shy of him. Now here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They desire him by prayer to ask direction from God what they should 
 do in the present critical juncture, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+42:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 They express themselves wonderfully well. 

 1. With great respect to the prophet. Though he was poor and low, and
 under their command, yet they apply to him with humility and 
 submissiveness, as petitioners for his assistance, which yet they 
 intimate their own unworthiness of: <I>Let, we beseech thee, our 
 supplication be accepted before thee.</I> They compliment him thus in 
 hopes to persuade him to say as they would have him say. 

 2. With a great opinion of his interest in heaven: "<I>Pray for us,</I> 
 who know not how to pray for ourselves. <I>Pray to the Lord thy 
 God,</I> for we are unworthy to call him ours, nor have we reason to 
 expect any favour from him." 

 3. With a great sense of their need of divine direction. They speak of
 themselves as objects of compassion: "<I>We are but a remnant, but a 
 few of many;</I> how easily will such a remnant be swallowed up, and 
 yet it is a pity that it should. <I>Thy eyes</I> see what distress we 
 are in, what a plunge we are at; if thou canst do any thing, help us." 
 
 4. With desire of divine direction: "Let <I>the Lord thy God</I> take
 this ruin into his thoughts and under his hand, and <I>show us the way 
 wherein we may walk</I> and may expect to have his presence with us, 
 <I>and the thing that we may do,</I> the course we may take for our own 
 safety." Note, In every difficult doubtful case our eye must be up to 
 God for direction. They then might expect to be directed by a <I>spirit 
 of prophecy,</I> which has now ceased; but we may still in faith pray 
 to be guided by a <I>spirit of wisdom</I> in our hearts and the hints 
 of Providence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Jeremiah faithfully promises them to pray for direction for them, 
 and, whatever message God should send to them by him, he would deliver 
 it to them just as he received it without adding, altering, or 
 diminishing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+42:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Ministers may hence learn, 

 1. Conscientiously to pray for those who desire their prayers: <I>I
 will pray for you according to your words.</I> Though they had slighted 
 him, yet, like Samuel when he was slighted, he will not <I>sin against 
 the Lord in ceasing to pray for</I> them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+12:23">1 Sam. xii. 23</A>.

 2. Conscientiously to advise those who desire their advice as near as
 they can to the mind of God, not <I>keeping back any thing that is 
 profitable for them,</I> whether it be pleasing or no, but to 
 <I>declare to them the whole counsel of God,</I> that they may approve 
 themselves true to their trust.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They fairly promise that they will be governed by the will of God, 
 as soon as they know what it is 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+42:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>),

 and they had the impudence to appeal to God concerning their sincerity 
 herein, though at the same time they dissembled: "<I>The Lord be a true 
 and faithful witness between us;</I> do thou in the fear of God tell us 
 truly what his mind is and then we will in the fear of God comply with 
 it, and for this the Lord the Judge be Judge between us." Note, Those 
 that expect to have the benefit of good ministers' prayers must 
 conscientiously hearken to their preaching and be governed by it, as 
 far as it agrees with the mind of God. Nothing could be better than 
 this was: <I>Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey 
 the voice of the Lord our God, that it may be well with us.</I> 

 1. They now call God <I>their</I> God, for Jeremiah had encouraged them
 to call him so

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+42:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>I will pray to the Lord your God.</I> He is ours, and therefore 
 <I>we will obey his voice.</I> Our relation to God strongly obliges us 
 to obedience. 

 2. They promise to <I>obey his voice</I> because they sent the prophet 
 to him to consult him. Note, We do not truly desire to know the mind of 
 God if we do not fully resolve to comply with it when we do know it. 

 3. It is an implicit universal obedience that they here promise. They
 will do what God appoints them to do, <I>whether it be good or whether 
 it be evil:</I> "Though it may seem evil to us, yet we will believe 
 that if God command it it is certainly good, and we must not dispute 
 it, but do it. Whatever God commands, whether it be easy or difficult, 
 agreeable to our inclinations or contrary to them, whether it be cheap 
 or costly, fashionable or unfashionable, whether we get or lose by it 
 in our worldly interests, if it be our duty, we will do it." 

 4. It is upon a very good consideration that they promise this, a
 reasonable and powerful one, <I>that it may be well with us,</I> which 
 intimates a conviction that they could not expect it should be well 
 with them upon any other terms.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 came unto Jeremiah.
 &nbsp; 8  Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the
 captains of the forces which <I>were</I> with him, and all the people
 from the least even to the greatest,
 &nbsp; 9  And said unto them, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the God of Israel,
 unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him;
 &nbsp; 10  If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you,
 and not pull <I>you</I> down, and I will plant you, and not pluck
 <I>you</I> up: for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you.
 &nbsp; 11  Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid;
 be not afraid of him, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: for I <I>am</I> with you to save
 you, and to deliver you from his hand.
 &nbsp; 12  And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have mercy
 upon you, and cause you to return to your own land.
 &nbsp; 13  But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey
 the voice of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God,
 &nbsp; 14  Saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we
 shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have
 hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:
 &nbsp; 15  And now therefore hear the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, ye remnant of
 Judah; Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, the God of Israel; If ye
 wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn
 there;
 &nbsp; 16  Then it shall come to pass, <I>that</I> the sword, which ye
 feared, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the
 famine, whereof ye were afraid, shall follow close after you
 there in Egypt; and there ye shall die.
 &nbsp; 17  So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go
 into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the
 famine, and by the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or
 escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.
 &nbsp; 18  For thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine
 anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of
 Jerusalem; so shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when ye
 shall enter into Egypt: and ye shall be an execration, and an
 astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this
 place no more.
 &nbsp; 19  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go
 ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you this
 day.
 &nbsp; 20  For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God, saying, Pray for us unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God; and
 according unto all that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God shall say, so declare
 unto us, and we will do <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 21  And <I>now</I> I have this day declared <I>it</I> to you; but ye have
 not obeyed the voice of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God, nor any <I>thing</I> for
 the which he hath sent me unto you.
 &nbsp; 22  Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword,
 by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye
 desire to go <I>and</I> to sojourn.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the answer which Jeremiah was sent to deliver to those who 
 employed him to ask counsel of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It did not come immediately, not till <I>ten days after,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+42:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 They were thus long held in suspense, perhaps, to punish them for their 
 hypocrisy or to show that Jeremiah did not speak of himself, nor what 
 he would, for he could not speak when he would, but must wait for 
 instructions. However, it teaches us to continue waiting upon God for 
 direction in our way. <I>The vision is for an appointed time, and at 
 the end it shall speak.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. When it did come he delivered it publicly, both to the 
 <I>captains</I> and to all the <I>people,</I> from the meanest to those 
 in the highest station; he delivered it fully and faithfully as he 
 received it, as he had promised that he would keep nothing back from 
 them. If Jeremiah had been to direct them by his own prudence, perhaps 
 he could not have told what to advise them to, the case was so 
 difficult; but what he has to advise is what <I>the Lord the God of 
 Israel saith,</I> to whom they had sent him, and therefore they were 
 bound in honour and duty to observe it. And this he tells them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That it is the will of God that they should stay where they are, and 
 his promise that, if they do so, it shall undoubtedly be <I>well with 
 them</I> he would have them still to <I>abide in this land,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+42:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 Their brethren were forced out of it into captivity, and this was their 
 affliction; let those therefore count it a mercy that they may stay in 
 it and a duty to stay in it. Let those whose lot is in Canaan never 
 quit it while they can keep it. It would have been enough to oblige 
 them if God had only said, "I charge you upon your allegiance to 
 <I>abide still in the land;</I>" but he rather persuades them to it as 
 a friend than commands it as a prince. 

 (1.) He expresses a very tender concern for them in their present
 calamitous condition: <I>It repenteth me of the evil that I have done 
 unto you.</I> Though they had shown small sign of their repenting of 
 their sins, yet God, as one <I>grieved for the misery of Israel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:16">Judg. x. 16</A>),

 begins to repent of the judgments he had brought upon them for their
 sins. Not that he changed his mind, but he was very ready to change his 
 way and to return in mercy to them. God's time to repent himself 
 concerning his servants is when he sees that, as here, their strength 
 is gone, and <I>there is none shut up or left,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:36">Deut. xxxii. 36</A>.

 (2.) He answers the argument they had against abiding in this land.
 <I>They feared the king of Babylon</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+41:18"><I>ch.</I> xli. 18</A>),

 lest he should come and avenge the death of Gedaliah upon them, though
 they were no way accessory to it, nay, had witnessed against it. The 
 surmise was foreign and unreasonable; but, if there had been any ground 
 for it, enough is here said to remove it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+42:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 "<I>Be not afraid of the king of Babylon,</I> though he is a man of 
 great might and little mercy, and a very arbitrary prince, whose will 
 is a law, and therefore you are afraid he will upon this pretence, 
 though without colour of reason, take advantage against you; <I>be not 
 afraid of him,</I> for that fear will bring a snare: fear not him, for 
 <I>I am with you;</I> and, if God be for you to save you, who can be 
 against you to hurt you?" Thus has God provided to obviate and silence 
 even the causeless fears of his people, which discourage them in the 
 way of their duty; there is enough in the promises to encourage them.
 
 (3.) He assures them that if they will still abide in this land they
 shall not only be safe from the king of Babylon, but be made happy by 
 the King of kings: "<I>I will build you and plant you;</I> you shall 
 take root again, and be the new foundation of another state, a 
 phoenix-kingdom, rising out of the ashes of the last." It is added 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+42:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 <I>I will show mercies unto you.</I> Note, In all our comforts we may 
 read God's mercies. God will show them mercy in this, that not only the 
 king of Babylon shall not destroy them, but he shall <I>have mercy upon 
 them</I> and help to settle them. Note, Whatever kindness men do us we 
 must attribute it to God's kindness. He makes those whom he pities to 
 be pitied even by <I>those who carried them captives,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:46">Ps. xvi. 46</A>.
 
 "The king of Babylon, having now the disposal of the country, shall
 <I>cause you to return it to your own land,</I> shall settle you again 
 in your own habitations and put you in possession of the lands that 
 formerly belonged to you." Note, God has made that our duty which is 
 really our privilege, and our obedience will be its own recompence.
 "<I>Abide in this land,</I> and it shall be your own land again and you 
 shall continue in it. Do not quit it now that you stand so fair for the 
 enjoyment of it again. Be no so unwise as to <I>forsake your own 
 mercies</I> for <I>lying vanities.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That as they tender the favour of God and their own happiness they 
 must by no means think of going into Egypt, not thither of all places, 
 not to that land out of which God had delivered their fathers and which 
 he had so often warned them not to make alliance with nor to put 
 confidence in. Observe here, 

 (1.) The sin they are supposed to be guilty of (and to him that knew
 their hearts it was more than a supposition): "You begin to say, <I>We 
 will not dwell in this land</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+42:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 we will never think that we can be safe in it, no, not though God 
 himself undertake our protection. We will not continue in it, no, not 
 <I>in obedience to the voice of the Lord our God.</I> He may say what 
 he please, but we will do what we please. We will <I>go into the land 
 of Egypt,</I> and <I>there will we dwell,</I> whether God give us leave 
 and go along with us or no," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+42:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 It is supposed that their hearts were upon it: "<I>If you wholly set 
 your faces to enter into Egypt,</I> and are obstinately resolved that 
 you will go and <I>sojourn there,</I> though God oppose you in it both 
 by his word and by his providence, then take what follows." Now the 
 reason they go upon in this resolution is that "<I>in Egypt we shall 
 see no war, nor have hunger of bread,; as we have had for a long time 
 in this land," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+42:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Note, It is folly to quit our place, especially to quit the holy land, 
 because we meet with trouble in it; but greater folly to think by 
 changing our place to escape the judgments of God, and that evil which 
 pursues sinners in every way of disobedience, and which there is no 
 escaping but by returning to our allegiance. 

 (2.) The sentence passed upon them for this sin, if they will persist
 in it. It is pronounced in God's name

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+42:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 "Hear the word of the Lord, you remnant of Judah,</I> who think that 
 because you are a remnant you must be spared of course 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+42:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)

 and indulged in your own humour." 

 [1.] Did the sword and famine frighten them? Those very judgments shall
 pursue them into Egypt, shall overtake them, and overcome them there

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+42:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>):

 "You think, because war and famine have long been raging in this land, 
 that they are entailed upon it; whereas, if you trust in God, he can 
 make even this land a land of peace to you; you think they are confined 
 to it, and, if you can get clear of this land, you shall get out of the 
 reach of them, but God will send them after you wherever you go." Note, 
 the evils we think to escape by sin we certainly and inevitably run 
 ourselves upon. The men that go to Egypt in contradiction to God's
 will, to escape <I>the sword and famine,</I> shall <I>die in Egypt by 
 sword and famine.</I> We may apply it to the common calamities of human 
 life; those that are impatient of them, and think to avoid them by 
 changing their place, will find that they are deceived and that they do 
 not at all better themselves. The grievances common to men will meet 
 them wherever they go. All our removes in this world are but from one 
 wilderness to another; still we are where we were. 

 [2.] Did the desolations of Jerusalem frighten them? Were they willing
 to get as far as they could from them? They shall meet with the second 
 part of them too in Egypt

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+42:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>As my anger and fury have been poured out</I> here upon Jerusalem, 
 so they shall be <I>poured out upon you in Egypt.</I> Note, Those that 
 have by sin made God their enemy will find him a consuming fire 
 wherever they go. And then you shall be <I>an execration and an 
 astonishment.</I> The Hebrews were of old an abomination to the 
 Egyptians 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+43:32">Gen. xliii. 32</A>),

 and now they shall be made more so than ever. When God's professing
 people mingle with infidels, and make their court to them, they lose 
 their dignity and make themselves a reproach.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That God knew their hypocrisy in their enquiries of him, and that 
 when they asked what he would have them to do they were resolved to 
 take their own way; and therefore the sentence which was before 
 pronounced conditionally is made absolute. Having set before them good 
 and evil, the blessing and the curse, in the close he makes application 
 of what he had said. And here, 

 (1.) He solemnly protests that he had faithfully delivered his message,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+42:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 The conclusion of the whole matter is, "<I>Go not down into Egypt;</I> 
 you disobey the command of God if you do, and what I have said to you 
 will be a witness against you; for <I>know certainly</I> that, 
 <I>whether you will hear or whether you will forbear,</I> I have 
 plainly <I>admonished you;</I> you cannot now plead ignorance of the 
 mind of God." 

 (2.) He charges them with base dissimulation in the application they
 made to him for divine direction

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+42:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 "<I>You dissembled in your hearts;</I> you professed one thing and 
 intended another, promising what you never meant to perform." <I>You 
 have used deceit against your soul</I> (so the margin reads it); for 
 those that think to put a cheat upon God will prove in the end to have 
 put a damning cheat upon themselves. 

 (3.) He is already aware that they are determined to go contrary to the
 command of God; probably they discovered it in their countenance and 
 secret mutterings already, before he had finished his discourse. 
 However, he spoke from him who knew their hearts: "<I>You have not 
 obeyed the voice of the Lord your God;</I> you have not a disposition 
 to obey it." Thus Moses, in the close of his farewell sermon, had told 
 them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:27,29">Deut. xxxi. 27, 29</A>),

 <I>I know thy rebellion and thy stiff neck,</I> and <I>that you will
 corrupt yourselves.</I> Admire the patience of God, that he is pleased 
 to speak to those who, he knows, will not regard him, and deal with 
 those who, he knows, will <I>deal very treacherously,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:8">Isa. xlviii. 8</A>.

 (4.) He therefore reads them their doom, ratifying what he had said
 before: <I>Know certainly that you shall die by the sword,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+42:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 God's threatenings may be vilified, but cannot be nullified, by the 
 unbelief of man. <I>Famine and pestilence</I> shall pursue these 
 sinners; for there is no place privileged from divine arrests, nor can 
 any malefactors go out of God's jurisdiction. <I>You shall die in the 
 place whither you desire to go.</I> Note, We know not what is good for 
 ourselves; and that often proves afflictive, and sometimes fatal, which 
 we are most fond of and have our hearts most set upon.</P>
