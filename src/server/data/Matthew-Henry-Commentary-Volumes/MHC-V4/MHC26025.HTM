 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Judgment began at the house of God, and therefore with them the 
 prophets began, who were the judges; but it must not end there, and 
 therefore they must not. Ezekiel had finished his testimony which 
 related to the destruction of Jerusalem. As to that he was ordered to 
 say no more, but stand upon his watch-tower and wait the issue; and yet 
 he must not be silent; there are divers nations bordering upon the land 
 of Israel, which he must prophesy against, as Isaiah and Jeremiah had 
 done before; and must proclaim God's controversy with them, chiefly for 
 the injuries and indignities which they had done to the people of God 
 in the day of their calamity. In this chapter we have his prophecy, 

 I. Against the Ammonites,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 II. Against the Moabites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:8-11">ver. 8-11</A>.

 III. Against the Edomites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:11-14">ver. 11-14</A>.

 IV. Against the Philistines, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:15-17">ver. 15-17</A>.

 That which is laid to the charge of each of them is their barbarous and 
 insolent conduct towards God's Israel, for which God threatens to put 
 the same cup of trembling into their hand. God's resenting it thus
 would be an encouragement to Israel to believe that though he had dealt 
 thus severely with them yet he had not cast them off, but would still 
 own them and plead their cause.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came again unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy
 against them;
 &nbsp; 3  And say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>;
 Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Because thou saidst, Aha, against my
 sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel,
 when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they
 went into captivity;
 &nbsp; 4  Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east
 for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee, and
 make their dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit, and they
 shall drink thy milk.
 &nbsp; 5  And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites
 a couching-place for flocks: and ye shall know that I <I>am</I> the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 6  For thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Because thou hast clapped
 <I>thine</I> hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart
 with all thy despite against the land of Israel;
 &nbsp; 7  Behold, therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and
 will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee
 off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the
 countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I <I>am</I>
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. The prophet is ordered to address himself to the Ammonites, in the 
 name of <I>the Lord Jehovah</I> the <I>God of Israel,</I> who is also 
 the God of the whole earth. But what can Chemosh, the god of the 
 children of Ammon, say, in answer to it? He is bidden to <I>set his
 face against the Ammonites,</I> for he is God's representative as a 
 prophet, and thus he must signify that God <I>set his face against 
 them,</I> for <I>the face of the Lord is against those that do 
 evil,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:16">Ps. xxxiv. 16</A>.

 He must speak with boldness and assurance, as one that knew whose
 errand he went upon, and that he should be borne out in delivering it. 
 He must therefore <I>set his face as a flint,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:7">Isa. i. 7</A>.

 He must show his displeasure against these proud enemies of Israel, and
 face them down, though they were very impudent, and thus must show 
 that, though he had prophesied so much and so long <I>against 
 Israel,</I> yet still he was for Israel, and, while he witnessed 
 against their corruptions, he adhered to and gloried in God's covenant 
 with them. Note, Those are miserable that have the preaching and
 praying of God's prophets against them, against whom their faces are 
 set.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He is directed what to say to them. Ezekiel is now a captive in 
 Babylon, and has been so many years, and knows little of the state of 
 his own nation, much less of the nations that were about it; but God 
 tells him both what they were doing and what he was about to do with 
 them. And thus by the spirit of prophecy he is enabled to speak as 
 pertinently to their case as if he had been among them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He must upbraid the Ammonites with their insolent and barbarous 
 triumphs over the people of Israel in their calamities, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 The Ammonites said, when all went against the Jews, <I>Aha! so would we 
 have it.</I> They were glad to see, 

 (1.) The temple burned, <I>the sanctuary profaned</I> by the victorious 
 Chaldeans. This is put first, to intimate what was the cause of the 
 controversy; they had an enmity to the Jews for the sake of their 
 religion, though it was only some poor remains of the profession of it 
 that were to be found among them.

 (2.) The nation ruined. They rejoiced when <I>the land of Israel was 
 made desolate,</I> the cities burnt, the country wasted, and both 
 depopulated, and when the house of <I>Judah went into captivity.</I> 
 When they had not power to oppress God's Israel themselves they were 
 pleased to see the Chaldeans oppress them, partly because they envied 
 their wealth and the good land they enjoyed, partly because they feared 
 their growing power, and partly because they hated their religion and 
 the divine oracles they were favoured with. It is repeated again

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>They clapped with their hands,</I> to irritate the rage of the 
 Chaldeans, and to set them on as dogs upon the game; or they clapped 
 their hands in triumph, attended this tragedy with their 
 <I>Plaudite--Give us your applause,</I> thinking it well acted; never 
 was there any thing more diverting or entertaining to them. They 
 <I>stamped with their feet,</I> ready to leap and dance for joy upon 
 this occasion; they not only <I>rejoiced in heart,</I> but they could 
 not forbear showing it, though every one that had any sense of honour 
 and humanity would cry shame upon them for it, especially considering 
 that they rejoiced thus, not for any thing they got by Israel's fall 
 (if so, they would have been the more excusable: most people are for 
 themselves); but this as purely from a principle of malice and enmity: 
 <I>Thou hast rejoiced in heart with all thy despite</I> (which 
 signifies both scorn and hatred) <I>against the land of Israel.</I> 
 Note, The people of God have always had a great deal of ill-will borne 
 them by this wicked world; and their calamities have been their 
 neighbours' entertainments. See to what unnatural instances of malice 
 the enmity that is in the seed of the serpent against the seed of the 
 woman will carry them. The Ammonites, of all people, should not have 
 rejoiced in Jerusalem's ruin, but should rather have trembled, because 
 they themselves had such a narrow escape at the same time; it was but 
 "cross or pile" [the toss of a halfpenny] which should be besieged 
 first, Rabbath or Jerusalem,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:20"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 20</A>.

 And they had reason to think that the king of Babylon would set upon
 them next. But thus were their hearts hardened to their ruin, and their 
 insolence against Jerusalem was to them an <I>evident token of 
 perdition,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:28">Phil. i. 28</A>.

 It is a very wicked thing to be glad at the calamities of any,
 especially of God's people, and a sin that God will surely reckon for; 
 such delight has God in showing mercy, and so backward is he to punish, 
 that nothing is more pleasing to him than to be stopped in the ways of 
 his judgments by intercessions, not any thing more provoking than to 
 <I>help forward the affliction</I> when he is but <I>a little 
 displeased,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:15">Zech. i. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He must threaten the Ammonites with utter ruin for this insolence 
 which they were guilty of. God turns away his wrath from Israel against 
 them, as is said, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+24:17,18">Prov. xxiv. 17, 18</A>.

 God is jealous for his people's honour, because his own is so nearly 
 interested in it. And therefore those that touch that shall be made to 
 know that they touch the apple of his eye. He had before predicted the 
 destruction of the Ammonites,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:28"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 28</A>.

 Had they repented, that would have been revoked; but now it is 
 ratified.

 (1.) A destroying enemy is brought against them: <I>I will
 deliver thee to the men of the east,</I> first to the Chaldeans, who 
 came from the north-east, and whose army, under the command of 
 Nebuchadnezzar, destroyed the country of the Ammonites, about five 
 years after the destruction of Jerusalem (as Josephus relates, 
 <I>Antiq.</I> 10.181), and then to the Arabians, who were properly the 
 <I>children of the east,</I> who, when the Chaldeans had made the 
 country desolate, and quitted it, came and took possession of it for 
 themselves, probably with the consent of the conquerors. Shepherds' 
 tents were their palaces; these they set up in the country of the 
 Ammonites; there they <I>made their dwellings,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 They enjoyed the products of the country: <I>They shall eat thy fruit 
 and drink thy milk;</I> and the milk from the cattle is the fruit of 
 the ground at second-hand. They made use even of the royal city for 
 their cattle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>I will make Rabbath,</I> that was a nice and splendid city, to be 
 <I>a stable for camels;</I> for its new masters, whose wealth lies all 
 in cattle, will not think they can put the palaces of Rabbath to a 
 better use. Rabbath had been a habitation of brutish men; justly 
 therefore is it now made a <I>stable for camels</I> and the country a 
 <I>couching-lace for flocks,</I> more innocent beasts than those with 
 which it had been before replenished. 

 (2.) God himself acts as an enemy to them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>I will stretch out my hand upon thee,</I> a hand that will reach far 
 and strike home, which there is no resisting the blow of, for it is a 
 mighty hand, nor bearing the weight of, for it is a heavy hand. God's 
 hand stretched out against the Ammonites will not only deliver them 
 <I>for a spoil to the heathen,</I> so that all their neighbours shall 
 prey upon them, but will <I>cut them off from the people</I> and 
 <I>made them perish out of the countries,</I> so that there shall be no 
 remains of them in that place. Compare with this,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:1">Jer. xlix. 1</A>,

 &c. What can sound more terrible than that resolution 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 <I>I will destroy thee?</I> For the almighty God is able both <I>to 
 save and to destroy,</I> and it is <I>a fearful thing to fall into his 
 hands.</I> Both the threatenings here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:5,7"><I>v.</I> 5 and <I>v.</I> 7</A>)

 conclude with this, <I>You shall know that I am the Lord.</I> For, 

 [1.] Thus God will maintain his own honour, and will make it appear 
 that he is the God of Israel, though he suffers them for a time to be 
 captives in Babylon.

 [2.] Thus he will bring those that were strangers to him into an 
 acquaintance with him, and it will be a blessed effect of their 
 calamities. Better know God and be poor than be rich and ignorant of 
 him.</P>

 people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger

 the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 15  Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Because the Philistines have dealt
 by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to
 destroy <I>it</I> for the old hatred;
 &nbsp; 16  Therefore thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Behold, I will stretch
 out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the
 Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.
 &nbsp; 17  And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious
 rebukes; and they shall know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, when I shall
 lay my vengeance upon them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Three more of Israel's ill-natured neighbours are here arraigned, 
 convicted, and condemned to destruction, for contributing to and 
 triumphing in Jerusalem's fall.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The Moabites. Seir, which was the seat of the Edomites, is joined 
 with them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 because they said the same as the Moabites; but they were afterwards 
 reckoned with by themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What was the sin of the Moabites; they said, <I>Behold, the house of 
 Judah is like unto all the heathen.</I> They triumphed, 

 (1.) In the apostasies of Israel, were please to see them forsake their 
 God and worship idols, and hoped that in a while their religion would 
 be quite lost and forgotten and the <I>house of Judah</I> would be 
 <I>like all the heathen,</I> perfect idolaters. When those that profess 
 religion walk unworthy of their profession they encourage the enemies 
 of religion to hope that it will in time sink, and be run down, and 
 quite abandoned; but let the Moabites know that, though there are those 
 of the house of Judah who have made themselves <I>like the heathen,</I> 
 yet there is a remnant that retain their integrity, the religion of the 
 house of Judah shall recover itself, its peculiarities shall be 
 preserved, it shall not lose itself <I>among the heathen,</I> but 
 distinguish itself from them, till it deliver itself honourably into a 
 better institution. 

 (2.) In the calamities of Israel. They said, "<I>The house of Judah is
 like all the heathen,</I> in as bad a state as they; their God is no 
 more able to deliver them from this <I>overflowing scourge</I> of these 
 parts of the world than the gods of the heathen are to deliver them. 
 Where are the promises they gloried in and all the wonders which they 
 and their fathers told us of? What the better are they for the covenant 
 of peculiarity, upon which they so much valued themselves? Those that 
 looked with so much scorn upon <I>all the heathen</I> are now set upon 
 a level with them, or rather sunk below them." Note, Those who judge 
 only by outward appearance are ready to conclude that the people of God 
 have lost all their privileges when they have lost their worldly 
 prosperity, which does not follow, for good men, even in affliction, in 
 captivity among the heathen, have graces and comforts within sufficient 
 to distinguish them from all the heathen. Though the event seem one to 
 the <I>righteous and wicked,</I> yet indeed it is vastly different.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What should be the punishment of Moab for this sin; because they 
 triumphed in the overthrow of Judah, their country shall be in like 
 manner overthrown with that of the Ammonites, who were guilty of the 
 same sin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>):

 "<I>I will open the side of Moab,</I> will uncover its shoulder, will 
 take away all its defences, that it may become an easy prey to any that 
 will make a prey of it." 

 (1.) See here how it shall be exposed; the frontier-towns, that were 
 its strength and guard, shall be demolished by the Chaldean forces, and 
 laid open. Some of the cities are here named, which are said to be 
 <I>the glory of the country,</I> which they trusted in, and boasted of 
 as impregnable; these shall decay, be deserted, or betrayed, or fall 
 into the enemies' hands, so that Moab shall lie exposed, and whoever 
 will may penetrate into the heart of the country. Note, Those who glory 
 in any other defence and protection than that of the divine power, 
 providence, and promise, will sooner or later see cause to be ashamed 
 of their glorying. 

 (2.) See here to whom it shall be exposed: <I>The men of the east,</I> 
 when they come to take possession of the country of the Ammonites, 
 shall seize that of the Moabites too. God, the Lord of all lands, will 
 give them that land; for the kingdoms of men he gives to whomsoever he 
 will. The Arabians, who are shepherds, and live quietly, plain men 
 dwelling in tents, shall by an overruling Providence be put in 
 possession of the land of the Moabites, who are soldiers, men of war, 
 and cunning hunters, that live turbulently. The Chaldeans shall get it 
 by war, and the Arabians shall enjoy it in peace. Concerning the 
 Ammonites it is said, They shall no <I>more be remembered among the 
 nations</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 for they had been accessory to the murder of Gedaliah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+40:14">Jer. xl. 14</A>.

 But of the Moabites it is said, <I>I will execute judgments upon
 Moab;</I> they shall feel the weight of God's displeasure, but perhaps 
 not to that degree that the Ammonites shall; however, so far as that 
 <I>they shall know that I am the Lord,</I> that the God of Israel is a 
 God of power, and that his covenant with his people is not broken.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The Edomites, the posterity of Esau, between whom and Jacob there 
 had been an old enmity. And here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The sin of the Edomites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 They not only triumphed in the ruin of Judah and Jerusalem, as the 
 Moabites and Ammonites had done, but they took advantage from the 
 present distressed state to which the Jews were reduced to do them some 
 real mischiefs, probably made inroads upon their frontiers and 
 plundered their country: <I>Edom has dealt against the house of Judah 
 by taking vengeance.</I> The Edomites had of old been tributaries to 
 the Jews, according to the sentence that the elder should serve the 
 younger. In Jehoram's time they revolted. Amaziah severely chastised 
 them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:7">2 Kings xiv. 7</A>),

 and for this they <I>took vengeance.</I> Now they would pay off all the
 old scores, and not only incensed the Babylonians against Jerusalem, 
 crying, <I>Rase it, rase it</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:7">Ps. cxxxvii. 7</A>),

 but cut <I>off those that escaped,</I> as we find in the prophecy of
 Obadiah, which is wholly directed against Edom,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>,

 &c. It is called here <I>revenging a revenge,</I> which intimates that
 they were not only eager upon it, but very cruel in it, and recompensed 
 to the Jews more than double. "Herein he <I>has greatly offended.</I>" 
 Note, It is a great offence to God for us to revenge ourselves upon our 
 brother; for God has said, <I>Vengeance is mine.</I> We are forbidden 
 to <I>revenge</I> or to <I>bear a grudge.</I> Suppose Judah had been 
 hard upon Edom formerly, it was a base thing for the Edomites now, in 
 revenge for it, <I>to smite them secretly.</I> But the Jews had a 
 divine warrant to reign over the Edomites, for that therefore they 
 ought not to have made reprisals; and it was the more disingenuous for 
 them to retain the old enmity when God had particularly commanded his 
 people to forget it. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:7">Deut. xxiii. 7</A>,

 <I>Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The judgments threatened against them for this sin. God will take 
 them to task for it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>I will stretch out my hand upon Edom</I> Their country shall be 
 desolate <I>from Teman,</I> which lay in the south part of it; and 
 <I>they shall fall by the sword unto Dedan,</I> which lay north; the 
 desolations of war should go through the nation. 

 (1.) They had taken vengeance, and therefore God will <I>lay his 
 vengeance</I> upon them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>They shall know my vengeance.</I> Those that will not leave it to 
 God to take vengeance for them may expect that he will take vengeance 
 on them; and those that will not believe and fear his vengeance shall 
 be made to know and feel his vengeance; they shall be dealt with 
 <I>according to God's anger</I> and <I>according to his fury,</I> not 
 according to the weakness of the instruments that are employed in it, 
 but according to the strength of the arm that employs them. 

 (2.) They had taken vengeance on Israel, and God will lay his vengeance
 on them <I>by the hand of his people Israel.</I> They suffered much by 
 the Chaldeans, which seems to be referred to, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:8">Jer. xlix. 8</A>.

 But besides that there were <I>saviours</I> to come <I>upon Mount
 Zion,</I> who should judge the mount of Esau

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:21">Obad. 21</A>),

 and Israel's Redeemer comes <I>with dyed garments from Bozrah</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:1">Isa. lxiii. 1</A>),

 this implies a promise that Israel should recover itself again to such
 a degree as to be in a capacity of curbing the insolence of its 
 neighbours. And we find 
 
 (<U>1 Mac. v. 3</U>)

 that <I>Judas Maccabeus fought against the children of Esau in Idumea,
 gave them a great overthrow, abated their courage, and took their 
 spoil;</I> and Josephus says (<I>Antiq.</I> 13.257), that Hircanus made 
 the Edomites tributaries to Israel. Note, The equity of God's judgments 
 is to be observed when he not only avenges injuries upon those that did 
 them, but by those against whom they were done.</P>

 III. The Philistines. And, 

 1. Their sin is much the same with that of the Edomites: They have
 <I>dealt by revenge</I> with the people of Israel, and have <I>taken 
 vengeance with a despiteful heart,</I> not to disturb them only, but to 
 <I>destroy them,</I> for <I>the old hatred</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 the old grudge they bore them, or (as the margin reads it) <I>with 
 perpetual hatred,</I> a hatred that began long since and which they 
 resolved to continue. The anger was implacable: they <I>dealt by 
 revenge,</I> traded in the acts of malice; it was their constant 
 practice, and their heart, their spiteful heart, was upon it.

 2. Their punishment likewise is much the same,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Those that were for destroying God's people shall themselves be cut off 
 and destroyed; and 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>)

 those that were for avenging themselves shall find that God will 
 <I>execute great vengeance upon them.</I> This was fulfilled when that 
 country was wasted by the Chaldean army, not long after the destruction 
 of Jerusalem, which is foretold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+47:1-7">Jer. xlvii</A>.

 It was strange that these nations, which bordered upon the land of
 Israel, were not alarmed by the success of the Chaldean army, and made 
 to tremble in the apprehension of their own danger; when their 
 neighbour's house was on fire it was time to look to their own; but 
 their impiety and malice made them forget their politics, till God by 
 his judgments convinced them that the cup was going round, and they 
 were the less safe for being secure.</P>
