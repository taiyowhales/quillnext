 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet in this chapter (according to the directions given him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:10,11"><I>ch.</I> iii. 10, 11</A>)

 saith to the righteous, It shall be well with thee, but Woe to the
 wicked, it shall be ill with him. Here are,

 I. Gracious promises to those that adhere to the law and to the
 testimony; while those that seek to familiar spirits shall be driven
 into darkness and dimness, they shall see a great light, relief in the
 midst of their distresses, typical of gospel grace.

 1. In the doctrine of the Messiah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 2. His victories,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:4,5">ver. 4, 5</A>.

 3. His government and dominion as Immanuel,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>.

 II. Dreadful threatenings against the people of Israel, who had 
 revolted from and were enemies to the house of David, that they should 
 be brought to utter ruin, that their pride should bring them down 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:8-10">ver. 8-10</A>),

 that their neighbours should make a prey of them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:11,12">ver. 11, 12</A>),

 that, for their impenitence and hypocrisy, all their ornaments and 
 supports should be cut off 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:13-17">ver. 13-17</A>),

 and that by the wrath of God against them, and their wrath one against 
 another, they should be brought to utter ruin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:18-21">ver. 18-21</A>.

 And this is typical of the final destruction of all the enemies of the 
 Son of David and his kingdom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Nevertheless the dimness <I>shall</I> not <I>be</I> such as <I>was</I> in
 her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of
 Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more
 grievously afflict <I>her by</I> the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in
 Galilee of the nations.
 &nbsp; 2  The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light:
 they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them
 hath the light shined.
 &nbsp; 3  Thou hast multiplied the nation, <I>and</I> not increased the joy:
 they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, <I>and</I> as
 <I>men</I> rejoice when they divide the spoil.
 &nbsp; 4  For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of
 his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian.
 &nbsp; 5  For every battle of the warrior <I>is</I> with confused noise, and
 garments rolled in blood; but <I>this</I> shall be with burning <I>and</I>
 fuel of fire.
 &nbsp; 6  For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the
 government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be
 called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting
 Father, The Prince of Peace.
 &nbsp; 7  Of the increase of <I>his</I> government and peace <I>there shall
 be</I> no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to
 order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from
 henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts will
 perform this.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The first words of this chapter plainly refer to the close of the
 foregoing chapter, where every thing looked black and melancholy:
 <I>Behold, trouble, and darkness, and dimness</I>--very bad, yet not so
 bad but that <I>to the upright there shall arise light in the
 darkness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:4">Ps. cxii. 4</A>)

 and <I>at evening time it shall be light,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:7">Zech. xiv. 7</A>.

 <I>Nevertheless it shall not be such dimness</I> (either not such for
 kind or not such for degree) as sometimes there has been. Note, In the
 worst of times God's people have a <I>nevertheless</I> to comfort 
 themselves with, something to allay and balance their troubles; they 
 are persecuted, but not forsaken

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:9">2 Cor. iv. 9</A>),

 sorrowful yet always rejoicing,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:10">2 Cor. vi. 10</A>.

 And it is matter of comfort to us, when things are at the darkest, that
 he who <I>forms the light and creates the darkness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:7"><I>ch.</I> xlv. 7</A>)

 has appointed to both their bounds and set the one over against the
 other, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:4">Gen. iv. 4</A>.

 He can say, "Hitherto the dimness shall go, so long it shall last, and
 no further, no longer." </P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Three things are here promised, and they all point ultimately at the 
 grace of the gospel, which the saints then were to comfort themselves 
 with the hopes of in every cloudy and dark day, as we now are to 
 comfort ourselves in time of trouble with the hopes of Christ's second 
 coming, though that be now, as his first coming then was, a thing at a 
 great distance. The mercy likewise which God has in store for his 
 church in the latter days may be a support to those that are mourning 
 with her for her present calamities. We have here the promise,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Of a glorious light, which shall so qualify, and by degrees dispel, 
 the dimness, that it shall not be as it sometimes has been: <I>Not such 
 as was in her vexation;</I> there shall not be such dark times as were 
 formerly, <I>when at first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and 
 Naphtali</I> (which lay remote and most exposed to the inroads of the 
 neighbouring enemies), <I>and afterwards he more grievously afflicted 
 the land by the way of the sea and beyond Jordan</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 referring probably to those days when <I>God began to cut Israel 
 short</I> and to <I>smite them in all their coasts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:32">2 Kings x. 32</A>.
 
 Note, God tries what less judgments will do with a people before he
 brings greater; but if a light affliction do not do its work with us, 
 to humble and reform us, we must expect to be afflicted more 
 grievously; for when God judges he will overcome. Well, those were dark 
 times with the land of Zebulun and Naphtali, and there was <I>dimness 
 of anguish in Galilee of the Gentiles,</I> both in respect of ignorance 
 (they did not speak according <I>to the law and the testimony,</I> and 
 then there was <I>no light in them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:20"><I>ch.</I> viii. 20</A>)

 and in respect of trouble, and the desperate posture of their outward
 affairs; we have both together, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:3,5">2 Chron. xv. 3, 5</A>.

 <I>Israel has been without the true God and a teaching priest, and in
 those times there was no peace.</I> But the dimness threatened

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:22"><I>ch.</I> viii. 22</A>)

 shall not prevail to such a degree; for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)

 <I>the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light.</I> 

 (1.) At this time when the prophet lived, there were many prophets in 
 Judah and Israel, whose prophecies were a great light both for 
 direction and comfort to the people of God, who adhered to the law and 
 the testimony. Besides the written word, they had prophecy; there were
 those that had shown them how long 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:9">Ps. lxxiv. 9</A>),

 which was a great satisfaction to them, when in respect of their
 outward troubles they <I>sat in darkness, and dwelt in the land of the 
 shadow of death.</I>

 (2.) This was to have its full accomplishment when our Lord Jesus began
 to appear as a prophet, and to preach the gospel in the land of Zebulun 
 and Naphtali, and in Galilee of the Gentiles. And the Old-Testament 
 prophets, as they were witnesses to him, so they were types of him.
 When he came and dwelt in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali, then 
 this prophecy is said to have been fulfilled, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:13-16">Matt. iv. 13-16</A>.
 
 Note,

 [1.] Those that want the gospel walk in darkness, and know not what 
 they do nor whither they go; and they dwell in the land of the shadow 
 of death, in thick darkness, and in the utmost danger. 

 [2.] When the gospel comes to any place, to any soul, light comes, a 
 great light, a shining light, which will shine more and more. It should 
 be welcome to us, as light is to those that sit in darkness, and we 
 should readily entertain it, both because if is of such sovereign use 
 to us and because it brings its own evidence with it. Truly this light 
 is sweet.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Of a glorious increase, and a universal joy arising from it, 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)
 
 "<I>Thou,</I> O God! <I>hast multiplied the nation,</I> the Jewish 
 nation which thou hast mercy in store for; though it has been 
 diminished by one sore judgment after another, yet now thou hast begun 
 to multiply it again." The numbers of a nation are its strength and 
 wealth if the numerous be industrious; and it is God that increases 
 nations, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:23">Job xii. 23</A>.

 Yet it follows, "<I>Thou hast not increased the joy</I>--the carnal joy
 and mirth, and those things that are commonly the matter and occasion 
 thereof. But, notwithstanding that, <I>they joy before thee;</I> there 
 is a great deal of serious spiritual joy among them, joy in the 
 presence of God, with an eye to him." This is very applicable to the 
 times of gospel light, spoken of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:2">v. 2</A>.

 Then God multiplied the nation, the gospel Israel. "And to him" (so the
 Masorites read it) "thou hast magnified the joy, to every one that 
 receives the light." The following words favour this reading: <I>"They 
 joy before thee;</I> they come before thee in holy ordinances with 
 great joy'; their mirth is not like that of Israel under their vines 
 and fig-trees (thou hast not increased that joy), but it is in the 
 favour of God and in the tokens of his grace." Note, The gospel, when 
 it comes in its light and power, brings joy along with it, and those 
 who receive it aright do therein rejoice, yea, and will rejoice; 
 therefore the conversion of the nations is prophesied of by this 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+67:4">Ps. lxvii. 4</A>),
 
 <I>Let the nations be glad, and sin for joy.</I> See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+96:11">Ps. xcvi. 11</A>.
 
 (1.) It is holy joy: <I>They joy before thee;</I> they rejoice in 
 spirit (as Christ did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:21">Luke x. 21</A>),

 and that is before God. In the eye of the world they are always as
 sorrowful, and yet, in God's sight, <I>always rejoicing,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:10">2 Cor. vi. 10</A>.

 (2.) It is great joy; it is <I>according to the joy in harvest,</I>
 when those who sowed in tears, and have with long patience waited for 
 the precious fruits of the earth, reap in joy; and as in war men 
 rejoice when, after a hazardous battle, <I>they divide the spoil.</I> 
 The gospel brings with it plenty and victory; but those that would have 
 the joy of it must expect to go through a hard work, as the husbandman 
 before he has the joy of harvest, and a hard conflict, as the soldier 
 before he has the joy of dividing the spoil; but the joy, when it 
 comes, will be an abundant recompence for the toil. See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:8,39">Acts viii. 8, 39</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Of a glorious liberty and enlargement 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>):

 "They shall rejoice before thee, and with good reason, <I>for thou hast 
 broken the yoke of his burden,</I> and made him easy, for he shall no 
 longer be in servitude; and thou hast broken <I>the staff of his 
 shoulder and the rod of his oppressor,</I> that rod of the wicked which 
 rested long on the lot of the righteous," as the Midianites' yoke was 
 broken from off the neck of Israel by the agency of Gideon. If God 
 makes former deliverances his patterns in working for us, we ought to 
 make them our encouragements to hope in him and to seek to him, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:9">Ps. lxxxiii. 9</A>.

 <I>Do unto them as to the Midianites.</I> What temporal deliverance
 this refers to is not clear, probably the preventing of Sennacherib 
 from making himself master of Jerusalem, which was done, <I>as in the 
 day of Midian,</I> by the immediate hand of God; and, whereas other 
 battles were usually won with a great deal of noise and by the expense 
 of much blood, this shall be done silently and without noise. <I>Under 
 his glory God shall kindle a burning</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:16"><I>ch.</I> x. 16</A>);

 a <I>fire not blown shall consume him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:26">Job xx. 26</A>.

 But doubtless it looks further, to the blessed fruits and effects of
 that great light which should visit those that sat in darkness; it 
 would bring liberty along with it, <I>deliverance to the captives,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:18">Luke iv. 18</A>.

 (1.) The design of the gospel, and the grace of it, is to break the
 yoke of sin and Satan, to remove the burden of guilt and corruption, 
 and to free us from the rod of those oppressors, that we might be 
 brought into the glorious liberty of the children of God. Christ broke 
 the yoke of the ceremonial law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:10,Ga+5:1">Acts xv. 10; Gal. v. 1</A>),

 and delivered us <I>out of the hand of our enemies,</I> that we might
 <I>serve him without fear,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:74,75">Luke i. 74, 75</A>.

 (2.) This is done by the Spirit working like fire 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:11">Matt. iii. 11</A>),

 not as the battle of the warrior is fought, with confused noise; no, 
 the weapons of our warfare are not carnal; but it is done with the 
 Spirit of judgment and the Spirit of burning,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+4:4"><I>ch.</I> iv. 4</A>.

 It is done <I>as in the day of Midian,</I> by a work of God upon the
 hearts of men. Christ is our Gideon; it is his sword that doeth 
 wonders.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. But who, where, is he that shall undertake and accomplish these 
 great things for the church? The prophet tells us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>)

 they shall be done by the Messiah, <I>Immanuel,</I> that son of a 
 virgin whose birth he had foretold

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:14"><I>ch.</I> vii. 14</A>),

 and now speaks of, in the prophetic style, as a thing already done: the
 <I>child is born,</I> not only because it was as certain, and he was as 
 certain of it as if it had been done already, but because the church 
 before his incarnation reaped great benefit and advantage by his 
 undertaking in virtue of that first promise concerning the <I>seed of 
 the woman,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:15">Gen. iii. 15</A>.

 As he was the Lamb slain, so he was the child born, <I>from the
 foundation of the world,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:8">Rev. xiii. 8</A>.

 All the great things that God did for the Old-Testament church were
 done by him as the eternal Word, and for his sake as the Mediator. He 
 was the Anointed, to whom God had respect

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:9">Ps. lxxxiv. 9</A>),

 and it was for the Lord's sake, for the Lord Christ's sake, that God
 caused his face to shine upon his sanctuary, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:17">Dan. ix. 17</A>.

 The Jewish nation, and particularly the house of David, were preserved
 many a time from imminent ruin only because that blessing was in them. 
 What greater security therefore could be given to the church of God 
 then that it should be preserved, and be the special care of the divine 
 Providence, than this, that God had so great a mercy in reserve for it? 
 The Chaldee paraphrast understands it of the man that shall endure for 
 ever, even Christ. And it is an illustrious prophecy of him and of his 
 kingdom, which doubtless those that waited for the consolation of 
 Israel built much upon, often turned to, and read with pleasure.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. See him in his humiliation. The same that is <I>the mighty God</I> 
 is <I>a child born;</I> the ancient of days becomes an infant of a span 
 long; the <I>everlasting Father</I> is <I>a Son given.</I> Such was his 
 condescension in taking our nature upon him; thus did he humble and 
 empty himself, to exalt and fill us. He is born into our world. <I>The 
 Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.</I> He is given, freely given, 
 to be all that to us which our case, in our fallen state, calls for. 
 God so loved the world that he gave him. He is born <I>to us,</I> he is 
 given to us, us men, and not to the angels that sinned. It is spoken 
 with an air of triumph, and the angel seems to refer to these words in 
 the notice he gives to the shepherds of the Messiah's having come 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:11">Luke ii. 11</A>),

 <I>Unto you is born, this day, a Saviour.</I> Note, Christ's being born
 and given to us is the great foundation of our hopes, and fountain of 
 our joys, in times of greatest grief and fear.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. See him in his exaltation. This child, this son, this Son of God, 
 this Son of man, that is given to us, is in a capacity to do us a great 
 deal of kindness; for he is invested with the highest honour and power, 
 so that we cannot but be happy if he be our friend.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) See the dignity he is advanced to, and the name he has above every 
 name. He shall be called (and therefore we are sure he is and shall be) 
 <I>Wonderful, Counsellor, &c.</I> His people shall know him and worship 
 him by these names; and, as one that fully answers them, they shall 
 submit to him and depend upon him. 

 [1.] He is <I>wonderful, counsellor.</I> Justly is he called 
 <I>wonderful,</I> for he is both God and man. His love is the wonder of 
 angels and glorified saints; in his birth, life, death, resurrection, 
 and ascension, he was wonderful. A constant series of wonders attended
 him, and, without controversy, great was the mystery of godliness 
 concerning him. He is the <I>counsellor,</I> for he was intimately 
 acquainted with the counsels of God from eternity, and he gives counsel 
 to the children of men, in which he consults our welfare. It is by him 
 that God has <I>given us counsel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:7,Re+3:18">Ps. xvi. 7; Rev. iii. 18</A>.

 He is the wisdom of the Father, and is made of God to us wisdom. Some
 join these together: He is the wonderful counsellor, a wonder or 
 miracle of a counsellor; in this, as in other things, he has the 
 pre-eminence; none teaches like him.

 [2.] He is <I>the mighty God--God, the mighty One.</I> As he has wisdom,
 so he has strength, to go through with his undertaking: he is able to 
 save to the utmost; and such is the work of the Mediator that no less a 
 power than that of the mighty God could accomplish it. 

 [3.] He is <I>the everlasting Father,</I> or <I>the Father of 
 eternity;</I> he is God, one with the Father, who is from everlasting 
 to everlasting. He is the author of everlasting life and happiness to 
 them, and so is the Father of a blessed eternity to them. He is <I>the
 Father of the world to come</I> (so the LXX. reads it), the father of 
 the gospel-state, which is put in subjection to him, not to the angels, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:5">Heb. ii. 5</A>.

 He was, from eternity, Father of the great work of redemption: his
 heart was upon it; it was the product of his wisdom as <I>the 
 counsellor,</I> of his love as <I>the everlasting Father.</I>

 [4.] He is <I>the prince of peace.</I> As a King, he preserves the 
 peace, commands peace, nay, he creates peace, in his kingdom. He is our 
 peace, and it is his peace that both keeps the hearts of his people and 
 rules in them. He is not only a peaceable prince, and his reign 
 peaceable, but he is the author and giver of all good, all that peace 
 which is the present and future bliss of his subjects.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) See the dominion he is advanced to, and the throne he has above 
 every throne 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>The government shall be upon his shoulder</I>--his only. He shall 
 not only wear the badge of it upon his shoulder (the <I>key of the 
 house of David,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:22"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 22</A>),

 but he shall bear the burden of it. The Father shall devolve it upon 
 him, so that he shall have an incontestable right to govern; and he 
 shall undertake it, so that no doubt can be made of his governing well, 
 for he shall set his shoulder to it, and will never complain, as Moses 
 did, of his being overcharged. <I>I am not able to bear all this 
 people,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:11,14">Num. xi. 11, 14</A>.

 Glorious things are here spoken of Christ's government,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 [1.] That it shall be an increasing government. It shall be multiplied; 
 the bounds of his kingdom shall be more and more enlarged, and many 
 shall be added to it daily. The lustre of it shall increase, and it 
 shall shine more and more brightly in the world. The monarchies of the 
 earth were each less illustrious than the other, so that what began in 
 gold ended in iron and clay, and every monarchy dwindled by degrees; 
 but the kingdom of Christ is a growing kingdom, and will come to 
 perfection at last. 

 [2.] That it shall be a peaceable government, agreeable to his 
 character as the prince of peace. He shall rule by love, shall rule in 
 men's hearts; so that wherever his government is there shall be peace, 
 and as his government increases the peace shall increase. The more we 
 are subject to Christ the more easy and safe we are.

 [3.] That it shall be a rightful government. He that is the Son of 
 David shall reign upon the throne of David and over his kingdom, which 
 he is entitled to. <I>God shall give him the throne of his father
 David,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:32,33">Luke i. 32, 33</A>.

 The gospel church, in which Jew and Gentile are incorporated, is the 
 holy hill of Zion, on which Christ reigns,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:6">Ps. ii. 6</A>.

 [4.] That it shall be administered with prudence and equity, and so as 
 to answer the great end of government, which is the establishment of 
 the kingdom: <I>He shall order it, and settle it, with justice and 
 judgment.</I> Every thing is, and shall be, well managed, in the 
 kingdom of Christ, and none of his subjects shall ever have cause to 
 complain. 

 [5.] That it shall be an everlasting kingdom: <I>There shall be no end 
 of the increase of his government</I> (it shall be still growing), no 
 end of the increase of the peace of it, for the happiness of the 
 subjects of this kingdom shall last to eternity and perhaps shall be 
 progressive <I>in infinitum--for ever.</I> He shall reign <I>henceforth
 even for ever;</I> not only throughout all generations of time, but, 
 even when the kingdom shall be delivered up to God even the Father, the 
 glory both of the Redeemer and the redeemed shall continue eternally. 
 
 [6.] That God himself has undertaken to bring all this about: "<I>The 
 Lord of hosts,</I> who has all power in his hand and all creatures at 
 his beck, <I>shall perform this,</I> shall preserve the throne of David 
 till this prince of peace is settled in it; his <I>zeal</I> shall do 
 it, his jealousy for his own honour, and the truth of his promise, and 
 the good of his church." Note, The heart of God is much upon the 
 advancement of the kingdom of Christ among men, which is very 
 comfortable to all those that wish well to it; <I>the zeal of the Lord 
 of hosts</I> will overcome all opposition.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon
 Israel.
 &nbsp; 9  And all the people shall know, <I>even</I> Ephraim and the
 inhabitant of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of
 heart,
 &nbsp; 10  The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn
 stones: the sycomores are cut down, but we will change <I>them
 into</I> cedars.
 &nbsp; 11  Therefore the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall set up the adversaries of Rezin
 against him, and join his enemies together;
 &nbsp; 12  The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they
 shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is
 not turned away, but his hand <I>is</I> stretched out still.
 &nbsp; 13  For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them,
 neither do they seek the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts.
 &nbsp; 14  Therefore the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will cut off from Israel head and tail,
 branch and rush, in one day.
 &nbsp; 15  The ancient and honourable, he <I>is</I> the head; and the
 prophet that teacheth lies, he <I>is</I> the tail.
 &nbsp; 16  For the leaders of this people cause <I>them</I> to err; and
 <I>they that are</I> led of them <I>are</I> destroyed.
 &nbsp; 17  Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men,
 neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for
 every one <I>is</I> a hypocrite and an evil doer, and every mouth
 speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but
 his hand <I>is</I> stretched out still.
 &nbsp; 18  For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the
 briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the
 forest, and they shall mount up <I>like</I> the lifting up of smoke.
 &nbsp; 19  Through the wrath of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts is the land darkened,
 and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall
 spare his brother.
 &nbsp; 20  And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he
 shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they
 shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm:
 &nbsp; 21  Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: <I>and</I> they
 together <I>shall be</I> against Judah. For all this his anger is not
 turned away, but his hand <I>is</I> stretched out still.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here are terrible threatenings, which are directed primarily against 
 Israel, the kingdom of the ten tribes, Ephraim and Samaria, the ruin of 
 which is here foretold, with all the woeful confusions that were the 
 prefaces to that ruin, all which came to pass within a few years after; 
 but they look further, to all the enemies of the throne and kingdom of 
 Christ the Son of David, and read the doom of all the nations that 
 forget God, and will not have Christ to reign over them. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The preface to this prediction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>The Lord sent a word into Jacob,</I> sent it by his servants the 
 prophets. He warns before he wounds. He sent notice what he would do, 
 that they might meet him in the way of his judgments; but they would 
 not take the hint, took no care to turn away his wrath, and so it 
 lighted upon Israel; for no word of God shall fall to the ground. It 
 fell upon them as a storm of rain and hail from on high, which they 
 could not avoid: <I>It has lighted upon them,</I> that is, it is as 
 sure to come as if come already, and all the people shall know by 
 feeling it what they would not know by hearing of it. Those that are 
 willingly ignorant of the wrath of God revealed from heaven against sin 
 and sinners shall be made to know it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The sins charged upon the people of Israel, which provoked God to 
 bring these judgments upon them. 

 1. Their insolent defiance of the justice of God, thinking themselves a
 match for him: "They <I>say, in the pride and stoutness of their 
 heart,</I> Let God himself do his worst; we will hold our own, and make 
 our part good with him. If he ruin our houses, we will repair them, and 
 make them stronger and finer than they were before. Our landlord shall
 not turn us out of doors, though we pay him no rent, but we will keep
 in possession. If the houses that were built of bricks be demolished in
 the war, we will rebuild them with hewn stones, that shall not so
 easily be thrown down. If the enemy cut down the sycamores, we will
 plant cedars in the room of them. We will make a hand of God's
 judgments, gain by them, and so outbrave them." Note, Those are 
 ripening apace for ruin whose hearts are unhumbled under humbling 
 providences; for God will walk contrary to those who thus walk contrary 
 to him and provoke him to jealousy, as if they were stronger than he. 

 2. Their incorrigibleness under all the rebukes of Providence hitherto

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 <I>The people turn not unto him that smiteth them</I> (they are not 
 wrought upon to reform their lives, to forsake their sins, and to 
 return to their duty), <I>neither do they seek the Lord of hosts;</I> 
 either they are atheists, and have no religion, or idolaters, and seek 
 to those gods that are the creatures of their own fancy and the works 
 of their own hands. Note, That which God designs, in smiting us, is to 
 turn us to himself and to set us a seeking him; and, if this point be 
 not gained by less judgments, greater may be expected. God smites that 
 he may not kill. 

 3. Their general corruption of manners and abounding profaneness.

 (1.) Those that should have reformed them helped to debauch them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>The leaders of this people</I> mislead them, and <I>cause them to 
 err,</I> by conniving at their wickedness and countenancing wicked 
 people, and by setting them bad examples; and then no wonder if those 
 that are led of them be deceived and so destroyed. But it is ill with
 a people when their physicians are their worst disease. "<I>Those that 
 bless this people,</I> or <I>call them blessed</I> (so the margin reads 
 it), that flatter them, and soothe them in their wickedness, and cry 
 <I>Peace, peace, to them,</I> cause them to err; and those <I>that are 
 called blessed of them are swallowed up</I> ere they are aware." We 
 have reason to be afraid of those that speak well of us when we do ill; 
 see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+24:24,29:5">Prov. xxiv. 24; xxix. 5</A>.

 (2.) Wickedness was universal, and all were infected with it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>Every one is a hypocrite and an evil doer.</I> If there be any that 
 are good, they do not, they dare not appear, for every mouth speaks 
 folly and villany; every one is profane towards God (so the word 
 properly signifies) and an evil doer towards man. These two commonly go 
 together: those that fear not God regard not man; and then every mouth 
 speaks folly, falsehood, and reproach, both against God and man; for 
 <I>out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The judgments threatened against them for this wickedness of 
 theirs; let them not think to go unpunished.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In general, hereby they exposed themselves to the wrath of God, 
 which should both devour as fire and darken as smoke. 

 (1.) It should devour as fire

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>Wickedness shall burn as the fire;</I> the displeasure of God, 
 incurred by sin, shall consume the sinners, who have made themselves as 
 briers and thorns before it, and as the thickets of the forest, 
 combustible matter, which the wrath of the Lord of hosts, the mighty 
 God, will go through and burn together. 

 (2.) It should darken as smoke. The briers and thorns, when the fire
 consumes them, shall <I>mount up like the lifting up of smoke,</I> so 
 that the whole land shall be darkened by it; they shall be in trouble, 
 and see no way out

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):
 
 <I>The people shall be as the fuel of the fire.</I> God's wrath fastens 
 upon none but those that make themselves fuel for it, and then they 
 mount up as the smoke of sacrifices, being made victims to divine 
 justice.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. God would arm the neighbouring powers against them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 At this time the kingdom of Israel was in league with that of Syria
 against Judah; but the Assyrians, who were adversaries to the Syrians, 
 when they had conquered them should invade Israel, and God would stir 
 them up to do it, and join the enemies of Israel together in alliance 
 against them, who yet had particular ends of their own to serve and 
 were not aware of God's hand in their alliance. Note, When enemies are 
 set up, and joined in confederacy against a people, God's hand must be 
 acknowledged in it. Note further, Those that partake with each other in 
 sin, as Syria and Israel in invading Judah, must expect to share in the 
 punishment of sin. Nay, the Syrians themselves, whom they were now in 
 league with, should be a scourge to them (for it is no unusual thing 
 for those to fall out that have been united in sin), one attacking them 
 in the front and the other flanking them or falling upon their rear; so 
 that they should be surrounded with enemies on all sides, who should 
 <I>devour them with open mouth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 The Philistines were not now looked upon as formidable enemies, and the
 Syrians were looked upon as firm friends; and yet these shall devour 
 Israel. When men's ways displease the Lord he makes even their friends 
 to be at war with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. God would take from the midst of them those they confided in and 
 promised themselves help from, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 Because the people seek not God, those they seek to and depend upon
 shall stand them in no stead. <I>The Lord will cut off head and tail,
 branch and rush,</I> which is explained in the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:15">next verse</A>.

 (1.) Their magistrates, who were honourable by birth and office and
 were the ancients of the people, these were <I>the head,</I> these were 
 the branch which they promised themselves spirit and fruit from; but 
 because these caused them to err they should be cut off, and their 
 dignity and power should be no protection to them when the abuse of 
 that dignity and power was the great provocation: and it was a judgment 
 upon the people to have their princes cut off, though they were not 
 such as they should have been.

 (2.) Their prophets, their false prophets, were <I>the tail</I> and the 
 <I>rush,</I> the most despicable of all. A wicked minister is the worst 
 of all. A wicked minister is the worst of men. <I>Corruptio optimi est
 pessima--The best things become when corrupted the worst.</I> The blind 
 led the blind, and so both fell into the ditch; and the blind leaders 
 fell first and fell undermost.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That the desolation should be as general as the corruption had been, 
 and none should escape it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 (1.) Not those that were the objects of complacency. None shall be
 spared for love: <I>The Lord shall have no joy in their young men,</I> 
 that were in the flower of their youth; nor will he say, <I>Deal gently 
 with the young men for my sake;</I> no, "Let them fall with the rest, 
 and with them let the seed of the next generation perish." 

 (2.) Not those that were the objects of compassion. None shall be
 spared for pity: He <I>shall not have mercy on their fatherless and 
 widows,</I> though he is, in a particular manner, the patron and 
 protector of such. They had corrupted their way like all the rest;
 and, if the poverty and helplessness of their state was not an argument 
 with them to keep them from sin, they could not expect it should be an 
 argument with God to protect them from judgments.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. That they should pull one another to pieces, that every one should 
 help forward the common ruin, and they should be cannibals to 
 themselves and one to another: <I>No man shall spare his brother,</I> 
 if he come in the way of his ambition of covetousness, or if he have 
 any colour to be revenged on him; and how can they expect God should 
 spare them when they show no compassion one to another? Men's passion 
 and cruelty one against another provoke God to be angry with them all 
 and are an evidence that he is so. Civil wars soon bring a kingdom to 
 desolation. Such there were in Israel, when, <I>for the transgression 
 of the land, many were the princes thereof,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:2">Prov. xxviii. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) In these intestine broils, men <I>snatched on the right hand, and 
 yet were hungry</I> still, and did eat the <I>flesh of their own 
 arms,</I> preyed upon themselves for hunger or upon their nearest 
 relations that were as their own flesh, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 
 This bespeaks,

 [1.] Great famine and scarcity; when men had pulled all they could to 
 them it was so little that they were still hungry, at least God did not 
 bless it to them, so that <I>they eat and have not enough,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:6">Hag. i. 6</A>.

 [2.] Great rapine and plunder. <I>Jusque datum sceleri--iniquity is
 established by law.</I> The hedge of property, which is a hedge of 
 protection to men's estates, shall be plucked up, and every man shall 
 think all that his own which he can lay his hands on (<I>vivitur ex 
 rapto, non hospes ab hospite tutus--they live on the spoil, and the
 rites of hospitality are all violated</I>); and yet, when men thus 
 catch at that which is none of their own, they are not satisfied.
 Covetous desires are insatiable, and this curse is entailed on that 
 which is ill got, that it will never do well.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) These intestine broils should be not only among particular persons 
 and private families, but among the tribes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>Manasseh shall devour Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasseh,</I> though they 
 be combined against Judah. Those that could unite against Judah could 
 not unite with one another; but that sinful confederacy of theirs 
 against their neighbour <I>that dwelt securely by them</I> was justly 
 punished by this separation of them one from another. Or Judah, having 
 sinned like Manasseh and Ephraim, shall not only suffer with them, but 
 suffer by them. Note, Mutual enmity and animosity among the tribes of 
 God's Israel is a sin that ripens them for ruin, and a sad symptom of 
 ruin hastening on apace. If Ephraim be against Manasseh, and Manasseh 
 against Ephraim, and both against Judah, they will all soon become a 
 very easy prey to the common enemy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. That, though they should be followed with all these judgments, yet 
 God would not let fall his controversy with them. It is the heavy 
 burden of this song 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:12,17,21"><I>v.</I> 12, 17, 21</A>):

 <I>For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched 
 out still,</I> that is, 

 (1.) They do nothing to turn away his anger; they do not repent and 
 reform, do not humble themselves and pray, none stand in the gap, none 
 answer God's calls nor comply with the designs of his providences, but 
 they are hardened and secure. 

 (2.) His anger therefore continues to burn against them and <I>his hand 
 is stretched out still.</I> The reason why the judgments of God are 
 prolonged is because the point is not gained, sinners are not brought 
 to repentance by them. <I>The people turn not to him that smites 
 them,</I> and therefore he continues to smite them; for when God judges 
 he will overcome, and the proudest stoutest sinner shall either bend or 
 break.</P>
