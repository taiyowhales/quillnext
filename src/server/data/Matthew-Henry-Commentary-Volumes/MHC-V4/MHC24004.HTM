 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It should seem that the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:29-37,4:1-2">first two verses</A>

 of this chapter might better have been joined to the close of the
 foregoing chapter, for they are directed to Israel, the ten tribes, by
 way of reply to their compliance with God's call, directing and 
 encouraging them to hold their resolution, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 The rest of the chapter concerns Judah and Jerusalem.

 I. They are called to repent and reform,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>.

 II. They are warned of the advance of Nebuchadnezzar and his forces
 against them, and are told that it is for their sins, from which they
 are again exhorted to wash themselves,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:5-18">ver. 5-18</A>.

 III. To affect them the more with the greatness of the desolation that
 was coming, the prophet does himself bitterly lament it, and sympathize 
 with his people in the calamities it brought upon them, and the plunge 
 it brought them to, representing it as a reduction of the world to its 
 first chaos,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, return unto
 me: and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight,
 then shalt thou not remove.
 &nbsp; 2  And thou shalt swear, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> liveth, in truth, in judgment,
 and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in
 him, and in him shall they glory.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When God called to backsliding Israel to return 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:22"><I>ch.</I> iii. 22</A>)

 they immediately answered, <I>Lord, we return;</I> now God here takes
 notice of their answer, and, by way of reply to it,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He directs them how to pursue their good resolutions: "Dost thou
 say, <I>I will return?</I>"

 1. "Then thou must <I>return unto me;</I> make a thorough work of it.
 Do not only turn from thy idolatries, but return to the instituted 
 worship of the God of Israel." Or, "Thou must return speedily and not 
 delay (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:12">Isa. xxi. 12</A>,

 <I>If you will enquire, enquire you</I>); if you will return unto me, 
 return you: do not talk of it, but do it."

 2. "Thou must utterly abandon all sin, and not retain any of the
 relics of idolatry: <I>Put away thy abominations out of my sight,</I>" 
 that is, out of all places (for every place is under the eye of God), 
 especially out of the temple, the house which he had in a particular 
 manner his eye upon, to see that it was kept clean. It intimates that 
 their idolatries were not only obvious, but offensive, to the eye of 
 God. They were abominations which he could not endure the sight of;
 therefore they must be <I>put away out of his sight,</I> because they 
 were a provocation to the pure eyes of God's glory. Sin must be put 
 away out of the heart, else it is not put away out of God's sight, for 
 the heart and all that is in it lie open before his eye. 

 3. They must not return to sin again; so some understand that, <I>Thou
 shalt not remove,</I> reading it, <I>Thou shalt not,</I> or <I>must 
 not, wander. "If thou wilt put away thy abominations, and wilt not
 wander</I> after them again, as thou hast done, all shall be well." 

 4. They must give unto God the glory due unto his name

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>Thou shalt sear, The Lord liveth.</I> His existence shall be with 
 thee the most sacred fact, than which nothing can be more sure, and his 
 judgment the supreme court to which thou shalt appeal, than which 
 nothing can be more awful." Swearing is an act of religious worship, in 
 which we are to give honour to God three ways:--

 (1.) We must swear by the true God only, and not by creatures, or any 
 false gods,--by the God that liveth, not by the gods that are deaf and 
 dumb and dead,--by him only, and not <I>by the Lord and by Malcham,</I> 
 as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:5">Zech. i. 5</A>.

 (2.) We must swear that only which is true, <I>in truth and in 
 righteousness,</I> not daring to assert that which is false, or which 
 we do not know to be true, nor to assert that as certain which is 
 doubtful, nor to promise that which we mean not to perform, nor to 
 violate the promise we have made. To say that which is untrue, or to do 
 that which is unrighteous, is bad, but to back either with an oath is 
 much worse. 

 (3.) We must do it solemnly, swear <I>in judgment,</I> that is, when 
 judicially called to it, and not in common conversation. Rash swearing 
 is as great a profanation of God's name as solemn swearing is an honour 
 to it. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:20,Mt+5:34,37">Deut. x. 20; Matt. v. 34, 37</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He encourages them to keep in this good mind and adhere to their 
 resolutions. If the scattered Israelites will thus return to God, 

 1. They shall be blessed themselves; for to that sense the first words
 may be read: "<I>If thou wilt return to me,</I> then <I>thou shalt 
 return,</I> that is, thou shalt be brought back out of thy captivity 
 into thy own land again, as was of old promised," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:29,30:2">Deut. iv. 29; xxx. 2</A>.

 Or, "Then <I>thou shalt rest in me,</I> shalt return to me as they
 rest, even while thou art in the land of thy captivity."

 2. They shall be blessings to others; for their returning to God again 
 will be a means of others turning to him who never new him. If thou 
 wilt own the living Lord, thou wilt thereby influence the nations among 
 whom thou art to bless themselves in him, to place their happiness in 
 his favour and to think themselves happy in being brought to the fear 
 of him. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:16">Isa. lxv. 16</A>.

 They shall bless themselves <I>in the God of truth,</I> and not in
 false gods, shall do themselves the honour, and give themselves the 
 satisfaction, to join themselves to him; and then <I>in him shall they 
 glory;</I> they shall make him their glory, and shall please, nay, 
 shall pride, themselves in the blessed change they have made. Those 
 that part with their sins to return to God, however they scrupled at 
 the bargain at first, <I>when they go away, then they boast.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  For thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> to the men of Judah and Jerusalem,
 Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.
 &nbsp; 4  Circumcise yourselves to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and take away the
 foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of
 Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none
 can quench <I>it,</I> because of the evil of your doings.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet here turns his speech, in God's name, to the men of the 
 place where he lived. We have heard what words he proclaimed <I>towards 
 the north</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:12"><I>ch.</I> iii. 12</A>),

 for the comfort of those that were now in captivity and were humbled
 under the hand of God; let us now see what he says to the <I>men of 
 Judah and Jerusalem,</I> who were now in prosperity, for their 
 conviction and awakening. In these two verses he exhorts them to 
 repentance and reformation, as the only way left them to prevent the 
 desolating judgments that were ready to break in upon them.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The duties required of them, which they are concerned to do.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They must do by their hearts as they do by their ground that they 
 expect any good of; they must plough it up 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>Break up your fallow-ground. Plough to yourselves a ploughing</I> 
 (or <I>plough up your plough land</I>), that you <I>sow not among 
 thorns,</I> that you may not labour in vain, for your own safety and 
 welfare, as those do that sow good seed among thorns and as you have 
 been doing a great while. Put yourselves into a frame fit to receive 
 mercy from God, and put away all that which keeps it from you, and then 
 you may expect to receive mercy and to prosper in your endeavours to 
 help yourselves." Note, 

 (1.) An unconvinced unhumbled heart is like fallow-ground, ground 
 untilled, unoccupied. It is ground capable of improvement; it is our 
 ground, let out to us, and we must be accountable for it; but it is 
 fallow; it is unfenced and lies common; it is unfruitful and of no 
 advantage to the owner, and (which is principally intended) it is 
 overgrown with thorns and weeds, which are the natural product of the 
 corrupt heart; and, if it be not renewed with grace, rain and sunshine 
 are lost upon it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:7,8">Heb. vi. 7, 8</A>.

 (2.) We are concerned to get this fallow-ground ploughed up. We must 
 search into our own hearts, let the word of God divide (as the plough 
 does) <I>between the joints and the marrow,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:12">Heb. iv. 12</A>.

 We must <I>rend our hearts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:13">Joel ii. 13</A>.

 We must pluck up by the roots those corruptions which, as thorns, choke
 both our endeavours and our expectations,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:12">Hos. x. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They must do that to their souls which was done to their bodies when 
 they were taken into covenant with God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>Circumcise yourselves to the Lord, and take away the foreskin of 
 your heart.</I> Mortify the flesh and the lusts of it. Pare off that 
 <I>superfluity of naughtiness</I> which hinders your <I>receiving with 
 meekness the engrafted word,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:21">Jam. i. 21</A>.

 Boast not of, and rest not in, the circumcision of the body, for that
 is but a sign, and will not serve without the thing signified. It is a
 dedicating sign. Do that in sincerity which was done in profession by 
 your circumcision; devote and consecrate yourselves unto the Lord, to 
 be to him a peculiar people. Circumcision is an <I>obligation to keep
 the law;</I> lay yourselves afresh under that obligation. It is a 
 <I>seal of the righteousness of faith;</I> lay hold then of that 
 righteousness, and so <I>circumcise yourselves to the Lord.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The danger they are threatened with, which they are concerned to 
 avoid. Repent and reform, <I>lest my fury come forth like fire,</I> 
 which it is now ready to do, as that fire which came forth from the 
 Lord and consumed the sacrifices, and which was always kept burning 
 upon the altar and none might quench it; such is God's wrath against 
 impenitent sinners, <I>because of the evil of their doings.</I> Note, 

 1. That which is to be dreaded by us more than any thing else is the 
 wrath of God; for that is the spring and bitterness of all present 
 miseries and will be the quintessence and perfection of everlasting 
 misery. 

 2. It is the <I>evil of our doings</I> that kindles the fire of God's 
 wrath against us. 

 3. The consideration of the imminent danger we are in of falling and
 perishing under this wrath should awaken us with all possible care to 
 <I>sanctify ourselves to God's glory</I> and to see to it that we be 
 <I>sanctified by his grace.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow
 ye the trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say,
 Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the defenced cities.
 &nbsp; 6  Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will
 bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.
 &nbsp; 7  The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of
 the Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to
 make thy land desolate; <I>and</I> thy cities shall be laid waste,
 without an inhabitant.
 &nbsp; 8  For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the
 fierce anger of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> is not turned back from us.
 &nbsp; 9  And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>that</I>
 the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes;
 and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall
 wonder.
 &nbsp; 10  Then said I, Ah, Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>! surely thou hast greatly deceived
 this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas
 the sword reacheth unto the soul.
 &nbsp; 11  At that time shall it be said to this people and to
 Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward
 the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse,
 &nbsp; 12  <I>Even</I> a full wind from those <I>places</I> shall come unto me:
 now also will I give sentence against them.
 &nbsp; 13  Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots <I>shall
 be</I> as a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto
 us! for we are spoiled.
 &nbsp; 14  O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou
 mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within
 thee?
 &nbsp; 15  For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction
 from mount Ephraim.
 &nbsp; 16  Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against
 Jerusalem, <I>that</I> watchers come from a far country, and give out
 their voice against the cities of Judah.
 &nbsp; 17  As keepers of a field, are they against her round about;
 because she hath been rebellious against me, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 18  Thy way and thy doings have procured these <I>things</I> unto
 thee; this <I>is</I> thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it
 reacheth unto thine heart.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God's usual method is to warn before he wounds. In these verses, 
 accordingly, God gives notice to the Jews of the general desolation 
 that would shortly be brought upon them by a foreign invasion. This 
 must be declared and published in all the cities of Judah and streets 
 of Jerusalem, that all might hear and fear, and by this loud alarm be 
 either brought to repentance or left inexcusable. The prediction of 
 this calamity is here given very largely, and in lively expressions, 
 which one would think should have awakened and affected the most 
 stupid. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The war proclaimed, and general notice given of the advance of the 
 enemy. It is published now, some years before, by the prophet; but, 
 since this will be slighted, it shall be published after another manner 
 when the judgment is actually breaking in, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 The <I>trumpet</I> must be <I>blown,</I> the <I>standard</I> must be
 <I>set up,</I> a summons must be issued out to the people to <I>gather 
 together</I> and to draw <I>towards Zion,</I> either to guard it or 
 expecting to be guarded by it. There must be a general rendezvous. The 
 militia must be raised and all the forces mustered. Those that are able 
 men, and fit for service, must <I>go into the defenced cities,</I> to 
 garrison them; those that are weak, and would lessen their provisions, 
 but not increase their strength, must <I>retire,</I> and <I>not 
 stay.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. An express arrived with intelligence of the approach of the king of 
 Babylon and his army. It is an evil that God will <I>bring from the 
 north</I> (as he had said, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:15"><I>ch.</I> i. 15</A>),

 <I>even a great destruction,</I> beyond all that had yet come upon the
 nation of the Jews. The enemy is here compared, 

 1. To <I>a lion</I> that <I>comes up from his thicket,</I> when he is
 hungry, to seek his prey,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The helpless beasts are so terrified with his roaring (as some report)
 that they cannot flee from him, and so become an easy prey to him. 
 Nebuchadnezzar is this roaring tearing lion, <I>the destroyer of the 
 nations,</I> that has laid many countries waste, and now is <I>on his 
 way</I> in full speed towards the land of Judah. The <I>destroyer of 
 the Gentiles</I> shall be the <I>destroyer of the Jews</I> too, when 
 they have by their idolatry made themselves like the Gentiles. "He has 
 <I>gone forth from his place,</I> from Babylon, or the place of the 
 rendezvous of his army, on purpose against <I>this land;</I> that is 
 the prey he has now his eye upon, not to plunder it only, but to make 
 it desolate, and herein he shall succeed to such a degree that the 
 cities shall be <I>laid waste, without inhabitants,</I> shall be 
 <I>overgrown with grass</I> as a field;" so some read it. 

 2. To a <I>drying</I> blasting <I>wind</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 a parching scorching wind, which spoils the fruits of the earth and 
 withers them, not a wind which brings rain, but such as comes <I>out of 
 the north,</I> which <I>drives away rain</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:23">Prov. xxv. 23</A>),

 but brings something worse instead of it; such shall this evil out of
 the north be to this people, a <I>black</I> freezing wind, which they 
 can neither fence against nor flee from, but, wherever they go, it 
 shall surround and pursue them; and they cannot see it before it comes, 
 but, when it comes, they shall feel it. It is a <I>wind of the high 
 places in the wilderness,</I> or <I>plain,</I> that beats upon the tops 
 of the hills or that carries all before it in the plain, where there is 
 no shelter, but the ground is all champaign. It shall come in its full 
 force <I>towards the daughters of my people,</I> that have been brought 
 up so tenderly and delicately that they could not endure to have the 
 wind blow upon them. Now this fierce wind shall come against them, 
 <I>not to fan, nor cleanse</I> them, not such a gentle wind as is used 
 in winnowing corn, but a <I>full wind</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 a strong and violent wind, blowing full upon them. This shall come 
 <I>to me,</I> or rather <I>for me;</I> it shall come with commission 
 from God and shall accomplish that for which he sends it; for this, as 
 other <I>stormy winds, fulfills his word.</I> 

 3. To clouds and whirlwinds for swiftness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 The Chaldean army shall <I>come up as clouds</I> driven with the wind,
 so thick shall they stand, so fast shall they march, and it shall be to 
 no purpose to offer to stop them or make head against them, any more 
 than to arrest a cloud or give check to a whirlwind. The horses are 
 <I>swifter than eagles</I> when they fly upon their prey; it is in vain 
 to think either of opposing them or of outrunning them. 

 4. To watchers and the keepers of a field,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:15-17"><I>v.</I> 15-17</A>.

 <I>The voice declares from Dan,</I> a city which lay furthest north of
 all the cities of Canaan, and therefore received the first tidings of 
 this <I>evil from the north</I> and hastened it to Mount Ephraim, that 
 part of the land of Israel which lay next to Judea; they received the 
 news of the affliction and transmitted it to Jerusalem. Ill news flies 
 apace; and an impenitent people, that hates to be reformed, can expect 
 no other that ill news. Now, what is the news? "<I>Tell the 
 nations,</I> those mixed nations that now inhabit the cities of the ten 
 tribes, mention it to them, that they may provide for their own safety; 
 but publish it <I>against Jerusalem,</I> that is the place aimed at, 
 the game shot at, let them know that <I>watchers have come from a far 
 country,</I> that is, soldiers, that will watch all opportunities to do 
 mischief." Private soldiers we call <I>private sentinels,</I> or 
 <I>watchmen.</I> "They are coming in full career, and <I>give out their 
 voice against the cities of Judah;</I> they design to invest them, to 
 make themselves masters of them, and to attack them with loud shouts, 
 as sure of victory. As <I>keepers of a field</I> surround it, to keep 
 all out from it, so shall they surround the cities of Judah, to keep 
 all in them, till they be constrained to surrender at discretion; they 
 are <I>against her round about, compassing her in on every side."</I> 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:43">Luke xix. 43</A>.

 As formerly the good angels, <I>those watchers,</I> and <I>holy
 ones,</I> were like <I>keepers of a field</I> to Jerusalem, watching 
 about it, that nothing might go in to its prejudice, so now their 
 enemies were as watchers and keepers of a field, surrounding it that 
 nothing might go in to its relief and succour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The lamentable cause of this judgment. How is it that Judah and 
 Jerusalem come to be thus abandoned to ruin? See how it came to this. 

 1. They sinned against God; it was all owing to themselves: <I>She has 
 been rebellious against me, saith the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Their enemies surrounded them as keepers of a field, because they had
 taken up arms against their rightful Lord and sovereign, and were to be 
 seized as rebels. The Chaldeans were breaking in upon them, and it was 
 sin that opened the gap at which they entered: <I>Thy way and thy 
 doings have procured these things unto thee</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 thy evil way and thy doings that have not been good. It was not a false 
 step or two that did them this mischief, but their way and course of 
 living were bad. Note, Sin is the procuring cause of all our troubles.
 Those that go on in sin while they are endeavouring to ward off 
 mischiefs with one hand are at the same time pulling them upon their 
 own heads with the other. 

 2. God was angry with them for their sin. It is the <I>fierce anger of 
 the Lord</I> that makes the army of the Chaldeans thus fierce, thus 
 furious; that is kindled against us, and is <I>not turned back from 
 us,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Note, In men's anger against us, and the violence of that, we must see
 and own God's anger and the power of that. If that were turned back 
 from us, our enemies could not come forward against us. 

 3. In his just and holy anger he condemned them to this dreadful
 punishment: <I>Now also will I give sentence against them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 The execution was done, not in a heat, but in pursuance of a sentence
 solemnly passed, according to equity, and upon mature deliberation.
 Some read it, <I>Now will I do execution upon them,</I> according to 
 the doom formerly passed; and <I>we are sure that the judgment of God 
 is according to the truth,</I> and the execution of that judgment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The lamentable effects of this judgment, upon the first alarm given 
 of it. 

 1. The people that should fight shall quite despair and shall not have
 a heart to make the least stand against the enemy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):
 
 "<I>For this gird yourself with sackcloth, lament and howl,</I>" that 
 is, "you will do so. When the cry is made through the kingdom, <I>Arm, 
 arm!</I> all will be seized with a consternation, and all put into 
 confusion. Instead of girding on the sword, they will gird on the 
 sackcloth; instead of animating one another to a vigorous resistance, 
 they will <I>lament and howl,</I> and so dishearten one another. While 
 the enemy is yet at a distance they will give up all for gone, and cry, 
 <I>Woe unto us! for we are spoiled,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 We are all undone, the spoilers will certainly carry the day, and it is
 in vain to make head against them." Judah and Jerusalem had been famed 
 for valiant men; but see what is the effect of sin: by depriving men of 
 their confidence towards God, it deprives them of their courage towards 
 men. 

 2. Their great men, who should contrive for the public safety, shall be 
 at their wits' end

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>At that day the heart of the king shall perish,</I> both his wisdom 
 and his courage. Despairing of success, he shall have no spirit to do 
 any thing, and, if he had, he will not know what to do. His princes and 
 privy-counselors, who should animate and advise him, shall be as much 
 at a loss and as much in despair as he. See how easily, how
 effectually, God can bring ruin upon a people that are doomed to it, 
 merely by dispiriting them, <I>taking away the heart of the chief</I> 
 of them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:20,24">Job xii. 20, 24</A>),

 <I>cutting off the spirit of princes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:12">Ps. lxxvi. 12</A>.

 The business of the priests was to encourage the people in the time of
 war; they were to say to the people, <I>Fear not, and let not your 
 hearts faint,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:2,3">Deut. xx. 2, 3</A>.

 They were to blow the trumpets, for an assurance to them that in the
 day of battle they should be <I>remembered before the Lord their 
 God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:9">Num. x. 9</A>.

 But now <I>the priests</I> themselves <I>shall be astonished,</I> and
 shall have no heart themselves to do their office, and therefore shall 
 not be likely to put spirit into the people. <I>The prophets</I> too, 
 the false prophets, who had cried <I>peace</I> to them, shall be put 
 into the greatest amazement imaginable, seeing their own guilty blood 
 ready to be shed by that sword which they had often told the people 
 there was no danger of. Note, God's judgments come with the greatest 
 terror upon those that have been most secure. Our Saviour foretels that 
 at the last destruction of Jerusalem <I>men's hearts</I> should <I>fail 
 them for fear,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:26">Luke xxi. 26</A>.

 And it is common for those who have cheated and flattered people into a
 carnal security not only to fail them, but to discourage them, when the 
 trouble comes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The prophet's complaint of the people's being deceived, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 It is expressed strangely, as we read it: <I>Ah! Lord God, surely thou
 hast greatly deceived this people, saying, You shall have peace.</I> We 
 are sure that God deceives none. <I>Let no man say, when he is 
 tempted</I> or deluded, that God has tempted or deluded him. But, 

 1. The people deceived themselves with the promises that God had made
 in general of his favour to that nation, and the many peculiar 
 privileges with which they were dignified, building upon them, though 
 they took no care to perform the conditions on which the accomplishment 
 of those promises and the continuance of those privileges did depend; 
 and they had no regard to the threatenings which in the law were set 
 over-against those promises. Thus they cheated themselves and then 
 wickedly complained that God had cheated them. 

 2. The false prophets deceived them with promises of peace, which they 
 made them in God's name.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:17,27:9"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 17; xxvii. 9</A>.

 If God had sent them, he had indeed greatly deceived the people, but he
 had not. It was the people's fault that they gave them credit; and here 
 also they deceived themselves. 

 3. God had permitted the false prophets to deceive, and the people to
 be deceived by them, giving both up to <I>strong delusions,</I> to 
 punish them <I>for not receiving the truth in the love of it.</I> 
 Herein the Lord was righteous; but the prophet complains of it as the 
 sorest judgment of all, for by this means they had been hardened in 
 their sins. 

 4. It may be read with an interrogation, "<I>Hast thou indeed thus 
 deceived this people?</I> It is plain that they are greatly deceived, 
 for they expect <I>peace,</I> whereas <I>the sword reaches unto the 
 soul;</I> that is, it is a killing sword, abundance of lives are lost, 
 and more likely to be." Now, was it God that deceived them? No, he had
 often given them warning of judgments in general and of this in 
 particular; but their own prophets deceive them, and cry peace to those 
 to whom the God of heaven does not speak peace. It is a pitiable thing, 
 and that which every good man greatly laments, to see people flattered 
 into their own ruin, and promising themselves peace when war is at the 
 door; and this we should complain of to God, who alone can prevent such 
 a fatal delusion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The prophet's endeavour to undeceive them. When the prophets they 
 loved and caressed dealt falsely with them, he whom they hated and 
 persecuted dealt faithfully. 

 1. He shows them their wound. They were loth to see it, very loth to
 have it searched into; but, if they will allow themselves the liberty 
 of a free thought, they might discover their punishment in their sin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "<I>This is thy wickedness because it is bitter.</I> Now thou seest 
 that it is a bitter thing to depart from God, and will certainly be 
 <I>bitterness in the latter end,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:19"><I>ch.</I> ii. 19</A>.

 It produces bitter effects, and grief that <I>reaches unto the
 heart,</I> touches to the quick, and in the most tender part; the sword 
 <I>reaches to the soul,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 God can make trouble reach the heart even of those that would lay
 nothing to heart. "And by this thou mayest see <I>what is thy
 wickedness,</I> that it is a bitter thing, <I>a root of bitterness, 
 that bears gall and wormwood,</I> and that it has <I>reached to the 
 heart;</I> it is the corruption of the soul, of the <I>imagination of 
 the thought of the heart.</I>" If the heart were not polluted with sin, 
 it would not be disturbed and disquieted as it is with trouble. 

 2. He shows them the cure,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 "Since <I>thy wickedness reaches to the heart,</I> there the
 application must be made. <I>O Jerusalem! wash thy heart from 
 wickedness, that thou mayest be saved.</I>" By Jerusalem he means each 
 one of the inhabitants of Jerusalem; for every man has a heart of his 
 own to take care of, and it is personal reformation that must help the 
 public. Every one must return from <I>his own evil way,</I> and, in 
 order to that, cleanse <I>his own evil heart.</I> "And let <I>the heart 
 of the city</I> too be purified, not the suburbs only, the outskirts of 
 it." The vitals of a state must be amended by the reformation of those 
 that have the commanding influence upon it. Note, 

 (1.) Reformation is absolutely necessary to salvation. There is no 
 other way of preventing judgments, or turning them away when we are 
 threatened with them, but taking away the sin by which we have procured 
 them to ourselves. 

 (2.) No reformation is saving but that which reaches the heart. There 
 is heart-wickedness that is defiling to the soul, from which we must 
 wash ourselves. By repentance and faith we must wash our hearts from 
 the guilt we have contracted by spiritual wickedness, by those sins 
 which begin and end in the heart and go no further; and by 
 mortification and watchfulness we must suppress and prevent this 
 heart-wickedness for the future. The tree must be made good, else the 
 fruit will not. Jerusalem was all overspread with the leprosy of sin.
 Now as the physicians agree with respect to the body when afflicted 
 with leprosy that external applications will do no good, unless physic 
 be taken inwardly to carry off the humours that lurk there and to 
 change the mass of the blood, so it is with the soul, so it is with the 
 state: there will be no effectual reformation of the manners without a 
 reformation of the mind; the mistakes there must be rectified, the 
 corruptions there must be mortified, and the evil dispositions there 
 changed. "Though thou art Jerusalem, called a <I>holy city,</I> that 
 will not save thee, unless thou <I>wash thy heart from wickedness.</I>" 
 In the latter part of the verse he reasons with them: <I>How long shall 
 thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?</I> He complains here

 [1.] Of the delays of their reformation: "<I>How long</I> shall that 
 filthy heart of thine continue unwashed? When shall it once be?" Note, 
 The God of heaven thinks the time long that his room is usurped, and 
 his interest opposed, in our souls,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:27"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 27</A>.

 [2.] Of the root of their corruption, the <I>vain thoughts that lodged
 within them</I> and defiled their hearts, from which they must wash 
 their hearts. <I>Thoughts of iniquity</I> or <I>mischief,</I> these are 
 the evil thoughts that are the spawn of the evil <I>heart,</I> from 
 which all other wickedness is produced, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:19">Matt. xv. 19</A>.

 These are our own, the conceptions of our own lusts

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:15">Jam. i. 15</A>),

 and they are the most dangerous when they lodge within us, when they
 are admitted and entertained as guests, and are suffered to continue.
 Some read it <I>thoughts of affliction,</I> such thoughts as will bring 
 nothing but affliction and misery. Some by the vain thoughts here 
 understand all those frivolous pleas and excuses with which they turned 
 off the reproofs and calls of the word and rendered them ineffectual, 
 and bolstered themselves up in their wickedness. <I>Wash thy heart from 
 wickedness,</I> and think not to say, <I>We are not polluted</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:23"><I>ch.</I> ii. 23</A>),

 or, "We are Jerusalem; <I>we have Abraham to our father,</I>"

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart
 maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast
 heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.
 &nbsp; 20  Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is
 spoiled: suddenly are my tents spoiled, <I>and</I> my curtains in a
 moment.
 &nbsp; 21  How long shall I see the standard, <I>and</I> hear the sound of
 the trumpet?
 &nbsp; 22  For my people <I>is</I> foolish, they have not known me; they
 <I>are</I> sottish children, and they have none understanding: they
 <I>are</I> wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.
 &nbsp; 23  I beheld the earth, and, lo, <I>it was</I> without form, and
 void; and the heavens, and they <I>had</I> no light.
 &nbsp; 24  I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the
 hills moved lightly.
 &nbsp; 25  I beheld, and, lo, <I>there was</I> no man, and all the birds of
 the heavens were fled.
 &nbsp; 26  I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place <I>was</I> a wilderness,
 and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>and</I> by his fierce anger.
 &nbsp; 27  For thus hath the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said, The whole land shall be
 desolate; yet will I not make a full end.
 &nbsp; 28  For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be
 black: because I have spoken <I>it,</I> I have purposed <I>it,</I> and will
 not repent, neither will I turn back from it.
 &nbsp; 29  The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and
 bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks:
 every city <I>shall be</I> forsaken, and not a man dwell therein.
 &nbsp; 30  And <I>when</I> thou <I>art</I> spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though
 thou clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with
 ornaments of gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in
 vain shalt thou make thyself fair; <I>thy</I> lovers will despise
 thee, they will seek thy life.
 &nbsp; 31  For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, <I>and</I> the
 anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice
 of the daughter of Zion, <I>that</I> bewaileth herself, <I>that</I>
 spreadeth her hands, <I>saying,</I> Woe <I>is</I> me now! for my soul is
 wearied because of murderers.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet is here in an agony, and cries out like one upon the rack 
 of pain with some acute distemper, or as a woman in travail. The 
 expressions are very pathetic and moving, enough to melt a heart of 
 stone into compassion: <I>My bowels! my bowels! I am pained at my very
 heart;</I> and yet well, and in health himself, and nothing ails him. 
 Note, A good man, in such a bad world as this is, cannot but be a 
 <I>man of sorrows. My heart makes a noise in me,</I> through the tumult 
 of my spirits, and <I>I cannot hold my peace.</I> Note, The grievance 
 and the grief sometimes may be such that the most prudent patient man 
 cannot forbear complaining.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, what is the matter? What is it that puts the good man into such 
 agitation? It is not for himself, or any affliction in his family that 
 he grieves thus; but it is purely upon the public account, it is his 
 people's case that he lays to heart thus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They are very sinful and will not be reformed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 These are the words of God himself, for so the prophet chose to give
 this character of the people, rather than in his own words, or as from 
 himself: <I>My people are foolish.</I> God calls them his people, 
 though they are foolish. They have cast him off, but he has not cast 
 them off, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:1">Rom. xi. 1</A>.

 "They are <I>my people,</I> whom I have been in covenant with, and
 still have mercy in store for. They are <I>foolish,</I> for <I>they 
 have not known me.</I>" Note, Those are foolish indeed that have not 
 known God, especially that call themselves his people, and have the 
 advantages of coming into acquaintance with him, and yet have not known 
 him. They are <I>sottish children,</I> stupid and senseless, and have 
 <I>no understanding.</I> They cannot distinguish between truth and 
 falsehood, good and evil; they cannot discern the mind of God either in 
 his word or in his providence; they do not understand what their true 
 interest is, nor on which side it lies. They are <I>wise to do
 evil,</I> to plot mischief against the quiet in the land, wise to 
 contrive the gratification of their lusts, and then to conceal and 
 palliate them. But <I>to do good they have no knowledge,</I> no 
 contrivance, no application of mind; they know not how to make a good 
 use either of the ordinances or of the providences of God, nor how to 
 bring about any design for the good of their country. Contrary to this 
 should be our character. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:19">Rom. xvi. 19</A>,

 <I>I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning
 evil.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They are miserable, and cannot be relieved.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He cries out, <I>Because thou hast heard, O my soul! the sound of 
 the trumpet,</I> and <I>seen the standard,</I> both giving <I>the alarm 
 of war,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:19,21"><I>v.</I> 19, 21</A>.

 He does not say, <I>Thou hast heard,</I> O my <I>ear!</I> but, O my
 <I>soul!</I> because the event was yet future, and it is by the spirit 
 of prophecy that he see it and receives the impression of it. His 
 <I>soul</I> heard it from the words of God, and therefore he was as 
 well assured of it, and as much affected with it, as if he had heard it 
 with his bodily ears. He expresses this deep concern, 

 (1.) To show that, though he foretold this calamity, yet he was far 
 from <I>desiring the woeful day;</I> for a woeful day it would be to 
 him. It becomes us to tremble at the thought of the misery that sinners 
 are running themselves into, though we have good hopes, through grace, 
 that we ourselves are <I>delivered from the wrath to come.</I> 

 (2.) To awaken them to a holy fear, and so to a care to prevent so 
 great a judgment by a true and timely repentance. Note, Those that 
 would affect other with the word of God should evidence that they are 
 themselves affected with it. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Let us see what there is in the destruction here foreseen and 
 foretold that is so very affecting.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) It is a swift and <I>sudden</I> destruction; it comes upon Judah
 and Jerusalem ere they are aware, and pours in so fast upon them that 
 they have not the east breathing time. They have no time to recollect 
 their thoughts, much less to recruit or recover their strength: 
 <I>Destruction upon destruction is cried</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 <I>breach upon breach,</I> one sad calamity, like Job's messengers, 
 treading upon the heels of another. The death of Josiah breaks the ice, 
 and plucks up the flood-gates; within three months after that his son 
 and successor Jehoahaz is deposed by the king of Egypt; within two or 
 three years after Nebuchadnezzar besieged Jerusalem and took it, and 
 thenceforward he was continually making descents upon the land of Judah 
 with his armies during the reigns of Jehoiakim, Jeconiah, and Zedekiah, 
 till about nineteen years after he completed their ruin in the 
 destruction of Jerusalem: but <I>suddenly were their tents spoiled and 
 their curtains in a moment.</I> Though the cities held out for some 
 time, the country was laid waste at the very first. The shepherds and 
 all that lived in tents were plundered immediately; they and their 
 effects fell into the enemies' hands; therefore we find the Rechabites, 
 who dwelt in tents, upon the first coming of the army of the Chaldees 
 into the land retiring to Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+35:11">Jer. xxxv. 11</A>.

 The inhabitants of the villages soon ceased: <I>Suddenly were the tents
 spoiled.</I> The plain men that dwelt in tents were first made a prey 
 of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) This dreadful war continued a great while, not in the borders, but 
 in the bowels of the country; for the people were very obstinate, and 
 would not submit to the king of Babylon, but took all opportunities to 
 rebel against him, which did but lengthen out the calamity; they might 
 as well have yielded at first as at last. This is complained of 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>How long shall I see the standard?</I> Shall the sword devour for 
 ever? Good men are none of those that <I>delight in war,</I> for they 
 know not how to fish in troubled waters; they are <I>for peace</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+120:7">Ps. cxx. 7</A>),

 and will heartily say <I>Amen</I> to that prayer, "Give peace in out
 time, O Lord!" <I>O thou sword of the Lord! when wilt thou be
 quiet?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The desolations made by it in the land were general and universal: 
 <I>The whole land is spoiled,</I> or plundered 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>);

 so it was at first, and at length it became a perfect chaos. It was 
 such a desolation as amounted in a manner to a dissolution; not only 
 the superstructure, but even the foundations, were all <I>out of 
 course.</I> The prophet in vision saw the extent and extremity of this 
 destruction, and he here gives a most lively description of it, which 
 one would think might have made those uneasy in their sins who dwelt in 
 a land doomed to such a ruin, which might yet have been prevented by 
 their repentance. 
 
 [1.] The earth is <I>without form, and void</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),
 
 as it was 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:2">Gen. i. 2</A>.

 It is <I>Tohu</I> and <I>Bohu,</I> the words there used, as far as the 
 land of Judea goes. It is <I>confusion</I> and <I>emptiness,</I> 
 stripped of all its beauty, void of all its wealth, and, compared with 
 what it was, every thing out of place and out of shape. To a worse 
 chaos than this will the earth be reduced at the end of time, when it, 
 <I>and all the works that are therein, shall be burnt up.</I> 

 [2.] The <I>heavens</I> too are <I>without light,</I> as the earth is 
 without fruits. This alludes to the <I>darkness</I> that was <I>upon 
 the face of the deep</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:2">Gen. i. 2</A>),

 and represents God's displeasure against them, as the eclipse of the
 sun did at our Saviour's death. It was not only the earth that failed 
 them, but heaven also frowned upon them; and with their trouble they 
 had darkness, for they could not see through their troubles. The smoke 
 of their houses and cities which the enemy burnt, and the dust which 
 their army raised in its march, even darkened the sun, so that <I>the 
 heavens had no light.</I> Or it may be taken figuratively: <I>The 
 earth</I> (that is, the common people) was impoverished and in 
 confusion; and the <I>heavens</I> (that is, the princes and rulers) 
 <I>had no light,</I> no wisdom in themselves, nor were any comfort to 
 the people, nor a guide to them. Comp. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:29">Matt. xxiv. 29</A>.

 [3.] The <I>mountains trembled, and the hills moved lightly,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.
 
 So formidable were the appearances of God against his people, as in the
 days of old they had been for them, that <I>the mountains skipped like 
 rams and the little hills like lambs,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+114:4">Ps. cxiv. 4</A>.

 The <I>everlasting mountains</I> seemed to be <I>scattered,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:6">Hab. iii. 6</A>.

 The mountains on which they had worshipped their idols, the mountains
 over which they had looked for succours, all trembled, as if they had 
 been conscious of the people's guilt. The mountains, those among them
 that seemed to the highest and strongest, and of the firmest 
 resolution, trembled at the approach of the Chaldean army. The hills 
 moved lightly, as being eased of the burden of a sinful nation,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:24">Isa. i. 24</A>.

 [4.] Not the earth only, but the air, was dispeopled, and left 
 uninhabited

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>I beheld</I> the cities, the countries that used to be populous, 
 <I>and, lo, there was no man</I> to be seen; all the inhabitants were 
 either killed, or fled, or taken captives, such a ruining depopulating 
 thing is sin: nay, even <I>the birds of the heavens,</I> that used to 
 fly about and <I>sing among the branches,</I> had now <I>fled</I> away, 
 and were no more to be seen or heard. The <I>land of Judah</I> had now 
 become like the <I>lake of Sodom,</I> over which (they say) no bird 
 flies; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:23">Deut. xxix. 23</A>.

 The enemies shall make such havoc of the country that they shall not so
 much as leave a bird alive in it.

 [5.] Both the ground and the houses shall be laid waste

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>Lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness,</I> being deserted by the 
 inhabitants that should cultivate it, and then soon overgrown with 
 thorns and briers, or being trodden down by the destroying army of the 
 enemy. The <I>cities</I> also and their gates and walls are <I>broken 
 down</I> and levelled with the ground. Those that look no further than 
 second causes impute it to the policy and fury of the invaders; but the 
 prophet, who looks to the first cause, says that it is <I>at the 
 presence of the Lord,</I> at <I>his face</I> (that is, the anger of his 
 countenance), even <I>by his fierce anger,</I> that this was done. Even 
 angry men cannot do us any real hurt, unless God be angry with us. If 
 our <I>ways please him,</I> all is well. 

 [6.] The meaning of all this is that the nation shall be entirely 
 ruined, and every part of it shall share in the destruction; neither 
 town nor country shall escape. <I>First,</I> Not the country, for
 <I>the whole land shall be desolate,</I> corn land and pasture land, 
 both common and enclosed, it shall be laid waste

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>);

 the conquerors will have occasion for it all. <I>Secondly,</I> Not the 
 men, for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>)

 <I>the whole city shall flee,</I> all the inhabitants of the town shall 
 quit their habitations by consent, <I>for fear of the horsemen and 
 bowmen.</I> Rather than lie exposed to their fury, they shall <I>go 
 into the thickets,</I> where they are in danger of being torn by 
 briers, nay, to be torn in pieces by wild beasts; and they shall 
 <I>climb up upon the rocks,</I> where their lodging will be hard and 
 cold, and the precipice dangerous. Let us not be over-fond of our 
 houses and cities; for the time may come when rocks and thickets may be 
 preferable, and chosen rather. This shall be the common case, for 
 <I>every city shall be forsaken,</I> and <I>not a man</I> shall be left 
 that dares <I>dwell therein.</I> Both government and trade shall be at 
 an end, and all civil societies and incorporations dissolved. It is a 
 very dismal idea which this gives of the approaching desolation; but in 
 the midst of all these threatenings comes in one comfortable word 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>Yet will not I make a full end</I>--not a total consumption, for God 
 will reserve a remnant to himself, that shall be hidden in the day of 
 the Lord's anger--not a final consumption, for Jerusalem shall again be 
 built and the land inhabited. This comes in here, in the midst of the 
 threatenings, for the comfort of those that <I>trembled at God's 
 word;</I> and it intimates to us the changeableness of God's 
 providence; as it breaks down, so it raises up again; every end of our 
 comforts is not a full end, however we may be ready to think it so. It 
 also intimates the unchangeableness of God's covenant, which stands so 
 firmly, that, though he may correct his people severely, yet he will 
 not <I>cast them off,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:11"><I>ch.</I> xxx. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) Their case was helpless and without remedy. 

 [1.] God would not help them; so he tells them plainly,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 And, if the Lord do not help them, who can? This is that which makes
 their case deplorable. "<I>For this the earth mourns and the heavens
 above are black</I> (there are no prospects but what are very dismal), 
 <I>because I have spoken it;</I> I have given the word which shall not 
 be called back; <I>I have purposed it</I> (it is a consumption decreed, 
 determined) <I>and I will not repent,</I> not change this way, but 
 proceed in it, and will not <I>turn back from it.</I>" They would not 
 repent and turn back from the way of their sins

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:25"><I>ch.</I> ii. 25</A>),

 and therefore God will not repent and turn back from the way of his
 judgments. 
 
 [2.] They could not help themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:30,31"><I>v.</I> 30, 31</A>.

 When the thing appeared at a distance they flattered themselves with
 hopes that, though God should not appear for them as he had done for 
 Hezekiah against the Assyrian army, yet they should find some means or 
 other to secure themselves and give check to the forces of the enemy. 
 But the prophet tells them that, when it comes to the setting to, they 
 will be quite at a loss: "<I>When thou art spoiled, what wilt thou 
 do?</I> What course wilt thou take? Sit down now, and consider this in 
 time." He assures them that, whatever were now their contrivances and 
 confidences, <I>First,</I> They will then be despised by their allies 
 whom they depended upon for assistance. He had often compared the sin 
 of Jerusalem to whoredom, not only her idolatry, but her trust in 
 creatures, in the neighbouring powers. Now here he compares her to a 
 harlot abandoned by all the lewd ones that used to make court to her.
 She is supposed to do all she can to keep up her interest in their 
 affections. She does what she can to make herself appear considerable 
 among the nations, and a valuable ally. She compliments them by her 
 ambassadors to the highest degree, to engage them to stand by her now 
 in her distress. She <I>clothes herself with crimson,</I> as if she 
 were rich, and <I>decks herself with ornaments of gold,</I> as if her 
 treasuries were still as full as ever they had been. She <I>rents her 
 face with painting,</I> puts the best colours she can upon her present 
 distresses and does her utmost to palliate and extenuate her losses, 
 sets a good face upon them. But this painting, though it beautifies the 
 face for the present, really rends it; the frequent use of paint spoils 
 the skin, cracks it, and makes it rough; so the case which by false 
 colours has been made to appear better than really it was, when truth 
 comes to light, will look so much the worse. "And, after all, <I>in
 vain shalt thou make thyself fair;</I> all thy neighbours are sensible 
 how low thou art brought; the Chaldeans will strip thee of thy crimson 
 and ornaments, and then thy confederates will not only slight thee and 
 refuse to give thee any succour, but they will join with those that 
 <I>seek thy life,</I> that they may come in for a share in the prey of 
 so rich a country." Here seems to be an allusion to the story of 
 Jezebel, who thought, by making herself look fair and fine, to outface 
 her doom, but in vain, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:30,33">2 Kings ix. 30, 33</A>.

 See what creatures prove when we confide in them, how treacherous they
 are; instead of saving the life, they seek the life; they often change, 
 so that they will sooner do us an ill turn than any service. And see to 
 how little purpose it is for those that have by sin deformed themselves 
 in God's eyes to think by any arts they can use to beautify themselves 
 in the eye of the world. <I>Secondly,</I> They will then be themselves
 in despair; they will find their troubles to be like the pains of a 
 woman in travail, which she cannot escape: <I>I have heard the voice of 
 the daughter of Zion,</I> her groans echoing to the triumphal shouts of 
 the Chaldean army, which he heard,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 It is like the <I>voice of a woman in travail,</I> whose pain is
 exquisite, and the fruit of sin and the curse too 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:16">Gen. iii. 16</A>),

 and exhorts lamentable outcries, especially of a <I>woman in travail of
 her first child,</I> who, having never known before what that pain is, 
 is the more terrified by it. Troubles are most grievous to those that 
 have not been used to them. Zion, in this distress, since her 
 neighbours refuse to pity her, <I>bewails herself,</I> fetching <I>deep 
 sighs</I> (so the word signifies), and she <I>spreads her hands,</I> 
 either wringing them for grief or reaching them forth for succour. All 
 the cry is, <I>Woe is me now!</I> (now that the decree has gone forth 
 against her and is past recall), for <I>my soul is wearied because of 
 murderers.</I> The Chaldean soldiers put all to the sword that gave 
 them any opposition, so that the land was full of murders. Zion was 
 weary of hearing tragical stories from all parts of the country, and 
 cried out, <I>Woe is me!</I> It was well if their sufferings put them 
 in mind of their sins, the murders committed upon them of the murders 
 committed by them; for God was now making inquisition for the 
 <I>innocent blood</I> shed in Jerusalem, <I>which the Lord would not 
 pardon,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:4">2 Kings xxiv. 4</A>.

 Note, As sin will find out the sinner, so sorrow will, sooner or later,
 find out the secure.</P>
