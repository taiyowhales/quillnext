 The prophet having in God's name reproved the people for their sins, 
 and given them warning of the judgments of God that were coming upon 
 them, in this chapter prosecutes the same intention for their 
 humiliation and awakening. 

 I. He shows them the invalidity of the plea they so much relied on,
 that they had the temple of God among them and constantly attended the 
 service of it, and endeavours to take them off from their confidence in 
 their external privileges and performances, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:1-11">ver. 1-11</A>.

 II. He reminds them of the desolations of Shiloh, and foretels that
 such should be the desolations of Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:12-16">ver. 12-16</A>.

 III. He represents to the prophet their abominable idolatries, for
 which he was thus incensed against them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:17-20">ver. 17-20</A>.

 IV. He sets before the people that fundamental maxim of religion that
 "to obey is better than sacrifice" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:22">1 Sam. xv. 22</A>),

 and that God would not accept the sacrifices of those that obstinately 
 persisted in disobedience, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:21-28">ver. 21-28</A>.

 V. He threatens to lay the land utterly waste for their idolatry and 
 impiety, and to multiply their slain as they had multiplied their sin,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The word that came to Jeremiah from the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Stand in the gate of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s house, and proclaim there
 this word, and say, Hear the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, all <I>ye of</I> Judah,
 that enter in at these gates to worship the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 3  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your
 ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this
 place.
 &nbsp; 4  Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 The temple of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, The temple of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>are</I> these.
 &nbsp; 5  For if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye
 throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour;
 &nbsp; 6  <I>If</I> ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the
 widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk
 after other gods to your hurt:
 &nbsp; 7  Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land
 that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever.
 &nbsp; 8  Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit.
 &nbsp; 9  Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear
 falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods
 whom ye know not;
 &nbsp; 10  And come and stand before me in this house, which is called
 by my name, and say, We are delivered to do all these
 abominations?
 &nbsp; 11  Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of
 robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen <I>it,</I> saith the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 12  But go ye now unto my place which <I>was</I> in Shiloh, where I
 set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the
 wickedness of my people Israel.
 &nbsp; 13  And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and I spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye
 heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not;
 &nbsp; 14  Therefore will I do unto <I>this</I> house, which is called by my
 name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you
 and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.
 &nbsp; 15  And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all
 your brethren, <I>even</I> the whole seed of Ephraim.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These verses begin another sermon, which is continued in this and the 
 two following chapters, much to the same effect with those before, to 
 reason them to repentance. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The orders given to the prophet to preach this sermon; for he had 
 not only a general commission, but particular directions and 
 instructions for every message he delivered. This was <I>a word</I> 
 that <I>came to him from the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 We are not told when this sermon was to be preached; but are told, 

 1. Where it must be preached--<I>in the gate of the Lord's house,</I>
 through which they entered into the outer court, or the <I>court of the 
 people.</I> It would affront the priests, and expose the prophet to 
 their rage, to have such a message as this delivered within their 
 precincts; but the prophet must not fear the face of man, he cannot be 
 faithful to his God if he do. 

 2. To whom it must be preached--to the men of <I>Judah, that enter in 
 at these gates to worship the Lord;</I> probably it was at one of three 
 feasts, when all the males from all parts of the country were to appear 
 before the Lord in the courts of his house, and not to <I>appear 
 empty:</I> then he had many together to preach to, and that was the 
 most seasonable time to admonish them not to trust to their privileges. 
 Note,

 (1.) Even those that profess religion have need to be preached to as 
 well as those that are without.

 (2.) It is desirable to have opportunity of preaching to many together.
 Wisdom chooses to cry <I>in the chief place of concourse,</I> and, as 
 Jeremiah here, <I>in the opening of the gates,</I> the temple-gates.
 
 (3.) When we are going to worship God we have need to be admonished to
 <I>worship him in the spirit,</I> and <I>to have no confidence in the 
 flesh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:3">Phil. iii. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The contents and scope of the sermon itself. It is delivered in the 
 name of <I>the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel,</I> who commands the 
 world, but covenants with his people. As creatures we are bound to 
 regard the <I>Lord of hosts,</I> as Christians <I>the God of 
 Israel;</I> what he said to them he says to us, and it is much the same 
 with that which John Baptist said to those whom he baptized 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:8,9">Matt. iii. 8, 9</A>),

 <I>Bring forth fruits meet for repentance; and think not to say within
 yourselves, We have Abraham to our father.</I> The prophet here tells 
 them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What were the true words of God, which they might trust to. In 
 short, they might depend upon it that if they would repent and reform 
 their lives, and return to God in a way of duty, he would restore and 
 confirm their peace, would redress their grievances, and return to them 
 in a way of mercy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Amend your ways and your doings.</I> This implies that there had
 been much amiss in their ways and doings, many faults and errors. But 
 it is a great instance of the favour of God to them that he gives them 
 liberty to amend, shows them where and how they must amend, and 
 promises to accept them upon their amendment: "<I>I will cause you to 
 dwell</I> quietly and peaceably <I>in this place,</I> and a stop shall 
 be put to that which threatens your expulsion." Reformation is the only 
 way, and a sure way to ruin. He explains himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:5-7"><I>v.</I> 5-7</A>),

 and tells them particularly,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What the amendment was which he expected from them. They must 
 <I>thoroughly amend;</I> in <I>making good,</I> they must <I>make good 
 their ways and doings;</I> they must reform with resolution, and it 
 must be a universal, constant, preserving reformation--not partial, but
 entire--not hypocritical, but sincere--not wavering, but constant. They
 must make the tree good, and so make the fruit good, must amend their 
 hearts and thoughts, and so amend their ways and doings. In particular, 
 
 [1.] They must be honest and just in all their dealings. Those that had 
 power in their hands must <I>thoroughly execute judgment between a man 
 and his neighbour,</I> without partiality, and according as the merits 
 of the cause appeared. They must not either in judgment or in contract 
 <I>oppress the stranger, the fatherless, or the widow,</I> nor 
 countenance or protect those that did oppress, nor refuse to do them 
 justice when they sought for it. They must <I>not shed innocent 
 blood,</I> and with it defile <I>this place</I> and the land wherein 
 they dwelt. 

 [2.] They must keep closely to the worship of the true God only: 
 "<I>Neither walk after other gods;</I> do not hanker after them, nor 
 hearken to those that would draw you into communion with idolaters; for 
 it is, and will be, <I>to your own hurt.</I> Be not only so just to 
 your God, but so wise for yourselves, as not to throw away your 
 adorations upon those who are not able to help you, and thereby provoke 
 him who is able to destroy you." Well, this is all that God insists 
 upon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He tells them what the establishment is which, upon this 
 amendment, they may expect from him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "Set about such a work of reformation as this with all speed, go 
 through with it, and abide by it; <I>and I will cause you to dwell in 
 this place,</I> this temple; it shall continue your place of resort and 
 refuge, the place of your comfortable meeting with God and one another; 
 and you shall dwell <I>in the land that I gave to your fathers for ever 
 and ever,</I> and it shall never be turned out either from God's house 
 or from your own." It is promised that they shall still enjoy their 
 civil and sacred privileges, that they shall have a comfortable 
 enjoyment of them: <I>I will cause you to dwell here;</I> and those 
 dwell at ease to whom God gives a settlement. They shall enjoy it by 
 covenant, by virtue of the grant made of it to their fathers, not by 
 providence, but by promise. They shall continue in the enjoyment of it
 without eviction or molestation; they shall not be disturbed, much less 
 dispossessed, <I>for ever and ever;</I> nothing but sin could throw 
 them out. An everlasting inheritance in the heavenly Canaan is hereby 
 secured to all that live in godliness and honesty. And the vulgar Latin 
 reads a further privilege here, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:3,7"><I>v.</I> 3, 7</A>.

 <I>Habitabo vobiscum--I will dwell with you in this place;</I> and we
 should find Canaan itself but an uncomfortable place to dwell in if God 
 did not dwell with us there.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What were the lying words of their own hearts, which they must not 
 trust to. He cautions them against this self-deceit 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>Trust no in lying words.</I> You are told in what way, and upon 
 what terms, you may be easy safe, and happy; now do not flatter 
 yourselves with an opinion that you may be so on any other terms, or in 
 any other way." Yet he charges them with this self-deceit arising from 
 vanity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>Behold,</I> it is plain that <I>you</I> do <I>trust in lying 
 words,</I> notwithstanding what is said to you; you trust in <I>words 
 that cannot profit;</I> you rely upon a plea that will stand you in no 
 stead." Those that slight the words of truth, which would profit them, 
 take shelter in words of falsehood, which cannot profit them. Now
 these lying words were, "<I>The temple of the Lord, the temple of the 
 Lord, the temple of the Lord are these.</I> These buildings, the 
 courts, the holy place, and the holy of holies, are the <I>temple of 
 the Lord,</I> built by his appointment, to his glory; here he resides, 
 here he is worshipped, here we meet three times a year to pay our 
 homage to him as our King in his palace." This they thought was 
 security enough to them to keep God and his favours from leaving them, 
 God and his judgments from breaking in upon them. When the prophets 
 told them how sinful they were, and how miserable they were likely to 
 be, still they appealed to the temple: "How can we be either so or so, 
 as long as we have that holy happy place among us?" The prophet repeats 
 it because they repeated it upon all occasions. It was the cant of the 
 times; it was in their mouths upon all occasions. If they heard an 
 awakening sermon, if any startling piece of news was brought to them, 
 they lulled themselves asleep again with this, "We cannot but do well, 
 for we have <I>the temple of the Lord among us.</I>" Note, The 
 privileges of a <I>form of godliness</I> are often the pride and 
 confidence of those that are strangers and enemies to the power of it.
 It is common for those that are furthest from God to boast themselves 
 most of their being near to the church. They are <I>haughty because of 
 the holy mountain</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:11">Zeph. iii. 11</A>),

 as if God's mercy were so tied to them that they might defy his
 justice. Now to convince them what a frivolous plea this was, and what 
 little stead it would stand them in,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He shows them the gross absurdity of it in itself. If they knew 
 any thing either of the <I>temple of the Lord</I> or of the <I>Lord of 
 the temple,</I> they must think that to plead that, either in excuse of 
 their sin against God or in arrest of God's judgment against them, was 
 the most ridiculous unreasonable thing that could be. 

 [1.] God is a holy God; but this plea made him the patron of sin, of 
 the worst of sins, which even the light of nature condemns,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 "What," says he, "<I>will you steal, murder, and commit adultery,</I>
 be guilty of the vilest immoralities, and which the common interest, as 
 well as the common sense, of mankind witness against? <I>Will you swear 
 falsely,</I> a crime which all nations (who with the belief of a God 
 have had a veneration for an oath) have always had a horror of? Will 
 <I>you burn incense to Baal,</I> a dunghill-deity, that sets up as a 
 rival with the great Jehovah, and, not content with that, <I>will you 
 walk after other gods</I> too, <I>whom you know not,</I> and by all 
 these crimes put a daring affront upon God, both as <I>the Lord of 
 hosts</I> and as the <I>God of Israel?</I> Will you exchange a God of 
 whose power and goodness you have had such a long experience for gods 
 of whose ability and willingness to help you you know nothing? And, 
 when you have thus done the worst you can against God, will you brazen 
 your faces so far as to come and <I>stand before him in this house 
 which is called by his name</I> and in which his name is called 
 upon--stand before him as servants waiting his commands, as supplicants 
 expecting his favour? Will you act in open rebellion against him, and 
 yet herd among his subjects, among the best of them? By this, it should 
 seem, you think that either he does not discover or does not dislike 
 your wicked practices, to imagine either of which is to put the highest 
 indignity possible upon him. It is as if you should say, <I>We are 
 delivered to do all these abominations.</I>" If they had not the front 
 to say this, <I>totidem verbis--in so many words,</I> yet their actions 
 spoke it aloud. They could not but own that God, even their own God, 
 had many a time delivered them, and been a present help to them, when 
 otherwise they must have perished. He, in delivering them, designed to 
 reduce them to himself, and by his goodness to lead them to repentance; 
 but they resolved to persist in their abominations notwithstanding. As 
 soon as they were delivered (as of old in the days of the Judges) they 
 <I>did evil again in the sight of the Lord,</I> which was in effect to 
 say, in direct contradiction to the true intent and meaning of the 
 providences which had affected them, that God had delivered them in 
 order to put them again into a capacity of rebelling against him, by 
 sacrificing the more profusely to their idols. Note, Those who continue 
 in sin because grace has abounded, or that grace may abound, do in 
 effect their idols. Note, Those who continue in sin because grace has 
 abounded, or that grace may abound, do in effect make Christ the 
 minister of sin. Some take it thus: "You present yourselves before God 
 with your sacrifices and sin-offerings, and then say, <I>We are 
 delivered,</I> we are discharged from our guilt, now it shall do us no 
 hurt; when all this is but to blind the world, and stop the mouth of 
 conscience, that you may, the more easily to yourselves and the more 
 plausibly before others, <I>do all these abominations.</I>" 

 [2.] His temple was a holy place; but this plea made it a protection to 
 the most unholy persons: "<I>Has this house, which is called by my 
 name</I> and is a standing sign of God's kingdom of sin and 
 Satan--<I>has this become a den of robbers in your eyes?</I> Do you 
 think it was built to be not only a rendezvous of, but a refuge and 
 shelter to, the vilest of malefactors?" No; though the horns of the 
 altar were a sanctuary to him that slew a man unawares, yet they were 
 not so to a wilful murderer, nor to one that did aught presumptuously, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+21:14,1Ki+2:29">Exod. xxi. 14; 1 Kings ii. 29</A>.

 Those that think to excuse themselves in unchristian practices with the
 Christian name, and sin the more boldly and securely because there is a 
 sin-offering provided, do, in effect, make God's house of prayer a den 
 of thieves, as the priests in Christ's time,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:13">Matt. xxi. 13</A>.

 But could they thus impose upon God? No: <I>Behold, I have seen it,
 saith the Lord,</I> have seen the real iniquity through the counterfeit 
 and dissembled piety. Note, Though men may deceive one another with the 
 appearances of devotion, yet they cannot deceive God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He shows them the insufficiency of this plea adjudged long since 
 in the case of Shiloh. 

 [1.] It is certain that Shiloh was ruined, though it had God's 
 sanctuary in it, when by its wickedness it profaned that sanctuary

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>Go you now to my place which was in Shiloh.</I> It is probable that 
 the ruins of that once flourishing city were yet remaining; they might, 
 at least, read the history of it, which ought to affect them as if they 
 saw the place. There God <I>set his name at the first,</I> there the 
 tabernacle was set up when Israel first took possession of Canaan 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:1">John xviii. 1</A>),

 and thither the tribes went up; but those that attended the service of
 the tabernacle there corrupted both themselves and others, and from 
 them arose the <I>wickedness of his people Israel;</I> that fountain 
 was poisoned, and sent forth malignant streams; and what came of it? 
 No; God <I>forsook</I> it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:60">Ps. lxxviii. 60</A>),

 sent his ark into captivity, cut off the house of Eli that presided
 there; and it is very probable that the city was quite destroyed, for 
 we never read any more of it but as a monument of divine vengeance upon 
 holy places when they harbour wicked people. Note, God's judgments
 upon others, who have really revolted from God while they have kept up 
 a profession of nearness to him, should be a warning to us not to 
 <I>trust in lying words.</I> It is good to consult precedents, and make 
 use of them. <I>Remember Lot's wife;</I> remember Shiloh and the seven
 churches of Asia; and know that the ark and candlestick are moveable 
 things, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:5,Mt+21:43">Rev. ii. 5; Matt. xxi. 43</A>.

 [2.] It is as certain that Shiloh's fate will be Jerusalem's doom if a
 speedy and sincere repentance prevent it not. <I>First,</I> Jerusalem
 was now as sinful as ever Shiloh was; that is proved by the unerring 
 testimony of God himself against them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):
 
 "<I>You have done all these works,</I> you cannot deny it:" and they 
 continued obstinate in their sin; that is proved by the testimony of 
 God's return and repent, <I>rising up early and speaking,</I> as one in 
 care, as one in earnest, as one who would lose no time in dealing with 
 them, nay, who would take the fittest opportunity for speaking to them 
 early <I>in the morning,</I> when, if ever, they were sober, and had 
 their thoughts free and clear; but it was all in vain. God spoke, but 
 they <I>heard not,</I> they heeded not, they never minded; he <I>called 
 them,</I> but they <I>answered not;</I> they would not come at his 
 call. Note, What God has spoken to us greatly aggravates what we have 
 done against him. <I>Secondly,</I> Jerusalem shall shortly be as
 miserable as ever Shiloh was: <I>Therefore I will do unto this house as 
 I did to Shiloh,</I> ruin it, and lay it waste, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Those that tread in the steps of the wickedness of those that went
 before them must expect to fall by the like judgments, for all these 
 things <I>happened to them for ensamples.</I> The temple at Jerusalem, 
 though ever so strongly built, if wickedness was found in it, would be 
 as unable to keep its ground and as easily conquered as even the 
 tabernacle in Shiloh was, when God's day of vengeance had come. "This 
 house" (says God) "is <I>called by my name,</I> and therefore you may 
 think that I should protect it; it is the house <I>in which you 
 trust,</I> and you think that it will protect you; this land is <I>the 
 place,</I> this city <I>the place, which I gave to you and your 
 fathers,</I> and therefore you are secure of the continuance of it, and 
 think that nothing can turn you out of it; but the men of Shiloh thus 
 flattered themselves and did but deceive themselves." He quotes another 
 precedent

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 the ruin of the kingdom of the ten tribes, who were the seed of 
 Abraham, and had the covenant of circumcision, and possessed the land 
 which God gave to them and their fathers, and yet the idolatries threw 
 them out and extirpated them: "And can you think but that the same evil 
 courses will be as fatal to you?" Doubtless they will be so; for God is 
 uniform and of a piece with himself in his judicial proceedings. It is 
 a rule of justice, <I>ut parium par sit ratio--that in similar cases 
 the same judgment should proceed.</I> "You have corrupted <I>yourselves 
 as your brethren</I> the <I>seed of Ephraim</I> did, and have become 
 their brethren in iniquity, and therefore I will <I>cast you out of my 
 sight, as I have cast them.</I>" The interpretation here given of the 
 judgment makes it a terrible one indeed; the casting of them out of 
 their land signified God's casting them out of his sight, as if he 
 would never look upon them, never look after them, more. Whenever we 
 are cast, it is well enough, if we be kept in the love of God; but, if 
 we are thrown out of his favour, our case is miserable though we dwell 
 in our own land. This threatening, that God would make this house like 
 Shiloh, we shall meet with again, and find Jeremiah indicted for it,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry
 nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will
 not hear thee.
 &nbsp; 17  Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in
 the streets of Jerusalem?
 &nbsp; 18  The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire,
 and the women knead <I>their</I> dough, to make cakes to the queen of
 heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that
 they may provoke me to anger.

 <I>provoke</I> themselves to the confusion of their own faces?

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God had shown them, in the foregoing verses, that the temple and the 
 service of it, of which they boasted and in which they trusted, should 
 not avail to prevent the judgment threatened. But there was another 
 thing which might stand them in some stead, and which yet they had no 
 value for, and that was the prophet's intercession for them; his 
 prayers would do them more good than their own pleas: now here that 
 support is taken from them; and their case is said indeed who have lost 
 their interest in the prayers of God's ministers and people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God here forbids the prophet to pray for them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 "The decree has gone forth, their ruin is resolved on, therefore 
 <I>pray not thou for this people,</I> that is, pray not for the 
 preventing of this judgment threatened; they have <I>sinned unto 
 death,</I> and therefore pray not for their life, but for the life of 
 their souls," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:16">1 John v. 16</A>.
 
 See here,

 1. That God's prophets are praying men; Jeremiah foretold the
 destruction of Judah and Jerusalem, and yet prayed for their 
 preservation, not knowing that the decree was absolute; and it is the 
 will of God that we <I>pray for the peace of Jerusalem.</I> Even when 
 we threaten sinners with damnation we must pray for their salvation, 
 that they may <I>turn and live.</I> Jeremiah was hated, and persecuted, 
 and reproached, by the children of his people, and yet he prayed for 
 them; for it becomes us to render good for evil. 

 2. That God's praying prophets have a great interest in heaven, how 
 little soever they have on earth. When God has determined to destroy 
 this people, he bespeaks the prophet not to pray for them, because he 
 would not have his prayers to lie (as prophets' prayers seldom did) 
 unanswered. God said to Moses, <I>Let me alone,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:10">Exod. xxii. 10</A>.

 3. It is an ill omen to a people when God restrains the spirits of his
 ministers and people from praying for them, and gives them to see their 
 case so desperate that they have no heart to speak a good word for 
 them. 

 4. Those that will not regard good ministers' preaching cannot expect 
 any benefit by their praying. If you will not hear us when we speak 
 from God to you, God will not hear us when we speak to him for you.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He gives him a reason for this prohibition. Praying breath is too 
 precious a thing to be lost and thrown away upon a people hardened in 
 sin and marked for ruin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They are resolved to persist in their rebellion against God, and 
 will not be turned back by the prophet's preaching. For this he appeals 
 to the prophet himself, and his own inspection and observation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):
 
 <I>Seest thou not what they do</I> openly and publicly, without either 
 shame or fear, <I>in the cities of Judah and in the streets of 
 Jerusalem?</I> This intimates both that the sin was evident and could 
 not be denied and that the sinners were impudent and would not be 
 reclaimed; they committed their wickedness even in the prophet's 
 presence and under his eye; he saw what they did, and yet they did it, 
 which was an affront to his office, and to him whose officer he was, 
 and bade defiance to both. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What the sin is with which they are here charged--it is idolatry,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Their idolatrous respects are paid to the <I>queen of heaven,</I> the
 moon, either in an image or in the original, or both. They worshipped
 it probably under the name of <I>Ashtaroth,</I> or some other of their 
 goddesses, being in love with the brightness in which they saw the moon 
 walk, and thinking themselves indebted to her for her benign influences 
 or fearing her malignant ones, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:26">Job xxxi. 26</A>.

 The worshipping of the moon was much in use among the heathen nations,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+44:17,19"><I>ch.</I> xliv. 17, 19</A>.

 Some read it the <I>frame</I> or <I>workmanship of heaven.</I> The
 whole celestial globe with all its ornaments and powers was the object 
 of their adoration. They <I>worshipped the host of heaven,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:42">Acts vii. 42</A>.

 The homage they should have paid to their Prince they paid to the
 statues that beautified the frontispiece of his palace; they worshipped 
 the creatures instead of him that made them, the servants instead of 
 him that commands them, and the gifts instead of him that gave them.
 <I>With the queen of heaven</I> they worshipped <I>other gods,</I> 
 images of things not only in <I>heaven above, but in earth beneath, and 
 in the waters under the earth;</I> for those that forsake the true God 
 wander endlessly after false ones. To these deities of their own making 
 they offer <I>cakes</I> for meat-offerings, and <I>pour out 
 drink-offerings,</I> as if they had their meat and drink from them and 
 were obliged to make to them their acknowledgments: and see how busy 
 they are, and how every hand is employed in the service of these idols, 
 according as they used to be employed in their domestic services.
 <I>The children</I> were sent to <I>gather wood; the fathers kindled 
 the fire</I> to heat the oven, being of the poorer sort that could not 
 afford to keep servants to do it, yet they would rather do it 
 themselves than it should be undone; <I>the women kneaded the dough</I> 
 with their own hands, for perhaps, though they had servants to do it, 
 they took a pride in showing their zeal for their idols by doing it 
 themselves. Let us be instructed, even by this bad example, in the 
 service of our God.

 [1.] Let us <I>honour him with our substance,</I> as those that have 
 our subsistence from him, and eat and drink to the glory of him from 
 whom we have our meat and drink. 

 [2.] Let us not decline the hardest services, nor disdain to stoop to 
 the meanest, by which God may be honoured; for none shall <I>kindle a 
 fire on God's altar for nought.</I> Let us think it an honour to be 
 employed in any work for God. 

 [3.] Let us bring up our children in the acts of devotion; let them, as 
 they are capable, be employed in doing something towards the keeping up 
 of religious exercises.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What is the direct tendency of this sin: "It is <I>that they may 
 provoke me to anger;</I> they cannot design any thing else in it. But 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>)

 <I>do they provoke me to anger?</I> Is it because I am hard to be 
 pleased, or easily provoked? Or am I to bear the blame of the 
 resentment? No; it is their own doing; they may thank themselves, and 
 they alone shall bear it." <I>Is it against God that they provoke him 
 to wrath?</I> Is he the worse for it? Does it do him any real damage?
 No; is <I>it not against themselves,</I> to the <I>confusion of their 
 own faces?</I> It is malice against God, but it is impotent malice; it 
 cannot hurt him: nay, it is foolish malice; it will hurt themselves.
 They show their spite against God, but they do the spite to themselves.
 Canst thou think any other than that a people, thus desperately set 
 upon their own ruin, should be abandoned?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. God is resolved to proceed in his judgments against them, and will 
 not be turned back by the prophet's prayers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>Thus saith the Lord God,</I> and what he saith he will not unsay, 
 nor can all the world gainsay it; hear it therefore, and tremble. 
 "<I>Behold, my anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this 
 place,</I> as the flood of waters was upon the old world or the shower 
 of fire and brimstone upon Sodom; since they will anger me, let them 
 see what will come of it." They shall soon find, 

 (1.) That there is no escaping this deluge of fire, either by flying 
 from it or fencing against it; it shall be poured out on <I>this 
 place,</I> though it be a holy place, the Lord's house. It shall reach 
 both <I>man and beast,</I> like the plagues of Egypt, and, like some of 
 them, shall destroy the <I>trees of the field and the fruit of the 
 ground,</I> which they had designed and <I>prepared for Baal,</I> and 
 of which they had made <I>cakes to the queen of heaven.</I> 

 (2.) There is no extinguishing it: <I>It shall burn and shall not be 
 quenched;</I> prayers and tears shall then avail nothing. When <I>his 
 wrath is kindled but a little,</I> much more when it is kindled to such 
 a degree, there shall be no quenching it. God's wrath is that fire 
 unquenchable which eternity itself will not see the period of.
 <I>Depart, you cursed, into everlasting fire.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your
 burnt offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh.
 &nbsp; 22  For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the
 day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning
 burnt offerings or sacrifices:
 &nbsp; 23  But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and
 I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all
 the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you.
 &nbsp; 24  But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked
 in the counsels <I>and</I> in the imagination of their evil heart, and
 went backward, and not forward.
 &nbsp; 25  Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land
 of Egypt unto this day I have even sent unto you all my servants
 the prophets, daily rising up early and sending <I>them:</I>
 &nbsp; 26  Yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but
 hardened their neck: they did worse than their fathers.
 &nbsp; 27  Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but
 they will not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them;
 but they will not answer thee.
 &nbsp; 28  But thou shalt say unto them, This <I>is</I> a nation that
 obeyeth not the voice of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> their God, nor receiveth
 correction: truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God, having shown the people that the temple would not protect them 
 while they polluted it with their wickedness, here shows them that 
 their sacrifices would not atone for them, nor be accepted, while they 
 went on in disobedience. See with what contempt he here speaks of their 
 ceremonial service 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>).

 "<I>Put your burnt-offerings to your sacrifices;</I> go on in them as 
 long as you please; add one sort of sacrifice to another; turn your 
 <I>burnt-offerings</I> (which were to be wholly burnt to the honour of 
 God) into <I>peace-offerings</I>" (which the offerer himself had a 
 considerable share of), "that you may <I>eat flesh,</I> for that is all 
 the good you are likely to have from your sacrifices, a good meal's 
 meat or two; but expect not any other benefit by them while you live at 
 this loose rate. <I>Keep your sacrifices to yourselves</I>" (so some 
 understand it); "let them be served up at your own table, for they are 
 no way acceptable at God's altars." For the opening of this,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He shows them that obedience was the only thing he required of them, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>.

 He appeals to the original contract, by which they were first formed
 into a people, when they were brought out of Egypt. God made them a 
 <I>kingdom of priests</I> to himself, not that he might be regaled with 
 their sacrifices, as the devils, whom the heathen worshipped, which are 
 represented as eating with pleasure the fat of their sacrifices and 
 drinking the wine of their drink-offerings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:38">Deut. xxxii. 38</A>.

 No: <I>Will God eat the flesh of bulls?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:13">Ps. l. 13</A>.

 <I>I spoke not to your fathers concerning burnt-offerings or
 sacrifices,</I> not of them <I>at first.</I> The precepts of the moral 
 law were given before the ceremonial institutions; and those came 
 afterwards, as trials of their obedience and assistances to their 
 repentance and faith. The Levitical law begins thus: <I>If any man of 
 you will bring an offering,</I> he must do so and so

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+1:2,2:1">Lev. i. 2, ii. 1</A>),

 as if it were intended rather to regulate sacrifice than to require it. 
 But that which God commanded, which he bound them to by his supreme 
 authority and which he insisted upon as the condition of the covenant,
 was, <I>Obey my voice;</I> see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:26">Exod. xv. 26</A>,

 where this was the statute and the ordinance by which God proved them:
 <I>Hearken diligently to the voice of the Lord thy God.</I> The 
 condition of their being God's peculiar people was this

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:5">Exod. xix. 5</A>),

 <I>If you will obey my voice indeed.</I> "Make conscience of the duties
 of natural religion, observe positive institutions from a principle of 
 obedience, and then <I>I will be your God and you shall be my 
 people,</I>" which is the greatest honour, happiness, and satisfaction, 
 that any of the children of men are capable of. "Let your conversation 
 be regular, and in every thing study to comply with the will and word 
 of God; <I>walk</I> within the bounds that I have set you, and <I>in 
 all the ways that I have commanded you,</I> and then you may assure 
 yourselves that <I>it shall be well with you.</I>" The demand here is 
 very reasonable, that we should be directed by Infinite Wisdom to that 
 which is fit, that he that made us should command us, and that he 
 should give us law who gives us our being and all the supports of it; 
 and the promise is very encouraging: Let God's will be your rule and 
 his favour shall be your felicity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He shows them that disobedience was the only thing for which he had 
 a quarrel with them. <I>He would not reprove them for their 
 sacrifices,</I> for the omission of them; they had been <I>continually 
 before him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:8">Ps. l. 8</A>);

 with them they hoped to bribe God, and purchase a license to go on in
 sin. That therefore which God had all along laid to their charge was 
 breaking his commandments in the course of their conversation, while 
 they observed them, in some instances, in the course of their devotion,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>,

 &c.

 1. They set up their own will in competition with the will of God:
 <I>They hearkened not</I> to God and to his law; they never heeded 
 that; it was to them as if it had never been given or were of no force; 
 they <I>inclined not their ear</I> to attend to it, much less their 
 hearts to comply with it. But they would have their own way, would do 
 as they chose, and not as they were bidden. <I>Their own counsels</I> 
 were their guide, and not the dictates of divine wisdom; that shall be 
 lawful and good with them which they think so, though the word of God 
 says quite contrary. <I>The imagination of their evil heart,</I> the 
 appetites and passions of it, shall be a law to them, and they will 
 walk in the way of it, and in the sight of their eyes.

 2. If they began well, yet they did not proceed, but soon flew off. 
 They <I>went backward,</I> when they talked of making a captain, and 
 returning to Egypt again, and would not go forward under God's conduct. 
 They promised fair: <I>All that the Lord shall say unto us we well 
 do;</I> and, if they would but have kept in that good mind, all would 
 have been well; but, instead of going on in the way of duty, they drew 
 back into the way of sin, and were worse than ever. 

 3. When God sent to them by word of mouth to put them in mind of the
 written word, which was the business of the prophets, it was all one; 
 still they were disobedient. God had servants of his among them in
 every age, <I>since they came out of Egypt unto this day,</I> some or 
 other to tell them of their faults and put them in mind of their duty, 
 whom he <I>rose up early to send</I> (as before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 as men rise up early to call servants to their work; but they were as
 deaf to the prophets as they were to the law

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>Yet they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear.</I> This had been 
 their way and manner all along; they were of the same stubborn 
 refractory disposition with those that went before them; it had all 
 along been the genius of the nation, and an evil genius it was, that 
 continually haunted them till it ruined them at last. 

 4. Their practice and character were still the same. They are worse, 
 and not better, <I>than their fathers.</I>

 (1.) Jeremiah can himself witness against them that they were 
 disobedient, or he shall soon find it so

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):
 
 "<I>Thou shalt speak all these words to them,</I> shalt particularly 
 charge them with disobedience and obstinacy. But even that will not 
 work upon them: <I>They will not hearken to thee,</I> nor heed thee. 
 Thou shalt go, and <I>call to them</I> with all the plainness and 
 earnestness imaginable, but<I> they will not answer thee;</I> they will 
 either give thee no answer at all or not an obedient answer; they will 
 not come at thy call." 

 (2.) He must therefore own that they deserved the character of a 
 disobedient people, that were ripe for destruction, and must go to them 
 and tell them so to their faces

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 "<I>Say unto them, This is a nation that obeys not the voice of the 
 Lord their God.</I> They are notorious for their obstinacy; they 
 sacrifice to the Lord as their God, but they will not be ruled by him 
 as their God; they will not receive either the instruction of his word 
 or the correction of his rod; they will not be reclaimed or reformed by 
 either. <I>Truth has perished</I> among them; they cannot receive it; 
 they will not submit to it nor be governed by it. They will not speak 
 truth; there is no believing a word they say, for it is <I>cut off from 
 their mouth,</I> and lying comes in the room of it. They are false both 
 to God and man."</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>29  Cut off thine hair, <I>O Jerusalem,</I> and cast <I>it</I> away, and
 take up a lamentation on high places; for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath rejected
 and forsaken the generation of his wrath.
 &nbsp; 30  For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: they have set their abominations in the house which is
 called by my name, to pollute it.
 &nbsp; 31  And they have built the high places of Tophet, which <I>is</I> in

 of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A loud call to weeping and mourning. Jerusalem, that had been a 
 joyous city, the joy of the whole earth, must now <I>take up a 
 lamentation on high places</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 the high places where they had served their idols; there must they now 
 bemoan their misery. In token both of sorrow and slavery, Jerusalem 
 must now <I>cut off her hair and cast it away;</I> the word is peculiar 
 to the hair of the Nazarites, which was the badge and token of their 
 dedication to God, and it is called <I>their crown.</I> Jerusalem had 
 been a city which was a Nazarite to God, but now must <I>cut off her 
 hair,</I> must be profaned, degraded, and separated from God, as she 
 had been separated to him. It is time for those that have lost their 
 holiness to lay aside their joy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Just cause given for this great lamentation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The sin of Jerusalem appears here very heinous, nowhere worse, or 
 more exceedingly sinful 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 "<I>The children of Judah</I>" (God's profession people, that <I>came 
 forth out of the waters of Judah,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:1">Isa. xlviii. 1</A>)

 "<I>have done evil in my sight,</I> under my eye, in my presence; they
 have affronted me to my face, which very much aggravates the affront:" 
 or, "They have done that which they know to be <I>evil in my sight,</I> 
 and in the highest degree offensive to me." Idolatry was the sin which 
 was above all other sins evil in God's sight. Now here are two things 
 charged upon them in their idolatry, which were very provoking:

 (1.) That they were very impudent in it towards God and set him at 
 defiance: <I>They have set their abominations</I> (their abominable 
 idols and the altars erected to them) <I>in the house that is called by 
 my name,</I> in the very courts of the temple, <I>to pollute it</I> 
 (Manasseh did so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:7,23:12">2 Kings xxi. 7, xxiii. 12</A>),

 as if they thought God would connive at it, or cared not though he was
 ever so much displeased with it, or as if they would reconcile heaven
 and hell, God and Baal. The heart is the place which God has chosen to
 <I>put his name there;</I> if sin have the innermost and uppermost
 place there, we pollute the temple of the Lord, and therefore he
 resents nothing more than <I>setting up idols in the heart,</I>

 (2.) That they were very barbarous in it towards their own children,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 They have particularly <I>built the high places of Tophet,</I> where
 the image of Moloch was set up, <I>in the valley of the son of 
 Hinnom,</I> adjoining to Jerusalem; and there <I>they burnt their sons 
 and their daughters in the fire,</I> burnt them alive, killed them, and 
 killed them in the most cruel manner imaginable, to honour or appease 
 those idols that were devils and not gods. This was surely the greatest 
 instance that ever was of the power of Satan in the children of 
 disobedience, and of the degeneracy and corruption of the human nature. 
 One would willingly hope that there were not many instances of such a 
 barbarous idolatry; but it is amazing that there should be any, that 
 men could be so perfectly void of natural affection as to do a thing so 
 inhuman as to burn little innocent children, and their own too, that 
 they should be so perfectly void of natural religion as to think it 
 lawful to do this, nay, to think it acceptable. Surely it was in a way 
 of righteous judgment, because they had changed the glory of God into 
 the similitude of a beast, that God gave them up to such vile 
 affections that changed them into worse than beasts. God says of this 
 that it was <I>what he commanded them not, neither cam it into his 
 heart,</I> which is not meant of his not commanding them thus to 
 worship Moloch (this he had expressly <I>forbidden</I> them), but he 
 had never commanded that his worshippers should be at such an expense, 
 nor put such a force upon their natural affection, in honouring him; it 
 never came into his heart to have children offered to him, yet they had 
 forsaken his service for the service of such gods as, by commanding 
 this, showed themselves to be indeed enemies to mankind.</P>

 2. The destruction of Jerusalem appears here very terrible. That speaks 
 misery enough in general 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 <I>The Lord hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.</I> 
 Sin makes those the generation of God's wrath that had ben the 
 generation of his love. And God will reject and quite forsake those who 
 have thus made themselves <I>vessels of wrath fitted to 
 destruction.</I> He will disown them for his. "Verily, I say unto you, 
 I know you not." And he will give them up to the terrors of their own 
 guilt, and leave them in those hands. 

 (1.) Death shall triumph over them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:32,33"><I>v.</I> 32, 33</A>.

 Sin reigns unto death; for that is the wages of it, the end of those
 things. <I>Tophet,</I> the valley adjoining to Jerusalem, <I>shall be 
 called the valley of slaughter,</I> for there multitudes shall be 
 slain, when, in their sallies out of the city and their attempts to 
 escape, they fall into the hands of the besiegers. Or it shall be 
 called <I>the valley of slaughtered ones,</I> because thither the 
 corpses of those that are slain shall be brought to be buried, all 
 other burying places being full; and there they shall bury <I>until 
 there be no more place</I> to make a grave. This intimates the 
 multitude of those that shall die by the sword, pestilence, and famine.
 Death shall ride on prosperously, with dreadful pomp and power, 
 <I>conquering and to conquer. The slain of the Lord shall be many.</I> 
 This valley of Tophet was a place where the citizens of Jerusalem 
 walked to take the air; but it shall now be spoiled for that use, for 
 it shall be so full of graves that there shall be no walking there, 
 because of the danger of contracting a ceremonial pollution by the 
 touch of a grave. There it was that they sacrificed some of their 
 children, and dedicated others to Moloch, and there they should fall as 
 victims to divine justice. Tophet had formerly been the burying place, 
 or burning place, of the dead bodies of the besiegers, when the 
 Assyrian army was routed by an angel; and for this it was <I>ordained 
 of old,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:33">Isa. xxx. 33</A>.

 But they having forgotten this mercy, and made it the place of their
 sin, God will now turn it into a burying place for the besieged. In 
 allusion to this valley, hell is in the New Testament called 
 <I>Gehenna--the valley of Hinnom,</I> for there were buried both the 
 invading Assyrians and the revolting Jews; so hell is a receptacle 
 after death both for infidels and hypocrites, the open enemies of God's 
 church and its treacherous friends; it is <I>the congregation of the 
 dead;</I> it is prepared for the <I>generation of God's wrath.</I> But 
 so great shall that slaughter be that even the spacious valley of 
 Tophet shall not be able to contain the slain; and at length there 
 shall not be enough left alive to bury the dead, so that <I>the 
 carcases of the people shall be meat</I> for the birds and beasts of 
 prey, that shall feed upon them like carrion, and none shall have the 
 concern or courage to frighten them away, as Rizpah did from the dead 
 bodies of Saul's sons, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+28:26">2 Sam. xxviii. 26</A>,

 <I>Thy carcase shall be meat to the fowls and beasts, and no man shall
 drive them away.</I> Thus do the law and the prophets agree, and the 
 execution with both. The decent burying of the dead is a piece of
 humanity, in remembrance of what the dead body has been--the tabernacle 
 of a reasonable soul. Nay, it is a piece of divinity, in expectation
 of what the dead body shall be at the resurrection. The want of it has 
 sometimes been an instance of the rage of men against God's witnesses,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:9">Rev. xi. 9</A>.

 Here it is threatened as an instance of the wrath of God against his
 enemies, and is an intimation that <I>evil pursues sinners</I> even 
 after death.

 (2.) Joy shall depart from them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>):

 <I>Then will I cause to cease the voice of mirth.</I> God had 
 <I>called</I> by his prophets, and by less judgments, <I>to weeping and 
 mourning;</I> but they walked contrary to him, and would hear of 
 nothing but joy and gladness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:12,13">Isa. xxii. 12, 13</A>.

 And what came of it? Now God <I>called to lamentation</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 and he made his call effectual, leaving them neither cause nor heart 
 for joy and gladness. Those that will not weep shall weep; those that
 will not by the grace of God be cured of their vain mirth shall by the 
 justice of God be deprived of all mirth; for <I>when God judges he will 
 overcome.</I> It is threatened here that there shall be nothing to 
 rejoice in. There shall be none of the joy of weddings; no mirth, for 
 there shall be no marriages. The comforts of life shall be abandoned, 
 and all care to keep up mankind upon earth cast off; there shall be 
 none of <I>the voice of the bridegroom and</I> the <I>bride,</I> no 
 music, no nuptial songs. Nor shall there be any more of the joy of the 
 harvest, <I>for the land shall be desolate,</I> uncultivated and 
 unimproved. Both <I>the cities of Judah and the streets of 
 Jerusalem</I> shall look thus melancholy; and when they thus look about 
 them, and see no cause to rejoice, no marvel if they retire into 
 themselves and find no heart to rejoice. Note, God can soon mar the 
 mirth of the most jovial, and make it to cease, which is a reason why 
 we should always rejoice with trembling, be merry and wise.</P>
