 In this chapter, 

 I. Those to whom God sends are justly charged with bringing all the
 troubles they were in upon themselves, by their own wilfulness and 
 obstinacy, it being made to appear that God was able and ready to help 
 them if they had been fit for deliverance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. He by whom God sends produces his commission
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:4">ver. 4</A>), 

 alleges his own readiness to submit to all the services and sufferings
 he was called to in the execution of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:5,6">ver. 5, 6</A>),

 and assures himself that God, who sent him, would stand by him and bear
 him out against all opposition, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:7-9">ver. 7-9</A>.

 III. The message that is sent is life and death, good and evil, the 
 blessing and the curse, comfort to desponding saints and terror to 
 presuming sinners, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:10,11">ver. 10, 11</A>.

 Now all this seems to have a double reference,

 1. To the unbelieving Jews in Babylon, who quarrelled with God for his 
 dealings with them, and to the prophet Isaiah, who, though dead long 
 before the captivity, yet, prophesying so plainly and fully of it, saw 
 fit to produce his credentials, to justify what he had said.

 2. To the unbelieving Jews in our Saviour's time, whose own fault it
 was that they were rejected, Christ having preached much to them, and
 suffered much from them, and being herein borne up by a divine power.
 The "contents" of this chapter, in our Bibles, give this sense of it, 
 very concisely, thus:--"Christ shows that the dereliction of the Jews 
 is not to be imputed to him, by his ability to save, by his obedience 
 in that work, and by his confidence in divine assistance." The prophet 
 concludes with an exhortation to trust in God and not in ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Where <I>is</I> the bill of your mother's
 divorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors <I>is
 it</I> to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye
 sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put
 away.
 &nbsp; 2  Wherefore, when I came, <I>was there</I> no man? when I called,
 <I>was there</I> none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it
 cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my
 rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their
 fish stinketh, because <I>there is</I> no water, and dieth for thirst.
 &nbsp; 3  I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth
 their covering.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Those who have professed to be the people of God, and yet seem to be 
 dealt severely with, are apt to complain of God, and to lay the fault 
 upon him, as if he had been hard with them. But, in answer to their 
 murmurings, we have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A challenge given them to prove, or produce any evidence, that the 
 quarrel began on God's side, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 They could not say that he had done them any wrong or had acted
 arbitrarily. 

 1. He had been a husband to them; and husbands were then allowed a
 power to put away their wives upon any little disgust: if their wives 
 found not favour in their eyes, they made nothing of giving them a bill 
 of divorce, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:1,Mt+19:7">Deut. xxiv. 1; Matt. xix. 7</A>.

 But they could not say that God had dealt so with them. It is true they
 were now separated from him, and had abode many days without ephod, 
 altar, or sacrifice; but whose fault was that? They could not say that 
 God had given their mother a bill of divorce; let them produce it if 
 they can, for a bill of divorce was given into the hand of her that was 
 divorced.

 2. He had been a father to them; and fathers had then a power to sell 
 their children for slaves to their creditors, in satisfaction for the 
 debts they were not otherwise able to pay. Now it is true the Jews were 
 sold to the Babylonians then, and afterwards to the Romans; but did God 
 sell them for payment of his debts? No, he was not indebted to any of 
 those to whom they were sold, or, if he had sold them, he <I>did not 
 increase his wealth by their price,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:12">Ps. xliv. 12</A>.

 When God chastens his children, it is neither for his pleasure

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:10">Heb. xii. 10</A>)

 nor for his profit. All that are saved are saved by a prerogative of
 grace, but those that perish are cut off by an act of divine holiness 
 and justice, not of absolute sovereignty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A charge exhibited against them, showing them that they were 
 themselves the authors of their own ruin: "<I>Behold, for your 
 iniquities,</I> for the pleasure of them and the gratification of your 
 own base lusts, <I>you have sold yourselves, for your iniquities you 
 are sold;</I> not as children are sold by their parents, to pay their 
 debts, but as malefactors are sold by the judges, to punish them for 
 their crimes. You sold yourselves to work wickedness, and therefore God 
 justly sold you into the hands of your enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:5,8">2 Chron. xii. 5, 8</A>.

 It is for your transgressions that your mother is put away, for her
 whoredoms and adulteries," which were always allowed to be a just cause 
 of divorce. The Jews were sent into Babylon for their idolatry, a sin 
 which broke the marriage covenant, and were at last rejected for 
 crucifying the Lord of glory; these were the iniquities for which they 
 were sold and put away.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The confirmation of this challenge and this charge. 

 1. It is plain that it was owing to themselves that they were cast off;
 for God came and offered them his favour, offered them his helping 
 hand, either to prevent their trouble or to deliver them out of it, but 
 they slighted him and all the tenders of his grace. "Do you lay it upon 
 me?" (says God); "tell me, then, wherefore, <I>when I came, was there 
 no man</I> to meet me, <I>when I called, was there none to answer 
 me?</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 God came to them by his servants the prophets, demanding the fruits of
 his vineyard 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:34">Matt. xxi. 34</A>);

 he sent them his messengers, <I>rising up betimes and sending them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+35:15">Jer. xxxv. 15</A>);

 he called to them to leave their sins, and so prevent their own ruin:
 but <I>was there</I> no man, or next to none, that had any regard to 
 the warnings which the prophets gave them, none that answered the calls 
 of God, or complied with the messages he sent them; and this was it for 
 which they were sold and put away. Because they <I>mocked the 
 messengers of the Lord,</I> therefore, <I>God brought upon them the 
 king of the Chaldeans,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:16,17">2 Chron. xxxvi. 16, 17</A>.

 Last of all <I>he sent unto them his Son.</I> He <I>came to his
 own,</I> but <I>his own received him not;</I> he called them to 
 himself, but there were none that answered; he would have gathered 
 Jerusalem's children together, but they would not; they knew not, 
 because they would not know, the things that belonged to their peace, 
 nor the day of their visitation, and for that transgression it was that 
 they were put away and their house was left desolate,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:41,23:37,38,Lu+19:41,42">Matt. xxi. 41; xxiii. 37, 38;
 Luke xix. 41, 42</A>.

 When God calls men to happiness, and they will not answer, they are
 justly left to be miserable.

 2. It is plain that it was not owing to a want of power in God, for he 
 is almighty, and could have recovered them from so great a death; nor 
 was it owing to a want of power in Christ, for he is <I>able to save to 
 the uttermost.</I> The unbelieving Jews in Babylon thought they were 
 not delivered because their God was not able to deliver them; and those 
 in Christ's time were ready to ask, in scorn, <I>Can this man save 
 us?</I> For <I>himself he cannot save.</I> "But" (says God) "<I>is my 
 hand shortened at all,</I> or is it weakened?" Can any limits be set to 
 Omnipotence? Cannot he redeem who is the great Redeemer? Has he no 
 <I>power to deliver</I> whose all power is? To put to silence, and for 
 ever to put to shame, their doubts concerning his power, he here gives 
 unquestionable proofs of it.

 (1.) He can, when he pleases, <I>dry up the seas,</I> and make the 
 rivers a wilderness. He did so for Israel when he redeemed them out of 
 Egypt, and he can do so again for their redemption out of Babylon. It
 is done at his <I>rebuke,</I> as easily as with a word's speaking. He
 can so dry up the rivers as to leave the fish to die for want of water, 
 and to putrefy. When God <I>turned the waters of Egypt into blood</I> 
 he <I>slew the fish,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:29">Ps. cv. 29</A>.

 The expression our Saviour sometimes used concerning the power of
 faith, that it will <I>remove mountains and plant sycamores in the 
 sea,</I> is not unlike this; if their faith could do that, no doubt 
 their faith would save them, and therefore they were inexcusable if 
 they perished in unbelief.

 (2.) He can, when he pleases, eclipse the lights of heaven, <I>clothe 
 then with blackness, and make sackcloth their covering</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 by thick and dark clouds interposing, which he balances,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  The Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I
 should know how to speak a word in season to <I>him that is</I> weary:
 he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as
 the learned.
 &nbsp; 5  The Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious,
 neither turned away back.
 &nbsp; 6  I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that
 plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.
 &nbsp; 7  For the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> will help me; therefore shall I not be
 confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know
 that I shall not be ashamed.
 &nbsp; 8  <I>He is</I> near that justifieth me; who will contend with me?
 let us stand together: who <I>is</I> mine adversary? let him come near
 to me.
 &nbsp; 9  Behold, the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> will help me; who <I>is</I> he <I>that</I> shall
 condemn me? lo, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth
 shall eat them up.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Our Lord Jesus, having proved himself able to save, here shows himself 
 as willing as he is able to save, here shows himself as willing as he 
 is able. We suppose the prophet Isaiah to say something of himself in 
 these verses, engaging and encouraging himself to go on in his work as 
 a prophet, notwithstanding the many hardships he met with, not doubting 
 but that God would stand by him and strengthen him; but, like David, he 
 speaks of himself as a type of Christ, who is here prophesied of and 
 promised to be the Saviour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. As an acceptable preacher. Isaiah, a a prophet, was qualified for 
 the work to which he was called, so were the rest of God's prophets, 
 and others whom he employed as his messengers; but Christ was anointed 
 with the Spirit above his fellows. To make the man of God perfect, he 
 has, 

 1. <I>The tongue of the learned,</I> to know how to give instruction,
 <I>how to speak a word in season to him that is weary,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 God, who made man's mouth, gave Moses the tongue of the learned, to
 speak for the terror and conviction of Pharaoh, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:11,12">Exod. iv. 11, 12</A>.

 He gave to Christ the tongue of the learned, to speak a word in season
 for the comfort of those that are weary and heavily laden under the 
 burden of sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:28">Matt. xi. 28</A>.

 <I>Grace was poured into his lips,</I> and they are said to <I>drop
 sweet-smelling myrrh.</I> See what is the best learning of a minister, 
 to know how to comfort troubled consciences, and to speak pertinently, 
 properly, and plainly, to the various cases of poor souls. An ability 
 to do this is God's gift, and it is one of the best gifts, which we 
 should covet earnestly. Let us repose ourselves in the many comfortable 
 words which Christ has spoken to the weary.

 2. The ear of the learned, to receive instruction. Prophets have as 
 much need of this as of the tongue of the learned; for they must 
 deliver what they are taught and no other, must hear the word from 
 God's mouth diligently and attentively, that they may speak it exactly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:17">Ezek. iii. 17</A>.

 Christ himself received that he might give. None must undertake to be
 teachers who have not first been learners. Christ's apostles were first 
 disciples, <I>scribes instructed unto the kingdom of heaven,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:52">Matt. xiii. 52</A>.

 Nor is it enough to hear, but we must <I>hear as the learned,</I> hear
 and understand, hear and remember, hear as those that would learn by 
 what we hear. Those that would hear as the learned must be awake, and 
 wakeful; for we are naturally drowsy and sleepy, and unapt to hear at 
 all, or we hear by the halves, hear and do not heed. Our ears need to
 be wakened; we need to have something said to rouse us, to awaken us 
 out of our spiritual slumbers, that we may hear as for our lives. We 
 need to be awakened <I>morning by morning,</I> as duly as the day 
 returns, to be awakened to do the work of the day in its day. Our case
 calls for continual fresh supplies of divine grace, to free us from the 
 dulness we contract daily. The morning, when our spirits are most 
 lively, is a proper time for communion with God; then we are in the 
 best frame both to speak to him (<I>my voice shalt thou hear in the 
 morning</I>) and to hear from him. The people came <I>early in the
 morning</I> to hear Christ in the temple

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:38">Luke xxi. 38</A>),

 for, it seems, his were morning lectures. And it is God that wakens us
 morning by morning. If we do any thing to purpose in his service, it is 
 he who, as our Master, calls us up; and we should doze perpetually if 
 he did not waken us morning by morning.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. As a patient sufferer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 One would think that he who was commissioned and qualified to speak
 comfort to the weary should meet with no difficulty in his work, but 
 universal acceptance. It is however quite otherwise; he has both hard 
 work to do and hard usage to undergo; and here he tells us with what 
 undaunted constancy he went through with it. We have no reason to 
 question but that the prophet Isaiah went on resolutely in the work to 
 which God had called him, though we read not of his undergoing any such 
 hardships as are here supposed; but we are sure that the prediction was 
 abundantly verified in Jesus Christ: and here we have, 

 1. His patient obedience in his doing work. "The Lord God has not only
 wakened my ear to hear what he says, but has opened my ear to receive 
 it, and comply with it" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:6,7">Ps. xl. 6, 7</A>,

 <I>My ear hast thou opened; then said I, Lo, I come</I>); for when he 
 adds, <I>I was not rebellious, neither turned away back,</I> more is 
 implied than expressed--that he was willing, that though he foresaw a 
 great deal of difficulty and discouragement, though he was to take 
 pains and give constant attendance as a servant, though he was to empty 
 himself of that which was very great and humble himself to that which 
 was very mean, yet he did not fly off, did not fail, nor was 
 discouraged. He continued very free and forward to his work even when 
 he came to the hardest part of it. Note, As a good understanding in the 
 truths of God, so a good will to the work and service of God, is from 
 the grace of God.

 2. His obedient patience in his suffering work. I call it obedient 
 patience because he was patient with an eye to his Father's will, thus 
 pleading with himself, <I>This commandment have I received of my 
 Father,</I> and thus submitting to God, <I>Not as I will, but as thou 
 wilt.</I> In this submission he resigned himself,

 (1.) To be scourged: <I>I gave my back to the smiters;</I> and that not 
 only by submitting to the indignity when he was smitten, but by 
 permitting it (or admitting it rather) among the other instances of 
 pain and shame which he would voluntarily undergo for us. 

 (2.) To be buffeted: <I>I gave my cheeks to those that</I> not only 
 smote them, but <I>plucked off the hair</I> of the beard, which was a 
 greater degree both of pain and of ignominy. 

 (3.) To be spit upon: <I>I hid not my face from shame and spitting.</I> 
 He could have hidden his face from it, could have avoided it, but he 
 would not, because he was made a reproach of men, and thus he would 
 answer to the type of Job, that man of sorrows, of whom it is said that 
 they <I>smote him on the cheek reproachfully</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:10">Job xvi. 10</A>),

 which was an expression not only of contempt, but of abhorrence and
 indignation. All this Christ underwent for us, and voluntarily, to
 convince us of his willingness to save us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. As a courageous champion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:7-9"><I>v.</I> 7-9</A>.

 The Redeemer is as famous for his boldness as for his humility and
 patience, and, though he yields, yet he is more than a conqueror. 
 Observe, 

 1. The dependence he has upon God. What was the prophet Isaiah's
 support was the support of Christ himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):
 
 <I>The Lord God will help me;</I> and again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Those whom God employs he will assist, and will take care they want not 
 any help that they or their work call for. God, having laid help upon 
 his Son for us, gave help to him, and his hand was all along <I>with 
 the man of his right hand.</I> Nor will he only assist him in his work, 
 but accept of him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>He is near that justifieth.</I> Isaiah, no doubt, was falsely 
 accused and loaded with reproach and calumny, as other prophets were; 
 but he despised the reproach, knowing that God would roll it away and 
 bring forth his righteousness as the light, perhaps in this world 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:6">Ps. xxxvii. 6</A>),

 at furthest in the great day, when there will be a resurrection of
 names as well as bodies, and the righteous shall shine forth as the 
 morning sun. And so it was verified in Christ; by his resurrection he 
 was proved to be not the man that he was represented, not a blasphemer, 
 not a deceiver, not an enemy to C&aelig;sar. The judge that condemned 
 him owned he found no fault in him; the centurion, or sheriff, that had 
 charge of his execution, declared him a righteous man: so near was he 
 that justified him. But it was true of him in a further and more 
 peculiar sense: the Father justified him when he accepted the 
 satisfaction he made for the sin of man, and constituted him <I>the 
 Lord our righteousness,</I> who was made sin for us. He was 
 <I>justified in the Spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:16">1 Tim. iii. 16</A>.

 He was near who did it; for his resurrection, by which he was
 justified, soon followed his condemnation and crucifixion. He was 
 straightway glorified,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:32">John xiii. 32</A>.

 2. The confidence he thereupon has of success in his undertaking: "If
 God will help me, if he will justify me, will stand by me and bear me
 out, <I>I shall not be confounded,</I> as those are that come short of 
 the end they aimed at and the satisfaction they promised themselves: 
 <I>I know that I shall not be ashamed.</I>" Though his enemies did all 
 they could to put him to shame, yet he kept his ground, he kept his 
 countenance, and was not ashamed of the work he had undertaken. Note, 
 Work for God is work that we should not be ashamed of; and hope in God 
 is hope that we shall not be ashamed of. Those that trust in God for 
 help shall not be disappointed; they know whom they have trusted, and 
 therefore know they shall not be ashamed. 

 3. The defiance which in this confidence he bids to all opposers and
 opposition: "God will help me, and <I>therefore have I set my face like 
 a flint.</I>" The prophet did so; he was bold in reproving sin, in 
 warning sinners 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:8,9">Ezek. iii. 8, 9</A>),

 and in asserting the truth of his predictions. Christ did so; he went
 on in his work, as Mediator, with unshaken constancy and undaunted 
 resolution; he did not fail nor was discouraged; and here he challenges 
 all his opposers,

 (1.) To enter the lists with him: <I>Who will contend with me,</I> 
 either in law or by the sword? <I>Let us stand together</I> as 
 combatants, or as the plaintiff and defendant. <I>Who is my 
 adversary?</I> Who is <I>the master of my cause?</I> so the word is, 
 "Who will pretend to enter an action against me? Let him appear, and 
 <I>come near to me,</I> for I will not abscond." Many offered to 
 dispute with Christ, but he put them to silence. The prophet speaks 
 this in the name of all faithful ministers; those who keep close to the 
 pure word of God, in delivering their message, need not fear 
 contradiction; the scriptures will bear them out, whoever contends with 
 them. <I>Great is the truth and will prevail.</I> Christ speaks this in 
 the name of all believers, speaks it as their champion. Who dares be an 
 enemy to those whom he is a friend to, or contend with those for whom 
 he is an advocate? Thus St. Paul applies it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:33">Rom. viii. 33</A>):

 <I>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect?</I>

 (2.) He challenges them to prove any crime upon him

 <I>Who is he that shall condemn me?</I> The prophet perhaps was 
 condemned to die; Christ we are sure was; and yet both could say, 
 <I>Who is he that shall condemn?</I> For there is no condemnation to 
 those whom God justifies. There were those that did condemn them, but 
 what became of them? <I>They all shall wax old as a garment.</I> The 
 righteous cause of Christ and his prophets shall outlive all 
 opposition. The <I>moth shall eat them up</I> silently and insensibly; 
 a little thing will serve to destroy them. But the roaring lion himself 
 shall not prevail against God's witnesses. All believers are enabled to 
 make this challenge, <I>Who is he that shall condemn? It is Christ that 
 died.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Who <I>is</I> among you that feareth the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that obeyeth the
 voice of his servant, that walketh <I>in</I> darkness, and hath no

 God.
 &nbsp; 11  Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass <I>yourselves</I>
 about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the
 sparks <I>that</I> ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand;
 ye shall lie down in sorrow.

 The prophet, having the tongue of the learned given him, that he might 
 give to every one his portion, here makes use of it, rightly dividing 
 the word of truth. It is the summary of the gospel. <I>He that believes 
 shall be saved</I> (he that trusts in the name of the Lord shall be 
 comforted, though for a while he walk in darkness and have no light), 
 but <I>he that believes not shall be damned;</I> though for a while he 
 walk in the light of his own fire, yet he shall lie down in sorrow.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Comfort is here spoken to disconsolate saints, and they are 
 encouraged to trust in God's grace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 Here observe, 

 1. What is always the character of a child of God. He is one that fears
 the Lord with a filial fear, that stands in awe of his majesty and is 
 afraid of incurring his displeasure. This is a grace that usually 
 appears most in good people when they walk in darkness, when other 
 graces appear not. They then <I>tremble at his word</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:2"><I>ch.</I> lxvi. 2</A>)

 and are <I>afraid of his judgments,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:120">Ps. cxix. 120</A>.

 He is one that obeys the voice of God's servant, is willing to be ruled
 by the Lord Jesus, as God's servant in the great work of man's 
 redemption, one that yields a sincere obedience to the law of Christ 
 and cheerfully comes up to the terms of his covenant. Those that truly 
 fear God will obey the voice of Christ.

 2. What is sometimes the case of a child of God. It is supposed that
 though he has in his heart the fear of God, and faith in Christ, yet 
 for a time he walks in darkness and has no light, is disquieted and has 
 little or no comfort. Who is there that does so? This intimates that
 it is a case which sometimes happens among the professors of religion, 
 yet not very often; but, whenever it happens, God takes notice of it. 
 It is no new thing for the children and heirs of light sometimes to 
 walk in darkness, and for a time not to have any glimpse or gleam of 
 light. This is not meant so much of the comforts of this life (those 
 that fear God, when they have ever so great an abundance of them, do 
 not walk in them as their light) as of their spiritual comforts, which 
 relate to their souls. They walk in darkness when their evidences for 
 heaven are clouded, their joy in God is interrupted, the testimony of 
 the Spirit is suspended, and the light of God's countenance is 
 eclipsed. Pensive Christians are apt to be melancholy, and those who 
 fear always are apt to fear too much.

 3. What is likely to be an effectual cure in this sad case. He that is
 thus in the dark, 

 (1.) <I>Let him trust in the name of the Lord,</I> in the goodness of 
 his nature, and that which he has made known of himself, his wisdom, 
 power, and goodness. <I>The name of the Lord is a strong tower,</I> let 
 his run into that. Let him depend upon it that if he walk before God, 
 which a man may do though he walk in the dark, he shall find God 
 all-sufficient to him. 

 (2.) Let him <I>stay himself upon his God,</I> his in covenant; let him 
 keep hold of his covenant-relation to God, and call God <I>his God,</I> 
 as Christ on the cross, <I>My God, My God.</I> Let him stay himself 
 upon the promises of the covenant, and build his hopes on them. When a 
 child of God is ready to sink he will find enough in God to stay 
 himself upon. Let him trust in Christ, for God's <I>name is in him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:21">Exod. xxiii. 21</A>),

 trust in that name of his, <I>The Lord our righteousness,</I> and stay
 himself upon God as his God, in and through a Mediator.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Conviction is here spoken to presuming sinners, and they are warned 
 not to trust in themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. The description given of them. They <I>kindle a fire,</I> and
 <I>walk in the light of that fire.</I> They depend upon their own 
 righteousness, offer all their sacrifices, and burn all their incense, 
 with that fire (as Nadab and Abihu) and not with the fire from heaven. 
 In their hope of acceptance with God they have no regard to the 
 righteousness of Christ. They refresh and please themselves with a 
 conceit of their own merit and sufficiency, and warm themselves with 
 that. It is both light and heat to them. They <I>compass themselves 
 about with sparks of their own kindling.</I> As they trust in their own 
 righteousness, and not in the righteousness of Christ, so they place 
 their happiness in their worldly possessions and enjoyments, and not in 
 the favour of God. Creature-comforts are as sparks, short-lived and
 soon gone; yet the children of this world, while they last, warm 
 themselves by them, and walk with pride and pleasure in the light of 
 them. 

 2. The doom passed upon them. They are ironically told to <I>walk in 
 the light of their own fire.</I> "Make your best of it, while it lasts. 
 But what will be in the end thereof, what will it come to at last? This 
 shall you have of my hand (says Christ, for to him the judgment is 
 committed), <I>you shall lie down in sorrow,</I> shall go to bed in the 
 dark." See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:5,6">Job xviii. 5, 6</A>.

 <I>His candle shall be put out with him.</I> Those that make the world
 their comfort, and their own righteousness their confidence, will 
 certainly meet with a fatal disappointment, which will be bitterness in 
 the end. A godly man's way may be melancholy, but his end shall be 
 peace and everlasting light. A wicked man's way may be pleasant, but 
 his end and endless abode will be utter darkness.</P>
