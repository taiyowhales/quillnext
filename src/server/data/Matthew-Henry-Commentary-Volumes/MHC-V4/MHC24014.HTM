 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter was penned upon occasion of a great drought, for want of 
 rain. This judgment began in the latter end of Josiah's reign, but, as 
 it should seem, continued in the beginning of Jehoiakim's: for less
 judgments are sent to give warning of greater coming, if not prevented
 by repentance. This calamity was mentioned several times before, but
 here, in this chapter, more fully. Here is,

 I. A melancholy description of it,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. A prayer to God to put an end to this calamity and to return in
 mercy to their land, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:7-9">ver. 7-9</A>.

 III. A severe threatening that God would proceed in his controversy,
 because they proceeded in their iniquity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:10-12">ver. 10-12</A>.

 IV. The prophet's excusing the people, by laying the blame on their
 false prophets; and the doom passed both on the deceivers and the
 deceived, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:13-16">ver. 13-16</A>.

 V. Directions given to the prophet, instead of interceding for them,
 to lament them; but his continuing notwithstanding to intercede for
 them,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> that came to Jeremiah concerning the
 dearth.
 &nbsp; 2  Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are
 black unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.
 &nbsp; 3  And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters:
 they came to the pits, <I>and</I> found no water; they returned with
 their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and
 covered their heads.
 &nbsp; 4  Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the
 earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads.
 &nbsp; 5  Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook <I>it,</I>
 because there was no grass.
 &nbsp; 6  And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed
 up the wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because <I>there
 was</I> no grass.
 &nbsp; 7  O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou
 <I>it</I> for thy name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have
 sinned against thee.
 &nbsp; 8  O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble,
 why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a
 wayfaring man <I>that</I> turneth aside to tarry for a night?
 &nbsp; 9  Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man
 <I>that</I> cannot save? yet thou, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>art</I> in the midst of us,
 and we are called by thy name; leave us not.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The first verse is the title of the whole chapter: it does indeed all
 <I>concern the dearth,</I> but much of it consists of the prophet's 
 prayers concerning it; yet these are not unfitly said to be, <I>The 
 word of the Lord which came to him</I> concerning it, for every 
 acceptable prayer is that which God puts into our hearts; nothing is 
 our word that comes to him but what is first his word that comes from 
 him. In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The language of nature lamenting the calamity. When the heavens were 
 as brass, and distilled no dews, the earth was as iron, and produced no 
 fruits; and then the grief and confusion were universal. 

 1. The people of the land were all in tears. Destroy their vines and
 their fig-trees and you cause all their mirth to cease, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:11,12">Hos. ii. 11, 12</A>.
 
 All their joy fails with the joy of harvest, with that of their corn
 and wine. <I>Judah mourns</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 not for the sin, but for the trouble--for the withholding of the rain, 
 not for the withdrawing of God's favour. <I>The gates thereof,</I> all
 that go in and out at their gates, <I>languish,</I> look pale, and grow 
 feeble, for want of the necessary supports of life and for fear of the 
 further fatal consequences of this judgment. <I>The gates,</I> through 
 which supplies of corn formerly used to be brought into their cities, 
 now look melancholy, when, instead of that, the inhabitants are 
 departing through them to seek for bread in other countries. Even those 
 that sit in the gates languish; <I>they are black unto the ground,</I> 
 they go in black as mourners and sit on the ground, a the poor beggars 
 at the gates are <I>black in the face</I> for want of food, <I>blacker 
 than a coal,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:8">Lam. iv. 8</A>.
 
 Famine is represented by a black horse,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:5">Rev. vi. 5</A>.

 They fall to the ground through weakness, not being able to go along 
 the streets. <I>The cry of Jerusalem has gone up;</I> that is, of the 
 citizens (for the city is <I>served by the field</I>), or of people 
 from all parts of the country met at Jerusalem to pray for rain; so 
 some. But I fear it was rather the cry of their trouble, and the cry of 
 their prayer. 
 
 2. The great men of the land felt from this judgment

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>The nobles sent their little ones to the water,</I> perhaps their 
 own children, having been forced to part with their servants because 
 they had not wherewithal to keep them, and being willing to train up 
 their children, when they were little, to labour, especially in a case 
 of necessity, as this was. We find Ahab and Obadiah, the king and the 
 lord chamberlain of his household, in their own persons, seeking for 
 water in such a time of distress as this was, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:5,6">1 Kings xviii. 5, 6</A>.

 Or, rather, <I>their meaner ones,</I> their servants and inferior
 officers; these they sent to seek for water, which there is no living 
 without; but there was none to be found: They <I>returned with their 
 vessels empty;</I> the springs were dried up when there was no rain to 
 feed them; and then <I>they</I> (their masters that sent them) <I>were 
 ashamed and confounded</I> at the disappointment. They would not be 
 ashamed of their sins, nor confounded at the sense of them, but were 
 unhumbled under the reproofs of the word, thinking their wealth and 
 dignity set them above repentance; but God took a course to make them 
 ashamed of that which they were so proud of, when they found that even 
 on this side hell their nobility would not purchase them a drop of 
 water to cool their tongue. Let our reading the account of this 
 calamity make us thankful for the mercy of water, that we may not by 
 the feeling of the calamity be taught to value it. What is most needful 
 is most plentiful.

 3. The husbandmen felt most sensibly and immediately from it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>The ploughmen were ashamed,</I> for the ground was so parched and 
 hard that it would not admit the plough even when it was so 
 <I>chapt</I> and cleft that it seemed as if it did not need the plough. 
 They were ashamed to be idle, for there was nothing to be done, and 
 therefore nothing to be expected. The <I>sluggard, that will not plough 
 by reason of cold,</I> is not ashamed of his own folly; but the 
 diligent husbandman, that cannot plough by reason of heat, is ashamed 
 of his own affliction. See what an immediate dependence husbandmen have 
 upon the divine Providence, which therefore they should always have an 
 eye to, for they cannot plough nor sow in hope unless God <I>water 
 their furrows,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:10">Ps. lxv. 10</A>.

 4. The case even of the wild beasts was very pitiable,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 Man's sin brings those judgments upon the earth which make even the 
 inferior creatures groan: and the prophet takes notice of this as a 
 plea with God for mercy. Judah and Jerusalem have sinned, but the hinds 
 and the wild asses, what have they done? The hinds are pleasant 
 creatures, lovely and loving, and particularly tender of their young; 
 and yet such is the extremity of the case that, contrary to the 
 instinct of their nature, they leave their young, even when they are 
 newly calved and most need them, to seek for grass elsewhere; and, if 
 they can find none, they <I>abandon</I> them, because not able to 
 suckle them. It grieved not the hind so much that she had no grass 
 herself as that she had none for her young, which will shame those who 
 spend that upon their lusts which they should preserve for their 
 families. The hind, when she has brought forth her young, is said to 
 have <I>cast forth her sorrows</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:3">Job xxxix. 3</A>),

 and yet she continues her cares; but, as it follows there, she soon
 sees the good effect of them, for <I>her young ones</I> in a little 
 while <I>grow up,</I> and trouble her no more,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 But here the great trouble of all is that she has nothing for them. 
 Nay, one would be sorry even for the <I>wild asses</I> (though they are 
 creatures that none have any great affection for); for, though the 
 <I>barren land</I> is made <I>their dwelling</I> at the best 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:5,6">Job xxxix. 5, 6</A>),

 yet even that is now made too hot for them, so hot that they cannot
 breathe in it, but they get to the <I>highest places</I> they can 
 reach, where the air is coolest, and <I>snuff up the wind like 
 dragons,</I> like those creatures which, being very hot, are 
 continually panting for breath. <I>Their eyes fail,</I> and so does
 their strength, <I>because there is no grass</I> to support them. The
 tame ass, that serves her owner, is welcome to <I>his crib</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:3">Isa. i. 3</A>)

 and has her keeping for her labour, when the <I>wild ass,</I> that
 <I>scorns the crying of the driver,</I> is forced to <I>live upon 
 air,</I> and is well enough served for not serving. <I>He that will not 
 labour, let him not eat.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is the language of grace, lamenting the iniquity, and 
 complaining to God of the calamity. The people are not forward to pray, 
 but the prophet here prays for them, and so excites them to pray for 
 themselves, and puts words into their mouths, which they may make use 
 of, in hopes to speed,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:7-9"><I>v.</I> 7-9</A>.
 
 In this prayer, 

 1. Sin is humbly confessed. When we come to pray for the preventing or 
 removing of any judgment we must always acknowledge that our 
 <I>iniquities testify against us.</I> Our sins are witnesses against 
 us, and true penitents see them to be such. They testify, for they are 
 plain and evident; we cannot deny the charge. They testify against us, 
 for our conviction, which tends to our present shame and confusion, and 
 our future condemnation. They disprove and overthrow all our pleas for 
 ourselves; and so not only accuse us, but answer against us. If we 
 boast of our own excellencies, and trust to our own righteousness, our 
 iniquities testify against us, and prove us perverse. If we quarrel 
 with God as dealing unjustly or unkindly with us in afflicting us, our 
 iniquities testify against us that we do him wrong; "for <I>our 
 backslidings are many</I> and our revolts are great, whereby <I>we have 
 sinned against thee</I>--too numerous to be concealed, for they are 
 many, too heinous to be excused, for they are against thee." 

 2. Mercy is earnestly begged: "<I>Though our iniquities testify against 
 us,</I> and against the granting of the favour which the necessity of 
 our case calls for, yet <I>do thou it.</I>" They do not say 
 particularly what they would have done; but, as becomes penitents and 
 beggars, they refer the matter to God: "Do with us as thou thinkest 
 fit," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:15">Judg. x. 15</A>.

 Not, <I>Do thou it</I> in this way or at this time, but "<I>Do thou it
 for thy name's sake;</I> do that which will be most for the glory of 
 thy name." Note, Our best pleas in prayer are those that are fetched 
 from the glory of God's own name. "Lord, do it, that they mercy may be 
 magnified, thy promise fulfilled, and thy interest in the world kept 
 up; we have nothing to plead in ourselves, but every thing in thee." 
 There is another petition in this prayer, and it is a very modest one

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>Leave us not,</I> withdraw not thy favour and presence." Note, We 
 should dread and deprecate God's departure from us more than the 
 removal of any or all our creature-comforts. 

 3. Their relation to God, their interest in him, and their expectations
 from him grounded thereupon, are most pathetically pleaded with him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 (1.) They look upon him as one they have reason to think should deliver 
 them when they are in distress, yea, though their iniquities testify 
 against them; for in him mercy has often rejoiced against judgment. The 
 prophet, like Moses of old, is willing to make the best he can of the 
 case of his people, and therefore, though he must own that they have 
 sinned many a great sin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:31">Exod. xxxii. 31</A>),

 yet he pleads, <I>Thou art the hope of Israel.</I> God has encouraged
 his people to hope in him; in calling himself so often the <I>God of 
 Israel,</I> the <I>rock of Israel,</I> and the <I>Holy One of 
 Israel,</I> he has made himself the <I>hope of Israel.</I> He has given 
 Israel his word to hope in, and caused them to hope in it; and there 
 are those yet in Israel that make God alone their hope, and expect he 
 will be <I>their Saviour in time of trouble,</I> and they look not for 
 salvation in any other; "Thou hast many a time been such, in the time 
 of their extremity." Note, Since God is his people's all-sufficient 
 Saviour, they ought to hope in him in their greatest straits; and, 
 since he is their only Saviour, they ought to hope in him alone. They 
 plead likewise, "<I>Thou art in the midst of us;</I> we have the 
 special tokens of thy presence with us, thy temple, thy ark, thy 
 oracles, and <I>we are called by the name,</I> the <I>Israel</I> of 
 God; and therefore we have reason to hope thou wilt not leave us; <I>we 
 are thine, save us.</I> Thy name is called upon us, and therefore what 
 evils we are under reflect dishonour upon thee, as if thou wert not 
 able to relieve thy own." The prophet had often told the people that 
 their profession of religion would not protect them from the judgments 
 of God; yet here he pleads it with God, as Moses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:11">Exod. xxxii. 11</A>.

 Even this may go far as to temporal punishments with a God of mercy.
 <I>Valeat quantum valere potest--Let the plea avail as far as is 
 proper.</I>

 (2.) It therefore grieves them to think that he does not appear for 
 their deliverance; and, though they do not charge it upon him as 
 unrighteous, they humbly plead it with him why he should be gracious, 
 for the glory of his own name. For otherwise he will seem, 

 [1.] Unconcerned for his own people: <I>What will the Egyptians 
 say?</I> they will say, "Israel's hope and Saviour does not mind them; 
 he has become <I>as a stranger in the land,</I> that does not at all 
 interest himself in its interests; his temple, which he called <I>his 
 rest for ever,</I> is no more so, but he is in it <I>as a wayfaring 
 man, that turns aside to tarry but for a night</I> in an inn, which he 
 never enquires into the affairs of, nor is in any care about." Though 
 God never is, yet he sometimes seems to be, as if he cared not what 
 became of his church: Christ slept when his disciples were in storm.

 [2.] Incapable of giving them any relief. The enemies once said, 
 Because the Lord <I>was not able to bring</I> his people to Canaan, he 
 let them <I>perish in the wilderness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:16">Num. xiv. 16</A>);

 so now they will say, "Either his wisdom or his power fails him; either
 he is <I>as a man astonished</I> (who, though he has the reason of a 
 man, yet, being astonished, is quite at a loss and at his wits' end) or 
 as a <I>mighty man</I> who is overpowered by such as are more mighty, 
 and therefore <I>cannot save;</I> though mighty, yet a man, and 
 therefore having his power limited." Either of these would be a most 
 insufferable reproach to the divine perfections; and therefore, why has 
 the God that we are sure <I>is in the midst of us</I> become <I>as a 
 stranger?</I> Why does the almighty God seem as if he were no more than 
 a mighty man, who, when he is astonished, though he would, yet cannot 
 save? It becomes us in prayer to show ourselves concerned more for 
 God's glory than for our own comfort. Lord, <I>what wilt thou do unto 
 thy great name?</I></P>

 them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine;

 &nbsp; 14  Then the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my
 name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither

 divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart.
 &nbsp; 15  Therefore thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> concerning the prophets that
 prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and
 famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those
 prophets be consumed.
 &nbsp; 16  And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in
 the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and
 they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their
 sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon
 them.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The dispute between God and his prophet, in this chapter, seems to be 
 like that between the owner and the dresser of the vineyard concerning 
 the barren fig-tree, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:7">Luke xiii. 7</A>.

 The justice of the owner condemns it to be cut down; the clemency of
 the dresser intercedes for a reprieve. Jeremiah had been earnest with
 God, in prayer, to return in mercy to this people. Now here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God overrules the plea which he had offered in their favour, and 
 shows him that it would not hold. In answer to it thus he says 
 concerning <I>this people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 He does not say, concerning <I>my people,</I> for he disowns them, 
 because they had broken covenant with him. It is true they were 
 <I>called by his name,</I> and had the tokens of his presence among 
 them; but they had sinned, and provoked God to withdraw. This the 
 prophet had owned, and had hoped to obtain mercy for them, 
 notwithstanding this, through intercession and sacrifice; therefore God 
 here tells him, 

 1. That they were not duly qualified for a pardon. The prophet had
 owned that <I>their backslidings were many;</I> and, though they were 
 so, yet there was hope for them if they returned. But <I>this 
 people</I> show no disposition at all to return; they have wandered, 
 and <I>they have loved to wander;</I> their backslidings have been 
 their choice and their pleasure, which should have been their shame and 
 pain, and therefore they will be their ruin. They cannot expect God
 should take up his rest with them when they take such delight in going 
 astray from him after their idols. It is not through necessity or 
 inadvertency that they wander, but they love to wander. Sinners are 
 wanderers from God; their wanderings forfeit God's favour, but it is 
 their loving to wander that quite cuts them off from it. They were told 
 what their wanderings would come to that one sin would hurry them on to 
 another, and all to ruin; and yet they have not taken warning and 
 <I>refrained their feet.</I> So far were they from returning to their 
 God that neither his prophets nor his judgments could prevail upon them 
 to give themselves the least check in a sinful pursuit. This is that 
 for which God is now reckoning with them. When he denies them rain from 
 heaven he is <I>remembering their iniquity</I> and <I>visiting their 
 sin;</I> that is it for which their <I>fruitful land</I> is thus 
 <I>turned into barrenness.</I> 

 2. That they had no reason to expect that the God they had rejected 
 should accept them; no, not though they betook themselves to fasting 
 and prayer and put themselves to the expense of burnt-offerings and 
 sacrifice: <I>The Lord doth not accept them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 <I>He takes no pleasure in them</I> (so the word is); for what pleasure 
 can the holy God take in those that take pleasure in his rivals, in any 
 service, in any society, rather than his? "<I>When they fast</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 which is a proper expression of repentance and reformation,--<I>when 
 they offer a burnt offering and an oblation,</I> which was designed to 
 be an expression of faith in a Mediator,--though their prayers be thus 
 enforced, and offered up in those vehicles that used to be acceptable, 
 yet, because they do not proceed from humble, penitent, and renewed 
 hearts, but still they <I>love to wander,</I> therefore <I>I will not 
 hear their cry,</I> be it ever so loud; <I>nor will I accept them,</I> 
 neither their persons nor their performances." It had been long since 
 declared, <I>The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the 
 Lord;</I> and those only are <I>accepted</I> that <I>do well,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:7">Gen. iv. 7</A>.

 3. That they had forfeited all benefit by the prophet's prayers for
 them because they had not regarded his preaching to them. This is the 
 meaning of that repeated prohibition given to the prophet

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):
 
 <I>Pray not thou for this people for their good,</I> as before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:15,11:14">
 <I>ch.</I> vii. 15; xi. 14</A>.

 This did not forbid him thus to express his <I>good-will</I> to them
 (Moses continued to intercede for Israel after God had said, <I>Let me 
 alone,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:10">Exod. xxxii. 10</A>),

 but it forbade them to expect any good effect from it as long as they
 <I>turned away their ear from hearing the law.</I> Thus was the doom of 
 the impenitent ratified, as that of Saul's rejection was by that word 
 to Samuel, <I>When wilt thou cease to mourn for Saul?</I> It therefore 
 follows

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 <I>I will consume them,</I> not only by this famine, but by the further 
 sore judgments of sword and pestilence; for God has many arrows in his 
 quiver, and those that will not be convinced and reclaimed by one shall 
 be consumed by another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The prophet offers another plea in excuse for the people's 
 obstinacy, and it is but an excuse, but he was willing to say whatever 
 their case would bear; it is this, That the prophets, who pretended a 
 commission from heaven, imposed upon them, and flattered them with 
 assurances of peace though they went on in their sinful way, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 He speaks of it with lamentation: "<I>Ah! Lord God,</I> the poor people 
 seem willing to take notice of what comes in thy name, and there are 
 those who in thy name tell them that they <I>shall not see the sword 
 nor famine;</I> and they say it as from thee, with all the gravity and 
 confidence of prophets: <I>I will</I> continue you <I>in this 
 place,</I> and will <I>give you assured peace</I> here, peace of truth.
 I tell them the contrary; but I am one against many, and every one is 
 apt to credit that which makes for them; therefore, Lord, pity and 
 spare them, for <I>their leaders cause them to err.</I>" This excuse 
 would have been of some weight if they had not had warning given them, 
 before, of false prophets, and rules by which to distinguish them; so 
 that if they were deceived it was entirely their own fault. But this 
 teaches us, as far as we can with truth, to make the best of bad, and 
 judge as charitably of others as their case will bear.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. God not only overrules this plea, but condemns both the blind 
 leaders and the blind followers to fall together into the ditch. 

 1. God disowns the flatteries

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>They prophesy lies in my name.</I> They had no commission from God 
 to prophesy at all: <I>I neither sent them, nor commanded them, nor 
 spoke unto them.</I> They never were employed to go on any errand at 
 all from God; he never made himself known to them, much less by them to 
 the people; never any word of the Lord came to them, no call, no 
 warrant, no instruction, much less did he send them on this errand, to 
 rock them asleep in security. No; men may flatter themselves, and Satan 
 may flatter them, but God never does. It is <I>a false vision, and a
 thing of nought.</I> Note, What is false and groundless in vain and 
 worthless. The vision that is not true, be it ever so pleasing, is good 
 for nothing; it is the <I>deceit of their heart,</I> a spider's web 
 spun out of their own bowels, and in it they think to shelter 
 themselves, but it will be swept away in a moment and prove a great 
 cheat. Those that oppose their own thoughts of God's word (God indeed 
 says so, but they think otherwise) walk in the <I>deceit of their 
 heart,</I> and it will be their ruin. 

 2. He passes sentence upon the flatterers,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 As for the prophets, who put this abuse upon the people by telling them 
 they shall have peace, and this affront upon God by telling them so in 
 God's name, let them know that they shall have no peace themselves. 
 They shall fall first by those very judgments which they have flattered 
 others with the hopes of an exemption from. They undertook to warrant 
 people that <I>sword and famine</I> should <I>not be in the land;</I> 
 but it shall soon appear how little their warrants are good for, when 
 they themselves shall be cut off by sword and famine. How should they 
 secure others or foretel peace to them when they cannot secure 
 themselves, nor have such a foresight of their own calamities as to get 
 out of the way of them? Note, The sorest punishment await those who 
 promise sinners impunity in their sinful ways. 

 3. He lays the flattered under the same doom: The <I>people to whom
 they prophesy lies,</I> and who willingly suffer themselves to be thus 
 imposed upon, <I>shall die by sword and famine,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Note, The unbelief of the deceived, with all the falsehood of the 
 deceivers, shall not make the divine threatenings of no effect; sword 
 and famine will come, whatever they say to the contrary; and those will 
 be least safe that are most secure. Impenitent sinners will not escape
 the damnation of hell by saying that they can never believe there is 
 such a thing, but will feel what they will not fear. It is threatened 
 that this people shall not only fall by <I>sword and famine,</I> but 
 that they shall be as it were hanged up in chains, as monuments of that 
 divine justice which they set at defiance; their bodies shall be 
 <I>cast out,</I> even <I>in the streets of Jerusalem,</I> which of all 
 places, one would think, should be kept clear from such nuisances: 
 there they shall lie unburied; their nearest relations, who should do 
 them that last office of love, being so poor that they cannot afford 
 it, or so weakened with hunger that they are not able to attend it, or 
 so overwhelmed with grief that they have no heart to it, or so 
 destitute of natural affection that they will not pay them so much 
 respect. Thus will God <I>pour their wickedness upon them,</I> that is, 
 the punishment of their wickedness; the full vials of God's wrath shall 
 be poured upon them, to which they have made themselves obnoxious.
 Note, When sinners are overwhelmed with trouble they must in it see 
 their own wickedness poured upon them. This refers to the wickedness 
 both of the false prophets and of the people; the blind lead the blind, 
 and both fall together into the ditch, where they will be miserable 
 comforters one to another.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes
 run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for
 the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach,
 with a very grievous blow.
 &nbsp; 18  If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the
 sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are
 sick with famine! yea, both the prophet and the priest go about
 into a land that they know not.
 &nbsp; 19  Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul loathed Zion?
 why hast thou smitten us, and <I>there is</I> no healing for us? we
 looked for peace, and <I>there is</I> no good; and for the time of
 healing, and behold trouble!
 &nbsp; 20  We acknowledge, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, our wickedness, <I>and</I> the iniquity

 made all these <I>things.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The present deplorable state of Judah and Jerusalem is here made the 
 matter of the prophet's lamentation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>)

 and the occasion of his prayer and intercession for them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 and I am willing to hope that the latter, as well as the former, was by 
 divine direction, and that these words 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 <I>Thus shalt thou say unto them</I> (or <I>concerning them,</I> or 
 <I>in their hearing</I>), refer to the intercession, as well as to the 
 lamentation, and then it amounts to a revocation of the directions 
 given to the prophet not to pray for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 However, it is plain, by the prayers we find in these verses, that the 
 prophet did not understand it as a prohibition, but only as a 
 discouragement, like that 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:16">1 John v. 16</A>,

 <I>I do not say he shall pray for that.</I> Here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The prophet stands weeping over the ruins of his country; God 
 directs him to do so, that, showing himself affected, he might, if 
 possible, affect them with the foresight of the calamities that were 
 coming upon them. Jeremiah must say it not only to himself, but to them 
 too: <I>Let my eyes run down with tears,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Thus he must signify to them that he certainly foresaw <I>the sword</I> 
 coming, and another sort of famine, more grievous even than this which 
 they were now groaning under; this was in the country for want of rain, 
 that would be in the city through the straitness of the siege. The 
 prophet speaks as if he already saw the miseries attending the descent 
 which the Chaldeans made upon them: <I>The virgin daughter of my 
 people,</I> that is as dear to me as a daughter to her father, <I>is 
 broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow,</I> much greater 
 and more grievous than any she has yet sustained; for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>)

 <I>in the field</I> multitudes lie dead that were <I>slain by the 
 sword,</I> and in the city multitudes lie dying for want of food. 
 Doleful spectacles! "<I>The prophets and the priests,</I> the false
 prophets that flattered them with their lies and the wicked priests 
 that persecuted the true prophets, are now expelled their country, and 
 <I>go about</I> either as prisoners and captives, whithersoever their 
 conquerors lead them, or as fugitives and vagabonds, wherever they can 
 find shelter and relief, <I>in a land that they know not.</I>" Some 
 understand this of the true prophets, Ezekiel and Daniel, that were 
 carried to Babylon with the rest. The prophet's eyes must run down 
 <I>with tears day and night,</I> in prospect of this, that the people 
 might be convinced, not only that this woeful day would infallibly 
 come, and would be a very woeful day indeed, but that he was far from 
 desiring it, and would as gladly have brought them messages of peace as 
 their false prophets, if he might have had warrant from heaven to do 
 it. Note, Because God, though he inflicts death on sinners, yet 
 delights not in it, it becomes his ministers, though in his name they 
 pronounce the death of sinners, yet sadly to lament it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He stands up to make intercession for them; for who knows but God 
 will yet return and repent? While there is life there is hope, and room 
 for prayer. And, though there were many among them who neither prayed 
 themselves nor valued the prophet's prayers, yet there were some who 
 were better affected, would join with him in his devotions, and set the 
 seal of their <I>Amen</I> to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He humbly expostulates with God concerning the present 
 deplorableness of their case, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.
 
 It was very sad, for, 

 (1.) Their expectations from their God failed them; they thought he had 
 avouched Judah to be his, but now, it seems, he has <I>utterly 
 rejected</I> it, and cast it off, will not own any relation to it nor 
 concern for it. They thought Zion was the beloved of his soul, was his
 rest for ever; but now <I>his soul</I> even <I>loathes Zion,</I> 
 loathes even the services there performed, for the sake of the sins 
 there committed.

 (2.) Then no marvel that all their other expectations failed them: 
 <I>They were smitten,</I> and their wounds were multiplied, but there 
 was <I>no healing</I> for them; they <I>looked for peace,</I> because 
 after a storm there usually comes a calm and fair weather, after a long 
 fit of wet; but <I>there was no good,</I> things went still worse and 
 worse. They looked for a <I>healing time,</I> but could not gain so 
 much as a <I>breathing time. "Behold, trouble</I> at the door, by which 
 we hoped peace would enter. And is it so then? <I>Hast thou</I> indeed 
 <I>rejected Judah?</I> Justly thou mightest. <I>Hath thy soul loathed 
 Zion?</I> We deserve it should. But wilt thou not at length in wrath 
 remember mercy?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He makes a penitent confession of sin, speaking that language which 
 they all should have spoken, though but few did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 "<I>We acknowledge our wickedness,</I> the abounding wickedness of our 
 land <I>and the iniquity of our fathers,</I> which we have imitated, 
 and therefore justly smart for. <I>We know, we acknowledge,</I> that 
 <I>we have sinned against thee,</I> and therefore thou art just in all 
 that is brought upon us; but, because we confess our sins, we hope to 
 find thee faithful and just in forgiving our sins."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He deprecates God's displeasure, and by faith appeals to his honour 
 and promise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 His petition is, "<I>Do not abhor us;</I> though thou afflict us, <I>do 
 not abhor us;</I> though thy hand by turned <I>against</I> us, let not 
 thy heart be so, nor let thy mind be alienated from us." They own God 
 might justly abhor them, they had rendered themselves odious in his 
 eyes; yet, when they pray, <I>Do not abhor us,</I> they mean, "Receive 
 us into favour again. <I>Let not thy soul loathe Zion,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Let not our incense be an abomination." They appeal, 

 (1.) To the honour of God, the honour of his scriptures, by which he 
 has made himself known--his <I>word,</I> which he has <I>magnified 
 above all his name: "Do not abhor us, for thy name's sake,</I> that the 
 name of thine by which we are called and which we call upon." The 
 honour of his sanctuary is pleaded: "Lord, do not abhor us, for that 
 will <I>disgrace the throne of thy glory</I>" (the temple, which is 
 called <I>a glorious high throne from the beginning,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:12"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 12</A>);

 let not that which has been the <I>joy of the whole earth</I> be made a
 <I>hissing</I> and an <I>astonishment.</I> We deserve to have disgrace 
 put upon us, but let it not be so as to reflect upon thyself; let not 
 the desolations of the temple give occasion to the heathen to reproach 
 him that used to be worshipped there, as if he could not, or would not, 
 protect it, or as if the gods of the Chaldeans had been too hard for 
 him. Note, Good men lay the credit of religion, and its profession in 
 the world, nearer their hearts than any private interest or concern of 
 their own; and those are powerful pleas in prayer which are fetched 
 thence and great supports to faith. We may be sure that God will not 
 <I>disgrace the throne of his glory</I> on earth; nor will he eclipse 
 the glory of his throne by one providence without soon making it shine 
 forth, and more brightly than before, by another. God will be no loser 
 in his honour at the long-run.

 (2.) To the promise of God; of this they are humbly bold to put him in 
 mind: <I>Remember thy covenant with us, and break not</I> that 
 covenant. Not that they had any distrust of his fidelity, or that they 
 thought he needed to be put in mind of his promise to them, but what he 
 had said he would plead with himself they take the liberty to plead 
 with him. <I>Then will I remember my covenant,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:42">Lev. xxvi. 42</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He professes a dependence upon God for the mercy of rain, which they 
 were now in want of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 If they have forfeited their interest in him as their God in covenant, 
 yet they will not let go their hold on him as the God of nature. 

 (1.) They will never make application to the idols of the heathen, for 
 that would be foolish and fruitless: <I>Are there any among the 
 vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain?</I> No; in a time of 
 great drought in Israel, Baal, though all Israel presented their 
 prayers to him in the days of Ahab, could not relieve them; it was that 
 God only who <I>answered by fire</I> that could answer <I>by water</I> 
 too. 

 (2.) They will not terminate their regards in second causes, nor expect 
 supply from nature only: <I>Can the heavens give showers?</I> No, not 
 without orders from the God of heaven; for it is he that has the key of 
 the clouds, that <I>opens the bottles of heaven</I> and <I>waters the 
 earth from his chambers.</I> But, 

 (3.) All their expectation therefore is from him and their confidence 
 in him: "<I>Art not thou he, O Lord our God!</I> from whom we may 
 expect succour and to whom we must apply? Art thou not he that
 <I>causest rain</I> and <I>givest showers?</I> For <I>thou hast made 
 all these things;</I> thou gavest them being, and therefore thou givest 
 them law and hast them all at thy command; thou madest that moisture in 
 nature which is in a constant circulation to serve the intentions of 
 Providence, and thou directest it, and makest what use thou pleasest of 
 it; <I>therefore we will wait upon thee,</I> and upon thee only; we 
 will <I>ask of the Lord rain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+10:1">Zech. x. 1</A>.

 We will trust in him to give it to us in due time, and be willing to
 tarry his time; it is fit that we should, and it will not be in vain to 
 do so." Note, The sovereignty of God should engage, and his 
 all-sufficiency encourage, our attendance on him and our expectations
 from him at all times.</P>
