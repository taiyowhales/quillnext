 The business of prophets was both to preach and pray. In this chapter, 
 
 I. The prophet determines to apply closely and constantly to this
 business, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. God appoints him and others of his prophets to continue to do so,
 for the encouragement of his people during the delays of their 
 deliverance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>.

 III. The promises are here repeated and ratified of the great things
 God would do for his church, for the Jews after their return out of 
 captivity and for the Christian church when it shall be set up in the 
 world. 

 1. The church shall be made honourable in the eyes of the world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:2">ver. 2</A>.
 
 2. It shall appear to be very dear to God, precious and honourable in
 his sight, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>.

 3. It shall enjoy great plenty,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:8,9">ver. 8, 9</A>.

 4. It shall be released out of captivity and grow up again into a
 considerable nation, particularly owned and favoured by heaven,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's
 sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as
 brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp <I>that</I> burneth.
 &nbsp; 2  And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings
 thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the
 mouth of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall name.
 &nbsp; 3  Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.
 &nbsp; 4  Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land
 any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzi-bah,
 and thy land Beulah: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> delighteth in thee, and thy
 land shall be married.
 &nbsp; 5  For <I>as</I> a young man marrieth a virgin, <I>so</I> shall thy sons
 marry thee: and <I>as</I> the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride,
 <I>so</I> shall thy God rejoice over thee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet here tells us,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What he will do for the church. A prophet, as he is a seer, so he is
 a spokesman. This prophet resolves to perform that office faithfully, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 He <I>will not hold his peace;</I> he <I>will not rest;</I> he will
 mind his business, will take pains, and never desire to take his ease; 
 and herein he was a type of Christ, who was indefatigable in executing 
 the office of a prophet and made it his meat and drink till he had 
 finished his work. Observe here, 

 1. What the prophet's resolution is: <I>He will not hold his peace.</I>
 He will continue instant in preaching, will not only faithfully 
 deliver, but frequently repeat, the messages he has <I>received from 
 the Lord.</I> If people receive not the precepts and promises at first, 
 he will inculcate them and give them line upon line. And he will 
 continue instant in prayer; he will never hold his peace at the throne 
 of grace till he has prevailed with God for the mercies promised; he 
 will <I>give himself to prayer and to the ministry of the word,</I> as 
 Christ's ministers must 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:4">Acts vi. 4</A>),

 who must labour frequently in both and never be weary of this
 well-doing. The business of ministers is to speak from God to his 
 people and to God for his people; and in neither of these must they be 
 silent.

 2. What is the principle of this resolution--<I>for Zion's sake, and 
 for Jerusalem's,</I> not for the sake of any private interest of his 
 own, but for the church's sake, because he has an affection and concern 
 for Zion, and it lies near his heart. Whatever becomes of his own house 
 and family, he desires to <I>see the good of Jerusalem</I> and resolves 
 to seek it all the days of his life, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+122:8,Ps+118:5">Ps. cxxii. 8, 9; cxviii. 5</A>.

 It is God's Zion and his Jerusalem, and it is <I>therefore</I> dear to
 him, because it is so to God and because God's glory is interested in 
 its prosperity.

 3. How long he resolves to continue this importunity--till the promise
 of the church's righteousness and salvation, given in the foregoing 
 chapter, be accomplished. Isaiah will not himself live to see the 
 release of the captives out of Babylon, much less the bringing in of 
 the gospel, in which <I>grace reigns through righteousness unto 
 life</I> and salvation; yet he will <I>not hold his peace till</I> 
 these be accomplished, even the utmost of them, because his prophecies 
 will continue speaking of these things, and there shall in every age be 
 a remnant that shall continue to pray for them, as successors to him, 
 till the promises be performed, and so the prayers answered that were 
 grounded upon them. Then the church's <I>righteousness</I> and 
 <I>salvation</I> will <I>go forth as brightness,</I> and <I>as a lamp 
 that burns,</I> so plainly that it will carry its own evidence along 
 with it. It will bring honour and comfort to the church, which will 
 hereupon both look pleasant and appear illustrious; and it will bring 
 instruction and direction to the world, a light not only to the eyes 
 but to the feet, and to <I>the paths</I> of those who before <I>sat in 
 darkness and in the shadow of death.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What God will do for the church. The prophet can but pray and 
 preach, but God will confirm the word and answer the prayers. 

 1. The church shall be greatly admired. When that righteousness which
 is her salvation, her praise, and her glory, shall be <I>brought 
 forth,</I> the <I>Gentiles shall see</I> it. The tidings of it shall be 
 carried to the Gentiles, and a tender of it made to them; they may so 
 see this righteousness as to share in it if it be not their own fault. 
 "Even kings shall see and be in love with the <I>glory of thy 
 righteousness</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 shall overlook the glory of their own courts and kingdoms, and look at, 
 and look after, the spiritual glory of the church as that which excels. 

 2. She shall be truly admirable. Great names make men considerable in 
 the world, and great respect is paid them thereupon; now it is agreed 
 that <I>honor est in honorante--honour derives its value from the 
 dignity of him who confers it.</I> God is the fountain of honour and 
 from him the church's honour comes: "<I>Thou shalt be called by a new 
 name,</I> a pleasant name, such as thou wast never called by before, 
 no, not in the day of thy greatest prosperity, and the reverse of that 
 which thou wast called by in the day of thy affliction; thou shalt have 
 a new character, be advanced to a new dignity, and those about thee 
 shall have new thoughts of thee." This seems to be alluded to in that 
 promise 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:17">Rev. ii. 17</A>)

 of the <I>white stone and in the stone a new name,</I> and that

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:12">Rev. iii. 12</A>)

 of the <I>name of the city of my God</I> and my <I>new name.</I> It is
 a name <I>which the mouth of the Lord shall name,</I> who, we are sure, 
 miscalls nothing, and who will oblige others to call her by the name he 
 has given her; for his judgment is according to truth and all shall 
 concur with it sooner or later. Two names God shall give her:--

 (1.) He shall call her his crown

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Thou shalt be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord,</I> not on 
 his head (as adding any real honour or power to him, as crowns do to 
 those that are crowned with them), but in his hand. He is pleased to 
 account them, and show them forth, as a glory and beauty to him. When
 he took them to be his people it was that they might be <I>unto him for 
 a name, and for a praise, and for a glory</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:11">Jer. xiii. 11</A>):

 "Thou shalt be a <I>crown of glory</I> and a <I>royal diadem,</I>
 through the hand, the good hand, of thy God upon thee; he shall make 
 thee so, for he shall be <I>to thee a crown of glory,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:5"><I>ch.</I> xxviii. 5</A>.

 Thou shalt be so <I>in his hand,</I> that is, under his protection; he
 that shall put glory upon thee shall <I>create a defence upon all that 
 glory,</I> so that the flowers of thy crown shall never wither nor 
 shall its jewels be lost." 
 
 (2.) He shall call her his spouse,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.
 
 This is a yet greater honour, especially considering what a forlorn
 condition she had been in. 

 [1.] Her case had been very melancholy. She was called <I>forsaken</I>
 and her land <I>desolate</I> during the captivity, like a woman 
 reproachfully divorced or left a disconsolate widow. Such as the state 
 of religion in the world before the preaching of the gospel--it was in 
 a manner forsaken and desolate, a thing that no man looked after nor 
 had any real concern for. 

 [2.] It should now be very pleasant, for God would return in mercy to 
 her. Instead of those two names of reproach, she shall be called by two 
 honourable names. <I>First,</I> She shall be called <I>Hephzi-bah,</I>
 which signifies, <I>My delight is in her;</I> it was the name of 
 Hezekiah's queen, Manasseh's mother

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:1">2 Kings xxi. 1</A>),

 a proper name for a wife, who ought to be her husband's delight, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:19">Prov. v. 19</A>.

 And here it is the church's Maker that is her husband: <I>The Lord
 delights in thee.</I> God by his grace has wrought that in his church 
 which makes her his delight, she being refined, and reformed, and 
 brought home to him; and then by his providence he does that for her 
 which makes it appear that she is his delight and that he delights to 
 do her good. <I>Secondly,</I> She shall be called <I>Beulah,</I> which 
 signifies <I>married,</I> whereas she had been desolate, a condition 
 opposed to that of the <I>married wife,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:1"><I>ch.</I> liv. 1</A>.

 "<I>Thy land shall be married,</I> that is, it shall become fruitful
 again, and be replenished." Though she has long been barren, she shall 
 again be peopled, shall again be made to keep house and to be a joyful 
 mother of children, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+113:9">Ps. cxiii. 9</A>.
 
 <I>She shall be married,</I> for,

 1. Her sons shall heartily espouse the land of their nativity and its
 interests, which they had for a long time neglected, as despairing ever 
 to have any comfortable enjoyment of it: <I>Thy sons shall marry 
 thee,</I> that is, they shall live with thee and take delight in thee.
 When they were in Babylon, they seemed to have espoused that land, for 
 they were appointed to settle, and to seek the peace of it, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:5-7">Jer. xxix. 5-7</A>.

 But now they shall again marry their own land, <I>as a young man
 marries a virgin</I> that he takes great delight in, is extremely fond 
 of, and is likely to have many children by. It bodes well to a land 
 when its own natives and inhabitants are pleased with it, prefer it 
 before other lands, when its princes marry their country and resolve to 
 take their lot with it.

 2. <I>Her God</I> (which is much better) shall <I>betroth her to 
 himself in righteousness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:19,20">Hosea ii. 19, 20</A>.

 He will take pleasure in his church: <I>As the bridegroom rejoices over
 the bride,</I> is pleased with his relation to her and her affection to 
 him, <I>so shall thy God rejoice over thee:</I> he shall rest in his 
 love to thee

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:17">Zeph. iii. 17</A>);
 
 <I>he shall take pleasure</I> in thee
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:11">Ps. cxlvii. 11</A>),

 and shall <I>delight to do thee good with his whole heart and his whole
 soul,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:41">Jer. xxxii. 41</A>.

 This is very applicable to the love Christ has for his church and the
 complacency he takes in it, which appears so brightly in Solomon's 
 Song, and which will be complete in heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, <I>which</I>
 shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, keep not silence,
 &nbsp; 7  And give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make
 Jerusalem a praise in the earth.
 &nbsp; 8  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his
 strength, Surely I will no more give thy corn <I>to be</I> meat for
 thine enemies; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy
 wine, for the which thou hast laboured:
 &nbsp; 9  But they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in
 the courts of my holiness.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two things are here promised to Jerusalem:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Plenty of the means of grace--abundance of good preaching and good
 praying 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>),

 and this shows the method God takes when he designs mercy for a people; 
 he first brings them to their duty and pours out a spirit of prayer 
 upon them, and then brings salvation to them. Provision is made,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That ministers may do their duty as watchmen. It is here spoken of 
 as a token for good, as a step towards further mercy and an earnest of 
 it, that, in order to what he designed for them, he would set 
 <I>watchmen on their walls who should never hold their peace.</I> Note, 
 
 (1.) Ministers are watchmen on the church's walls, for it is as a city 
 besieged, whose concern it is to have sentinels on the walls, to take 
 notice and give notice of the motions of the enemy. It is necessary 
 that, as watchmen, they be wakeful, and faithful, and willing to endure 
 hardness. 

 (2.) They are concerned to stand upon their guard day and night; they 
 must never be off their watch as long as those for whose souls they 
 watch are not out of danger. 

 (3.) They must never hold their peace; they must take all opportunities 
 to give warning to sinners, in season, out of season, and must never 
 betray the cause of Christ by a treacherous or cowardly silence. They 
 must never hold their peace at the throne of grace; they must <I>pray, 
 and not faint,</I> as Moses lifted up his hands and kept them steady, 
 till Israel had obtained the victory over Amalek, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:10,12">Exod. xvii. 10, 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That people may do their duty. As those that make mention of the
 Lord, let not them keep silence neither, let not them think it enough 
 that their watchmen pray for them, but let them pray for themselves; 
 all will be little enough to meet the approaching mercy with due 
 solemnity. Note, 

 (1.) It is the character of God's professing people that they make 
 mention of the Lord, and continue to do so even in bad times, when the 
 land is termed <I>forsaken</I> and <I>desolate.</I> They are <I>the 
 Lord's remembrancers</I> (so the margin reads it); they remember the 
 Lord themselves and put one another in mind of him. 

 (2.) God's professing people must be a praying people, must be 
 public-spirited in prayer, must wrestle with God in prayer, and 
 continue to do so: "<I>Keep not silence;</I> never grow remiss in the 
 duty nor weary of it." <I>Give him no rest</I>--alluding to an 
 importunate beggar, to the widow that with her continual coming wearied 
 the judge into a compliance. God said to <I>Moses, Let me alone</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:10">Exod. xxxii. 10</A>),

 and Jacob to Christ, <I>I will not let thee go except thou bless
 me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:26">Gen. xxxii. 26</A>.

 (3.) God is so far from being displeased with our pressing importunity, 
 as men commonly are, that he invites and encourages it; he bids us to 
 cry after him; he is not like those disciples who discouraged a 
 petitioner, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:23">Matt. xv. 23</A>.

 He bids us make pressing applications at the throne of grace, and
 <I>give him no rest,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:5,8">Luke xi. 5, 8</A>.

 He suffers himself not only to be reasoned with, but to be wrestled
 with.

 (4.) The public welfare or prosperity of God's Jerusalem is that which 
 we should be most importunate for at the throne of grace; we should 
 pray for the good of the church. 

 [1.] That it may be safe, that he would <I>establish</I> it, that the
 interests of the church may be firm, may be settled for the present and 
 secured to posterity. 

 [2.] That it may be great, may be <I>a praise in the earth,</I> that it 
 may be praised, and God may be praised for it. When gospel truths are
 cleared and vindicated, when gospel ordinances are duly administered in 
 their purity and power, when the church becomes eminent for holiness 
 and love, then Jerusalem is a praise in the earth, then it is in 
 reputation.

 (5.) We must persevere in our prayers for mercy to the church till the 
 mercy come; we must do as the prophet's servant did, go yet seven 
 times, till the promising cloud appear, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:44">1 Kings xviii. 44</A>.

 (6.) It is a good sign that God is coming towards a people in ways of 
 mercy when he pours out a spirit of prayer upon them and stirs them up 
 to be fervent and constant in their intercessions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Plenty of all other good things, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 This follows upon the former; when the people praise God, when <I>all
 the people praise him, then shall the earth yield her increase</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+67:5,6">Ps. lxvii. 5, 6</A>),

 and outward prosperity, crowning its piety, shall help to make
 Jerusalem a praise in the earth. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The great distress they had been in, and the losses they had 
 sustained. Their corn had been meat for their enemies, which they hoped 
 would be meat for themselves and their families. Here was a double 
 grievance, that they themselves wanted that which was necessary to the 
 support of life and were in danger of perishing for want of it, and 
 that their enemies were strengthened by it, had their camp victualled 
 with it, and so were the better able to do them a mischief. God is said 
 to give their corn to their enemies, because he not only permitted it, 
 but ordered it, to be the just punishment both of their abuse of plenty 
 and of their symbolizing with strangers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:7"><I>ch.</I> i. 7</A>.

 The wine which they had laboured for, and which in their affliction
 they needed for the relief of those among them that were of a heavy 
 heart, strangers drank it, to gratify their lusts with; this sore 
 judgment was threatened for their sins, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:16,De+28:33">Lev. xxvi. 16; Deut. xxviii. 33</A>.

 See how uncertain our creature-comforts are, and how much it is our
 wisdom to labour for that meat which we can never be robbed of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The great fulness and satisfaction they should now be restored to 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Those that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the Lord.</I> 
 See here, 

 (1.) God's mercy in giving plenty, and peace to enjoy it,--that the 
 earth yields her increase, that there are hands to be employed in 
 gathering it in, and that they are not taken off by plague and 
 sickness, or otherwise employed in war,--that strangers and enemies do 
 not come and gather it for themselves, or take it from us when we have 
 gathered it,--that we eat the labour of our hands and the bread is not 
 eaten out of our mouths,--and especially that we have opportunity and a 
 heart to honour God with it, and that his courts are open to us and we 
 are not restrained from attending on him in them.

 (2.) Our duty in the enjoyment of this mercy. We must gather what God 
 gives, with care and industry; we must eat it freely and cheerfully, 
 not bury the gifts of God's bounty, but make use of them. We must, when 
 we have eaten and are full, <I>bless the Lord,</I> and give him thanks 
 for his bounty to us; and we must serve him with our abundance, use it 
 in works of piety and charity, eat it and <I>drink it in the courts of 
 his holiness,</I> where the altar, the priest, and the poor must all 
 have their share. The greatest comfort that a good man has in his meat
 and drink is that it furnishes him with a meat-offering and a 
 drink-offering for the Lord his God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:14">Joel ii. 14</A>);

 the greatest comfort that he has in an estate is that it gives him an
 opportunity of honouring God and doing good. This wine is to be 
 <I>drunk in the courts of God's holiness,</I> and therefore moderately 
 and with sobriety, as before the Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The solemn ratification of this promise: <I>The Lord has sworn by 
 his right hand, and by the arm of his strength,</I> that he will do 
 this for his people. God confirms it by an oath, that his people, who 
 trust in him and his word, may have <I>strong consolation,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:17,18">Heb. vi. 17, 18</A>.

 And, since he can swear by no greater, he swears by himself, sometimes
 by his being (<I>As I live,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:11">Ezek. xxxiii. 11</A>),

 here by his power, his right hand (which was lifted up in swearing,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:40">Deut. xxxii. 40</A>),

 and his arm of power; for it is a great satisfaction to those who build
 their hopes on God's promise to be sure that <I>what he has promised he 
 is able to perform,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:21">Rom. iv. 21</A>.

 To assure us of this he has sworn by his strength, pawning the
 reputation of his omnipotence upon it; if he do not do it, let it be 
 said, <I>It was because he could not,</I> which the Egyptians shall 
 never say

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:16">Num. xiv. 16</A>)

 nor any other. It is the comfort of God's people that his power is
 engaged for them, his right hand, where the Mediator sits.</P>

 This, as many like passages before, refers to the deliverance of the 
 Jews out of Babylon, and, under the type and figure of that, to the 
 great redemption wrought out by Jesus Christ, and the proclaiming of 
 gospel grace and liberty through him. 

 1. Way shall be made for this salvation; all difficulties shall be
 removed, and whatever might obstruct it shall be taken out of the way,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 The gates of Babylon shall be thrown open, that they may with freedom
 go through them; the way from Babylon to the land of Israel shall be 
 prepared; causeways shall be made and cast up through wet and miry 
 places, and the stones gathered out from places rough and rocky; in the 
 convenient places appointed for their rendezvous standards shall be set 
 up for their direction and encouragement, that they may embody for 
 their greater safety. Thus John Baptist was sent to <I>prepare the way 
 of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:3">Matt. iii. 3</A>.

 And, before Christ by his graces and comforts comes to any for
 salvation, preparation is made for him by repentance, which is called 
 the <I>preparation of the gospel of peace,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:15">Eph. vi. 15</A>.

 Here the way is levelled by it, there the feet are shod with it, which
 comes all to one, for both are in order to a journey.

 2. Notice shall be given of this salvation,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 It shall be proclaimed to the captives that they are set at liberty and
 may go if they please; it shall be proclaimed to their neighbours, to 
 all about them, <I>to the end of the world,</I> that God has pleaded 
 Zion's just, injured, and despised cause. Let is be said to Zion, for
 her comfort, <I>Behold, thy salvation comes</I> (that is, thy Saviour, 
 who brings salvation); he will bring such a work, such a reward, in 
 this salvation, as shall be admired by all, a reward of comfort and 
 peace with him; but a work of humiliation and reformation before him, 
 to prepare his people for that recompence of their sufferings; and 
 then, with reference to each, it follows, they shall be called, <I>The 
 holy people,</I> and the <I>redeemed of the Lord. The work before 
 him,</I> which shall be wrought in them and upon them, shall denominate 
 them a holy people, cured of their inclination to idolatry and 
 consecrated to God only; and the <I>reward with him,</I> the 
 deliverance wrought for them, shall denominate them the <I>redeemed of 
 the Lord,</I> so redeemed as none but God could redeem them, and 
 redeemed to be his, their bonds loosed, that they might be his 
 servants. Jerusalem shall then be called, <I>Sought out, a city not 
 forsaken.</I> She had been forsaken for many years; there were neither 
 traders nor worshippers that enquired the way to Jerusalem as formerly, 
 when it was frequented by both. But now God will again make her 
 considerable. She shall be sought out, visited, resorted to, and court 
 made to her, as much as ever. When Jerusalem is called a <I>holy 
 city,</I> then it is called <I>sought out;</I> for holiness puts an 
 honour and beauty upon any place or person, which draws respect, and 
 makes them to be admired, beloved, and enquired after. But this being 
 proclaimed to the end of the world must have a reference to the gospel 
 of Christ, which was to be preached to every creature; and it 
 intimates, 

 (1.) The glory of Christ. It is published immediately to the church, 
 but is thence echoed to every nation: <I>Behold, thy salvation 
 cometh.</I> Christ is not only the Saviour, but the salvation itself; 
 for the happiness of believers is not only from him, but in him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+12:2"><I>ch.</I> xii. 2</A>.

 His salvation consists both in the work and in the reward which he
 brings with him; for those that are his shall neither be idle nor lose 
 their labour. 

 (2.) The beauty of the church. Christians shall be called <I>saints</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:2">1 Cor. i. 2</A>),

 <I>the holy people,</I> for they are chosen and called <I>to salvation
 through sanctification.</I> They shall be called <I>the redeemed of the 
 Lord;</I> to him they owe their liberty, and therefore to him they owe 
 their service, and they shall not be ashamed to own both. None are to 
 be <I>called the redeemed of the Lord</I> but those that are the 
 <I>holy people;</I> the people of God's purchase are a holy nation. And 
 they shall be called, <I>Sought out.</I> God shall seek them out, and 
 find them, wherever they are dispersed, eclipsed, or lost in a crowd; 
 men shall seek them out, that they may join themselves to them, and not 
 forsake them. It is good to associate with <I>the holy people,</I> that 
 we may learn their ways, and with <I>the redeemed of the Lord,</I> that 
 we may share in the blessings of the redemption.</P>
