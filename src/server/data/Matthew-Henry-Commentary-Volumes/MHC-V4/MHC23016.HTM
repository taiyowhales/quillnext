 This chapter continues and concludes the burden of Moab. In it, 

 I. The prophet gives good counsel to the Moabites, to reform what was
 amiss among them, and particularly to be kind to God's people, as the 
 likeliest way to prevent the judgments before threatened, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+16:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. Fearing they would not take this counsel (they were so proud), he
 goes on to foretel the lamentable devastation of their country, and the
 confusion they should be brought to, and this within three years,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the
 wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.
 &nbsp; 2  For it shall be, <I>that,</I> as a wandering bird cast out of the
 nest, <I>so</I> the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.
 &nbsp; 3  Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night
 in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him
 that wandereth.
 &nbsp; 4  Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to
 them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at an
 end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the
 land.
 &nbsp; 5  And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall
 sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and
 seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God has made it to appear that he delights not in the ruin of sinners 
 by telling them what they may do to prevent the ruin; so he does here 
 to Moab.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He advises them to be just to the house of David, and to pay the 
 tribute they had formerly covenanted to pay to the kings of his line 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+16:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>Send you the lamb to the ruler of the land.</I> David made the 
 Moabites tributaries to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:2">2 Sam. viii. 2</A>.

 They <I>became his servants, and brought gifts.</I> Afterwards they
 paid their tribute to the kings of Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:4">2 Kings iii. 4</A>),

 and paid it in lambs. Now the prophet requires them to pay it to
 Hezekiah. Let it be raised and levied from all parts of the country, 
 <I>from Selah,</I> a frontier city of Moab on the one side, <I>to the 
 wilderness,</I> a boundary of the kingdom on the other side: and let it 
 be sent, where it should be sent, <I>to the mount of the daughter of 
 Zion,</I> the city of David. Some take it as an advice to send a lamb 
 for a sacrifice to God, <I>the ruler of the earth</I> (so it may be 
 read), the Lord of the whole earth, ruler of all lands, the land of 
 Moab as well as the land of Israel, "Send it to the temple built on 
 Mount Zion." And some think it is in this sense spoken ironically, 
 upbraiding the Moabites with their folly in delaying to repent and make 
 their peace with God. "Now you would be glad to send a lamb to Mount 
 Zion, to make the God of Israel your friend; but it is too late: the 
 decree has gone forth, the consumption is determined, and the 
 <I>daughters of Moab</I> shall be cast out <I>as a wandering bird,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+16:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 I rather take it as good advice seriously given, like that of Daniel to
 Nebuchadnezzar when he was reading him his doom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:27">Dan. iv. 27</A>.

 <I>Break off thy sins by righteousness, if it may be a lengthening of
 thy tranquillity.</I> And it is applicable to the great gospel duty of 
 submission to Christ, as the ruler of the land, and our ruler: "Send 
 him the lamb, the best you have, yourselves a living sacrifice. When 
 you come to God, the great ruler, come in the name of the Lamb, the 
 Lamb of God. <I>For else it shall be</I>" (so we may read it) "<I>that, 
 as a wandering bird cast out of the nest, so shall the daughters of 
 Moab be.</I> If you will not pay your quit-rent, your just tribute to 
 the king of Judah, you shall be turned out of your houses: <I>The 
 daughters of Moab</I> (the country villages, or the women of your 
 country) shall flutter about the <I>fords of Arnon,</I> attempting that 
 way to make their escape to some other land, <I>like a wandering bird 
 thrown out of the nest</I> half-fledged." Those that will not submit to 
 Christ, nor be gathered under the shadow of his wings, shall be <I>as a 
 bird that wanders from her nest,</I> that shall either be snatched up 
 by the next bird of prey or shall wander endlessly in continual 
 frights. Those that will not yield to the fear of God shall be made to 
 yield to the fear of every thing else.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He advises them to be <I>kind to the seed of Israel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+16:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):
 
 "Take counsel, call a convention, and consult among yourselves what is 
 fit to be done in the present critical juncture; and you will find it 
 your best way to execute judgment, to reverse all the unrighteous 
 decrees you have made, by which you have put hardships upon the people 
 of God, and, in token of your repentance for them, study now how to 
 oblige them, and this shall be accepted of God more than all 
 burnt-offering and sacrifice."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The prophet foresaw some storm coming upon the people of God, 
 perhaps the good people of the ten tribes, or of the two and a half on 
 the other side Jordan, whose country joined to that of Moab, and who, 
 by the merciful providence of God, escaped the fury of the Assyrian 
 army, had their lives given them for a prey, and were reserved for 
 better times, but were put to the utmost extremity to shift for their 
 own safety. The danger and trouble they were in were like the scorching 
 heat at noon; the face of the spoiler was very fierce upon them and the 
 oppressor and extortioner were ready to swallow them up after stripping 
 them of what they had.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He bespeaks a shelter for them in the land of Moab, when their own 
 land was made too hot for them. This judgment they must execute; thus 
 wisely must they do for themselves, and thus kindly must they deal with 
 the people of God. If they would themselves continue in their 
 habitations, let them now open their doors to the distressed dispersed 
 members of God's church, and be to them like a cool shade to those that 
 <I>bear the burden and heat of the day.</I> Let them not discover those 
 that absconded among them, nor deliver them up to the pursuers that 
 made search for them: "<I>Betray not him that wandereth,</I> nor 
 deliver him up" (as the Edomites did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:13,14">Obad. 13, 14</A>),

 "but <I>hide the outcasts.</I>" This was that good work by which
 Rahab's faith was justified, and proved to be sincere, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:31">Heb. xi. 31</A>.
 
 "Nay, do not only hide them for a time, but, if there be occasion, let
 them be naturalized: <I>Let my outcasts dwell with thee, Moab</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+16:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 find a lodging for them and <I>be thou a covert to them.</I> Let them 
 be taken under the protection of the government, though they are but 
 poor, and likely to be a charge to thee." Note, 

 (1.) It is often the lot even of those who are Israelites indeed to be 
 outcasts, driven out of house and harbour by persecution or war, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:37">Heb. xi. 37</A>.

 (2.) God owns them when men reject and disown them. They are 
 <I>outcasts,</I> but they are <I>my outcasts.</I> The Lord knows those 
 that are his wherever he finds them, even where no one else knows them.
 
 (3.) God will find a rest and shelter for his outcasts; for, though
 they are persecuted, they are not forsaken. He will himself be their 
 dwelling-place if they have no other, and in him they shall be at home.
 
 (4.) God can, when he pleases, raise up friends for his people even 
 among Moabites, when they can find none in all the land of Israel that 
 can and dare shelter them. The earth often helps the woman,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:16">Rev. xii. 16</A>.

 (5.) Those that expect to find favour when they are in trouble 
 themselves must show favour to those that are in trouble; and what 
 service is done to God's outcasts shall no doubt be recompensed one way 
 or other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He assures them of the mercy God had in store for his people. 

 (1.) That they should not long need their kindness, or be troublesome 
 to them: <I>For the extortioner is almost at an end</I> already, <I>and 
 the spoiler ceases.</I> God's people shall not be long outcasts; they 
 <I>shall have tribulation ten days</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:10">Rev. ii. 10</A>),

 and that is all. The spoiler would never cease spoiling if he might
 have his will; but God has him in a chain. <I>Hitherto he shall go, but 
 no further.</I>

 (2.) That they should, ere long, be in a capacity to return their 
 kindness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+16:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "Though the throne of the ten tribes be sunk and overturned, yet <I>the 
 throne of David shall be established in mercy,</I> by the mercy they 
 receive from God and the mercy they show to others; and by the same 
 methods may your throne be established if you please." It would engage 
 great men to be kind to the people of God if they would but observe, as 
 they easily might, how often such conduct brings the blessing of God 
 upon kingdoms and families. "Make Hezekiah your friend, for you will
 find it your interest to do so upon the account both of the grace of 
 God in him and the presence of God with him. He <I>shall sit upon the 
 throne in truth,</I> and then he does indeed sit in honour and sit 
 firmly. Then he shall sit <I>judging,</I> and will then be a protector
 to those that have been a shelter to the people of God." And see in him 
 the character of a good magistrate. 

 [1.] He shall <I>seek judgment;</I> that is, he shall seek occasions of 
 doing right to those that are wronged, and shall punish the injurious 
 even before they are complained of: or he shall diligently search into 
 every cause brought before him, that he may find where the right lies.
 
 [2.] He shall <I>hasten righteousness,</I> and not delay to do justice, 
 nor keep those long waiting that make application to him for the 
 redress of their grievances. Though he seeks judgment, and deliberates 
 upon it, yet he does not, under pretence of deliberation, stay the 
 progress of the streams of justice. Let the Moabites take example by 
 this, and then assure themselves that their state shall be 
 established.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  We have heard of the pride of Moab; <I>he is</I> very proud:
 <I>even</I> of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: <I>but</I>
 his lies <I>shall</I> not <I>be</I> so.
 &nbsp; 7  Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for
 the foundations of Kir-hareseth shall ye mourn; surely <I>they are</I>
 stricken.
 &nbsp; 8  For the fields of Heshbon languish, <I>and</I> the vine of Sibmah:
 the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants
 thereof, they are come <I>even</I> unto Jazer, they wandered <I>through</I>
 the wilderness: her branches are stretched out, they are gone
 over the sea.
 &nbsp; 9  Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of
 Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh:
 for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is
 fallen.
 &nbsp; 10  And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful
 field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither
 shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine in
 <I>their</I> presses; I have made <I>their vintage</I> shouting to cease.
 &nbsp; 11  Wherefore my bowels shall sound like a harp for Moab, and
 mine inward parts for Kir-haresh.
 &nbsp; 12  And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is
 weary on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to
 pray; but he shall not prevail.
 &nbsp; 13  This <I>is</I> the word that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath spoken concerning Moab
 since that time.
 &nbsp; 14  But now the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as
 the years of a hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be
 contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant <I>shall
 be</I> very small <I>and</I> feeble.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have, 

 I. The sins with which Moab is charged, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+16:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 The prophet seems to check himself for going about to give good counsel
 to the Moabites, concluding they would not take the advice he gave 
 them. He told them their duty (whether they would hear or whether they 
 would forbear), but despairs of working any good upon them; he would 
 have healed them, but they would not be healed. Those that will not be 
 counselled cannot be helped. Their sins were, 

 1. Pride. This is most insisted upon; for perhaps there are more
 precious souls ruined by pride than by any one lust whatsoever. The 
 Moabites were notorious for this: "<I>We have heard</I> in both ears 
 <I>of the pride of Moab;</I> it is what all their neighbours cry out 
 shame upon them for. <I>He is very proud;</I> the body of the nation is 
 so, forgetting the baseness of their origin and the brand of infamy 
 fastened upon them by that law of God which forbade a Moabite to 
 <I>enter into the congregation of the Lord for ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:3">Deut. xxiii. 3</A>.

 We have heard of <I>his haughtiness and his pride.</I> It is not the
 rash and rigid censure of one of two concerning them, but it is the 
 character which all that know them will give of them. They are a proud 
 people, and therefore they will not take good counsel when it is given 
 them. They think themselves too wise to be advised; therefore they will 
 not take example by Hezekiah to do justly and love mercy. They scorn to 
 make him their pattern, for they think themselves able to teach him.
 They are proud, and therefore will not be subject to God himself nor 
 regard the warnings he gives them. <I>The wicked, in the pride of his
 countenance, will not seek after God.</I> They are proud, and therefore 
 will not entertain and protect God's outcasts; they scorn to have any 
 thing to do with them." But this is not all:--

 2. "We have heard of <I>his wrath</I> too (for those that are very
 proud are commonly very passionate), particularly his wrath against the 
 people of God, whom therefore he will rather persecute than protect. 

 3. It is with <I>his lies</I> that he gains the gratifications of his
 pride and his passion; <I>but his lies shall not be so;</I> he shall 
 not compass his proud and angry projects as he hoped he should." Some 
 read it, <I>His haughtiness, his pride, and his wrath, are greater than 
 his strength.</I> "We know that, if we lay at his mercy, we should find 
 no mercy with him, but he has not power equal to his malice. His pride 
 draws down ruin upon him; for it is the preface to destruction, and he 
 has not strength to ward it off."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The sorrows with which Moab is threatened 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+16:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab.</I> All the inhabitants shall 
 bitterly lament the ruin of their country. They shall complain one to 
 another: <I>Every one shall howl</I> in despair, and not one shall 
 either see any cause or have any heart to encourage his friend.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The causes of this sorrow. 

 (1.) The destruction of their cities: <I>For the foundations of 
 Kir-haraseth shall you mourn.</I> That great and strong city, which had 
 held out against a mighty force 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:25">2 Kings iii. 25</A>),

 should now be levelled with the ground, either burnt or broken down,
 and its foundations <I>stricken,</I> bruised and broken (so the word 
 signifies); they shall howl when they see their splendid cities turned 
 into ruinous heaps.

 (2.) The desolation of their country. Moab was famous for its fields 
 and vineyards; but those shall all be laid waste by the invading army,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+16:8,10"><I>v.</I> 8, 10</A>.
 
 See, 

 [1.] What a fruitful pleasant country they had, as the garden of the
 Lord, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:10">Gen. xiii. 10</A>.

 It was planted with choice and noble vines, with <I>principal
 plants,</I> which reached <I>even to Jazer,</I> a city in the tribe of 
 Gad. The luxuriant branches of their vines <I>wandered,</I> and wound 
 themselves along the ranges on which they were spread, even <I>through 
 the wilderness</I> of Moab. There were vineyards there. Nay, they were
 <I>stretched out,</I> and went even to <I>the sea,</I> the Dead Sea: 
 the best grapes grew in their hedge-rows.

 [2.] How merry and pleasant they had been in it. Many a time they had 
 shouted <I>for their summer fruits, and for their harvest,</I> as the 
 country people sometimes do with us when they have cut down all their 
 corn. They had had <I>joy and gladness</I> in their fields and 
 vineyards, <I>singing</I> and <I>shouting at the treading of their 
 grapes.</I> Nothing is said of their praising God for their abundance, 
 and giving him the glory of it. If they had made it the matter of
 their thanksgiving, they might still have had it the food and fuel of 
 their lusts; see therefore, 

 [3.] How they should be stripped of all. "The fields shall
 <I>languish,</I> all the fruits of them being carried away or trodden 
 down; they cannot now enrich their owners as they have done, and 
 therefore they languish. The soldiers, called here <I>the lords of the 
 heathen,</I> shall break down all the plants, though they were 
 <I>principal plants,</I> the choicest that could be got. Now the 
 shouting for the enjoyment of the summer fruits has fallen, and is 
 turned into howling for the loss of them. The joy of harvest has 
 ceased; there is no more singing, no more shouting, for the treading 
 out of wine. They have not what they have had to rejoice in, nor have 
 they a disposition to rejoice; the ruin of their country has marred 
 their mirth." Note, <I>First,</I> God can easily change the note of 
 those that are most addicted to mirth and pleasure, can soon turn their 
 laughter into mourning and their joy into heaviness. <I>Secondly,</I> 
 Joy in God is, upon this account, far better than the joy of harvest, 
 that it is what we cannot be robbed of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:6,7">Ps. iv. 6, 7</A>.

 Destroy the vines and the fig-trees, and you make all the mirth of a
 carnal heart to cease,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:11,12">Hos. ii. 11, 12</A>.

 But a gracious soul can rejoice in the Lord as the God of its salvation
 even when the fig-tree does not blossom and there is no fruit in the 
 vine, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:17,18">Hab. iii. 17, 18</A>.

 In God therefore let us always rejoice with a holy triumph, and in
 other things let us always rejoice with a holy trembling, rejoice as 
 though we rejoiced not.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The concurrence of the prophet with them in this sorrow: "<I>I will 
 with weeping bewail Jazer, and the vine of Sibmah,</I> and look with a 
 compassionate concern upon the desolations of such a pleasant country. 
 <I>I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon!</I> and mingle them with 
 thy tears;" nay 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+16:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 it appears to be an inward grief: <I>My bowels shall sound like a harp 
 for Moab;</I> it should make such an impression upon him that he should 
 feel an inward trembling, like that of the strings of a harp when it is 
 played upon. It well becomes God's prophets to acquaint themselves with 
 grief; the great prophet did so. The afflictions of the world, as well
 as those of the church, should be afflictions to us. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+15:5"><I>ch.</I> xv. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. In the close of the chapter we have, 

 1. The insufficiency of the gods of Moab, the false gods, to help them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+16:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 "Moab shall be soon <I>weary of the high place.</I> He shall spend his
 spirits and strength in vain in praying to his idols; they cannot help 
 him, and he shall be convinced that they cannot." It is seen that it is 
 to no purpose to expect any relief from the high places on earth; it 
 must come from above the hills. Men are generally so stupid that they 
 will not believe, till they are made to see, the vanity of idols and of 
 all creature-confidences, nor will come off from them till they are 
 made weary of them. But, when he is weary of his high places, he will 
 not go, as he should, to God's sanctuary, but to <I>his</I> sanctuary, 
 to the temple of Chemosh, the principal idol of Moab (so it is 
 generally understood); and he shall pray there to as little purpose, 
 and as little to his own case and satisfaction, as he did in his high 
 places; for, whatever honours idolaters give to their idols, they do 
 not thereby make them at all the better able to help them. Whether they 
 are the <I>dii majorum gentium--gods of the higher order,</I> or 
 <I>minorum--of the lower order,</I> they are alike the creatures of 
 men's fancy and the work of men's hands. Perhaps it may be meant of
 their coming to God's sanctuary. When they found they could have no 
 succours from their own high places some of them would come to the 
 temple of God at Jerusalem, to pray there, but in vain; he will justly 
 send them back to <I>the gods whom they have served,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:14">Judg. x. 14</A>.

 2. The sufficiency of the God of Israel, the only true God, to make
 good what he had spoken against them.

 (1.) The thing itself was long since determined

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+16:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>This is the word,</I> this is the thing, <I>that the Lord has spoken 
 concerning Moab, since the time</I> that he began to be so proud, and 
 insolent, and abusive to God's people. The country was long ago doomed 
 to ruin; this was enough to give an assurance of it that <I>it is the 
 word which the Lord has spoken;</I> and, as he will never unsay what he 
 has spoken, so all the power of hell and earth cannot gainsay it, or 
 obstruct the execution of it. 

 (2.) Now it was made known when it should be done. The time was before 
 fixed in the counsel of God, but now it was revealed: <I>The Lord has 
 spoken</I> that it shall be <I>within three years,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+16:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 <I>It is not for us to know,</I> or covet to know, <I>the times and the
 seasons,</I> any further than God has thought fit to make them known, 
 and so far we may and must take notice of them. See how God makes known 
 his mind by degrees; the light of divine revelation shone more and 
 more, and so does the light of divine grace in the heart. Observe, 

 [1.] The sentence passed upon Moab: <I>The glory of Moab shall be 
 contemned,</I> that is, it shall be contemptible, when all those things 
 they have gloried in shall come to nothing. Such is the glory of this 
 world, so fading and uncertain, admired awhile, but soon slighted. Let 
 that therefore which will soon be contemptible in the eyes of others be 
 always contemptible in our eyes in comparison with the <I>far more 
 exceeding weight of glory.</I> It was the glory of Moab that their 
 country was very populous and their forces were courageous; but where 
 is her glory when all that great multitude is in a manner swept away, 
 some by one judgment and some by another, and the little remnant that 
 is left shall be <I>very small and feeble,</I> not able to bear up 
 under their own griefs, much less to make head against their enemies' 
 insults? Let not therefore the strong glory in their strength nor the 
 many in their numbers. 

 [2.] The time fixed for the execution of this sentence: <I>Within three 
 years, as the years of a hireling,</I> that is, at the three years' end 
 exactly, for a servant that is hired for a certain term keeps account 
 to a day. Let Moab know that her ruin is very near, and prepare 
 accordingly. Fair warning is given, and with it space to repent, which 
 if they had improved, as Nineveh did, we have reason to think the 
 judgments threatened would have been prevented.</P>
