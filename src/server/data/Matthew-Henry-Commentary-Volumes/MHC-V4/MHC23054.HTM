 The death of Christ is the life of the church and of all that truly 
 belong to it; and therefore very fitly, after the prophet had foretold 
 the sufferings of Christ, he foretels the flourishing of the church, 
 which is a part of his glory, and that exaltation of him which was the 
 reward of his humiliation: it was promised him that he should see his
 seed, and this chapter is an explication of that promise. It may easily 
 be granted that it has a primary reference to the welfare and 
 prosperity of the Jewish church after their return out of Babylon, 
 which (as other things that happened to them) was typical of the 
 glorious liberty of the children of God, which through Christ we are 
 brought into; yet it cannot be denied but that it has a further and 
 principal reference to the gospel church, into which the Gentiles were 
 to be admitted. And the first words being understood by the apostle 
 Paul of the New-Testament Jerusalem 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:26">Gal. iv. 26</A>)

 may serve as a key to the whole chapter and that which follows. It is
 here promised concerning the Christian church,

 I. That, though the beginnings of it were small, it should be greatly 
 enlarged by the accession of many to it among the Gentiles, who had 
 been wholly destitute of church privileges, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. That though sometimes God might seem to withdraw from her, and
 suspend the tokens of his favour, he would return in mercy and would 
 not return to contend with them any more, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:6-10">ver. 6-10</A>.

 III. That, though for a while she was in sorrow and under oppression, 
 she should at length be advanced to greater honour and splendour than 
 ever, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:11,12">ver. 11, 12</A>.

 IV. That knowledge, righteousness, and peace, should flourish and 
 prevail, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:13,14">ver. 13, 14</A>.

 V. That all attempts against the church should be baffled, and she
 should be secured from the malice of her enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:14-17">ver. 14-17</A>.</P>

 If we apply this to the state of the Jews after their return out of 
 captivity, it is a prophecy of the increase of their nation after they 
 were settled in their own land. Jerusalem had been in the condition of 
 a wife written childless, or a desolate solitary widow; but now it is 
 promised that the city should be replenished and the country peopled 
 again, that not only the ruins of Jerusalem should be repaired, but the 
 suburbs of it extended on all sides and a great many buildings erected 
 upon new foundations,--that those estates which had for many years been
 wrongfully held by the Babylonian Gentiles should now return to the 
 right owners. God will again be a husband to them, and the reproach of 
 their captivity, and the small number to which they were then reduced, 
 shall be forgotten. And it is to be observed that, by virtue of the 
 ancient promise made to Abraham of the increase of his seed, when they 
 were restored to God's favour they multiplied greatly. Those that first 
 came out of Babylon were but 42,000 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:64">Ezra ii. 64</A>),

 about a fifteenth part of their number when they came out of Egypt;
 many came dropping to them afterwards, but we may suppose that to be 
 the greatest number that ever came in a body; and yet above 500 years 
 after, a little before their destruction by the Romans, a calculation 
 was made by the number of the paschal lambs, and the lowest computation 
 by that rule (allowing only ten to a lamb, whereas they might be 
 twenty) made the nation to be nearly three millions. Josephus says, 
 seven and twenty hundred thousand and odd, <I>Jewish War</I> 6.425. But 
 we must apply it to the church of God in general; I mean the kingdom of 
 God among men, God's city in the world, the children of God 
 incorporated. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The low and languishing state of religion in the world for a long 
 time before Christianity was brought in. It was like one <I>barren, 
 that did not bear,</I> or travail with child, was like one desolate, 
 that had lost husband and children; the church lay in a little compass, 
 and brought forth little fruit. The Jews were indeed by profession 
 married to God, but few proselytes were added to them, the rising 
 generations were unpromising, and serious godliness manifestly lost 
 ground among them. The Gentiles had less religion among them than the 
 Jews; their proselytes were in a dispersion; and the children of God, 
 like the children of a broken, reduced family, were <I>scattered 
 abroad</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:52">John xi. 52</A>),
 
 did not appear nor make any figure.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Its recovery from this low condition by the preaching of the gospel 
 and the planting of the Christian church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Multitudes were converted from idols to the living God. Those were 
 the church's children that were born again, were partakers of a new and 
 divine nature, by the word. <I>More were the children of the desolate 
 than of the married wife;</I> there were more good people found in the 
 Gentile church (when that was set up) that had long been afar off, and 
 without God in the world, than ever were found in the Jewish church. 
 God's sealed ones out of the tribes of Israel are numbered 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:4">Rev. vii. 4</A>),
 
 and they were but a remnant compared with the thousands of Israel; but
 those of other nations were so many, and crowded in so thickly, and lay 
 so much scattered in all parts, that no man could number them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 
 Sometimes more of the power of religion is found in those places and 
 families that have made little show of it, and have enjoyed but little 
 of the means of grace, than in others that have distinguished 
 themselves by a flourishing profession; and then more are the children 
 of the desolate, more the fruits of their righteousness, than those of 
 the married wife; so the last shall be first. Now this is spoken of as 
 matter of great rejoicing to the church, which is called upon to break 
 forth into singing upon this account. The increase of the church is the 
 joy of all its friends and strengthens their hands. The longer the 
 church has lain desolate the greater will the transports of joy be when 
 it begins to recover the ground it has lost and to gain more. Even in 
 heaven, among the angels of God, there is an uncommon joy for a sinner 
 that repents, much more for a nation that does so. If the barren 
 fig-tree at length bring forth fruit, it is well; it shall rejoice, and 
 others with it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The bounds of the church were extended much further than ever 
 before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 (1.) It is here supposed that the present state of the church is a 
 tabernacle state; it dwells in tents, like the heirs of promise of old 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:9">Heb. xi. 9</A>);

 its dwelling is mean and movable, and of no strength against a storm.
 The city, the continuing city, is reserved for hereafter. A tent is 
 soon taken down and shifted, so the candlestick of church privileges is 
 soon <I>removed out of its place</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:5">Rev. ii. 5</A>),
 
 and, when God pleases, it is as soon fixed elsewhere.

 (2.) Though it be a tabernacle state, it is sometimes very remarkably a 
 growing state; and, if this family increase, no matter though it be in 
 a tent. Thus it was in the first preaching of the gospel; it was the 
 business of the apostles to disciple all nations, to stretch forth the 
 curtains of the church's habitation, to preach the gospel where Christ 
 had not yet been named 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:20">Rom. xv. 20</A>),

 to leaven with the gospel those towns and countries that had hitherto
 been strangers to it, and so to lengthen the cords of this tabernacle, 
 that more might be enclosed, which would make it necessary to 
 strengthen the stakes proportionably, that they might bear the weight 
 of the enlarged curtains. The more numerous the church grows the more 
 cautious she must be to fortify herself against errors and corruptions, 
 and to support her seven pillars, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+9:1">Prov. ix. 1</A>.

 (3.) It was a proof of divine power going along with the gospel that in 
 all places it <I>grew and prevailed mightily,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:20">Acts xix. 20</A>.

 It broke forth, as the breaking forth of waters--<I>on the right hand
 and on the left,</I> that is, on all hands. The gospel spread itself
 into all parts of the world; there were eastern and western churches. 
 The church's seed inherited the Gentiles, and the cities that had been 
 desolate (that is, destitute of the knowledge and worship of the true 
 God) came to be inhabited, that is, to have religion set up in them and 
 the name of Christ professed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. This was the comfort and honour of the church 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>Fear not, for thou shalt not be ashamed,</I> as formerly, of the 
 straitness of thy borders, and the fewness of thy children, which thy 
 enemies upbraided thee with, but shalt <I>forget the reproach of thy 
 youth,</I> because there shall be no more ground for that reproach." It 
 was the reproach of the Christian religion, in its youth, that none of 
 the rulers or princes of this world embraced it and that it was 
 entertained and professed by a despicable handful of men; but, after 
 awhile, nations were discipled, the empire became Christian, and then 
 this <I>reproach of its youth was forgotten.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. This was owing to the relation in which God stood to his church, as 
 her husband 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Thy maker is thy husband.</I> Believers are said to be married to 
 Christ, that they may <I>bring forth fruit unto God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:4">Rom. vii. 4</A>);

 so the church is married to him, that she may bear and bring up a holy
 seed to God, that shall be accounted to him for a generation. Jesus 
 Christ is the church's Maker, by whom she is formed into a people--her 
 Redeemer, by whom she is brought out of captivity, the bondage of sin, 
 the worst of slaveries. This is he that espoused her to himself; and,

 (1.) He is <I>the Lord of hosts,</I> who has an irresistible power, an 
 absolute sovereignty, and a universal dominion! Kings who are lords of
 some hosts, find there are others who are lords of other hosts, as many 
 and mighty as theirs; but God is the Lord of all hosts. 

 (2.) He is <I>the Holy One of Israel,</I> the same that presided in the 
 affairs of the Old-Testament church and was the Mediator of the 
 covenant made with it. The promises made to the New-Testament Israel 
 are as rich and sure as those made to the Old-Testament Israel; for he 
 that is our Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel. 

 (3.) He is and shall be called <I>the Lord of the whole earth,</I> as 
 God, and as Mediator, for he is the heir of all things; but <I>then</I> 
 he shall be called so, when the ends of the earth shall be made to see 
 his salvation, when all the earth shall call him their God and have an 
 interest in him. Long he had been called, in a peculiar manner, <I>the 
 God of Israel;</I> but now, the partition wall between Jew and Gentile 
 being taken down, he shall be called <I>the God of the whole earth</I> 
 even where he has been, as at Athens itself, an <I>unknown God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The seasonable succour and relief which God sent to his captives in 
 Babylon, when they had a discharge from their bondage there, are here 
 foretold, as a type and figure of all those consolations of God which 
 are treasured up for the church in general and all believers in 
 particular, in the covenant of grace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Look back to former troubles, and in comparison with them God's 
 favours to his people appear very comfortable,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:6-8"><I>v.</I> 6-8</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. How sorrowful the church's condition had been. She had been as a 
 woman forsaken, whose husband was dead, or had fallen out with her, 
 though she was <I>a wife of youth,</I> upon which account she is 
 grieved in spirit, takes it very ill, frets, and grows melancholy upon 
 it; or she had been as one refused and rejected, and therefore full of 
 discontent. Note, Even those that are espoused to God may yet seem to
 be refused and forsaken, and may be grieved in spirit under the 
 apprehensions of being so. Those that shall never be forsaken and left 
 in despair may yet for a time be perplexed and in distress. The 
 similitude is explained

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>):

 <I>For a small moment have I forsaken thee. In a little wrath I hid my 
 face from thee.</I> When God continues his people long in trouble he 
 seems to forsake them; so their enemies construe it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:11">Ps. lxxi. 11</A>);

 so they themselves misinterpret it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:14"><I>ch.</I> xlix. 14</A>.

 When they are comfortless under their troubles, because their prayers
 and expectations are not answered, God hides his face from them, as if 
 he regarded them not nor designed them any kindness. God owns that he 
 had done this; for he keeps an account of the afflictions of his 
 people, and, though he never turned his face against them (as against 
 the wicked, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:16">Ps. xxxiv. 16</A>),

 he remembers how often he turned his back upon them. This arose indeed
 from his displeasure. It was in wrath that he forsook them and hid his 
 face from them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:17"><I>ch.</I> lvii. 17</A>);

 yet it was but in a little wrath: not that God's wrath ever is a little
 thing, or to be made light of (<I>Who knows the power of his 
 anger?</I>), but little in comparison with what they had deserved, and 
 what others justly suffer, on whom the full vials of his wrath are 
 poured out. He did not stir up all his wrath. But God's people, though 
 they be sensible of ever so small a degree of God's displeasure, cannot 
 but be grieved in spirit because of it. As for the continuance of it, 
 it was but <I>for a moment,</I> a <I>small</I> moment; for God does not 
 keep his anger against his people for ever; no, it is soon over. As he 
 is slow to anger, so he is swift to show mercy. The afflictions of 
 God's people, as they are light, so they are but for a moment, a cloud 
 that presently blows over. 

 2. How sweet the returns of mercy would be to them when God should come 
 and comfort them according to the time that he had afflicted them. God 
 called them into covenant with himself when they were forsaken and 
 grieved; he called them out of their afflictions when they were most 
 pressing,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 God's anger endures for a moment, but he will gather his people when 
 they think themselves neglected, will gather them out of their 
 dispersions, that they may return in a body to their own land,--will 
 gather them into his arms, to protect them, embrace them, and bear them 
 up,--and will gather them at last to himself, <I>will gather the wheat 
 into the barn.</I> He will have mercy on them. This supposes the 
 turning away of his anger and the admitting of them again into his 
 favour. God's gathering his people takes rise from his mercy, not any 
 merit of others; and it is with <I>great mercies</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 <I>with everlasting kindness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 The wrath is little, but the mercies are great; the wrath is for a 
 moment, but the kindness everlasting. See how one is set over against 
 the other, that we may neither despond under our afflictions nor 
 despair of relief.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Look forward to future dangers, and in defiance of them God's 
 favours to his people appear very constant, and his kindness 
 everlasting; for it is formed into a covenant, here called a 
 <I>covenant of peace,</I> because it is founded in reconciliation and 
 is inclusive of all good. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. This is as firm as the covenant of providence. It is <I>as the 
 waters of Noah,</I> that is, as that promise which was made concerning 
 the deluge that there should never be the like again to disturb the 
 course of summer and winter, seed-time and harvest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 God then contended with the world in great wrath, and for a full year, 
 and yet at length returned in mercy, everlasting mercy; for he gave his 
 word, which was as inviolable as his oath, that Noah's flood should 
 never return, that he would never drown the world again; see 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:21,22,9:11">Gen. viii. 21, 22; ix. 11</A>.

 And God has ever since kept his word, though the world has been very
 provoking; and he will keep it to the end; for the world that now is is 
 reserved unto fire. And thus inviolable is the covenant of grace: <I>I 
 have sworn that I would not be wroth with thee,</I> as I have been, 
 <I>and rebuke thee,</I> as I have done. He will not be so angry with 
 them as to cast them off and break his covenant with them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:34">Ps. lxxxix. 34</A>),

 nor rebuke them as he has rebuked the heathen, to destroy them, and
 <I>put out their name for ever and ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:5">Ps. ix. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It is more firm than the strongest parts of the visible creation 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 The <I>mountains shall depart,</I> which are called <I>everlasting 
 mountains,</I> and <I>the hills be removed,</I> though they are called 
 <I>perpetual hills,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:6">Hab. iii. 6</A>.

 Sooner shall they remove than God's covenant with his people be broken.
 Mountains have sometimes been shaken by earthquakes, and removed; but 
 the promises of God were never broken by the shock of any event. The 
 day will come when all <I>the mountains shall depart</I> and all <I>the 
 hills be removed,</I> not only the tops of them covered, as they were 
 by the waters of Noah, but the roots of them torn up; for the earth and 
 all the works that are therein shall be burned up; but then the 
 covenant of peace between God and believers shall continue in the 
 everlasting bliss of all those who are the children of that covenant. 
 Mountains and hills signify great men, men of bulk and figure. Do these 
 mountains seem to support the skies (as Atlas) and bear them up? They 
 shall depart and be removed. Creature-confidences shall fail us. <I>In
 vain is salvation hoped for from those hills and mountains.</I> But the 
 firmament is firm, and answers to its name, when those who seem to prop 
 it are gone. When our friends fail us our God does not, nor does his
 kindness depart? Do these mountains threaten, and seem to top the 
 skies, and bid defiance to them, as Pelion and Ossa? Do the kings of 
 the earth, and the rulers, set themselves against the Lord? They shall 
 depart and be removed. Great mountains, that stand in the way of the
 salvation of the church, shall be <I>made plain</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:7">Zech. iv. 7</A>);

 but God's kindness shall never depart from his people, for whom he
 loves he loves to the end; nor shall the covenant of his peace ever be 
 removed, for he is the Lord that has mercy on his people. 
 <I>Therefore</I> the covenant is immovable and inviolable, because it 
 is built not on our merit, which is a mutable uncertain thing, but on 
 God's mercy, which is from everlasting to everlasting.</P>

 &nbsp; 14  In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be
 far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror;
 for it shall not come near thee.
 &nbsp; 15  Behold, they shall surely gather together, <I>but</I> not by me:
 whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy
 sake.
 &nbsp; 16  Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in
 the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and
 I have created the waster to destroy.
 &nbsp; 17  No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and
 every tongue <I>that</I> shall rise against thee in judgment thou
 shalt condemn. This <I>is</I> the heritage of the servants of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and their righteousness <I>is</I> of me, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Very precious promises are here made to the church in her low 
 condition, that God would not only continue his love to his people 
 under their troubles as before, but that he would restore them to their 
 former prosperity, nay, that he would raise them to greater prosperity 
 than any they had yet enjoyed. In the foregoing chapter we had the 
 humiliation and exaltation of Christ; here we have the humiliation and 
 exaltation of the church; for, if we suffer with him, we shall reign 
 with him. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The distressed state the church is here reduced to by the providence 
 of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 "<I>O thou afflicted,</I> poor, and indigent society, that art 
 <I>tossed with tempests,</I> like a ship driven from her anchors by a 
 storm and hurried into the ocean, where she is ready to be swallowed up 
 by the waves, and in this condition <I>not comforted</I> by any 
 compassionate friend that will sympathize with thee, or suggest to thee 
 any encouraging considerations 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+4:1">Eccl. iv. 1</A>),

 not comforted by any allay to thy trouble, or prospect of deliverance
 out of it." This was the condition of the Jews in Babylon, and 
 afterwards, for a time, under Antiochus. It is often the condition of 
 Christian churches and of particular believers; without are fightings, 
 within are fears; they are like the disciples in a storm, ready to 
 perish; and where is their faith?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The glorious state the church is here advanced to by the promise of 
 God. God takes notice of the afflicted distressed state of his church, 
 and comforts her, when she is most disconsolate and has no other 
 comforter. Let the people of God, when they are afflicted and tossed, 
 think they hear God speaking comfortably to them by these words, taking 
 notice of their griefs and fears, what afflictions they are under, what 
 distresses they are in, and what comforts their case calls for. When 
 they bemoan themselves, God bemoans them, and speaks to them with pity: 
 <I>O thou afflicted, tossed with tempests, and not comforted;</I> for 
 in all their afflictions he is afflicted. But this is not all; he 
 engages to raise her up out of her affliction, and encourages her with 
 the assurance of the great things he would do for her, both for her 
 prosperity and for the securing of that prosperity to her.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Whereas now she lay in disgrace, God promises that which would be 
 her beauty and honour, which would make her easy to herself and amiable 
 in the eyes of others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) This is here promised by a similitude taken from a city, and it is 
 an apt similitude, for the church is the city of the living God, the 
 heavenly Jerusalem. Whereas now Jerusalem lay in ruins, a heap of 
 rubbish, it shall be not only rebuilt, but beautified, and appear more 
 splendid than ever; the stones shall be laid not only firm, but fine, 
 laid with fair colours; they shall be <I>glistering stones,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:2">1 Chron. xxix. 2</A>.

 The foundations shall be laid or garnished with <I>sapphires,</I> the
 most precious of the precious stones here mentioned; for Christ (the 
 church's foundation), and the foundation of the apostles and prophets, 
 are precious above any thing else. The windows of this house, city, or 
 temple, shall be made of <I>agates,</I> the gates of <I>carbuncles,</I> 
 and all the <I>borders</I> (the walls that enclose the courts, or the 
 boundaries by which her limits are marked, the mere-stones) shall be 
 <I>of pleasant stones,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Never was this literally true; but it intimates,

 [1.] That, God having graciously undertaken to build his church, we may 
 expect that to be done for it, that to be wrought in it, which is very 
 great and uncommon. 

 [2.] That the glory of the New-Testament church shall far exceed that 
 of the Jewish church, not in external pomp and splendour, but in those 
 gifts and graces of the Spirit which are infinitely more valuable, that 
 wisdom which is <I>more precious than rubies</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:15">Prov. iii. 15</A>),

 than the precious onyx and the sapphire, and which the <I>topaz of
 Ethiopia cannot equal,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+28:16,19">Job xxviii. 16, 19</A>.

 [3.] That the wealth of this world, and those things of it that are 
 accounted most precious, shall be despised by all the true living 
 members of the church, as having no value, no glory, in comparison with 
 that which far excels. That which the children of this world lay up 
 among their treasures, and too often in their hearts, the children of 
 God make pavements of, and put under their feet, the fittest place of 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It is here promised in the particular instances of those things 
 that shall be the beauty and honour of the church, which are knowledge, 
 holiness, and love, the very image of God, in which man was created, 
 renewed, and restored. And these are the sapphires and carbuncles, the 
 precious and pleasant stones, with which the gospel temple shall be 
 enriched and beautified, and these wrought by the power and efficacy of 
 those doctrines which the apostle compares to gold or silver, and 
 precious stones, that are to be <I>built upon the foundation,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:12">1 Cor. iii. 12</A>.
 
 Then the church is all glorious,

 [1.] When it is full of the knowledge of God, and that is promised here 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>All thy children shall be taught of the Lord.</I> The church's 
 children, being born of God, shall be taught of God; being his children 
 by adoption, he will take care of their education. It was promised 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)

 that the church's children should be many; but lest we should think 
 that being many, as sometimes it happens in numerous families, they 
 will be neglected, and not have instruction given them so carefully as 
 if they were but few, God here takes that work into his own hand: 
 <I>They shall all be taught of the Lord;</I> and none teaches like him.
 <I>First,</I> It is a promise of the means of instruction and those 
 means authorized by a divine institution: <I>They shall all be taught 
 of God,</I> that is, they shall be taught by those whom God shall 
 appoint and whose labours shall be under his direction and blessing. He 
 will ordain the methods of instruction, and by his word and ordinances 
 will diffuse a much greater light than the Old-Testament church had.
 Care shall be taken for the teaching of the church's children, that 
 knowledge may be transmitted from generation to generation, and that 
 all may be enriched with it, from the least even to the greatest.
 <I>Secondly,</I> It is a promise of the Spirit of illumination. Our 
 Saviour quotes it with application to gospel grace, and makes it to 
 have its accomplishment in all those that were brought to believe in 
 him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:45">John vi. 45</A>):

 <I>It is written in the prophets, They shall be all taught of God,</I>
 whence he infers that those, and those only, come to him by faith that 
 have heard and learned of the Father, that are <I>taught by him as the 
 truth is in Jesus,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:21">Eph. iv. 21</A>.

 There shall be a plentiful effusion of the Spirit of grace upon
 Christians, to <I>teach them all things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:26">John xiv. 26</A>.

 [2.] When the members of it live in love and unity among themselves: 
 <I>Great shall be the peace of thy children.</I> Peace may be taken 
 here for all good. As where no knowledge of God is no good can be
 expected, so those that are taught of God to know him are in a fair way 
 to prosper for both worlds. <I>Great peace have those that</I> know and 
 <I>love God's law,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:165">Ps. cxix. 165</A>.

 But it is often put for love and unity; and so we may take it. All that
 are taught of God are taught to <I>love one another</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:9">1 Thess. iv. 9</A>)

 and that will keep peace among the church's children and prevent their
 falling out by the way.

 [3.] When holiness reigns; for that above any thing is the beauty of 
 the church 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>In righteousness shall thou be established.</I> The reformation of 
 manners, the restoration of purity, the due administration of public 
 justice, and the prevailing of honesty and fair dealing among men, are 
 the strength and stability of any church or state. The kingdom of God, 
 set up by the gospel of Christ, is not meat and drink, but this 
 righteousness and peace, holiness and love.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Whereas now she lay in danger, God promises that which would be her 
 protection and security.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) God engages here that though, in the day of her distress, without 
 were fightings and within were fears, now she shall be safe from both. 
 
 [1.] There shall be no fears within 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 "<I>Thou shalt be far from oppression.</I> Those that have oppressed 
 thee shall be removed, those that would oppress thee shall be 
 restrained, and therefore thou shalt not fear, but mayest look upon it 
 as a thing at a great distance, that thou art now in no danger of. Thou 
 shalt be far from terror, not only from evil, but from the fear of 
 evil, for it shall not come near thee so as to do thee any hurt or to 
 put thee in any fright." Note, Those are far from terror that are far 
 from oppression; for it is as great a terror as can fall on a people to 
 have the rod of government turned into the serpent of oppression, 
 because against this there is no fence, nor is there any flight from 
 it.

 [2.] There shall be no fightings without. Though attempts should be 
 made upon them to insult them, to invade their country, or besiege 
 their towns, they should all be in vain, and none of them succeed, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 It is granted, "<I>They shall surely gather together against thee;</I> 
 thou must expect it." The confederate force of hell and earth will be 
 renewing their assaults. As long as there is a devil in hell, and a 
 persecutor out of it, God's people must expect frequent alarms; but, 
 <I>First,</I> God will not own them, will not give them either 
 commission or countenance; they gather together, hand joins in hand, 
 but it is <I>not by me.</I> God gave them no such order as he did to 
 Sennacherib, to <I>take the spoil, and to take the prey,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:6"><I>ch.</I> x. 6</A>.

 And therefore, <I>Secondly,</I> Their attempt will end in their own
 ruin: "<I>Whosoever shall gather together against thee,</I> be they 
 ever so many and ever so mighty, they shall not only be baffled, but 
 they <I>shall fall for thy sake,</I> or they shall fall before thee, 
 which shall be the just punishment of their enmity to thee." God will 
 make them to fall for the sake of the love he bears to his church and 
 the care he has of it, in answer to the prayers made by his people, and 
 in pursuance of the promises made to them. "They shall fall, that thou
 mayest stand," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:2">Ps. xxvii. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That we may with the greatest assurance depend upon God for the 
 safety of his church, we have here, 

 [1.] The power of God over the church's enemies asserted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 The truth is they have <I>no power but what is given them from 
 above,</I> and he that gave them their power can limit and restrain 
 them. <I>Hitherto they shall go, and no further. First,</I> They
 cannot carry on their design without arms and weapons of war; and the 
 smith that makes those weapons is God's creature, and he gave him his 
 skill to work in iron and brass 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+31:3,4">Exod. xxxi. 3, 4</A>)

 and particularly to make proper instruments for warlike purposes. It is
 melancholy to think, as if men did not die fast enough of themselves, 
 how ingenious and industrious they are to make instruments of death and 
 to find out ways and means to kill one another. <I>The smith blows the 
 coals in the fire,</I> to make his iron malleable, to soften it first, 
 that it may be hardened into steel, and so <I>he may bring forth an 
 instrument proper for the work of those that seek to destroy.</I> It is 
 the iron age that is the age of war. But <I>God has created the
 smith,</I> and therefore can tie his hands, so that the project of the 
 enemy shall miscarry (as many a project has done) for want of arms and 
 ammunition. Or the smith that forges the weapons is perhaps put here
 for the council of war that forms the design, blows the coals of 
 contention, and brings forth the plan of the war; these can do no more 
 than God will let them. <I>Secondly,</I> They cannot carry it on
 without men, they must have soldiers, and it is <I>God that created the 
 waster to destroy.</I> Military men value themselves upon their great 
 offices and splendid titles, and even the common soldiers call 
 themselves <I>gentlemen;</I> but God calls them <I>wasters made to 
 destroy,</I> for wasting and destruction are their business. They think 
 their own ingenuity, labour, and experience, made them soldiers; but it 
 was God that created them, and gave them strength and spirit for that 
 hazardous employment; and therefore he not only can restrain them, but 
 will serve his own purposes and designs by them.

 [2.] The promise of God concerning the church's safety solemnly laid 
 down, as <I>the heritage of the servants of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 as that which they may depend upon and be confident of, that God will 
 protect them from their adversaries both in camps and courts.
 <I>First,</I> From their field-adversaries, that think to destroy them 
 by force and violence, and dint of sword: "<I>No weapon that is formed 
 against thee</I> (though ever so artfully formed by the smith that 
 blows the coals, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>,

 though ever so skilfully managed by the waster that seeks to destroy) 
 <I>shall prosper;</I> it shall not prove strong enough to do any harm 
 to the people of God; it shall miss its mark, shall fall out of the 
 hand or perhaps recoil in the face of him that uses it against thee." 
 It is the happiness of the church that <I>no weapons formed against it 
 shall prosper</I> long, and therefore the folly of its enemies will at 
 length be made manifest to all, for they are but preparing instruments 
 of ruin for themselves. <I>Secondly,</I> From their law-adversaries,
 that think to run them down under colour of right and justice. When the 
 weapons of war do not prosper there are tongues that rise in judgment. 
 Both are included in the gates of hell, that seek to destroy the 
 church; for they had their courts of justice, as well as their 
 magazines and military stores, in their gates. The tongues that rise in 
 judgment against the church are as such as either demand a dominion 
 over it, as if God's children were their lawful captives, pretending an 
 authority to oppress their consciences, or they are such as 
 misrepresent them, and falsely accuse them, and by slanders and 
 calumnies endeavour to make them odious to the people and obnoxious to 
 the government. This the enemies of the Jews did, to incense the kings 
 of Persia against them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:12,Es+3:8">Ezra iv. 12; Esth. iii. 8</A>.

 "But these insulting threatening tongues thou shalt condemn; thou shalt
 have wherewith to answer their insolent demands, and to put to silence 
 their malicious reflections. Thou shalt do it <I>by well-doing</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:15">1 Pet. ii. 15</A>),

 by doing that which will make thee manifest in the consciences even of
 thy adversaries, that thou art not what thou art represented to be. 
 <I>Thou shalt condemn them,</I> that is, God shall condemn them for 
 thee. <I>He shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:6">Ps. xxxvii. 6</A>.

 Thou shalt condemn them as Noah condemned the old world that reproached
 him, by building the ark, and so saving his house, in contempt of their 
 contempts." The day is coming when God will reckon with the wicked men 
 for all their hard speeches which they have spoken against him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:15">Jude 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The last words refer not only to this promise, but to all that go 
 before: <I>This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord.</I> God's 
 servants are his sons, for he has provided an inheritance for them, 
 rich, sure, and indefeasible. God's promises are their <I>heritage for 
 ever</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:111">Ps. cxix. 111</A>);

 <I>and their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord.</I> God will clear 
 up the righteousness of their cause before men. It is with him, for he 
 knows it; it is with him, for he will plead it. Or their reward for 
 their righteousness, and for all that which they have suffered 
 unrighteously, is of God, that God who judges in the earth, and with 
 whom <I>verily there is a reward for the righteous.</I> Or their 
 righteousness itself, all that in them which is good and right, is of 
 God, who works it in them; it is of Christ who is made righteousness to 
 them. In those for whom God designs a heritage hereafter he will work 
 righteousness now.</P>
