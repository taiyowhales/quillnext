 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have another comfortable vision, which, as it was 
 explained to the prophet, had much in it for the encouragement of the 
 people of God in their present straits, which were so great that they 
 thought their case helpless, that their temple could never be rebuilt 
 nor their city replenished; and therefore the scope of the vision is to 
 show that God would, by his own power, perfect the work, though the 
 assistance given to it by its friends were ever so weak, and the 
 resistance given to it by its enemies were ever so strong. Here is, 

 I. The awakening of the prophet to observe the vision,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. The vision itself, of a candlestick with seven lamps, which were
 supplied with oil, and kept burning, immediately from two olive-trees 
 that grew by it, one on either side, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:2,3">ver. 2, 3</A>.

 III. The general encouragement hereby intended to be given to the
 builders of the temple to go on in that good work, assuring them that
 it should be brought to perfection at last, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:4-10">ver. 4-10</A>.

 IV. The particular explication of the vision, for the illustration of 
 these assurances, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:11-14">ver. 11-14</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me,
 as a man that is wakened out of his sleep,
 &nbsp; 2 And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked,
 and behold a candlestick all <I>of</I> gold, with a bowl upon the top
 of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven
 lamps, which <I>are</I> upon the top thereof:
 &nbsp; 3 And two olive trees by it, one upon the right <I>side</I> of the
 bowl, and the other upon the left <I>side</I> thereof.
 &nbsp; 4 So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me,
 saying, What <I>are</I> these, my lord?
 &nbsp; 5 Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me,
 Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.
 &nbsp; 6 Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This <I>is</I> the
 word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by
 power, but by my spirit, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts.
 &nbsp; 7 Who <I>art</I> thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel <I>thou
 shalt become</I> a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone
 <I>thereof with</I> shoutings, <I>crying,</I> Grace, grace unto it.
 &nbsp; 8 Moreover the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 9 The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this
 house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts hath sent me unto you.
 &nbsp; 10 For who hath despised the day of small things? for they
 shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of
 Zerubbabel <I>with</I> those seven; they <I>are</I> the eyes of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 which run to and fro through the whole earth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The prophet prepared to receive the discovery that was to be made to 
 him: <I>The angel that talked with him came and waked him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 It seems, though he was in conference with an angel, and about matters 
 of great and public concern, yet he grew dull and fell asleep, as it 
 should seem, while the angel was yet talking with him. Thus the
 disciples, when they saw Christ transfigured, were <I>heavy with 
 sleep,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:32">Luke ix. 32</A>.

 The prophet's spirit, no doubt, was willing to attend to that which was
 to be seen and heard, but the flesh was weak; his body could not keep
 pace with his soul in divine contemplations; the strangeness of the
 visions perhaps stupefied him, and so he was overcome with sleep, or
 perhaps the sweetness of the visions composed him and even sung him
 asleep. Daniel was in a <I>deep sleep when he heard the voice of the
 angel's words,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:9">Dan. x. 9</A>.

 We shall never be fit for converse with spirits till we have got clear
 of these bodies of flesh. It should seem, the angel let him lose
 himself a little, that he might be fresh to receive new discoveries,
 but then <I>waked him,</I> to his surprise, <I>as a man that is wakened
 out of his sleep.</I> Note, We need the Spirit of God, not only to make
 known to us divine things, but to make us take notice of them. <I>He
 wakens morning by morning, he wakens my ear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:4">Isa. l. 4</A>.

 We should beg of God that, whenever he speaks to us, he would awaken
 us, and we should then <I>stir up ourselves.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The discovery that was made to him when he was thus prepared. The 
 angel asked him, <I>What seest thou?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 When he was awake perhaps he would not have taken notice of what was 
 presented to his view if he had not thus been excited to look about 
 him. When he observed he saw a <I>golden candlestick,</I> such a one as 
 was in the temple formerly, and with the like this temple should in due 
 time be furnished. The church is a candlestick, set up for the 
 enlightening of this dark world and the holding forth of the light of 
 divine revelation to it. The candle is God's; the church is but the 
 candlestick, but all of gold, denoting the great worth and excellence 
 of the church of God. This golden candlestick had <I>seven lamps</I>
 branching out from it, so many sockets, in each of which was a burning 
 and shining light. The Jewish church was but one, and though the Jews 
 that were dispersed, it is probable, had synagogues in other countries, 
 yet they were but as so many lamps belonging to one candlestick; but 
 now, under the gospel, Christ is the centre of unity, and not 
 Jerusalem, or any one place; and therefore seven particular churches 
 are represented, not as <I>seven lamps,</I> but as seven several 
 <I>golden candlesticks,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:20">Rev. i. 20</A>.

 This candlestick had one <I>bowl,</I> or common receiver, on the top, 
 into which oil was continually dropping, and from it, by seven secret 
 pipes, or passages, it was diffused to the seven lamps, so that, 
 without any further care, they received oil as fast as they wasted it 
 (as in those which we call <I>fountain-ink-horns,</I> or 
 <I>fountain-pens</I>); they never wanted, nor were ever glutted, and so 
 kept always burning clear. And the bowl too was continually supplied, 
 without any care or attendance of man; for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 he saw <I>two olive-trees,</I> one on each side the candlestick, that 
 were so fat and fruitful that of their own accord they poured plenty of 
 oil continually into the bowl, which by two larger pipes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>)
 
 dispersed the oil to smaller ones and so to the lamps; so that nobody 
 needed to attend this candlestick, to furnish it with oil (it tarried 
 not for man, nor waited for the sons of men), the scope of which is to 
 show that God easily can, and often does, accomplish his gracious 
 purposes concerning his church by his own wisdom and power, without any 
 art or labour of man, and that though sometimes he makes use of 
 instruments, yet he neither needs them nor is tied to them, but can do 
 his work without them, and will rather than it shall be undone.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The enquiry which the prophet made concerning the meaning of this, 
 and the gentle reproof given him for his dulness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>I answered and spoke to the angel,</I> saying, <I>What are these, my 
 lord?</I> Observe how respectfully he speaks to the angel; he calls him 
 <I>my lord.</I> Those that would be taught must give honour to their 
 teachers. He saw what these <I>were,</I> but asked what these 
 <I>signified.</I> Note, It is very desirable to know the meaning of 
 God's manifestations of himself and his mind both in his word and by 
 his ordinances and providences. <I>What mean you by these</I> services, 
 by these signs? And those that would understand the mind of God must be 
 inquisitive. <I>Then shall we know if we follow on to know,</I> if we 
 not only <I>hear,</I> but, as Christ, <I>ask questions</I> upon what we 
 hear,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:46">Luke ii. 46</A>.

 The angel answered him with a question, <I>Knowest thou not what these
 be?</I> intimating that if he had considered, and compared spiritual 
 things with spiritual, he might have guessed at the meaning of these 
 things; for he knew that there was a golden candlestick in the 
 tabernacle, which it was the priests' constant business to supply with 
 oil and to keep burning, for the use of the tabernacle; when therefore 
 he saw, in vision, such a candlestick, with lamps always kept burning, 
 and yet no priests to attend it, nor any occasion for them, he might 
 discern the meaning of this to be that though God had set up the 
 priesthood again, yet he could carry on his own work for and in his 
 people without them. Note, We have reason to be ashamed of ourselves 
 that we do not more readily apprehend the meaning of divine 
 discoveries. The angel asked the prophet this question, to draw from 
 him an acknowledgment of his own dulness, and darkness, and slowness to 
 understand, and he had it immediately: "<I>I said, No, my lord;</I> I 
 know not what these are." Visions had their significance, but often 
 dark and hard to be understood, and the prophets themselves were not 
 always aware of it at first. But those that would be taught of God must 
 see and acknowledge their own ignorance, and their need to be taught, 
 and must apply to God for instruction. To him that gave us the cabinet 
 we must apply for the key wherewith to unlock it. God will teach the 
 meek and humble, not those that are conceited of themselves and lean on 
 the broken reed of their own understanding.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The general intention of this vision. Without a critical descant 
 upon every circumstance of the vision, the design of it is to assure 
 the prophet, and by him the people, that this good work of building the 
 temple should, by the special care of divine Providence, and the 
 immediate influence of divine grace, be brought to a happy issue, 
 though the enemies of it were many and mighty and the friends and 
 furtherers of it few and feeble. Note, In the explication of visions 
 and parables, we must look at the principal scope of them, and be 
 satisfied with that, if that be clear, though we may not be able to 
 account for every circumstance, or accommodate it to our purpose. The 
 angel lets the prophet know, in general, that this vision was designed 
 to illustrate a word which the Lord had to say to Zerubbabel, to 
 encourage him to go on with the building of the temple. Let him know 
 that he is a worker together with God in it, and that it is a work 
 which God will own and crown.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God will carry on and complete this work, as he had begun their 
 deliverance from Babylon, not by external force, but by secret 
 operations and internal influences upon the minds of men. <I>He</I> 
 says this who is the <I>Lord of hosts,</I> and could do it <I>vi et 
 armis--by force,</I> has legions at command; but he will do it, <I>not
 by</I> human <I>might or power,</I> but <I>by his own Spirit.</I> What 
 is done by his Spirit is done by might and power, but it stands in 
 opposition to visible force. Israel was brought out of Egypt, and into
 Canaan, by might and power; in both these works of wonder great 
 slaughter was made. But they were brought out of Babylon, and into 
 Canaan the second time, <I>by the Spirit of the Lord of hosts</I> 
 working upon the spirit of Cyrus, and inclining him to proclaim liberty 
 to them, and working upon the spirits of the captives, and inclining 
 them to accept the liberty offered them. It was by the <I>Spirit of the 
 Lord of hosts</I> that the people were excited and animated to build 
 the temple; and <I>therefore</I> they are said to be <I>helped by the 
 prophets of God,</I> because they, as the Spirit's mouth, spoke to 
 their hearts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+5:2">Ezra v. 2</A>.

 It was by the same Spirit that the heart of Darius was inclined to
 favour and further that good work and that the sworn enemies of it were 
 infatuated in their councils, so that they could not hinder it as they 
 designed. Note, The work of God is often carried on very successfully 
 when yet it is carried on very silently, and without the assistance of 
 human force; the gospel-temple is built, not by might or power (for 
 <I>the weapons of our warfare are not carnal</I>), but by the <I>Spirit 
 of the Lord of hosts,</I> whose work on men's consciences is mighty to 
 the pulling down of strong-holds; thus the excellency of the power is 
 of God, and not of man. When instruments fail, let us therefore leave 
 it to God to do his work himself by his own Spirit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. All the difficulties and oppositions that lie in the way shall be 
 got over and removed, even those that seem insuperable 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Who art thou, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel thou shalt become 
 a plain.</I> See here, 

 (1.) How the difficulty is represented; it is a <I>great mountain,</I> 
 impassable and immovable, a heap of rubbish, like a great mountain, 
 which must be got away, or the work cannot go on. The enemies of the 
 Jews are proud and hard as great mountains; but, when God has work to 
 do, the mountains that stand in the way of it shall dwindle into 
 mole-hills; for see here, 

 (2.) How these difficulties are despised: "<I>Who art thou, O great 
 mountain!</I> that thou shouldst stand in God's way and think to stop 
 the progress of his work? Who art thou that lookest so big, that thus
 threatenest, and art thus feared? <I>Before Zerubbabel,</I> when he is
 God's agent, <I>thou shalt become a plain.</I> All the difficulties 
 shall vanish, and all the objections be got over. <I>Every mountain and 
 hill</I> shall be <I>brought low</I> when the <I>way of the Lord</I> is 
 to be <I>prepared,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:4">Isa. xl. 4</A>.

 Faith will remove mountains and make them plains. Christ is our
 Zerubbabel; mountains of difficulty were in the way of his undertaking, 
 but before him they were all levelled; nothing is too hard for his 
 grace to do.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The same hand that has begun this good work will perform it: <I>He 
 shall bring forth the head-stone</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);
 
 and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 <I>The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house,</I> 
 be it spoken to his honour (perhaps with his own hands he laid the 
 first stone), and though it has been long retarded, and is still much 
 opposed, yet it shall be finished at last; he shall live to see it 
 finished, nay, and <I>his hands shall also finish it;</I> herein he is 
 a type of Christ, who is both the <I>author</I> and the <I>finisher of 
 our faith;</I> and his being the <I>author</I> of it is an assurance to 
 us that he will be the <I>finisher,</I> for, <I>as for God, his work is 
 perfect;</I> has he begun and shall he not make an end? Zerubbabel 
 shall himself <I>bring forth the head-stone with shoutings,</I> and 
 loud acclamations of joy, among the spectators. The acclamations are 
 not <I>huzzas,</I> but <I>Grace, grace;</I> that is the burden of the 
 triumphant songs which the church sings. It may be taken, 

 (1.) As magnifying free grace, and giving to that all the glory of what 
 is done. When the work is finished it must be thankfully acknowledged 
 that it was not by any policy or power of our own that it was brought 
 to perfection, but that it was grace that did it--God's good-will 
 towards us and his good work in us and for us. <I>Grace, grace,</I> 
 must be cried, not only to the head-stone, but to the foundation-stone, 
 the corner-stone, and indeed to every stone in God's building; from 
 first to last it is nothing of works, but all of grace, and all our 
 crowns must be cast at the feet of free grace. <I>Not unto us, O Lord! 
 not unto us.</I> 

 (2.) As depending upon free grace, and desiring the continuance of it, 
 for what is yet to be done. <I>Grace, grace,</I> is the language of 
 prayer as well as of praise; now that this building is finished, all 
 happiness attend it! Peace be within its walls, and, in order to that, 
 <I>grace.</I> Let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon it! Note, What 
 comes from the grace of God may, in faith, and upon good grounds, be 
 committed to the grace of God, for God will not forsake the work of his 
 own hands.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. This shall be a full ratification of the prophecies which went 
 before concerning the Jews' return, and their settlement again. When 
 the temple is finished then <I>thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts 
 has sent me unto you.</I> Note, The exact accomplishment of scripture 
 prophecies is a convincing proof of their divine original. Thus God 
 <I>confirms the word of his servant,</I> by <I>saying to Jerusalem, 
 Thou shalt be built,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:26">Isa. xliv. 26</A>.

 No word of God shall fall to the ground, nor shall there fail one iota
 or tittle of it. Zechariah's prophecies of the approaching day of 
 deliverance to the church would soon appear, by the accomplishment of 
 them, to be of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. This shall effectually silence those that looked with contempt upon 
 the beginning of this work, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Who, where, is he now that despised the day of small things, and 
 thought this work would never come to any thing? The Jews themselves 
 despised the foundation of the second temple, because it was likely to 
 be so far inferior to the first, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:12">Ezra iii. 12</A>.

 Their enemies despised the wall when it was in the building, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:19,4:2,3">Neh. ii. 19; iv. 2, 3</A>.

 But let them not do it. Note, In God's work the day of small things is
 not to be despised. Though the instruments be weak and unlikely, God 
 often chooses such, by them to bring about great things. As a great
 mountain becomes a plain before him when he pleases, so a little stone, 
 cut out of a mountain without hands, comes to fill the earth, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:35">Dan. ii. 35</A>.

 Though the beginnings be small, God can make the latter end greatly to
 increase; a grain of mustard-seed may become a great tree. Let not the
 dawning light be despised, for it will shine more and more to the 
 perfect day. The day of small things is the day of precious things, and 
 will be the day of great things.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. This shall abundantly satisfy all the hearty well-wishers to God's 
 interest, who will be glad to see themselves mistaken in <I>despising 
 the day of small things.</I> Those that despaired of the finishing of 
 the work shall rejoice when they <I>see the plummet in the hand of 
 Zerubbabel,</I> when they see him busy among the builders, giving 
 orders and directions what to do, and taking care that the work be done 
 with great exactness, that it may be both fine and firm. Note, It is 
 matter of great rejoicing to all good people to see magistrates careful 
 and active for the edifying of the house of God, to see the plummet in 
 the hand of those who have power to do much, if they have but a heart 
 according to it; we see not Zerubbabel with the trowel in his hand 
 (that is left to the workmen, the ministers), but we see him with the 
 plummet in his hand, and it is no disparagement, but an honour to him. 
 Magistrates are to inspect ministers' work, and to speak comfortably to 
 the Levites that do their duty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. This shall highly magnify the wisdom and care of God's providence, 
 which is always employed for the good of his church. Zerubbabel does 
 his part, does as much as man can do to forward the work, but it is 
 <I>with those seven, those seven eyes of the Lord</I> which we read of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+3:9"><I>ch.</I> iii. 9</A>.

 He could do nothing if the watchful, powerful, gracious providence of
 God did not go before him and go along with him in it. Except the Lord
 had built this house, Zerubbabel and the rest would have <I>laboured in 
 vain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+127:1">Ps. cxxvii. 1</A>.

 These <I>eyes of the Lord</I> are those that <I>run to and fro through
 the whole earth,</I> that take cognizance of all the creatures and all 
 their actions

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+16:9">2 Chron. xvi. 9</A>),

 and inspire and direct all, according to the divine counsels. Note, We
 must not think that God is so taken up with the affairs of his church 
 as to neglect the world; but it is a comfort to us that the same 
 all-wise almighty Providence that governs the nations of the earth is 
 in a particular manner conversant about the church. Those <I>seven 
 eyes</I> that <I>run through the earth</I> are all <I>upon the 
 stone</I> that Zerubbabel is laying straight with his plummet, to see 
 that it be well laid. And those that have the plummet in their hand 
 must look up to <I>those eyes of the Lord,</I> must have a constant 
 regard to divine Providence, and act in dependence upon its guidance 
 and submission to its disposals.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Enough is said to Zechariah to encourage him, and to enable him to 
 encourage others, with reference to the good work of building the 
 temple which they were now about, and that was the principal intention 
 of the vision he saw; but still he is inquisitive about the 
 particulars, which we will ascribe, not to any vain curiosity, but to 
 the value he had for divine discoveries and the pleasure he took in 
 acquainting himself with them. Those that know much of the things of 
 God cannot but have a humble desire to know more. Now observe,</P>

 I. What his enquiry was. He understood the meaning of the candlestick 
 with its lamps: It is Jerusalem, it is the temple, and their salvation 
 that is to <I>go forth as a lamp that burns;</I> but he wants to know 
 what are these <I>two olive-trees</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 these <I>two olive-branches?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 
 Observe here, 

 1. He asked. Note, Those that would be acquainted with the things of
 God must be inquisitive concerning those things. Ask, and you shall be 
 told. 

 2. He asked twice, his first question having no reply given to it.
 Note, If satisfactory answers be not given to our enquiries and 
 requests quickly, we must renew them, and repeat them, and continue 
 instant and importunate in them, and the vision shall at length 
 <I>speak, and not lie.</I> 

 3. His second query varied somewhat from the former. He first asked,
 What are <I>these two olive-trees,</I> but afterwards, <I>What are 
 these two olive-branches?</I> that is, those boughs of the tree that 
 hung over the bowl and distilled oil into it. When we enquire
 concerning the grace of God, it must be rather as it is communicated to 
 us by the fruitful boughs of the word and ordinances (for that is one 
 of the <I>things revealed,</I> which <I>belong to us and to our 
 children</I>) than as it is resident in the good olive where all our 
 springs are, for that is one of the <I>secret things,</I> which 
 <I>belong not to us.</I> 

 4. In his enquiry he mentioned the observations he had made upon the
 vision; he took notice not only of what was obvious at first sight, 
 that the two olive-trees grew, one <I>on the right side and the other 
 on the left side of the candlestick</I> (so nigh, so ready, is divine 
 grace to the church), but he observed further, upon a more narrow 
 inspection, that the <I>two olive-branches,</I> from which in 
 particular the candlestick did receive of <I>the root and fatness of 
 the olive</I> (as the apostle says of the church,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:17">Rom. xi. 17</A>),

 did empty the <I>golden oil</I> (that is, the clear bright oil, the
 best in its kind, and of great value, as if it were <I>aurum 
 potabile--liquid gold) out of themselves through the two golden 
 pipes,</I> or (as the margin reads it) which <I>by the hand of the two 
 golden pipes empty out of themselves oil into the gold,</I> that is, 
 into the <I>golden bowl</I> on the head of the candlestick. Our Lord 
 Jesus emptied himself, to fill us; his precious blood is the golden oil 
 in which we are supplied with all we need.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What answer was given to his enquiry. Now again the angel obliged 
 him expressly to own his ignorance, before he informed him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):
 
 "<I>Knowest thou not what these are?</I> If thou knowest the church to 
 be the candlestick, canst thou think the olive-trees, that supply it 
 with oil, to be any other than the grace of God?" But he owned he 
 either did not fully understand it or was afraid he did not rightly 
 understand it: <I>I said, No, my Lord, how should I, except some one 
 guide me?</I> And then he told him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>These are the two sons of oil</I> (so it is in the original), <I>the 
 two anointed ones</I> (so we read it), rather, <I>the two oily 
 ones.</I> That which we read 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:1">Isa. v. 1</A>)

 a <I>very fruitful hill</I> is in the original <I>the horn of the son
 of oil,</I> a fat and fattening soil. 

 1. If by the candlestick we understand the visible church, particularly
 that of the Jews at that time, for whose comfort it was primarily 
 intended, these <I>sons of oil,</I> that <I>stand before the Lord of 
 the whole earth,</I> are the two great ordinances and offices of the 
 magistracy and ministry, at that time lodged in the hands of those two 
 great and good men Zerubbabel and Joshua. Kings and priests were 
 anointed; this prince, this priest, were <I>oily ones,</I> endued with 
 the gifts and graces of God's Spirit, to qualify them for the work to 
 which they were called. They <I>stood before the Lord of the whole
 earth,</I> to minister to him, and to receive direction from him; and a 
 great influence they had upon the affairs of the church at that time.
 Their wisdom, courage, and zeal, were continually emptying themselves 
 into the golden bowl, to keep the lamps burning; and, when they are 
 gone, others shall be raised up to carry on the same work; Israel shall 
 no longer be without prince and priest. Good magistrates and good 
 ministers that are themselves anointed with the grace of God and 
 <I>stand by the Lord of the whole earth,</I> as faithful adherents to 
 his cause, contribute very much to the maintaining and advancing of 
 religion and the shining forth of the word of life. 

 2. If by the candlestick we understand the church of the first-born, of
 true believers, these sons of oil may be meant of Christ and the 
 Spirit, the Redeemer and the Comforter. Christ is not only the Messiah, 
 the <I>Anointed One</I> himself, but he is the <I>good olive</I> to his 
 church; and <I>from his fulness we receive,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:16">John i. 16</A>.

 And the Holy Spirit is the <I>unction or anointing</I> which we have
 received,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:20,27">1 John ii. 20, 27</A>.

 From Christ, the <I>olive tree,</I> by the <I>Spirit, the olive
 branch,</I> all the golden oil of grace is communicated to believers, 
 which keeps their lamps burning, and without a constant supply of which 
 they would soon go out. They <I>stand by the Lord of the whole 
 earth,</I> who is in a special manner the church's Lord; for the Son 
 was to be sent by the Father, and so was the Holy Ghost, in the time 
 appointed, and they stand by him ready to go.</P>
