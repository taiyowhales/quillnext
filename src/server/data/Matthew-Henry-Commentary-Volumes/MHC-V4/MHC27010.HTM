 This chapter and the two next (which conclude this book) make up one 
 entire vision and prophecy, which was communicated to Daniel for the 
 use of the church, not by signs and figures, as before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:1-8:27"><I>ch.</I> vii. and viii.</A>),

 but by express words; and this was about two years after the vision in 
 the foregoing chapter. Daniel prayed daily, but had a vision only now 
 and then. In this chapter we have some things introductory to the 
 prophecy, in the eleventh chapter the particular predictions, and 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+12:1-13"><I>ch.</I> xii.</A>

 the conclusion of it. This chapter shows us, 

 I. Daniel's solemn fasting and humiliation, before he had this vision, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. A glorious appearance of the Son of God to him, and the deep
 impression it made upon him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:4-9">ver. 4-9</A>.

 III. The encouragement that was given him to expect such a discovery of 
 future events as should be satisfactory and useful both to others and 
 to himself, and that he should be enabled both to understand the 
 meaning of this discovery, though difficult, and to bear up under the 
 lustre of it, though dazzling and dreadful,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was
 revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the
 thing <I>was</I> true, but the time appointed <I>was</I> long: and he
 understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.
 &nbsp; 2  In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.
 &nbsp; 3  I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my
 mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks
 were fulfilled.
 &nbsp; 4  And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I
 was by the side of the great river, which <I>is</I> Hiddekel;
 &nbsp; 5  Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain
 man clothed in linen, whose loins <I>were</I> girded with fine gold of
 Uphaz:
 &nbsp; 6  His body also <I>was</I> like the beryl, and his face as the
 appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his
 arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and the voice
 of his words like the voice of a multitude.
 &nbsp; 7  And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with
 me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so
 that they fled to hide themselves.
 &nbsp; 8  Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and
 there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in
 me into corruption, and I retained no strength.
 &nbsp; 9  Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the
 voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my
 face toward the ground.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This vision is dated in the <I>third year of Cyrus,</I> that is, of his 
 reign after the conquest of Babylon, his third year since Daniel became 
 acquainted with him and a subject to him. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A general idea of this prophecy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>The thing was true;</I> every word of God is so; it was true that 
 Daniel had such a vision, and that such and such things were said. This 
 he solemnly attests upon the word of a prophet. <I>Et hoc paratus est 
 verificare--He was prepared to verify it;</I> and, if it was a word 
 <I>spoken from heaven,</I> no doubt it is stedfast and may be depended 
 upon. <I>But the time appointed was long,</I> as long as to the end of 
 the reign of Antiochus, which was 300 years, a long time indeed when it 
 is looked upon as to come. Nay, and because it is usual with the 
 prophets to glance at things spiritual and eternal, there is that in 
 this prophecy which looks in type as far forward as to the end of the 
 world and the resurrection of the dead; and then he might well say, 
 <I>The time appointed was long.</I> It was, however, made as plain to 
 him as if it had been a history rather than a prophecy; he 
 <I>understood the thing;</I> so distinctly was it delivered to him, and 
 received by him, that he could say he <I>had understanding of the 
 vision.</I> It did not so much operate upon his fancy as upon his 
 understanding.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. An account of Daniel's mortification of himself before he had this 
 vision, not in expectation of it, nor, when he prayed that solemn 
 prayer 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:1-27"><I>ch.</I> ix.</A>,

 does it appear that he had any expectation of the vision in answer to
 it, but purely from a principle of devotion and pious sympathy with the 
 afflicted people of God. He <I>was mourning full three weeks</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 for his own sins and the sins of his people, and their sorrows. Some
 think that the particular occasion of his mourning was slothfulness and 
 indifference of many of the Jews, who, though they had liberty to 
 return to their own land, continued still in the land of their 
 captivity, not knowing how to value the privileges offered them; and 
 perhaps it troubled him the more because those that did so justified 
 themselves by the example of Daniel, though they had not that reason to 
 stay behind which he had. Others think that it was because he heard of 
 the obstruction given to the building of the temple by the enemies of 
 the Jews, who <I>hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their 
 purpose</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:4,5">Ezra iv. 4, 5</A>),

 <I>all the days of Cyrus,</I> and gained their point from his son
 Cambyses, or Artaxerxes, who governed while Cyrus was absent in the 
 Scythian war. Note, Good men cannot but mourn to see how slowly the 
 work of God goes on in the world and what opposition it meets with, how 
 weak its friends are and how active its enemies. During the days of 
 Daniel's mourning he <I>ate no pleasant bread;</I> he could not live 
 without meat, but he ate little, and very sparingly, and mortified 
 himself in the quality as well as the quantity of what he ate, which 
 may truly be reckoned fasting, and a token of humiliation and sorrow. 
 He did not eat the pleasant bread he used to eat, but that which was 
 course and unpalatable, which he would not be tempted to eat any more 
 of than was just necessary to support nature. As ornaments, so
 delicacies, are very disagreeable to a day of humiliation. <I>Daniel 
 ate no flesh, drank no wine, nor anointed himself,</I> for those three 
 week's time,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Though he was now a very old man, and might plead that the decay of his 
 nature required what was nourishing, though he was a very great man, 
 and might plead that, being used to dainty meats, he could not do 
 without them, it would prejudice his health if he were, yet, when it 
 was both to testify and to assist his devotion, he could thus deny 
 himself; let this be noted to the shame of many young people in the 
 common ranks of life who cannot persuade themselves thus to deny 
 themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A description of that glorious person whom Daniel saw in vision, 
 which, it is generally agreed, could be no other that Christ himself, 
 the eternal Word. He was by the side of the river Hiddekel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),
 
 probably walking there, not for diversion, but devotion and 
 contemplation, as Isaac walked in the field, to meditate; and, being a 
 person of distinction, he had his servants attending him at some 
 distance. There he <I>looked up,</I> and saw <I>one man Christ 
 Jesus.</I> It must be he, for he appears in the same resemblance 
 wherein he appeared to St. John in the isle of Patmos, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:13-15">Rev. i. 13-15</A>.
 
 His dress was priestly, for he is the high priest of our profession, 
 <I>clothed in linen,</I> as the high priest himself was on the day of 
 atonement, that great day; <I>his loins were girded</I> (in St. John's 
 vision his <I>paps</I> were <I>girded) with a golden girdle</I> of the 
 finest gold, that of Uphaz, for every thing about Christ is the best in 
 its kind. The <I>girding of the loins</I> denotes his ready and 
 diligent application to his work, as his Father's servant, in the 
 business of our redemption. His shape was amiable, <I>his body like the 
 beryl,</I> a precious stone of a sky-colour. His countenance was awful, 
 and enough to strike a terror on the beholders, for his face was <I>as 
 the appearance of lightning,</I> which dazzles the eyes, both brightens 
 and threatens. His <I>eyes</I> were bright and sparkling, <I>as lamps 
 of fire.</I> His <I>arms and feet</I> shone <I>like polished brass,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 His <I>voice</I> was loud, and strong, and very piercing, <I>like the 
 voice of a multitude.</I> The <I>vox Dei</I>--<I>voice of God</I> can 
 overpower the <I>vox populi</I>--<I>voice of the people.</I> Thus 
 glorious did Christ appear, and it should engage us, 

 1. To think highly and honourably of him. <I>Now consider how great
 this man is,</I> and in all things let him have the pre-eminence. 

 2. To admire his condescension for us and our salvation. Over all this
 splendour he drew a veil when he took upon him the form of a servant, 
 and <I>emptied himself.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The wonderful influence that this appearance had upon Daniel and 
 his attendants, and the terror that it struck upon him and them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His attendants <I>saw not the vision;</I> it was not fit that they 
 should be honoured with the sight of it. There is a divine revelation 
 vouchsafed to all, from converse with which none are excluded who do 
 not exclude themselves; but such a vision must be peculiar to Daniel, 
 who was a favourite. Paul's companions were aware of the <I>light,</I> 
 but <I>saw no man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:7,22:9">Acts ix. 7; xxii. 9</A>.

 Note, It is the honour of those who are beloved of God that, what is
 hidden from others, is known to them. Christ <I>manifests himself to 
 them, but not to the world,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:22">John xiv. 22</A>.

 But, though they saw not the vision, they were seized with an
 unaccountable trembling; either from the voice they heard, or from some 
 strange concussion or vibration of the air they felt, so it was that a 
 <I>great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide 
 themselves,</I> probably among the willows that grew by the river's 
 side. Note, Many have a <I>spirit of bondage to fear</I> who never 
 receive <I>a spirit of adoption,</I> to whom Christ has been, and will 
 be, never otherwise than a terror. Now the fright that Daniel's 
 attendants were in is a confirmation of the truth of the vision; it 
 could not be Daniel's fancy, or the product of a heated imagination of 
 his own, or it had a real, powerful, and strange effect upon those 
 about him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He himself saw it, and saw it alone, but he was not able to bear the 
 sight of it. It not only dazzled his eyes, but overwhelmed his spirit, 
 so that <I>there remained no strength in him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 He said, as Moses himself, <I>I exceedingly fear and quake.</I> His 
 spirits were all so employed, either in an intense speculation of the 
 glory of this vision or in the fortifying of his heart against the 
 terror of it, that his body was left in a manner lifeless and 
 spiritless. He had no vigour in him, and was but one remove from a dead 
 carcase; he looked as pale as death, his colour was gone, his 
 <I>comeliness</I> in him was <I>turned into corruption,</I> and he 
 <I>retained no strength.</I> Note, the greatest and best of men cannot 
 bear the immediate discoveries of the divine glory; no man can see it 
 and live; it is next to death to see a glimpse of it, as Daniel here; 
 but glorified saints see Christ as he is and can bear the sight. But, 
 though Daniel was thus dispirited with the vision of Christ, yet he 
 <I>heard the voice of his words</I> and knew what he said. Note, We 
 must take heed lest our reverence of God's glory, by which we should be 
 awakened to hear his voice both in his word and in his providence, 
 should degenerate into such a dread of him as will disable or indispose 
 us to hear it. It should seem that when the vision of Christ terrified 
 Daniel the voice of his words soon pacified and composed him, silenced 
 his fear, and laid him to sleep in a holy security and serenity of 
 mind: <I>When I heard the voice of his words I fell into a slumber,</I> 
 a sweet slumber, <I>on my face,</I> and <I>my face towards the 
 ground.</I> When he saw the vision he threw himself prostrate, into a 
 posture of the most humble adoration, and dropped asleep, not as 
 careless of what he heard and saw, but charmed with it. Note, How 
 dreadful soever Christ may appear to those who are under convictions of 
 sin, and in terror by reason of it, there is enough in his word to 
 quiet their spirits and make them easy, if they will but attend to it 
 and apply it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  And, behold, a hand touched me, which set me upon my knees
 and <I>upon</I> the palms of my hands.
 &nbsp; 11  And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved,
 understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright:
 for unto thee am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word
 unto me, I stood trembling.
 &nbsp; 12  Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first
 day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten
 thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for
 thy words.
 &nbsp; 13  But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and
 twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to
 help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.
 &nbsp; 14  Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy
 people in the latter days: for yet the vision <I>is</I> for <I>many</I>
 days.
 &nbsp; 15  And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face
 toward the ground, and I became dumb.
 &nbsp; 16  And, behold, <I>one</I> like the similitude of the sons of men
 touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto
 him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are
 turned upon me, and I have retained no strength.
 &nbsp; 17  For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my
 lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in
 me, neither is there breath left in me.
 &nbsp; 18  Then there came again and touched me <I>one</I> like the
 appearance of a man, and he strengthened me,
 &nbsp; 19  And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace <I>be</I> unto
 thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me,
 I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast
 strengthened me.
 &nbsp; 20  Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and
 now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I
 am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come.
 &nbsp; 21  But I will show thee that which is noted in the scripture of
 truth: and <I>there is</I> none that holdeth with me in these things,
 but Michael your prince.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Much ado here is to bring Daniel to be able to bear what Christ has to 
 say to him. Still we have him in a fright, hardly and very slowly 
 recovering himself; but he is still answered and <I>supported</I> with 
 <I>good words</I> and <I>comfortable words.</I> Let us see how Daniel 
 is by degrees brought to himself, and gather up the several passages 
 that are to the same purport.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Daniel is in a great consternation and finds it very difficult to 
 get clear of it. The hand that <I>touched him</I> set him at first 
 <I>upon his knees and the palms of his hands,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Note, Strength and comfort commonly come by degrees to those that have 
 been long cast down and disquieted; they are first helped up a little, 
 and then more. <I>After two days he will revive us, and</I> then
 <I>the third day he will raise us up.</I> And we must not <I>despise 
 the day of small things,</I> but be thankful for the beginnings of 
 mercy. Afterwards he is helped up, but he <I>stands trembling</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 for fear lest he fall again. Note, Before God <I>gives strength and 
 power unto his people</I> he makes them sensible of their own weakness. 
 <I>I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:16">Hab. iii. 16</A>.

 But when, afterwards, Daniel recovered so much strength in his limbs
 that he could stand steadily, yet he tells us

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 that he <I>set his face towards the ground and became dumb;</I> he was 
 as a man astonished, who knew not what to say, struck dumb with 
 admiration and fear, and was loth to enter into discourse with one so 
 far <I>above him;</I> he <I>kept silence,</I> yea, <I>even from 
 good,</I> till he had recollected himself a little. Well, at length he 
 recovered, not only the use of his feet, but the use of his tongue; 
 and, when he <I>opened his mouth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 that which he had to say was to excuse his having been so long silent, 
 for really he durst not speak, he could not speak: "<I>O my lord</I>" 
 (so, in great humility, this prophet calls the angel, though the 
 angels, in great humility, called themselves <I>fellow-servants to the 
 prophets,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:9">Rev. xxii. 9</A>),

 "<I>by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me;</I> they break in up 
 on me with violence; the sense of my sinful sorrowful state <I>turns 
 upon me</I> when I see thy purity and brightness." Note, Man, who has 
 lost his integrity, has reason to blush, and be ashamed of himself, 
 when he sees or considers the glory of the blessed angels that keep 
 their integrity. "<I>My sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained 
 no strength</I> to resist them or bear up a head against them." And 
 again

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 like one half dead with the fright, he complains, "As for me, 
 <I>straightway there remained no strength in me</I> to receive these 
 displays of the divine glory and these discoveries of the divine will; 
 nay, <I>there is no breath left in me.</I>" Such a <I>deliquium</I> did 
 he suffer that he could not draw one breath after another, but panted 
 and languished, and was in a manner breathless. See how well it is for 
 us that the treasure of divine revelation is put into <I>earthen 
 vessels,</I> that God speaks to us <I>by men like ourselves</I> and not 
 by angels. Whatever we may wish, in a peevish dislike of the method God 
 takes in dealing with us, it is certain that if we were tried we should 
 all be of Israel's mind at Mt. Sinai, when they said to Moses, <I>Speak 
 thou to us, and we will hear, but let not God speak to us lest we 
 die,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:19">Exod. xx. 19</A>.

 If Daniel could not bear it, how could we? Now this he insists upon as
 an excuse for his irreverent silence, which otherwise would have been 
 blame-worthy: <I>How can the servant of this my lord talk with this my 
 lord?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Note, Whenever we enter into communion with God it becomes us to have a 
 due sense of the vast distance and disproportion that there are between 
 us and the holy angels, and of the infinite distance, and no proportion 
 at all, between us and the holy God, and to acknowledge that we cannot 
 <I>order our speech by reason of darkness.</I> How shall we that are 
 dust and ashes speak to the Lord of glory?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The blessed angel that was employed by Christ to converse with him 
 gave him all the encouragement and comfort that could be. It should 
 seem, it was not he whose glory he saw in vision 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>)

 that here <I>touched him,</I> and <I>talked with him;</I> that was 
 Christ, but this seems to have been the angel Gabriel, whom Christ had 
 once before ordered to instruct Daniel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:16"><I>ch.</I> viii. 16</A>.

 That glorious appearance (as that of the <I>God of glory</I> to
 Abraham, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:2">Acts vii. 2</A>)

 was to give authority and to gain attention to what the angel should
 say. Christ himself comforted John when he in a like case <I>fell at 
 his feet as dead</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:17">Rev. i. 17</A>);

 but here he did it by <I>the angel,</I> whom Daniel saw in a glory much 
 inferior to that of the vision in the verses before; for he was <I>like 
 the similitude of the sons of men</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),
 
 one like the appearance <I>of a man,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.
 
 When <I>he</I> only <I>appeared,</I> as he had done before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:21"><I>ch.</I> ix. 21</A>),

 we do not find that Daniel was put into any disorder by it, as he was
 by this vision; and therefore he is here employed a third time with 
 Daniel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He lent him his hand to help him, <I>touched him, and set him upon 
 his hands and knees</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 else he would still have lain grovelling, <I>touched his lips</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 else he would have been still dumb; again he <I>touched him</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 and put strength into him, else he would still have been staggering and 
 trembling. Note, The hand of God's power going along with the word of 
 his grace is alone effectual to redress all our grievances, and to 
 rectify whatever is amiss in us. One touch from heaven brings us to our 
 knees, sets us on our feet, opens our lips, and strengthens us; for it 
 is God that works on us, and <I>works in us, both to will and to do</I> 
 that which is good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He assured him of the great favour that God had for him: Thou art 
 <I>a man greatly beloved</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);
 
 and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 <I>O man greatly beloved!</I> Note, Nothing is more likely, nothing 
 more effectual, to revive the drooping spirits of the saints than to be 
 assured of God's love to them. Those are greatly beloved indeed whom 
 God loves; and it is comfort enough to know it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He silenced his fears, and encouraged his hopes, with good words and 
 comfortable words. He said unto him, <I>Fear not, Daniel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);
 
 and again 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 <I>O man greatly beloved! fear not; peace be unto thee; be strong, yea, 
 be strong.</I> Never did any tender mother quiet her child, when any 
 thing had grieved or frightened it, with more compassion and affection 
 than the angel here quieted Daniel. Those that are beloved of God have 
 no reason to be afraid of any evil; peace is to them; God himself 
 speaks peace to them; and they ought, upon the warrant of that, to 
 speak peace to themselves; and that peace, that <I>joy of the Lord,</I> 
 will be <I>their strength.</I> Will God <I>plead against us with his 
 great power?</I> will he take advantage against us of our being 
 overcome by his terror? <I>No, but he will put strength into us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:6">Job xxiii. 6</A>.

 So he did into Daniel here, when, by reason of the lustre of the 
 vision, <I>no strength</I> of his own <I>remained in him;</I> and he 
 acknowledges it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>When he had spoken to me I was strengthened.</I> Note, God by his
 word puts life, and strength, and spirit into his people; for if he 
 says, <I>Be strong,</I> power goes along with the word. And, now that 
 Daniel has experienced the efficacy of God's strengthening word and 
 grace, he is ready for any thing: "<I>Now, Let my lord speak,</I> and I 
 can hear it, I can bear it, and am ready to do according to it, <I>for 
 thou hast strengthened me.</I>" Note, To those that (like Daniel here) 
 have no might God <I>increases strength,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:29">Isa. xl. 29</A>.

 And we cannot keep up our communion with God but by strength derived
 from him; but, when he is pleased to put strength into us, we must make 
 a good use of it, and say, <I>Speak, Lord, for thy servant hears.</I> 
 Let God enable us to comply with his will, and them, whatever it is, we 
 will stand complete in it. <I>Da quod jubes, et jube quod vis--Give 
 what thou commandest, and then command what thou wilt.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He assured him that his fastings and prayers had come up for a
 memorial before God, as the angel told Cornelius 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:4">Acts x. 4</A>):

 <I>Fear not, Daniel,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 It is natural to fallen man to be afraid of an extraordinary messenger 
 from heaven, as dreading to hear evil tidings thence; but Daniel need 
 not fear, for he has by his three weeks' humiliation and supplication 
 sent <I>extraordinary</I> messengers to heaven, which he may expect to 
 return with an olive-branch of peace: "<I>From the first day that thou 
 didst set thy heart to understand</I> the word of God, which is to be 
 the rule of thy prayers, and to <I>chasten thyself before thy God,</I> 
 that thou mightest put an edge upon thy prayers, <I>thy words were 
 heard,</I>" as, before, <I>at the beginning of thy supplication,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:23"><I>ch.</I> ix. 23</A>.

 Note, As the <I>entrance of God's word is enlightening</I> to the
 upright, so the entrance of their prayers is pleasing to God, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:130">Ps. cxix. 130</A>.

 From the first day that we begin to look towards God in a way of duty
 he is ready to meet us in a way of mercy. Thus ready is God to hear 
 prayer. <I>I said, I will confess, and thou forgavest.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He informed him that he was sent to him on purpose to bring him a
 prediction of the future state of the church, as a token of God's 
 accepting his prayers for the church: "<I>Knowest thou wherefore I come 
 unto thee?</I> If thou knewest on what errand I come, thou wouldst not 
 be put into such a consternation by it." Note, If we rightly understood 
 the meaning of God's dealings with us, and the methods of his 
 providence and grace concerning us, we should be better reconciled to 
 them. "<I>I have come for thy words</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 to bring thee a gracious answer to thy prayers." Thus, when God's 
 praying people call to him, he says, <I>Here I am</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:9">Isa. lviii. 9</A>);
 
 <I>what would you</I> have with me? See the power of prayer, what
 glorious things it has, in its time, fetched from heaven, what strange 
 discoveries! On what errand did this angel come to Daniel? He tells him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>I have come to make thee understand what shall befal thy people in 
 the latter days.</I> Daniel was a curious inquisitive man, that had all 
 his days been searching into secret things, and it would be a great 
 gratification to him to be let into the knowledge of things to come.
 Daniel had always been concerned for the church; its interests lay much 
 upon his heart, and it would be a particular satisfaction to him to 
 know what its state should be, and he would know the better what to 
 pray for as long as he lived. He was now lamenting the difficulties 
 which his people met with in the present day; but, that he might not be 
 offended in those, the angel must tell him what greater difficulties 
 are yet before them; and, if they be <I>wearied</I> now that they only 
 <I>run with the footmen, how will they contend with horses?</I> Note, 
 It would abate our resentment of present troubles to consider that we 
 know not but much greater are before us, which we are concerned to 
 provide for. Daniel must be made to know what shall befal his people 
 <I>in the latter days</I> of the church, after the cessation of 
 prophecy, and when the time drew nigh for the Messiah to appear, <I>for 
 yet the vision is for many days;</I> the principal things that this 
 vision was intended to give the church the foresight of would come to 
 pass in the days of Antiochus, nearly 300 years after this. Now that 
 which the angel is entrusted to communicate to Daniel, and which Daniel 
 is encouraged to expect from him, is not any curious speculations, 
 moral prognostications, nor rational prospects of his own, though he is 
 an angel, but what he has <I>received from the Lord.</I> It was the 
 <I>revelation of Jesus Christ</I> that the angel gave to St. John to be 
 <I>delivered to the churches,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:1">Rev. i. 1</A>.
 
 So here
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>I will show thee what is written in the scriptures of truth,</I> 
 that is, what is fixed in the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of 
 God. The <I>decree of God</I> is a thing written, it is a 
 <I>scripture</I> which remains and cannot be altered. <I>What I have
 written I have written.</I> As there are scriptures for the revealed 
 will of God, the letters-patent, which are published to the world, so 
 there are scriptures for the secret will of God, the close rolls, which 
 are <I>sealed among his treasures,</I> the book of his decrees. Both 
 are <I>scriptures of truth;</I> nothing shall be added to nor taken 
 from either of them. The <I>secret things belong not to us,</I> only 
 now and then some few paragraphs have been copied out from the book of 
 God's counsels, and delivered to the prophets for the use of the 
 church, as here to Daniel; but they are the <I>things revealed,</I> 
 even the <I>words of this law,</I> which belong <I>to us and to our 
 children;</I> and we are concerned to study what is written in these 
 <I>scriptures of truth,</I> for they are things which <I>belong to our 
 everlasting peace.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. He gave him a general account of the adversaries of the church's 
 cause, from whom it might be expected that troubles would arise, and of 
 its patrons, under whose protection it might be assured of safety and 
 victory at last. 

 (1.) The <I>kings of the earth</I> are and will be its adversaries; for
 they set themselves against the Lord, and against his Anointed, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:2">Ps. ii. 2</A>.

 The angel told Daniel that he was to have come to him with a gracious
 answer to his prayers, but that the <I>prince of the kingdom of Persia 
 withstood him one and twenty days,</I> just the three weeks that Daniel 
 had been fasting and praying. Cambyses king of Persia had been very 
 busy to embarrass the affairs of the Jews, and to do them all the 
 mischief he could, and the angel had been all that time employed to 
 counter-work him; so that he had been constrained to defer his visit to 
 Daniel till now, for angels can be but in one place at a time. Or, as 
 Dr. Lightfoot says, This new king of Persia, by hindering the temple, 
 had hindered those good tidings which otherwise he should have brought 
 him. The kings and kingdoms of the world were indeed sometimes helpful 
 to the church, but more often they were injurious to it. "When <I>I 
 have gone forth</I> from the kings of Persia, when their monarchy is 
 brought down for their unkindness to the Jews, then <I>the prince of 
 Grecia shall come,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 The Grecian monarchy, though favourable to the Jews at first, as the 
 Persian was, will yet come to be vexatious to them. Such is the state 
 of the church-militant; when it has got clear of one enemy it has 
 another to encounter: and such a hydra's head is that of the old 
 serpent; when one storm has <I>blown over</I> it is not long before 
 another rises. 

 (2.) The <I>God of heaven</I> is, and will be, its protector, and,
 under him, the angels of heaven are its patrons and guardians. 

 [1.] Here is the angel Gabriel busy in the service of the church, 
 making his part good in defence of it twenty-one days, <I>against the 
 prince of Persia,</I> and <I>remaining there with the kings of 
 Persia,</I> as consul, or liege-ambassador, to take care of the affairs 
 of the Jews in that court, and to do them service,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 And, though much was done against them by the kings of Persia (God 
 permitting it), it is probably that much more mischief would have been 
 done them, and they would have been quite ruined (witness Haman's plot) 
 if God had not prevented it by the ministration of angels. Gabriel 
 resolves, when he has despatched this errand to Daniel, that he will 
 return <I>to fight with the prince of Persia,</I> will continue to 
 oppose him, and will at length humble and bring down that proud 
 monarchy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 though he knows that another as mischievous, even that of Grecia, will 
 rise instead of it. 

 [2.] Here is Michael our prince, the great protector of the church, and 
 the patron of its just but injured cause: <I>The first of the chief 
 princes,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Some understand it of a created angel, but an archangel of the highest 
 order, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:16,Jude+1:9">1 Thess. iv. 16; Jude 9</A>.

 Others think that <I>Michael the archangel</I> is no other than Christ
 himself, the <I>angel of the covenant,</I> and the Lord of the angels,
 he whom Daniel saw in vision,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 He <I>came to help me</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 and there is <I>none but he that holds with me in these things,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Christ is the church's prince; angels are not, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:5">Heb. ii. 5</A>.

 He presides in the affairs of the church and effectually provides for
 its good. He is said to <I>hold with the angels,</I> for it is he that 
 makes them serviceable to the <I>heirs of salvation;</I> and, if he 
 were not on the church's side, its case were bad. But, says David, and 
 so says the church, <I>The Lord takes my part with those that help 
 me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+118:7">Ps. cxviii. 7</A>.
 
 <I>The Lord is with those that uphold my soul,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+54:4">Ps. liv. 4</A>.</P>
