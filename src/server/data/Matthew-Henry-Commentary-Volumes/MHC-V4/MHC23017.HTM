 Syria and Ephraim were confederate against Judah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:1,2"><I>ch.</I> vii. 1, 2</A>),

 and, they being so closely linked together in their counsels, this
 chapter, though it be entitled "the burden of Damascus" (which was the 
 head city of Syria), reads the doom of Israel too.

 I. The destruction of the strong cities both of Syria and Israel is
 here foretold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+17:1-5,9-11">ver. 1-5 and ver. 9-11</A>.

 II. In the midst of judgment mercy is remembered to Israel, and a
 gracious promise made that a remnant should be preserved from the
 calamities and should get good by them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+17:6-8">ver. 6-8</A>.

 III. The overthrow of the Assyrian army before Jerusalem is pointed at, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+17:12-14">ver. 12-14</A>.
 
 In order of time this chapter should be placed next after

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:1-25"><I>ch.</I> ix.</A>,

 for the destruction of Damascus, here foretold, happened in the reign
 of Ahaz,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from
 <I>being</I> a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap.
 &nbsp; 2  The cities of Aroer <I>are</I> forsaken: they shall be for flocks,
 which shall lie down, and none shall make <I>them</I> afraid.
 &nbsp; 3  The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom
 from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria: they shall be as the
 glory of the children of Israel, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts.
 &nbsp; 4  And in that day it shall come to pass, <I>that</I> the glory of
 Jacob shall be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh shall wax
 lean.
 &nbsp; 5  And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn,
 and reapeth the ears with his arm; and it shall be as he that
 gathereth ears in the valley of Rephaim.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the burden of Damascus; the Chaldee paraphrase reads it, 
 <I>The burden of the cup of the curse to drink to Damascus in;</I> and, 
 the ten tribes being in alliance, they must expect to pledge Damascus 
 in this cup of trembling that is to go round. 

 1. Damascus itself, the head city of Syria, must be destroyed; the
 houses, it is likely, will be burnt, as least the walls, and gates, and 
 fortifications demolished, and the inhabitants carried away captive, so 
 that for the present it is <I>taken away from being a city,</I> and is 
 reduced not only to a village, but to <I>a ruinous heap,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+17:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Such desolating work as this does sin make with cities. 

 2. The country towns are abandoned by their inhabitants, frightened or 
 forced away by the invaders: <I>The cities of Aroer</I> (a province of 
 Syria so called) <I>are forsaken</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+17:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 the conquered dare not dwell in them, and the conquerors have no 
 occasion for them, nor did they seize them for want, but wantonness; so 
 that the places which should be for men to live in are for <I>flocks to 
 lie down in,</I> which they may do, and none will disturb nor dislodge 
 them. Stately houses are converted into sheep-cotes. It is strange that 
 great conquerors should pride themselves in being common enemies to 
 mankind. But, how unrighteous soever they are, God is righteous in 
 causing those cities to spue out their inhabitants, who by their 
 wickedness had made themselves vile; it is better that <I>flocks should 
 lie down there</I> than that they should harbour such as are in open 
 rebellion against God and virtue. 

 3. The strongholds of Israel, the kingdom of the ten tribes, will be 
 brought to ruin: <I>The fortress shall cease from Ephraim</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+17:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 that in Samaria, and all the rest. They had joined with Syria in
 invading Judah very unnaturally; and now those that had been partakers 
 in sin should be made partakers in ruin, and justly. When <I>the 
 fortress shall cease from Ephraim,</I> by which Israel will be 
 weakened, the kingdom will cease from Damascus, by which Syria will be 
 ruined. The Syrians were the ring-leaders in that confederacy against 
 Judah, and therefore they are punished first and sorest; and, because 
 they boasted of their alliance with Israel, now that Israel is weakened 
 they are upbraided with those boasts: "<I>The remnant of Syria shall be 
 as the glory of the children of Israel;</I> those few that remain of 
 the Syrians shall be in as mean and despicable a condition as the 
 children of Israel are, and the glory of Israel shall be no relief or 
 reputation to them." Sinful confederacies will be no strength, no stay, 
 to the confederates, when God's judgments come upon them. See here what 
 the glory of Jacob is when God contends with him, and what little 
 reason Syria will have to be proud of resembling the glory of Jacob. 
 
 (1.) It is wasted like a man in a consumption,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+17:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 <I>The glory of Jacob</I> was their numbers, that they were as the sand
 of the sea for multitude; but this glory <I>shall be made thin,</I> 
 when many are cut off, and few left. Then the <I>fatness of their 
 flesh,</I> which was their pride and security, <I>shall was lean,</I> 
 and the body of the people shall become a perfect skeleton, nothing but 
 skin and bones. Israel died of a lingering disease; the kingdom of the
 ten tribes wasted gradually; God was to them <I>as a moth,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:12">Hos. v. 12</A>.

 Such is all the glory of this world: it soon withers, and is made thin; 
 but thee is a far more exceeding and external weight of glory designed 
 for the spiritual seed of Jacob, which is not subject to any such 
 decay--fatness of God's house, which will not <I>wax lean.</I>

 (2.) It is all gathered and carried away by the Assyrian army, as the 
 corn is carried out of the field by the husbandmen, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+17:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The corn is the glory of the fields 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:13">Ps. lxv. 13</A>);

 but, when it is reaped and gone, where is the glory? The people had by
 their sins made themselves ripe for ruin, and their glory was as 
 quickly, as easily, as justly, and as irresistibly, cut down and taken 
 away, as the corn is out of the field by the husbandman. God's
 judgments are compared to the <I>thrusting in of the sickle when the 
 harvest is ripe,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:15">Rev. xiv. 15</A>.

 And the victorious army, like the careful husbandmen in the valley of
 Rephaim, where the corn was extraordinary, would not, if they could 
 help it, leave an ear behind, would lose nothing that they could lay 
 their hands on.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Mercy is here reserved, in a parenthesis, in the midst of judgment, for 
 a remnant that should escape the common ruin of the kingdom of the ten 
 tribes. Though the Assyrians took all the care they could that none 
 should slip out of their net, yet the meek of the earth were hidden in 
 the day of the Lord's anger, and had their lives given them for a prey 
 and made comfortable to them by their retirement to the land of Judah, 
 where they had the liberty of God's courts. 

 1. They shall be but a small remnant, a very few, who shall be marked
 for preservation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+17:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):
 
 <I>Gleaning grapes shall be left in it.</I> The body of the people were 
 carried into captivity, but here and there one was left behind, perhaps 
 one of two in a bed when the other was taken, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:34">Luke xvii. 34</A>.

 The most desolating judgments in this world are short of the last
 judgment, which shall be universal and which none shall escape. In 
 times of the greatest calamity some are kept safe, as in times of the 
 greatest degeneracy some are kept pure. But the fewness of those that 
 escape supposes the captivity of the far greatest part; those that are 
 left are but like the poor remains of an olive tree when it has been 
 carefully shaken by the owner; if there be <I>two or three berries in 
 the top of the uppermost bough</I> (out of the reach of those that 
 shook it), that is all. Such is the <I>remnant according to the 
 election of grace,</I> very few in comparison with the multitudes that 
 walk on in the broad way.

 2. They shall be a sanctified remnant, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+17:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 These few that are preserved are such as, in the prospect of the 
 judgment approaching, had repented of their sins and reformed their 
 lives, and therefore were snatched thus as brands out of the burning, 
 or such as having escaped, and becoming refugees in strange countries, 
 were awakened, partly by a sense of the distinguishing mercy of their 
 deliverance, and partly by the distresses they were still in, to return 
 to God. 

 (1.) They shall look up to their Creator, shall enquire, <I>Where is 
 God my Maker, who giveth songs in the night,</I> in such a night of 
 affliction as this? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+35:10,11">Job xxxv. 10, 11</A>.

 They shall acknowledge his hand in all the events concerning them,
 merciful and afflictive, and shall submit to his hand. They shall give 
 him the glory due to his name, and be suitably affected with his 
 providences. They shall expect relief and succour from him and depend 
 upon him to help them. Their <I>eyes shall have respect</I> to him, 
 <I>as the eyes of a servant to the hand of his master,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:2">Ps. cxxiii. 2</A>.

 Observe, It is our duty at all times to have respect to God, to have 
 our eyes ever towards him, both as our Maker (the author of our being 
 and the God of nature) and as the Holy One of Israel, a God in covenant 
 with us and the God of grace; particularly, when we are in affliction, 
 our eyes must be towards the Lord, to <I>pluck our feet out of the 
 net</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+25:15">Ps. xxv. 15</A>);

 to bring us to this is the design of his providence as he is our Maker
 and the work of his grace as he is the Holy One of Israel.

 (2.) They shall look off from their idols, the creatures of their own 
 fancy, shall no longer worship them, and seek to them, and expect 
 relief from them. For God will be alone regarded, or he does not look 
 upon himself as at all regarded. He that looks to his Maker must not 
 <I>look to the altars, the work of his hands,</I> but disown them and 
 cast them off, must not retain the least respect for <I>that which his 
 fingers have made,</I> but break it to pieces, though it be his own 
 workmanship--<I>the groves and the images;</I> the word signifies 
 images made in honour of the sun and by which he was worshipped, the 
 most ancient and most plausible idolatry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:19,Job+31:26">Deut. iv. 19; Job xxxi. 26</A>.

 We have reason to account those happy afflictions which part between us
 and our sins, and by sensible convictions of the vanity of the world, 
 that great idol, cool our affections to it and lower our expectations 
 from it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough,
 and an uppermost branch, which they left because of the children
 of Israel: and there shall be desolation.
 &nbsp; 10  Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and
 hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength, therefore
 shalt thou plant pleasant plants, and shalt set it with strange
 slips:
 &nbsp; 11  In the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow, and in the

 <I>shall be</I> a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the prophet returns to foretel the woeful desolations that should 
 be made in the land of Israel by the army of the Assyrians. 

 1. That the cities should be deserted. Even the strong cities, which
 should have protected the country, shall not be able to protect 
 themselves: They <I>shall be as a forsaken bough and an uppermost
 branch</I> of an old tree, which has gone to decay, is forsaken of its 
 leaves, and appears on the top of the tree, bare, and dry, and dead; so 
 shall their strong cities look when the inhabitants have deserted them 
 and the victorious army of the enemy pillaged and defaced them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+17:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 They shall be as the cities (so it may be supplied) which the 
 Canaanites left, the old inhabitants of the land, because of the 
 children of Israel, when God brought them in with a high hand, to take 
 possession of that good land, cities which they built not. As the 
 Canaanites then fled before Israel, so Israel should now flee before 
 the Assyrians. And herein the word of God was fulfilled, that, if they 
 committed the same abominations, <I>the land</I> should <I>spue them 
 out, as it spued out the nations that were before them</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:28">Lev. xviii. 28</A>),

 and that as, while they had God on their side, <I>one of them chased a
 thousand,</I> so, when they had made him their enemy, <I>a thousand</I>
 of them should <I>flee at the rebuke of one;</I> so that in the cities
 should be desolation, according to the threatenings in the law, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:31,De+28:51">Lev. xxvi. 31; Deut. xxviii. 51</A>.

 2. That the country should be laid waste,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+17:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.
 
 Observe here, 

 (1.) The sin that had provoked God to bring so great a destruction upon
 that pleasant land. It was <I>for the iniquity of those that dwelt 
 therein.</I> "It is <I>because thou hast forgotten the God of thy 
 salvation</I> and all the great salvations he has wrought for thee, 
 hast forgotten thy dependence upon him and obligations to him, and 
 <I>hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength,</I> not only who 
 is himself a strong rock, but who has been thy strength many a time, or 
 thou wouldst have been sunk and broken long since." Note, The God of 
 our salvation is the rock of our strength; and our forgetfulness and 
 unmindfulness of him are at the bottom of all sin. <I>Therefore</I> 
 have we <I>perverted our way, because we have forgotten the Lord our 
 God,</I> and so we undo ourselves. 

 (2.) The destruction itself, aggravated by the great care they took to 
 improve their land and to make it yet more pleasant. 

 [1.] Look upon it at the time of the seedness, and it was all like a 
 garden and a vineyard; that pleasant land was replenished with pleasant 
 plants, the choicest of its own growth; nay, so nice and curious were 
 the inhabitants that, not content with them, they sent to all the 
 neighbouring countries for strange slips, the more valuable for being 
 strange, uncommon, far-fetched, and dear-bought, though perhaps they 
 had of their own not inferior to them. This was an instance of their
 pride and vanity, and (that ruining error) their affection to be 
 <I>like the nations. Wheat, and honey, and oil</I> were their staple 
 commodities 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:17">Ezek. xxvii. 17</A>);

 but, not content with these, they must have flowers and greens with
 strange names imported from other nations, and a great deal of care and 
 pains must be taken by hot-beds to make these plants to grow; the soil 
 must be forced, and they must be covered with glasses to shelter them, 
 and early in the morning the gardeners must be up to make the seed to 
 flourish, that it may excel those of their neighbours. The ornaments of 
 nature are not to be altogether slighted, but it is a folly to be 
 over-fond of them, and to bestow more time, and cost, and pains about 
 them than they deserve, as many do. But here this instance seems to be 
 put in general for their great industry in cultivating their ground, 
 and their expectations from it accordingly; they doubt not but their 
 plants will grow and flourish. But,

 [2.] Look upon the same ground at the time of harvest, and it is all
 like a wilderness, a dismal melancholy place, even to the spectators, 
 much more to the owners; for <I>the harvest shall be a heap,</I> all in 
 confusion, <I>in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.</I> The 
 harvest used to be a time of joy, of singing and shouting

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+16:10"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 10</A>);

 but this harvest the hungry eat up

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:5">Job v. 5</A>),

 which makes it a day of grief, and the more because the plants were 
 pleasant and costly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+17:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>)

 and their expectations proportionably raised. The harvest had sometimes 
 been a day of grief, if the crop was thin and the weather unseasonable; 
 and yet in that case there was hope that the next would be better. But 
 this shall be desperate sorrow, for they shall see not only this year's 
 products carried off, but the property of the ground altered and their 
 conquerors lords of it. The margin reads it, <I>The harvest shall be 
 removed</I> (into the enemy's country or camp, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:33">Deut. xxviii. 33</A>)

 <I>in the day of inheritance</I> (when thou thoughtest to inherit it),
 <I>and there shall be deadly sorrow.</I> This is a good reason why we 
 should not lay up our treasure in those things which we may so quickly 
 be despoiled of, but in that good part which shall never be taken away 
 from us.</P>

 These verses read the doom of those that spoil and rob the people of 
 God. If the Assyrians and Israelites invade and plunder Judah, if the
 Assyrian army take God's people captive and lay their country waste, 
 let them know that ruin will be their lot and portion. They are here 
 brought in, 

 1. Triumphing over the people of God. They relied upon their numbers.
 The Assyrian army was made up out of divers nations: it was <I>the 
 multitude of many people</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+17:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 by which weight they hoped to carry the cause. They were very noisy, 
 like the roaring of the seas; they talked big, hectored, and 
 threatened, to frighten God's people from resisting them, and all their 
 allies from sending in to their aid. Sennacherib and Rabshakeh, in 
 their speeches and letters, made a mighty noise to strike a terror upon 
 Hezekiah and his people; the nations that followed them <I>made a 
 rushing like the rushing of many waters,</I> and those mighty ones, 
 that threaten to bear down all before them and carry away every thing 
 that stands in their way. <I>The floods have lifted up their voice, 
 have lifted up their waves;</I> such is the tumult of the people, and 
 the heathen, when they rage, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1,93:3">Ps. ii. 1; xciii. 3</A>.

 2. Triumphed over by the judgments of God. They thought to carry their 
 point by dint of noise; but woe to them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+17:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 for he <I>shall rebuke them,</I> that is, God shall, one whom they 
 little think of, have no regard to, stand in no awe of; he shall give 
 them a check with an invisible hand, <I>and</I> then <I>they shall flee 
 afar off.</I> Sennacherib, and Rabshakeh, and the remains of their 
 forces, shall run away in a fright, and shall be chased by their own 
 terrors, <I>as the chaff of the mountains</I> which stand bleak 
 <I>before the wind, and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind,</I> 
 like thistle-down (so the margin); they make themselves <I>as chaff 
 before the wind</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:5">Ps. xxxv. 5</A>)

 and then <I>the angel of the Lord</I> (as it follows there), the same
 angel that slew many of them, shall chase the rest. God will make 
 <I>them like a wheel,</I> or rolling thing, and then <I>persecute them 
 with his tempest</I> and <I>make them afraid with his storm,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:13,15">Ps. lxxxiii. 13, 15</A>.

 Note, God can dispirit the enemies of his church when they are most
 courageous and confident, and dissipate them when they seem most 
 closely consolidated. This shall be done suddenly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+17:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>At evening-tide</I> they are very troublesome, and threaten trouble 
 to the people of God; but <I>before the morning they are not.</I> At 
 sleeping time they are cast into a deep sleep, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+26:5,6">Ps. xxvi. 5, 6</A>.

 It was in the night that the angel routed the Assyrian army. God can in
 a moment break the power of his church's enemies, even when it appears 
 most formidable; and this is written for the encouragement of the 
 people of God in all ages, when they find themselves an unequal match 
 for their enemies; for <I>this is the portion of those that spoil 
 us,</I> they shall themselves be spoiled. God will plead his church's
 cause, and those that meddle do it to their own hurt.</P>
