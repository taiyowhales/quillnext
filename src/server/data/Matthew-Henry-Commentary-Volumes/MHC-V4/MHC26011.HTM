 This chapter concludes the vision which Ezekiel saw, and this part of
 it furnished him with two messages:--

 I. A message of wrath against those who continued still at Jerusalem,
 and were there in the height of presumption, thinking they should never 
 fall, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:1-13">ver. 1-13</A>.

 II. A message of comfort to those who were carried captives into
 Babylon and were there in the depth of despondency, thinking they
 should never rise. And, as the former are assured that God has
 judgments in store for them notwithstanding their present security, so
 the later are assured that God has mercy in store for them
 notwithstanding their present distress, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:14-21">ver. 14-21</A>.

 And so the glory of God removes further, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:22,23">ver. 22, 23</A>.

 The vision disappears 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:24">ver. 24</A>),

 and Ezekiel faithfully gives his hearers an account of it, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:25">ver. 25</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the
 east gate of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s house, which looketh eastward: and behold
 at the door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw
 Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah,
 princes of the people.
 &nbsp; 2  Then said he unto me, Son of man, these <I>are</I> the men that
 devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city:
 &nbsp; 3  Which say, <I>It is</I> not near; let us build houses: this <I>city
 is</I> the caldron, and we <I>be</I> the flesh.
 &nbsp; 4  Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.
 &nbsp; 5  And the Spirit of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> fell upon me, and said unto me,
 Speak; Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel:
 for I know the things that come into your mind, <I>every one of</I>
 them.
 &nbsp; 6  Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have
 filled the streets thereof with the slain.
 &nbsp; 7  Therefore thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Your slain whom ye have
 laid in the midst of it, they <I>are</I> the flesh, and this <I>city is</I>
 the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it.
 &nbsp; 8  Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you,
 saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 9  And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver
 you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among
 you.
 &nbsp; 10  Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border
 of Israel; and ye shall know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 11  This <I>city</I> shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be
 the flesh in the midst thereof; <I>but</I> I will judge you in the
 border of Israel:
 &nbsp; 12  And ye shall know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: for ye have not
 walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have
 done after the manners of the heathen that <I>are</I> round about you.
 &nbsp; 13  And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the
 son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried
 with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>! wilt thou make a full
 end of the remnant of Israel?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The great security of the prince's of Jerusalem, notwithstanding the 
 judgments of God that were upon them, The prophet was brought, in 
 vision, to the gate of the temple where these princes sat in council 
 upon the present arduous affairs of the city: <I>The Spirit lifted me 
 up, and brought me to the east gate of the Lord's house, and behold 
 twenty-five men were there.</I> See how obsequious the prophet was to 
 the Spirit's orders and how observant of all the discoveries that were 
 made to him. It should seem, these twenty-five men were not the same 
 with those twenty-five whom we saw at the door of the temple, 
 <I>worshipping towards the east</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:16"><I>ch.</I> viii. 16</A>);

 those seen to have been priests or Levites, for they were between the
 porch and the altar, but these were princes sitting <I>in the gate of 
 the Lord's house,</I> to try causes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+26:10">Jer. xxvi. 10</A>),

 and they are here charged, not with corruptions in worship, but with
 mal-administration in the government; two of them are named, because 
 they were the most active leading men, and perhaps because the prophet 
 knew them, though he had been some years absent--<I>Pelatiah</I> and 
 <I>Jaazaniah,</I> not that mentioned

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:11"><I>ch.</I> viii. 11</A>,

 for he was the son of <I>Shaphan,</I> this is the <I>son of Azur.</I>
 Some tell us that Jerusalem was divided into twenty-four wards, and 
 that these were the governors or aldermen of those wards, with their 
 mayor or president. Now observe, 

 1. The general character which God gives of these men to the prophet

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>These are the men that devise mischief;</I> under pretence of 
 concerting measures for the public safety they harden people in their 
 sins, and take off their fear of God's judgments which they are
 threatened with by the prophets; they <I>gave wicked counsel in this 
 city,</I> counselling them to restrain and silence the prophets, to 
 rebel against the king of Babylon, and to resolve upon holding <I>the 
 city</I> out to the last extremity." Note, It is bad with a people when 
 the things that belong to their peace are hidden from the eyes of those 
 who are entrusted with their counsels. And, when mischief is done, God 
 knows at whose door to lay it, and, in the day of discovery and 
 recompence, will be sure to lay it at the right door, and will say, 
 <I>These are the men that devised it,</I> though they are great men, 
 and pass for wise men, and must not now be contradicted or controlled. 

 2. The particular charge exhibited against them in proof of this 
 character. They are indicted for words spoken at their council-board, 
 which he that <I>stands in the congregation of the mighty</I> would 
 take cognizance of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 they said to this effect, "<I>It is not near;</I> the destruction of 
 our city, that has been so often threatened by the prophets, <I>is not 
 near,</I> not so near as they talk of." They are conscious to 
 themselves of such an enmity to reformation that they cannot but 
 conclude it will come at last; but they have such an opinion of God's 
 patience (though they have long abused it) that they are willing to 
 hope it will not come this great while. Note, Where Satan cannot 
 persuade men to look upon the judgment to come as a thing doubtful and
 uncertain, yet he gains his point by persuading them to look upon it as 
 a thing at a distance, so that it loses its force: if it be sure, yet 
 <I>it is not near;</I> whereas, in truth, <I>the Judge stands before 
 the door.</I> Now, if the destruction is not near, they conclude, 
 <I>Let us build houses;</I> let us count upon a continuance, for 
 <I>this city is the caldron and we are the flesh.</I> This seems to be 
 a proverbial expression, signifying no more than this, "We are as safe 
 in this city as flesh in a boiling pot; the walls of the city shall be 
 to us as <I>walls of brass,</I> and shall receive no more damage from 
 the besiegers about it than the <I>cauldron</I> does from <I>the fire 
 under it.</I> Those that think to force us out of our city into 
 captivity shall find it to be as much at their peril as it would be to 
 take the flesh out of a boiling pot with their hands." This appears to 
 be the meaning of it, by the answer God gives to it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>I will bring you out of the midst of the city,</I> where you think 
 yourselves safe, and then it will appear 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)

 that <I>this is not your caldron, neither are you the flesh.</I>" 
 Perhaps it has a particular reference to <I>the flesh of the 
 peace-offerings,</I> which it was so great an offence for the priests 
 themselves to take out of the <I>caldron</I> while it was in seething 
 (as we find 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:13,14">1 Sam. ii. 13, 14</A>),

 and then it intimates that they were the more secure because Jerusalem
 was the holy city, and they thought themselves a holy people in it, not 
 to be meddled with. Some think this was a banter upon Jeremiah, who in 
 one of his first visions saw Jerusalem represented by a <I>seething 
 pot,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:13">Jer. i. 13</A>.

 "Now," say they, in a way of jest and ridicule, "if it be a seething
 pot, we are as the flesh in it, and who dares meddle with us?" Thus 
 they continued mocking the messengers of the Lord, even while they 
 suffered for so doing; but <I>be you not mockers, lest your bands be 
 made strong.</I> Those hearts are indeed which are made more secure by 
 those words of God which were designed for warning to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The method taken to awaken them out of their security. One would 
 think that the providences of God which related to them were enough to 
 startle them; but, to help them to understand and improve those, the 
 word of God is sent to them to give them warning 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Therefore prophesy against them,</I> and try to undeceive them; 
 <I>prophesy, O son of man!</I> upon these dead and dry bones. Note, The 
 greatest kindness ministers can do to secure sinners is to preach 
 against them, and to show them their misery and danger, though they are 
 ever so unwilling to see them. We then act most for them when we appear 
 most against them. But the prophet, being at a loss what to say to men 
 that were hardened in sin, and that bade defiance to the judgments of 
 God, <I>the Spirit of the Lord fell upon him,</I> to make him full of 
 power and courage, and <I>said unto him, Speak.</I> Note, When sinners 
 are flattering themselves into their own ruin it is time to speak, and 
 to tell them that they shall have no peace if they go on. Ministers are 
 sometimes so bashful and timorous, and so much at a loss, that they 
 must be put on to speak, and to speak boldly. But he that commands the 
 prophet to speak gives him instructions what to say; and he must 
 address himself to them as <I>the house of Israel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 for not the princes only, but all the people, were concerned to know 
 the truth of their cause, to know the worst of it. They are the 
 <I>house of Israel,</I> and therefore the <I>God of Israel</I> is 
 concerned, in kindness to them, to give them warning; and they are 
 concerned in duty to him to take the warning. And what is it that the 
 must say to them in God's name? 

 1. Let them know that the God of heaven takes notice of the vain
 confidences with which they support themselves

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>I know the things which come into your minds every one of them,</I> 
 what secret reasons you have for these resolutions, and what you aim at 
 in putting so good a face upon a matter you know to be bad." Note, God 
 perfectly knows not only the things that come out of our mouths, but 
 the things that come into our minds, not only all we say, but all we 
 think; even those thoughts that are most suddenly darted into our 
 minds, and that as suddenly slip out of them again, so that we 
 ourselves are scarcely aware of them, yet God knows them. He knows us 
 better than we know ourselves; <I>he understands our thoughts afar 
 off.</I> The consideration of this should oblige us to keep our hearts 
 with all diligence, that no vain thoughts come into them or lodge 
 within them. 

 2. Let them know that those who advised the people to stand it out 
 should be accounted before God the murderers of all who had fallen, or 
 should yet fall, in Jerusalem, by the sword of the Chaldeans; and those 
 slain were the only ones that should <I>remain in the city,</I> as the 
 <I>flesh in the caldron. "You have multiplied your slain in the 
 city,</I> not only those whom you have by the sword of justice unjustly 
 put to death under colour of law, but those whom you have by your 
 wilfulness and pride unwisely exposed to the sword of war, though you 
 were told by the prophets that you should certainly go by the worst. 
 Thus you, with your stubborn humour, have <I>filled the streets of 
 Jerusalem with the slain,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Note, Those who are either unrighteous or imprudent in beginning or 
 carrying on a war bring upon themselves a great deal of the guilt of 
 blood; and those who are slain in the battles or sieges which they, by 
 such a reasonable peace as the war aimed at, might have prevented, will 
 be called <I>their slain.</I> Now these slain are the only flesh that 
 shall be left in this <I>caldron,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 There shall none remain to keep possession of the city but those that 
 are buried in it. There shall be no inhabitants of Jerusalem but the 
 inhabitants of the graves there, no freemen of the city but the free 
 among the dead. 

 3. Let them know that, how impregnable soever they thought their city
 to be, they should be forced out of it, either driven to flight or 
 dragged into captivity: <I>I will bring you forth out of the midst of 
 it,</I> whether you will or no,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:7,9"><I>v.</I> 7, 9</A>.

 They had provoked God to forsake the city, and thought they should do 
 well enough by their own policy and strength when he was gone; but God 
 will make them know that there is no peace to those that have left 
 their God. If they have by their sins driven God from his house, he 
 will soon by his judgments drive them from theirs; and it will be found 
 that those are least safe that are most secure: "This city shall not be 
 your <I>caldron, neither shall you be the flesh;</I> you shall not soak 
 away in it as you promise yourselves, and die in your nest; you think 
 yourself safe <I>in the midst thereof,</I> but you shall not be long 
 there." 

 4. Let them know that when God has got them out of the midst of 
 Jerusalem he will pursue them with his judgments wherever he finds 
 them, the judgments which they thought to shelter themselves from by 
 keeping close in Jerusalem. They feared the sword if they should go
 out to the Chaldeans, and therefore would abide in their 
 <I>caldron,</I> but, says God, I will <I>bring a sword upon you</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>)

 and <I>you shall fall by the sword,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Note, The fear of the wicked shall come upon him. And there is no fence 
 against the judgments of God when they come with commission, no, not in 
 walls of brass. They were afraid of trusting to the mercy of strangers. 
 "But," says God, "<I>I will deliver you into the hands of 
 strangers,</I> whose resentments you shall feel, since you were not 
 willing to lie at their mercy." See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:17,18">Jer. xxxviii. 17, 18</A>.

 They thought to escape the judgments of God, but God says that he will
 <I>execute judgments upon them;</I> and whereas they resolved, if they 
 must be judged, that it should be in Jerusalem, God tells them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10 and again <I>v.</I> 11</A>)

 that he will judge them <I>in the borders of Israel,</I> which was 
 fulfilled when Nebuchadnezzar slew all the nobles of Judah at Riblah in 
 the land of Hamath, on the utmost border of the land of Canaan. Note, 
 Those who have taken ever so deep root in the place where they live 
 cannot be sure that in that place they shall die.

 5. Let them know that all this is the due punishment of their sin, and
 <I>the revelation of the righteous judgment of God</I> against them: 
 <I>You shall know that I am the Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:10,12"><I>v.</I> 10 and again <I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Those shall be made to know by the sword of the Lord who would not be 
 taught by his word what a hatred he has to sin, and what a fearful 
 thing it is for impenitent sinners to fall into his hands. <I>I will 
 execute judgments,</I> and then you shall <I>know that I am the 
 Lord,</I> for the Lord is known by the judgments which he executes upon 
 those <I>that have not walked in his statutes.</I> Hereby it is known 
 that he made the law, because he punishes the breach of it. <I>I will 
 execute judgments among you</I> (says God) because <I>you have not 
 executed my judgments,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Note, The executing of the judgments of God's mouth by us, in a uniform 
 steady course of obedience to his law, is the only way to prevent the 
 executing of the judgments of his hand upon us in our ruin and 
 confusion. One way or other. God's judgments will be executed; the law 
 will take place either in its precept or in its penalty. If we do not 
 give honour to God by executing his judgments as he has commanded, he 
 will <I>get him honour</I> upon us by executing his judgments as he has 
 threatened; and thus we shall know that he is the Lord, the sovereign 
 Lord of all, that will not be mocked. And observe, When they cast off 
 God's statutes, and walked not in them, they did <I>after the manners 
 of the heathen that were round about them,</I> and introduced into 
 their worship all their impure, ridiculous, and barbarous usages. When 
 men leave the settled rule of divine institutions, they wander 
 endlessly. Justly therefore was this made the reason why they should 
 <I>keep God's ordinances,</I> that they might not <I>commit the 
 abominable customs of the heathen,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:30">Lev. xviii. 30</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. This awakening word is here immediately followed by an awakening 
 providence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 Here we may observe, 

 1. With what power Ezekiel prophesied, or, rather, what a divine power 
 went along with it: <I>It came to pass, when I prophesied, that 
 Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died;</I> he was mentioned 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)

 as a principal man among the twenty-five princes that made all the 
 mischief in Jerusalem. It should seem, this was done in vision now, as 
 the slaying of the ancient men

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+9:6"><I>ch.</I> ix. 6</A>)

 upon occasion of which Ezekiel prayed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>)

 as he did here; but it was an assurance that when this prophecy should 
 be published it should be done in fact. The death of Pelatiah was an 
 earnest of the complete accomplishment of this prophecy. Note, God is 
 pleased often-times to single out some sinners, and to make them 
 monuments of his justice, for warning to others of what is coming; and 
 some that thought themselves very safe and snatched away suddenly, and 
 drop down dead in an instant, as Ananias and Sapphira at Peter's feet 
 when he prophesied. 

 2. With what pity Ezekiel prayed. Thought the sudden death of Pelatiah 
 was a confirmation of Ezekiel's prophecy, and really an honour to him, 
 yet he was in deep concern about it, and laid it to heart as if he had 
 been his relation or friend: <I>He fell on his face and cried with a 
 loud voice,</I> as one in earnest, "<I>Ah! Lord God, wilt thou make a 
 full end of the remnant of Israel?</I> Many are swept away by the 
 judgments we have been under; and shall the remnant which have escaped 
 the sword die thus by the immediate hand of heaven? Then thou wilt
 indeed make a full end." Perhaps it was Ezekiel's infirmity to bewail 
 the death of this wicked prince thus, as it was Samuel's to mourn so 
 long for Saul; but thus he showed how far he was from desiring the 
 woeful day he foretold. David lamented the sickness of those that hated 
 and persecuted him. And we ought to be much affected with the sudden 
 death of others, yea, though they are wicked.</P>

 thy kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, <I>are</I> they unto
 whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: unto us is this land given in possession.
 &nbsp; 16  Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Although I have cast
 them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered
 them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little
 sanctuary in the countries where they shall come.
 &nbsp; 17  Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; I will even gather
 you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where
 ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.
 &nbsp; 18  And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all
 the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof
 from thence.
 &nbsp; 19  And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit
 within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh,
 and will give them a heart of flesh:
 &nbsp; 20  That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances,
 and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their
 God.
 &nbsp; 21  But <I>as for them</I> whose heart walketh after the heart of
 their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense
 their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:4">Isa. xl. 4</A>),

 and prophets were to speak not only conviction to the presumptuous and
 secure, but comfort to the despised and desponding that trembled at 
 God's word. The prophet Ezekiel, having in the former part of this 
 chapter received instructions for the awakening of those that were 
 <I>at ease in Zion,</I> is in these verses furnished with comfortable 
 words for those that mourned in Babylon and <I>by the rivers</I> there 
 sat <I>weeping</I> when they <I>remembered Zion.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How the pious captives were trampled upon and insulted over by those 
 who continued in Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 God tells the prophet what the inhabitants of Jerusalem said of him and 
 the rest of them that were already carried away to Babylon. God had 
 owned them as <I>good figs,</I> and declared it was for their good that 
 he had sent them into Babylon; but the inhabitants of Jerusalem 
 abandoned them, supposing those that were really the best saints to be 
 the greatest sinners of all men that dwelt in Jerusalem. Observe, 

 1. How they are described: They are <I>thy brethren</I> (says God to
 the prophet), whom thou hast a concern and affection for; they are 
 <I>the men of thy kindred (the men of thy redemption,</I> so the word 
 is), thy next of kin, to whom the right of redeeming the alienated 
 possession belongs, but who are so far from being able to do it that 
 they have themselves gone into captivity. They are <I>the whole house 
 of Israel;</I> God so accounts of them because they only have retained 
 their integrity, and are bettered by their captivity. They were not 
 only of the same family and nation with Ezekiel, but of the same 
 spirit; they were his hearers, and he had communion with them in holy 
 ordinances; and perhaps upon that account they are called <I>his 
 brethren and the men of his kindred.</I> 

 2. How they were disowned by <I>the inhabitants of Jerusalem;</I> they 
 said of them, <I>Get you far from the Lord.</I> Those that were at ease 
 and proud themselves scorned their brethren that were humbled and under 
 humbling providences.

 (1.) They cut them off from being members of their church. Because they 
 had separated themselves from their rulers and in compliance with the 
 will of God had surrendered themselves to the king of Babylon, they 
 excommunicated them, and said, "<I>Get you far from the Lord;</I> we 
 will have nothing to do with you." Those that were superstitious were 
 very willing to shake off those that were conscientious, and were 
 severe in their censures of them and sentences against them, as if they 
 were forsaken and forgotten of the Lord and were cut off from the 
 communion of the faithful. 

 (2.) They cut them off from being members of the commonwealth too, as 
 if they had no longer any part or lot in the matter: "<I>Unto us is 
 this land given in possession,</I> and you have forfeited your estates 
 by surrendering to the king of Babylon, and we have thereby become 
 entitled to them." God takes notice of, and is much displeased with, 
 the contempt which those that are in prosperity put upon their brethren 
 that are in affliction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The gracious promises which God made to them in consideration of 
 the insolent conduct of their brethren towards them. Those that hated 
 them and cast them out said, <I>Let the Lord be glorified;</I> but 
 <I>he shall appear to their joy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:5">Isa. lxvi. 5</A>.

 God owns that his hand had gone out against them, which had given
 occasion to their brethren to triumph over them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 "It is true <I>I have cast them far off among the heathen</I> and 
 <I>scattered them among the countries;</I> they look as if they were an 
 abandoned people, and so mingled with the nations that they will be 
 lost among them; but I have mercy in store for them." Note, God takes 
 occasion from the contempts which are put upon his people to speak 
 comfort to them, as David hoped God would reward him good for Shimei's 
 cursing. His time to support his people's hopes is when their enemies 
 are endeavouring to drive them to despair. Now God promises,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That he will make up to them the want of the temple and the 
 privileges of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>I will be to them as a little sanctuary, in the countries where they 
 shall come.</I> Those at Jerusalem have the temple, but without God; 
 those in Babylon have God, though without the temple. 

 (1.) God <I>will be a sanctuary to them;</I> that is, a place of 
 refuge; to him they shall flee, and in him they shall be safe, as he 
 was that took hold on <I>the horns of the altar.</I> Or, rather, they 
 shall have such communion with God in the land of their captivity as it 
 was thought could be had nowhere but in the temple. They shall there 
 <I>see God's power and his glory,</I> as they used <I>to see them in 
 the sanctuary;</I> they shall have the tokens of God's presence with 
 them, and his grace in their hearts shall sanctify their prayers and 
 praises, as well as ever the altar sanctified the gift, so that they 
 shall <I>please the Lord better than an ox or bullock.</I> 

 (2.) He <I>will be a little sanctuary,</I> not seen or observed by 
 their enemies, who looked with an evil and an envious eye upon <I>that 
 house</I> at Jerusalem which was high and great, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+9:8">1 Kings ix. 8</A>.

 They were but few and mean, and a little sanctuary was fittest for
 them. God regards the low estate of his people, and suits his favours 
 to their circumstances. Observe the condescensions of divine grace.
 The great God will be to his people a little sanctuary. Note, Those 
 that are deprived of the benefit of public ordinances, if it be not 
 their own fault, may have the want of them abundantly made up in the 
 immediate communications of divine grace and comforts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That God would in due time put an end to their afflictions, bring 
 them out of the land of their captivity, and settle them again, them or 
 their children, in their own land 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 "<I>I will gather</I> even <I>you</I> that are thus dispersed, thus 
 despised, and given over for lost by your own countrymen; <I>I will 
 gather you from the people,</I> distinguish you from those with whom 
 you are mingled, deliver you from those by whom you are held captives, 
 <I>and assemble you</I> in a body out of the countries <I>where you 
 have been scattered;</I> you shall not come back one by one, but all 
 together, which will make your return more honourable, safe, and 
 comfortable; and then <I>I will give you the land of Israel,</I> which 
 now your brethren look upon you as for ever shut out from." Note, It is 
 well for us that men's severe censures cannot cut us off from God's 
 gracious promises. There are many that will be found to have a place in 
 the holy land whom uncharitable men, by their monopolies of it to 
 themselves, had secluded from it. <I>I will give you the land of 
 Israel,</I> give it to you again by a new grant, <I>and they shall come 
 thither.</I> If there be any thing in the change of the person from 
 <I>you</I> to <I>them,</I> it may signify the posterity of those to 
 whom the promise is made. "<I>You</I> shall have the title as the 
 patriarchs had, and <I>those</I> that come after shall have the 
 possession."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That God by his grace would part between them and their sins, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.
 
 Their captivity shall effectually cure them of their idolatry: <I>When 
 they come thither</I> to their own land again <I>they shall take away 
 all the detestable things thereof.</I> Their idols, that had been their 
 delectable things, should now be looked upon with detestation, not only 
 the idols of Babylon, where they were captives, but the idols of 
 Canaan, where they were natives; they should not only not worship them 
 as they had done, but they should not suffer any monuments of them to 
 remain: <I>They shall take all the abominations thereof thence.</I> 
 Note, <I>Then</I> it is in mercy that we return to a prosperous estate, 
 when we return not to the sins and follies of that state. <I>What have
 I to do any more with idols?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That God would powerfully dispose them to their duty; they shall not 
 only <I>cease to do evil,</I> but they shall <I>learn to do well,</I> 
 because there shall be not only an end of their troubles, but a return 
 to their peace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) God will plant good principles in them; he will make the tree 
 good, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 This is a gospel promise, and is made good to all those whom God 
 designs for the heavenly Canaan; for God prepares all for heaven whom 
 he has prepared heaven for. It is promised, 

 [1.] That God <I>will give them one heart,</I> a heart entire for the
 true God and not divided as it had been among many gods, a heart firmly 
 fixed and resolved for God and not wavering, steady and uniform, and 
 not inconstant with itself. <I>One heart</I> is a sincere and upright
 heart, its intentions of a piece with its professions. 

 [2.] That he <I>will put a new spirit within them,</I> a temper of mind
 agreeable to the new circumstances into which God in his providence 
 would bring them. All that are sanctified have <I>a new spirit,</I> 
 quite different from what it was; they act from new principles, walk by 
 new rules, and aim at new ends. A new name, or a new face, will not 
 serve without a new spirit. <I>If any man be in Christ, he is a new 
 creature.</I> 

 [3.] That he <I>will take</I> away <I>the stony heart out of their
 flesh,</I> out of their corrupt nature. Their hearts shall no longer 
 be, as they have been, dead and dry, and hard and heavy, as a stone, no 
 longer incapable of bearing good fruit, so that the good seed is lost 
 upon it, as it was on the <I>stony ground.</I> 

 [4.] That he <I>will give them a heart of flesh,</I> not dead or proud
 flesh, but living flesh; he will make their hearts sensible of 
 spiritual pains and spiritual pleasures, will make them tender, and apt 
 to receive impressions. This is God's work, it is his gift, his gift by 
 promise; and a wonderful and happy change it is that is wrought by it, 
 from death to life. This is promised to those whom God would bring back 
 to their own land; for <I>then</I> such a change of the condition is 
 for the better indeed when it is accompanied with such a change of the 
 heart; and such a change must be wrought in all those that shall be 
 brought to the <I>better country,</I> that is, the heavenly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Their practices shall be consonant to those principles: <I>I will 
 give them a new spirit,</I> not that they may be able to discourse well 
 of religion and to dispute for it, but <I>that they may walk in my 
 statues</I> in their whole conversation <I>and keep my ordinances</I> 
 in all acts of religious worship, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 These two must go together; and those to whom God has given <I>a new 
 heart and a new spirit</I> will make conscience of both; and then 
 <I>they shall be my people and I will be their God.</I> The ancient 
 covenant, which seemed to be broken and forgotten, shall be renewed. By 
 their idolatry, it should seem, they had cast God off; by their 
 captivity, it should seem, God had cast them off. But when they were 
 cured of their idolatry, and delivered out of their captivity, God and 
 his Israel own one another again. God, by his good work in them, will 
 make them his <I>people;</I> and then, by the tokens of his good-will 
 towards them, he will show that he is <I>their God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is a threatening of wrath against those who hated to be 
 reformed. As, when judgments are threatened, the righteous are 
 distinguished so as not to share in the evil of those judgments, so, 
 when favours are promised, the wicked are distinguished so as not to 
 share in the comfort of those favours; they have no part nor lot in the 
 matter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 <I>But, as for those</I> that have no grace, what have they <I>to do 
 with peace?</I> Observe, 

 1. Their description. Their <I>heart walks after the heart of their
 detestable things;</I> they have as great a minds to worship devils as 
 devils have to be worshipped. Or, in opposition to the <I>new heart</I> 
 which God gives his people, which is a heart after his own heart, they 
 have a <I>heart after the heart of their idols;</I> in their temper and 
 practice they conformed to the characters and accounts given them of 
 their idols, and the ideas they had of them, and of them they learned 
 lewdness and cruelty. Here lies the root of all their wickedness, the 
 corruption of the heart; as the root of their reformation is laid in 
 the renovation of the heart. The heart has its walks, and according as 
 those are the man is. 

 2. Their doom. It carries both justice and terror in it: <I>I will 
 recompense their way upon their own heads;</I> I will deal with them as 
 they deserve. There needs no more than this to speak God righteous, 
 that he does but render to men according to their deserts: and yet such 
 are the deserts of sin that there needs no more than this to speak the 
 sinner miserable.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>22  Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels
 beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel <I>was</I> over them
 above.
 &nbsp; 23  And the glory of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> went up from the midst of the
 city, and stood upon the mountain which <I>is</I> on the east side of
 the city.
 &nbsp; 24  Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision
 by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So
 the vision that I had seen went up from me.
 &nbsp; 25  Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had shewed me.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The departure of God's presence from the city and temple. When the
 message was committed to the prophet, and he was fully apprized of it, 
 fully instructed how to separate between <I>the precious and the vile, 
 then the cherubim lifted up their wings and the wheels beside them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>)
 
 as before,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:19"><I>ch.</I> x. 19</A>.

 Angels, when they have done their errands in this lower world, are upon
 the wing to be gone, for they lose no time. We left <I>the glory of the 
 Lord</I> last at <I>the east gate of the temple</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:19"><I>ch.</I> x. 19</A>),

 which is here said to be in the <I>midst of the city.</I> Now here we
 are told that, finding and wondering that there was none to intercede, 
 none to uphold, none to invite its return, it removed next to <I>the 
 mountain which is on the east side of the city</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>);

 that was the <I>mount of Olives.</I> On this mountain they had set up 
 their idols, to confront God in his temple, when he dwelt there 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:7">1 Kings xi. 7</A>),

 and thence it was called <I>the mount of corruption</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:13">2 Kings xxiii. 13</A>);

 therefore there God does as it were set up his standard, his tribunal,
 as it were to confront those who thought to keep possession of the 
 temple for themselves now that God had left it. From that mountain
 there was a full prospect of the city; thither God removed, to make 
 good what he had said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:20">Deut. xxxii. 20</A>),

 <I>I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall
 be.</I> It was from this mountain that Christ <I>beheld the city and 
 wept over it,</I> in the foresight of its last destruction by the 
 Romans. <I>The glory of the Lord</I> removed thither, to be as it were 
 yet within call, and ready to return if now at length, <I>in this their 
 day,</I> they would have <I>understood the things that belonged to 
 their peace.</I> Loth to depart bids oft farewell. God, by going away 
 thus slowly, thus gradually, intimated that he left them with 
 reluctance, and would not have gone if they had not perfectly forced 
 him from them. He did now, in effect, say, <I>How shall I give thee up, 
 Ephraim? How shall I deliver thee, Israel?</I> But, though he bear 
 long, he will not bear always, but will at length forsake those, and 
 cast them off for ever, who have forsaken him and cast him off.

 2. The departure of this vision from the prophet. At length it <I>went 
 up from him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>);

 he saw it mount upwards, till it went out of sight, which would be a 
 confirmation to his faith that it was a heavenly vision, that it 
 descended from above, for thitherward it returned. Note, The visions 
 which the saints have of the glory of God will not be constant will 
 they come to heaven. They have glimpses of that glory, which they soon 
 lose again, visions which go up from them, tastes of divine pleasures, 
 but not a continual feast. It was from the mount of Olives that the 
 vision went up, typifying the ascension of Christ to heaven from that 
 very mountain, when those that had seen him <I>manifested in the 
 flesh</I> saw him no more. It was foretold 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:4">Zech. xiv. 4</A>)

 that <I>his feet should stand upon the mount of Olives,</I> stand last
 there.

 3. The prophet's return to those of the captivity. The same spirit that
 had carried him in a trance or ecstasy to Jerusalem brought him back to 
 Chaldea; for there the bounds of his habitation are at present 
 appointed, and that is the place of his service. The Spirit came to 
 him, not to deliver him out of captivity, but (which was equivalent) to 
 support and comfort him in his captivity.

 4. The account which he gave to his hearers of all he had seen and 
 heard,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 He received that he might give, and he was <I>faithful to him that 
 appointed him;</I> he delivered his message very honestly: he <I>spoke 
 all that,</I> and that only, which God <I>had shown</I> him. He told
 them of the great wickedness he had seen at Jerusalem, and the ruin 
 that was hastening towards that city, that they might not repent of 
 their surrendering themselves to the king of Babylon as Jeremiah 
 advised them, and blame themselves for it, nor envy those that staid 
 behind, and laughed at them for going when they did, nor wish 
 themselves there again, but be content in their captivity. Who would 
 covet to be in a city so full of sin and so near to ruin? It is better 
 to be in Babylon under the favour of God than in Jerusalem under his 
 wrath and curse. But, though this was delivered immediately to those of 
 the captivity, yet we may suppose that they sent the contents of it to 
 those at Jerusalem, with whom they kept up a correspondence; and well 
 would it have been for Jerusalem if she had taken the warning hereby 
 given.</P>
