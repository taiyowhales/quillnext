 In this chapter, 

 I. The oppressors in Israel are threatened for their oppression of the
 poor, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+4:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. The idolaters in Israel, being joined to idols, are given up to
 their own heart's lusts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+4:4,5">ver. 4, 5</A>.

 III. All the sins of Israel are aggravated from their incorrigibleness
 in them, and their refusal to return and reform, notwithstanding the
 various rebukes of Providence which they had been under, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+4:6-11">ver. 6-11</A>.

 IV. They are invited yet at length to humble themselves before God,
 since it is impossible for them to make their part good against him,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that <I>are</I> in the mountain
 of Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which
 say to their masters, Bring, and let us drink.
 &nbsp; 2 The Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days
 shall come upon you, that he will take you away with hooks, and
 your posterity with fish-hooks.
 &nbsp; 3 And ye shall go out at the breaches, every <I>cow at that which
 is</I> before her; and ye shall cast <I>them</I> into the palace, saith
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 4 Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply
 transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, <I>and</I>
 your tithes after three years:
 &nbsp; 5 And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and
 proclaim <I>and</I> publish the free offerings: for this liketh you, O
 ye children of Israel, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is here foretold, in the name of God, that oppressors shall be 
 humbled and idolaters shall be hardened.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That proud oppressors shall be humbled for their oppressions: for 
 <I>he that does wrong shall receive according to the wrong that he has 
 done.</I> Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How their sin is described, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+4:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 They are compared to the <I>kine of Bashan,</I> which were a breed of 
 cattle very large and strong, especially if, though bred there, they 
 were fed upon <I>the mountain of Samaria,</I> where the pastures were 
 extraordinarily fat. Amos had been a herdsman, and he speaks in a 
 dialect of his calling, comparing the rich and great men, that lived in 
 luxury and wantonness, to the <I>kine of Bashan,</I> which were wanton 
 and unruly, would not be kept within the bounds of their own pasture, 
 But broke through the hedges, broke down all the fences, and trespassed 
 upon the neighboring grounds; and not only so, but pushed and gored the 
 smaller cattle that were not a match for them. Those that had their 
 summer-houses upon the mountains of Samaria when they went thither for 
 fresh air were as mischievous as the kine upon the mountains of Bashan 
 and as injurious to those about them. 

 (1.) They oppress the poor and needy themselves; they <I>crush</I> 
 them, to squeeze something to themselves out of them. They took 
 advantage of their poverty, and necessity, and inability to help 
 themselves, to make them poorer and more necessitous than they were.
 They made use of their power as judges and magistrates for the invading 
 of men's rights and properties, the poor not excepted; for they made no 
 conscience of robbing even the hospital. 

 (2.) They are in confederacy with those that do so. They <I>say to 
 their masters</I> (to the masters of the poor, that abuse them and 
 violently take from them what they have, when they ought to relieve 
 them), "<I>Bring, and let us drink;</I> let us feast with you upon the 
 gains of our oppression, and then we will protect you, and stand by you 
 in it, and reject the appeals of the poor against you." Note, What is 
 got by extortion is commonly made use of as <I>provisions for the 
 flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof;</I> and <I>therefore</I> men are 
 tyrants to the poor because they are slaves to their appetites.
 <I>Bring, and let us drink,</I> is the language of those that <I>crush 
 the needy,</I> as if the <I>tears of the oppressed,</I> mingled with 
 their wine, made it drink the better. And by their associations for 
 drinking and reveling, and an excess of riot, they strengthen their 
 combinations for persecution and oppression, and harden the hearts of 
 one another in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How their punishment is described, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+4:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 God will <I>take them away with hooks, and their posterity with 
 fish-hooks;</I> he will send the Assyrian army upon them, that shall 
 make a prey of them, shall not only enclose the body of the nation in 
 their net, but shall angle for particular persons, and take them 
 prisoners and captives as with hooks and fish-hooks, shall draw them 
 out of their own land as fish are drawn out of the water, which is 
 their element, them and their children with them, or, They in their day 
 shall be drawn out by one victorious enemy, and their posterity in 
 their day by another, so that by a succession of destroying judgments 
 they shall at length be wholly extirpated. These <I>kine of Bashan</I> 
 thought they could no more be drawn out with a hook and a cord than the 
 Leviathan can, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:1,2">Job xli. 1, 2</A>.

 But God will make them know that he has a <I>hook for their nose</I>
 and a <I>bridle for their jaws,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:29">Isa. xxxvii. 29</A>.

 The enemy shall take them away as easily as the fisherman takes away
 the little fish, and shall make it their sport and recreation. When
 the enemy has made himself master of Samaria, then,

 (1.) Some shall attempt to escape by flight: <I>You shall go out at the 
 breaches</I> made in the wall of the city, <I>every cow at that which 
 is before her,</I> to shift for her own safety, and make the best of 
 her way; and now the unruly kine of Bashan are tamed, and are 
 themselves crushed, as they crushed the poor and needy. Note, Those to 
 whom God has given a good pasture, if they are wanton in it, will 
 justly be turned out of it; and those who will not be kept within the 
 hedge of God's precept forfeit the benefit of the hedge of God's 
 protection, and will be forced in vain to flee through the breaches 
 they have themselves fearfully made in that hedge. 

 (2.) Others shall think to shelter themselves, or at least their best 
 effects, in the palace, because it is a castle well fortified and a 
 garrison well manned: <I>You shall throw yourselves</I> (so some read 
 it), or <I>throw them</I> (that is, your posterity, your children, or 
 whatever is dear to you), <I>into the palace,</I> where the enemy will 
 find it ready to be seized. Note, What is got by oppression cannot long 
 be enjoyed with satisfaction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. How their sentence to this punishment is ratified: <I>The Lord God 
 has sworn it by his holiness.</I> He had often said it, and they 
 regarded it not; they thought God and his prophets did but jest with 
 them; therefore he <I>swears</I> it <I>in his wrath,</I> and what he 
 has sworn he will not revoke. He swears by <I>his holiness,</I> that 
 attribute of his which is so much his glory, and which is so much 
 glorified in the punishment of wicked people; for, as sure as God is a 
 holy God, those that <I>plough iniquity and sow wickedness shall reap 
 the same.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That obstinate idolaters shall be hardened in their idolatries 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+4:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>):

 <I>Come to Bethel, and transgress.</I> It is spoken ironically: "Do so; 
 take your course; <I>multiply</I> your <I>transgressions</I> by 
 multiplying your sacrifices, <I>for this liketh you;</I> but what will 
 you do in the end hereof?" Here we see, 

 1. How intent they were upon the service of their idols, and how
 willing they were to be at cost upon them; they <I>brought their 
 sacrifices,</I> and their <I>tithes,</I> and their <I>free-will 
 offerings,</I> hoping that therein they should be accepted of God, but 
 it was all an abomination to him. The profuseness of idolaters in the 
 service of their false gods may shame our strait-handedness in the 
 service of the true and living God. 

 2. How they mimicked God's institutions. They had their <I>daily
 sacrifice</I> at the altar of Bethel, as God had at his altar; they had 
 their <I>thank-offerings</I> as God had, only they allowed 
 <I>leaven</I> in them, which God had forbidden, because their priests 
 did not like to have the bread to heavy and tasteless as it would be if 
 it had not leaven in it, for something to ferment it. Holy bread would 
 not serve them, unless it were pleasant bread. 

 3. How well pleased they were with these services themselves: <I>This
 liketh you, O you children of Israel! So you love.</I> What was their 
 own invention they were fond of and wedded to, and thought it must be 
 pleasing to God because it was agreeable to their own fancy. 

 4. How they upbraided with it: "<I>Come to Bethel, to Gilgal; bring the 
 sacrifices</I> and <I>tithes</I> yourselves; <I>proclaim</I> and 
 <I>publish</I> to the nation the <I>free-offerings,</I> pressing them 
 to bring in abundance of such; <I>go on</I> in this way;" that is,

 (1.) "It is plain that you are resolved to do it, whatever God and 
 conscience say to the contrary." 

 (2.) "Your prophets shall let you alone in it, and not admonish you as 
 they have done, for it is to no purpose. <I>Let no man strive nor 
 rebuke his neighbour.</I>" 

 (3.) "Your foolish hearts shall be more and more darkened and besotted, 
 and you shall be quite <I>given up to</I> these <I>strong delusions, to 
 believe a lie.</I>" 

 (4.) "What will you get by it? <I>Come to Bethel</I> and <I>multiply 
 your sacrifices,</I> and see what the better you will be, what returns 
 you will have to your sacrifices, what stead they will stand you in in 
 the day of distress. <I>You shall be ashamed of Bethel your
 confidence,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:13">Jer. xlviii. 13</A>.

 (5.) "<I>Come, and transgress,</I> come, and <I>multiply your 
 transgression,</I> that you may <I>fill up the measure</I> of your 
 iniquity and be ripened for ruin." Thus Christ said to Judas, <I>What 
 thou doest do quickly;</I> and to the Jews, <I>Fill you up the measure 
 of your fathers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:32">Matt. xxiii. 32</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6 And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your
 cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet have ye not
 returned unto me, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 7 And also I have withholden the rain from you, when <I>there
 were</I> yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain
 upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one
 piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not
 withered.
 &nbsp; 8 So two <I>or</I> three cities wandered unto one city, to drink
 water; but they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto
 me, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 9 I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your
 gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive
 trees increased, the palmer-worm devoured <I>them:</I> yet have ye not
 returned unto me, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 10 I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of
 Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken
 away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come
 up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 11 I have overthrown <I>some</I> of you, as God overthrew Sodom and
 Gomorrah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning:
 yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 12 Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: <I>and</I> because
 I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.
 &nbsp; 13 For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the
 wind, and declareth unto man what <I>is</I> his thought, that maketh
 the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the
 earth, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, The God of hosts, <I>is</I> his name.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. God complains of his people's incorrigibleness under the judgments 
 which he had brought upon them in order to their humiliation and 
 reformation. He had by several tokens intimated to them his 
 displeasure, with this design, that they might by repentance make their 
 peace with him; but it had not that effect.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is five times repeated in these verses, as the burden of the
 charge, "<I>Yet have you not returned unto me, saith the Lord;</I> you 
 have been several times corrected, but in vain; you are not reclaimed, 
 there is no sign of amendment. You have been sent for by one messenger 
 after another, but you have not come back, you have not come home." 
 
 (1.) This intimates that that which God designed in all his 
 providential rebukes was to reduce them to their allegiance, to 
 influence them to return to him.

 (2.) That, if they had returned to their God, they would have been 
 accepted, he would have bidden them welcome, and the troubles they were 
 in would have been removed. 

 (3.) That the reason why God sent further troubles was because former 
 troubles had not done the work, otherwise it is <I>no pleasure to the 
 Almighty that he should afflict.</I> 

 (4.) That God was grieved at their obstinacy, and took it unkindly that 
 they should force him to do that which he did so unwillingly: "<I>You 
 have not returned to me</I> from whom you have revolted, <I>to me</I> 
 with whom you are in covenant, <I>to me</I> who stands ready to receive 
 you, <I>to me</I> who have so often called you." Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. To aggravate their incorrigibleness, and to justify himself in 
 inflicting greater judgments, he recounts the less judgments with which 
 he had tried to bring them to repentance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) There had sometimes been a scarcity of provisions, though there 
 was no visible cause of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>I have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities,</I> for you 
 had no meat to chew, whereby your teeth might be fouled," especially no 
 flesh, which dirties the teeth. Or, <I>I have given you emptiness of
 teeth,</I> nothing to fill your mouths with. "<I>Bread,</I> the staff 
 of life, has been wanting, for you have <I>sown much</I> and <I>brought 
 in little,</I>" as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:9">Hag. i. 9</A>.

 Some think this refers to that <I>seven years' famine</I> that was in
 Elisha's time, which we read of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:1">2 Kings viii. 1</A>.

 Now when God thus <I>took away their corn in the season thereof,</I>
 because they had prepared it for Baal, they should have said, We will 
 <I>go and return to our first husband,</I> having paid dearly for 
 leaving him; but it had not that effect. <I>They have not returned to 
 me,</I> saith the Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Sometimes they had wanted rain, and then of course they wanted the 
 fruits of the earth. This evil was of the Lord: <I>I have withholden 
 the rain from you.</I> God has the key of the clouds, and, if he shut 
 up, who can open? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The rain was withheld <I>when there were yet three months to the 
 harvest,</I> at the time when they used to have it, and therefore the 
 withholding of it was an extraordinary thing, and, if the course of 
 nature was altered, they must therein own the hand of the God of 
 nature; and it was at a time when they most needed it, and therefore 
 the want of it was a very sore judgment, and blasted their expectations 
 of a crop at harvest. And one circumstance which made this very 
 remarkable was that when there were some places that wanted rain, and 
 withered for want of it, there were other places near adjoining that 
 had it in abundance. God <I>caused it to rain upon one city, and not 
 upon another,</I> in the same country; nay, he caused it to rain 
 <I>upon one field,</I> one <I>piece</I> of a field, and it was thereby 
 made fruitful and flourishing, but on the next field, on the other side 
 of the hedge, nay, on another part of the same field, <I>it rained 
 not</I> at all, and it was so long without rain that all the products 
 of it <I>withered.</I> No doubt this was literally true, and there were 
 many instances of it which were generally taken notice of. Now,

 [1.] By this it appeared that the withholding of the rain was not 
 casual, but by a divine direction and disposal, and that the cloud 
 which waters the earth is <I>turned round about by the counsels of God, 
 to do whatsoever he commands it, whether for correction, or for his 
 land, or for his mercy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:12-18">Job xxxvii. 12-18</A>.

 Rain does not go by planets (as common people speak), but as God sends
 it by his winds.

 [2.] We have reason to think that those cities on which it rained not 
 were the most infamous for wickedness, such as Bethel and Gilgal 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 and that those on which it rained were such as retained something of 
 religion and virtue among them. And so in the town-fields it rained or 
 rained not, upon the piece, according as the owner was; for we are sure 
 <I>the curse of the Lord is in the house,</I> and upon the ground, 
 <I>of the wicked, but he blesses the habitation of the just,</I> and 
 his field is a <I>field that the Lord has blessed.</I>

 [3.] It would be the greater grief and vexation to those whose fields 
 withered for want of rain to see their neighbours' fields well watered 
 and flourishing. <I>My servants shall eat, but you shall be hungry,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:13">Isa. lxv. 13</A>.

 The <I>wicked shall see it, and be grieved.</I> Probably those that
 were oppressed were rained upon, and so they recovered their losses, 
 while the oppressors withered, and so lost their gains.

 [4.] Yet, as to the nation in general, it was a mixture of mercy with 
 the judgment, and, consequently, strengthened the call to repentance 
 and reformation, and encouraged them to hope for all mercy, in their 
 returns to God, since there was so much mercy even in God's rebukes of 
 them. But, because they did not make good use of this gracious allay to 
 the extremity of the judgment, they had not the benefit of it, which 
 otherwise they might have had, for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>)

 <I>two or three cities wandered</I> at uncertainty, as beggars, <I>unto 
 one city, to drink water,</I> and, if possible, to have some to carry 
 home with them, but <I>they were not satisfied;</I> it was but here and 
 there one city that had water, while many wanted, and then it was not, 
 as usual, <I>Usus communis aquarum--Water is free to all.</I> Those 
 that had it had occasion for it, or knew not how soon they might, and 
 therefore could afford but little to those that wanted, saying, <I>Lest 
 there be not enough for us and you.</I> Those that came <I>drank 
 water,</I> but <I>they were not satisfied,</I> because they drank it 
 <I>by measure, and with astonishment;</I> and those that <I>drink of 
 this water shall thirst again,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:13">John iv. 13</A>.

 They were not satisfied, because their desires were greedy, and what
 they had God did not bless to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:6">Hag. i. 6</A>.

 And now, one would think, when they met with all this disappointment,
 they should have considered their ways and repented; but it had not 
 that effect: "<I>Yet have you not returned to me,</I> no, not so much 
 as to pray in a right manner for the former and latter rain,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+10:1">Zech. x. 1</A>.

 See the folly of carnal hearts; they will wander from city to city,
 from one creature to another, in pursuit of satisfaction, and still 
 they miss of it; they <I>labour for that which satisfies not</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:2">Isa. lv. 2</A>),

 and yet, after all, they <I>will not return to God,</I> will not
 incline their ear to him in whom they might have satisfaction. The
 preaching of the gospel is as rain; God sometimes blesses one place 
 with it more than another; some countries, some cities, are, like 
 Gideon's fleece, wet with this dew, while the ground about is dry; all 
 withers where this rain is wanting. But it were well if people were but 
 as wise for their souls as they are for their bodies, and, when they 
 have not this rain near them, would go and seek it where it is to be 
 had; and, if they seek aright, they shall not seek in vain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Sometimes the fruits of their ground were eaten up by 
 caterpillars, or blasted with mildew, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Heaven and earth are armed against those who have made God their enemy. 
 When God pleased, that is, when he was displeased,

 [1.] They suffered by a malignant air, the influence of which, either 
 too hot or too cold, blasted their fruits, with a force that could be 
 neither discerned nor resisted, and against which there was no defence.

 [2.] They suffered by malignant animals. Their <I>vineyards</I> and
 <I>gardens</I> yielded their increase in great abundance, so did their 
 <I>fig-trees</I> and <I>olive-trees;</I> but the <I>palmer-worm 
 devoured them</I> before the fruits were ripe, and fit to be gathered 
 in. This was either the same judgment with that which we read of 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:4-6">Joel i. 4-6</A>,

 or a less judgment of the same nature, sent before to give warning of 
 that. But they did not take warning: <I>Yet have you not returned unto 
 me.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) Sometimes the plague had raged among them, and the sword of war 
 had cut off multitudes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 <I>The pestilence</I> is God's messenger; this he <I>sent among</I> 
 them, with directions whom to strike dead, and it was done. It was a 
 <I>pestilence after the manner of Egypt;</I> deaths were scattered 
 among them by the hand of a <I>destroying angel at midnight.</I> And 
 perhaps this pestilence, as that of Egypt, fastened upon the 
 first-born. <I>In the way of Egypt</I> (so the margin); when they were 
 making their escape to Egypt, or going thither to seek for aid, the 
 pestilence seized them by the way and stopped their journey. The sword 
 of war is likewise <I>the sword of the Lord;</I> this was drawn among 
 them with commission; and then it <I>slew their young men,</I> the 
 strength of the present generation and the seed of the next. God says, 
 <I>I have slain them;</I> he avows the execution. <I>The slain of the 
 Lord are many.</I> The enemy <I>took away their horses,</I> and 
 converted them to their own use; and the dead carcases of those that 
 were slain either with sword or pestilence were so many, and for want 
 of surviving friends were left so long unburied, that the <I>stench of 
 their camps came up into their nostrils,</I> and was both noisome and 
 dangerous, and might put them in mind of the offensiveness of their sin 
 to God. And yet this did not prevail to humble and reclaim them: <I>You 
 have not returned to</I> him that smites you. Such a rueful woeful 
 sight as this prevailed not to make them religious.</P>

 (5.) In these and other judgments some were remarkably cut off, and 
 made monuments of justice, others were remarkably spared, and made 
 monuments of mercy, the setting of which the one over against the other 
 one would have thought likely to work upon them, but it had not its 
 effect, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+4:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 [1.] Some were quite ruined, their families destroyed, and themselves 
 in them: <I>I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and 
 Gomorrah.</I> Perhaps they were consumed with lightning, as Sodom was, 
 or the houses were, in some other way, burnt to the ground, and the 
 inhabitants in them. Sodom and Gomorrah are said to be <I>condemned 
 with an overthrow, and so made an example,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:6">2 Pet. ii. 6</A>.

 God had threatened to destroy the whole land with such an overthrow as
 that of Sodom,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:23">Deut. xxix. 23</A>.

 But he began with some particular places first, to give them warning,
 or perhaps with some particular persons, whose <I>sins went beforehand 
 to judgment.</I>

 [2.] Others very narrowly escaped: "You <I>were</I> many of you as a 
 <I>firebrand plucked out of the burning,</I> like Lot out of Sodom, 
 when the fire had already kindled upon you; and yet you hate sin never 
 the more for the danger it has brought you to, nor love God ever the 
 more for the deliverance he wrought for you. You that have been so
 signally delivered, and in such a distinguishing way, <I>have not 
 returned unto me.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God, in the close, calls upon his people, now at length, in this 
 their day, to understand the things that belong to their peace, before 
 they were hidden from their eyes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+4:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.
 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How God threatens them with sorer judgments than any they had yet 
 been under: "Therefore, seeing you have not been wrought upon by 
 correction hitherto, <I>thus will I do unto thee, O Israel!</I>" He 
 does not say how he will do, but it shall be something worse than had 
 come yet, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:14">John v. 14</A>.

 Or, "<I>Thus I will</I> go on to <I>do unto thee,</I> following one
 judgment with another, like the plagues of Egypt, till I have made a 
 full end." Nothing but reformation will prevent the ruin of a sinful 
 people. If they turn not to him, his anger is not <I>turned away,</I>
 but <I>his hand is stretched out still. I will punish you yet seven 
 times more, if you will not be reformed;</I> so it was written in the 
 law,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:23,24">Lev. xxvi. 23, 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How he awakens them therefore to think of making their peace with 
 God: "<I>Seeing I will do this unto thee,</I> and there is no remedy, 
 <I>prepare to meet they God, O Israel!</I>" that is, 

 (1.) "Consider how unable thou art to meet him as a combatant." Some 
 make it to be spoken by way of irony or challenge: "Prepare to meet 
 God, who is coming forth to contend with thee. What armour of proof 
 canst thou put on? What courage canst thou steel thyself with? Alas! it 
 is but putting <I>briers and thorns</I> before a consuming fire, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:4,5">Isa. xxvii. 4, 5</A>.

 Art thou able with less than 10,000 to meet him that comes forth
 against thee with more than 20,000?"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:31">Luke xiv. 31</A>.

 (2.) "Resolve therefore to meet him as a penitent, as a humble 
 suppliant, to meet him as <I>thy God,</I> in covenant with thee, to 
 submit, and stand it out no longer." We must prepare to <I>meet God in 
 the way of his judgments</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:8">Isa. xxvi. 8</A>),

 to <I>take hold on his strength, that we may make peace.</I> Note,
 Since we cannot flee from God we are concerned to prepare to meet him; 
 and therefore he gives us warning, that we may prepare. When we are to 
 meet him in his ordinances we must prepare to meet him, prepare to seek 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. How he sets forth the greatness and power of God as a reason why we 
 should prepare to meet him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 If he be such a God as he is here described to be, it is folly to 
 contend with him, and our duty and interest to make our peace with him; 
 it is good having him our friend and bad having him our enemy. 

 (1.) He <I>formed the mountains,</I> made the earth, the strongest 
 stateliest parts of it, and by the word of his power still upholds it 
 and them. Whatever are the products of the everlasting mountains, he
 formed them; whatever <I>salvation</I> is <I>hoped for from hills and 
 mountains,</I> he is the founder of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:11,12">Ps. lxxxix. 11, 12</A>.

 He that formed the <I>great mountains</I> can <I>make them plain,</I>
 when they stand in the way of his people's salvation.

 (2.) He <I>creates the wind.</I> The power of the air is derived from 
 him, and directed by him; he brings the wind out of his treasures, and 
 orders from what point of the compass it shall blow; and he that made 
 it rules it; even <I>the winds and the seas obey him.</I> 

 (3.) He <I>declares unto man what is his thought.</I> He makes known 
 his counsel by his servants the prophets to the children of men, the 
 thought of his justice against impenitent sinners, and the thought of 
 good he thinks towards those that repent. He can also make known, for
 he perfectly knows, the thought that is in man's heart; he 
 <I>understands it afar off,</I> and in the day of conviction will set 
 the evil thoughts among the other sins of sinners <I>in order before 
 them.</I> 

 (4.) He often <I>makes the morning darkness,</I> by thick clouds 
 overspreading the sky immediately after the sun rose bright and 
 glorious; so when we look for prosperity and joy he can dash our 
 expectations with some unlooked-for calamity. 

 (5.) He <I>treads upon the high places of the earth,</I> is not only 
 higher than the highest, but has dominion over all, tramples upon proud 
 men, and upon the idols that were worshipped in the highest places. 
 
 (6.) <I>Jehovah the God of hosts is his name,</I> for he has his being
 of himself, and is the fountain of all being, and all the hosts of 
 heaven and earth are at his command. Let us humble ourselves before 
 this God, prepare to meet him, and give all diligence to make him our 
 God, for happy are the people whose God he is, who have all this power 
 engaged for them.</P>
