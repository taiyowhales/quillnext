 This chapter is an abridgment of the foregoing chapter; the heads of it 
 are much the same. Here is, 

 I. A woe to those who, when the Assyrian army invaded them, trusted to
 the Egyptians, and not to God, for succour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+31:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. Assurance given of the care God would take of Jerusalem in that
 time of danger and distress, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+31:4,5">ver. 4, 5</A>.

 III. A call to repentance and reformation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+31:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>.

 IV. A prediction of the fall of the Assyrian army, and the fright which 
 the Assyrian king should thereby be put into, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+31:8,9">ver. 8, 9</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on
 horses, and trust in chariots, because <I>they are</I> many; and in
 horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto
 the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>!
 &nbsp; 2  Yet he also <I>is</I> wise, and will bring evil, and will not call
 back his words: but will arise against the house of the
 evildoers, and against the help of them that work iniquity.
 &nbsp; 3  Now the Egyptians <I>are</I> men, and not God; and their horses
 flesh, and not spirit. When the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall stretch out his hand,
 both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is holpen shall fall
 down, and they all shall fail together.
 &nbsp; 4  For thus hath the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spoken unto me, Like as the lion and
 the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds
 is called forth against him, <I>he</I> will not be afraid of their
 voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so shall the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and for the hill
 thereof.
 &nbsp; 5  As birds flying, so will the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts defend Jerusalem;
 defending also he will deliver <I>it; and</I> passing over he will
 preserve it.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is the last of four chapters together that begin with woe; and
 they are all woes to the sinners that were found among the professing
 people of God, to the <I>drunkards of Ephraim</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:1"><I>ch.</I> xxviii. 1</A>),

 to <I>Ariel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:1"><I>ch.</I> xxix. 1</A>),
 
 to the <I>rebellious children</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:1"><I>ch.</I> xxx. 1</A>),
 
 and here to <I>those that go down to Egypt for help;</I> for men's
 relation to the church will not secure them from divine woes if they 
 live in contempt of divine laws. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What the sin was that is here reproved, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+31:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 1. Idolizing the Egyptians, and making court to them, as if happy were 
 the people that had the Egyptians for their friends and allies. They 
 <I>go down to Egypt for help</I> in every exigence, as if the 
 worshippers of false gods had a better interest in heaven and were more 
 likely to have success of earth than the servants of the living and 
 true God. That which invited them to Egypt was that the Egyptians had 
 many chariots to accommodate them with, and horses and horsemen that 
 were strong; and, if they could get a good body of forces thence into 
 their service, they would think themselves able to deal with the king 
 of Assyria and his numerous army. Their kings were forbidden to 
 multiply horses and chariots, and were told of the folly of trusting to 
 them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:7">Ps. xx. 7</A>);
 
 but they think themselves wiser than their Bible.

 2. Slighting the God of Israel: <I>They look not to the Holy One of
 Israel,</I> as if he were not worth taking notice of in this distress.
 They advise not with him, seek not his favour, nor are in any care to 
 make him their friend.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The gross absurdity and folly of this sin. 

 1. They neglected one whom, if they would not hope in him, they had
 reason to fear. They do not seek the Lord, nor make their application 
 to him, <I>yet he also is wise,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+31:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 They are solicitous to get the Egyptians into an alliance with them, 
 because they have the reputation of a politic people; and is not God 
 wise too? and would not infinite wisdom, engaged on their side, stand 
 them in more stead than all the policies of Egypt? They are at the
 pains of going down to Egypt, a tedious journey, when they might have 
 had better advice, and better help, by looking up to heaven, and would 
 not. But, if they will not court God's wisdom to act for them, they 
 shall find it act against them. He is wise, too wise for them to 
 outwit, and he will bring evil upon those who thus affront him. He
 will not call back his words as men do (because they are fickle and 
 foolish), but he <I>will arise against the house of the evil-doers,</I> 
 this cabal of them that go down to Egypt; God will appear to their 
 confusion, according to the word that he has spoken, and will oppose 
 the help they think to bring in from the workers of iniquity. Some 
 think the Egyptians made it one condition of their coming into an 
 alliance with him that they should worship the gods of Egypt, and they 
 consented to it, and therefore they are both called <I>evil-doers</I> 
 and <I>workers of iniquity.</I> 

 2. They trusted to those who were unable to help them and would soon 
 appear to be so,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+31:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Let them know that <I>the Egyptians,</I> whom they depend so much upon, 
 <I>are men and not God.</I> As it is good for men to <I>know themselves 
 to be but men</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:20">Ps. ix. 20</A>),

 so it is good for us to consider that those we love and trust to are
 but men. They therefore can do nothing without God, nothing against 
 him, nothing in comparison with him. They are men, and therefore fickle 
 and foolish, mutable and mortal, here to day and gone to morrow; they 
 are men, and therefore let us not make gods of them, by making them our 
 hope and confidence, and expecting that in them which is to be found in 
 God only; they are not God, they cannot do that for us which God can 
 do, and will, if we trust in him. Let us not then neglect him, to seek
 to them; let us not forsake the rock of ages for broken reeds, nor the 
 fountain of living waters for broken cisterns. The Egyptians indeed
 have horses that are very strong; but <I>they are flesh, and not 
 spirit,</I> and therefore, strong as they are, they may be wearied with 
 a long march, and become unserviceable, or be wounded and slain in 
 battle, and leave their riders to be ridden over. Every one knows this, 
 that the Egyptians are not God and their horses are not spirit; but 
 those that seek to them for help do not consider it, else they would 
 not put such confidence in them. Sinners may be convicted of folly by 
 the plainest and most self-evident truths, which they cannot deny, but 
 will not believe.

 3. They would certainly be ruined with the Egyptians they trusted in,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+31:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 <I>When the Lord</I> does but <I>stretch out his hand</I> how easily, 
 how effectually, will he make them ashamed of their confidence in 
 Egypt, and the Egyptians ashamed of the encouragement they gave them to 
 trust in them; for <I>he that helps and he that is helped shall fall 
 together,</I> and their mutual alliance shall prove their joint ruin.
 The Egyptians were shortly to be reckoned with, as appears by the 
 <I>burden of Egypt</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:1-25"><I>ch.</I> xix.</A>),

 and then those who fled to them for shelter and succour should fall
 with them; for there is no escaping the judgments of God. <I>Evil 
 pursues sinners,</I> and it is just with God to make that creature a 
 scourge to us which we make an idol of. 

 4. They took God's work out of his hands. They pretended a great deal
 of care to preserve Jerusalem, in advising to an alliance with Egypt; 
 and, when others would not fall in with their measures, they pleaded 
 self preservation, and went to Egypt themselves. Now the prophet here 
 tells them that Jerusalem should be preserved without aid from Egypt 
 and that those who tarried there should be safe when those who fled to 
 Egypt should be ruined. Jerusalem was under God's protection, and 
 therefore there was no occasion to put it under the protection of 
 Egypt. But a practical distrust of God's all-sufficiency is at the 
 bottom of all our sinful departures from him to the creature. The 
 prophet tells them he had it from God's own mouth: <I>Thus hath the 
 Lord spoken to me.</I> They might depend upon it, 

 (1.) That God would appear against Jerusalem's enemies with the 
 boldness of a <I>lion over his prey,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+31:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 When the lion comes out to seize his prey <I>a multitude of shepherds 
 come out against him;</I> for it becomes neighbours to help one another 
 when persons or goods are in danger. These shepherds dare not come near 
 the lion; all they can do is to make a <I>noise,</I> and with that they 
 think to frighten him off. But does he regard it? <I>No: he will not
 be afraid of their voice,</I> nor abase himself so far as to be in the 
 least moved by it either to quit his prey or to make any more haste 
 than otherwise he would do in seizing it. <I>Thus will the Lord of 
 hosts come down to fight for Mount Zion,</I> with such an unshaken 
 undaunted resolution not to be moved by any opposition; and he will as 
 easily and irresistibly destroy the Assyrian army as a lion tears a 
 lamb in pieces. Whoever appear against God, they are but like a 
 multitude of poor simple shepherds shouting at a lion, who scorns to 
 take notice of them or so much as to alter his pace for them. Surely
 those that have such a protector need not go to Egypt for help. 

 (2.) That God would appear for Jerusalem's friends with the tenderness 
 of a bird over her young,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+31:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 God was ready to <I>gather Jerusalem, as a hen gathers her brood under 
 her wings</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:37">Matt. xxiii. 37</A>);

 but those that trusted to the Egyptians would not be gathered. <I>As
 birds flying</I> to their nests with all possible speed, when they see 
 them attacked, and fluttering about their nests with all possible 
 concern, hovering over their young ones to protect them and drive away 
 the assailants, with such compassion and affection <I>will the Lord of 
 hosts defend Jerusalem.</I> As an eagle stirs up her young when they 
 are in danger, <I>takes them and bears them on her wings,</I> so the 
 Lord led Israel out of Egypt

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:11,12">Deut. xxxii. 11, 12</A>);

 and he has now the same tender concern for them that he had then, so
 that they need not flee into Egypt again for shelter. <I>Defending, he 
 will deliver it;</I> he will so defend it as to secure the continuance 
 of its safety, not defend it for a while and abandon it at last, but 
 defend it so that it shall not fall into the enemies' hand. <I>I will
 defend this city to save it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:35"><I>ch.</I> xxxvii. 35</A>.

 <I>Passing over he will preserve it;</I> the word for passing over is
 used in this sense only here and 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:12,23,27">Exod. xii. 12, 23, 27</A>,

 concerning the destroying angel's passing over the houses of the
 Israelites when he slew all the first-born of the Egyptians, to which 
 story this passage refers. The Assyrian army was to be routed by a 
 destroying angel, who should pass over Jerusalem, though that deserved 
 to be destroyed, and draw his sword only against the besiegers. They 
 shall be slain by the pestilence, but none of the besieged shall take 
 the infection. Thus he will again pass over the houses of his people 
 and secure them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  Turn ye unto <I>him from</I> whom the children of Israel have
 deeply revolted.
 &nbsp; 7  For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of
 silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made
 unto you <I>for</I> a sin.
 &nbsp; 8  Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty
 man; and the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but he
 shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be
 discomfited.
 &nbsp; 9  And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his
 princes shall be afraid of the ensign, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, whose fire
 <I>is</I> in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This explains the foregoing promise of the deliverance of Jerusalem; 
 she shall be fitted for deliverance, and then it shall be wrought for 
 her; for in that method God delivers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Jerusalem shall be reformed, and so she shall be delivered from her 
 enemies within her walls, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+31:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.
 
 Here is, 

 1. A gracious call to repentance. This was the Lord's voice crying in 
 the city, the voice of the rod, the voice of the sword, and the voice 
 of the prophets interpreting the judgment: "<I>Turn you,</I> O turn you 
 now, from your evil ways, <I>unto God,</I> return to your allegiance to 
 him <I>from whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted,</I> from 
 whom you, <I>O children of Israel!</I> have revolted." He reminds them 
 of their birth and parentage, that they were <I>children of Israel,</I> 
 and therefore under the highest obligations imaginable to the God of 
 Israel, as an aggravation of their revolt from him and as an 
 encouragement to them to return to him. "They have been backsliding 
 children, yet children; therefore let them return, and their 
 backslidings shall be healed. They have deeply revolted, with great 
 address as they supposed (<I>the revolters are profound,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:2">Hos. v. 2</A>);
 
 but the issue will prove that they have revolted dangerously. The stain
 of their sins has gone deeply into their nature, not to be easily got 
 out, like the blackness of the Ethiopian. <I>They have deeply corrupted 
 themselves</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:9">Hos. ix. 9</A>);

 they have sunk deep into misery, and cannot easily recover themselves;
 therefore you have need to hasten your return to God."

 2. A gracious promise of the good success of this call

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+31:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>In that day every man shall cast away his idols,</I> in obedience to 
 Hezekiah's orders, which, till they were alarmed by the Assyrian 
 invasion, many refused to do. That is a happy fright which frightens us 
 from our sins. 

 (1.) It shall be a general reformation: every man shall cast away his 
 own idols, shall begin with them before he undertakes to demolish other 
 people's idols, which there will be no need of when every man reforms 
 himself. 

 (2.) It shall be a thorough reformation; for they shall part with their 
 idolatry, their beloved sin, with their <I>idols of silver and 
 gold,</I> their idols that they are most fond of. Many make an idol of 
 their silver and gold, and by the love of that idol are drawn to revolt 
 from God; but those that turn to God cast that away out of their hearts 
 and will be ready to part with it when God calls.

 (3.) It shall be a reformation upon a right principle, a principle of 
 piety, not of politics. They shall cast away their idols, because they 
 have been unto them <I>for a sin,</I> an occasion of sin; therefore 
 they will have nothing to do with them, though they had been the work 
 of their <I>own hands,</I> and upon that account they had a particular 
 fondness for them. Sin is the work of our own hands, but in working it 
 we have been working our own ruin, and therefore we must cast it away; 
 and those are strangely wedded to it who will not be prevailed upon to 
 cast it away when they see that otherwise they themselves will be 
 castaways. Some make this to be only a prediction that those who trust 
 in idols, when they find they stand them in no stead, will cast them 
 away in indignation. But it agrees so exactly with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:22"><I>ch.</I> xxx. 22</A>

 that I rather take it as a promise of a sincere reformation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Jerusalem's besiegers shall be routed, and so she shall be 
 delivered from the enemies about her walls. The former makes way for 
 this. If a people return to God, they may leave it to him to plead 
 their cause against their enemies. When they have cast away their 
 idols, <I>then shall the Assyrian fall,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+31:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 1. The army of the Assyrians shall be laid dead upon the spot <I>by the 
 sword, not of a mighty man, nor of a mean man,</I> not of any man at 
 all, either Israelite or Egyptian, not forcibly by the sword of a 
 mighty man nor surreptitiously by the sword of a mean man, but by the 
 sword of an angel, who strikes more strongly than a mighty man and yet 
 more secretly than a mean man, by the sword of the Lord, and his power 
 and wrath in the hand of the angel. Thus the young men of the army 
 shall melt, and be discomfited, and become tributaries to death. When 
 God has work to do against the enemies of his church we expect it must 
 be done by mighty men and mean men, officers and common soldiers; 
 whereas God can, if he please, do it without either. <I>He</I> needs 
 not armies of men who has legions of angels at command, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:53">Matt. xxvi. 53</A>.

 2. The king of Assyria shall flee for the same, shall flee from that
 invisible sword, hoping to get out of the reach of it; and he shall 
 make the best of his way to his own dominions, shall pass over to some 
 strong-hold of his own, for fear lest the Jews should pursue him now 
 that his army was routed. Sennacherib had been very confident that he 
 should make himself master of Jerusalem, and in the most insolent 
 manner had set both God and Hezekiah at defiance; yet now he is made to 
 tremble for fear of both. God can strike a terror into the proudest of 
 men, and make the stoutest heart to tremble. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:11,20:24">Job xviii. 11; xx. 24</A>.
 
 <I>His princes</I> that accompany him <I>shall be afraid of the
 ensign,</I> shall be in a continual fright at the remembrance of the 
 ensign in the air, which perhaps the destroying angel displayed before 
 he gave the fatal bow. Or they shall be afraid of every ensign they 
 see, suspecting it is a party of the Jews pursuing them. The banner 
 that God displays for the encouragement of his people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+60:4">Ps. lx. 4</A>)

 will be a terror to his and their enemies. Thus he <I>cuts off the
 spirit of princes and is terrible to the kings of the earth.</I> But 
 who will do this? It is <I>the Lord, whose fire is in Zion and his 
 furnace in Jerusalem.</I>

 (1.) Whose residence is there, and who there keeps house, as a man does 
 where his fire and his oven are. It is the city of the great King, and 
 let not the Assyrians think to turn him out of the possession of his 
 own house. 

 (2.) Who is there a consuming fire to all his enemies and will make 
 them as a fiery oven in the day of his wrath, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:9">Ps. xxi. 9</A>.

 He is himself <I>a wall of fire round about Jerusalem,</I> so that
 whoever assaults her does so at his peril,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:5,Re+11:5">Zech. ii. 5; Rev. xi. 5</A>.

 (3.) Who has his altar there, on which the holy fire is continually 
 kept burning and sacrifices are daily offered to his honour, and with 
 which he is well pleased; and therefore he will defend this city, 
 especially having an eye to the great sacrifice which was there also to 
 be offered, of which all the sacrifices were types. If we keep up the 
 fire of holy love and devotion in our hearts and houses, we may depend 
 upon God to be a protection to us and them.</P>
