 In this chapter we have, 

 I. A general declaration of God's ways in dealing with nations and
 kingdoms, that he can easily do what he will with them, as easily as
 the potter can with the clay 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>),

 but that he certainly will do what is just and fair with them. If he
 threaten their ruin, yet upon their repentance he will return in mercy
 to them, and, when he is coming towards them in mercy, nothing but
 their sin will stop the progress of his favours,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:7-10">ver. 7-10</A>.

 II. A particular demonstration of the folly of the men of Judah and
 Jerusalem in departing from their God to idols, and so bringing ruin 
 upon themselves notwithstanding the fair warnings given them and God's 
 kind intentions towards them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:11-17">ver. 11-17</A>.

 III. The prophet's complaint to God of the base ingratitude and
 unreasonable malice of his enemies, persecutors, and slanderers, and 
 his prayers against them,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The word which came to Jeremiah from the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will
 cause thee to hear my words.
 &nbsp; 3  Then I went down to the potter's house, and, behold, he
 wrought a work on the wheels.
 &nbsp; 4  And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of
 the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to
 the potter to make <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 5  Then the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came to me, saying,
 &nbsp; 6  O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>. Behold, as the clay <I>is</I> in the potter's hand, so <I>are</I>
 ye in mine hand, O house of Israel.
 &nbsp; 7  <I>At what</I> instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and
 concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to
 destroy <I>it;</I>
 &nbsp; 8  If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from
 their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto
 them.
 &nbsp; 9  And <I>at what</I> instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and
 concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant <I>it;</I>
 &nbsp; 10  If it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I
 will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet is here sent to <I>the potter's house</I> (he knew where to 
 find it), not to preach a sermon as before to the gates of Jerusalem, 
 but to prepare a sermon, or rather to receive it ready prepared. Those 
 needed not to study their sermons that had them, as he had this, by 
 immediate inspiration. "<I>Go to the potter's house,</I> and observe 
 how he manages his work, and there <I>I will cause thee,</I> by silent 
 whispers, <I>to hear my words.</I> There thou shalt receive a message, 
 to be delivered to the people." Note, Those that would know God's mind 
 must observe his appointments, and attend where they may hear his 
 words. The prophet was never <I>disobedient to the heavenly vision,</I> 
 and therefore went to the potter's house 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 and took notice how he <I>wrought his work upon the wheels,</I> just as 
 he pleased, with a great deal of ease, and in a little time. And 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)
 
 when a lump of clay that he designed to form into one shape either 
 proved too stiff, or had a stone in it, or some way or other came to be 
 <I>marred in his hand,</I> he presently turned it into another shape; 
 if it will not serve for a vessel of honour, it will serve for a vessel 
 of dishonour, just <I>as seems good to the potter.</I> It is probable 
 that Jeremiah knew well enough how the potter wrought his work, and how 
 easily he threw it into what form he pleased; but he must go and 
 observe it <I>now,</I> that, having the idea of it fresh in his mind, 
 he might the more readily and distinctly apprehend that truth which God 
 designed thereby to represent to him, and might the more intelligently 
 explain it to the people. God <I>used similitudes by his servants the 
 prophets</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:10">Hos. xii. 10</A>),

 and it was requisite that they should themselves understand the
 similitudes they used. Ministers will make a good use of their
 converse with the business and affairs of this life if they learn 
 thereby to speak more plainly and familiarly to people about the things 
 of God, and to expound scripture comparisons. For they ought to make 
 all their knowledge some way or other serviceable to their 
 profession.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now let us see what the message is which Jeremiah receives, and is 
 entrusted with the delivery of, at the potter's house. While he looks 
 carefully upon the potter's work, God darts into his mind these two 
 great truths, which he must preach to <I>the house of Israel:</I>--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That God has both an incontestable authority and an irresistible 
 ability to form and fashion kingdoms and nations as he pleases, so as 
 to serve his own purposes: "<I>Cannot I do with you as this potter, 
 saith the Lord?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Have not I as absolute a power over you in respect both of might and of 
 right?" Nay, God has a clearer title to a dominion over us than the 
 potter has over the clay; for the potter only gives it its form, 
 whereas we have both matter and form from God. <I>As the clay is in the 
 potter's hand</I> to be moulded and shaped as he pleases, <I>so are you 
 in my hand.</I> This intimates, 

 1. That God has an incontestable sovereignty over us, is not debtor to
 us, may dispose of us as he thinks fit, and is not accountable to us, 
 and that it would be as absurd for us to dispute this as for the clay 
 to quarrel with the potter. 

 2. That it is a very easy thing with God to make what use he pleases of 
 us and what changes he pleases with us, and that we cannot resist him. 
 One turn of the hand, one turn of the wheel, quite alters the shape of 
 the clay, makes it a vessel, unmakes it, new-makes it. Thus are our
 times in God's hand, and not in our own, and it is in vain for us to 
 strive with him. It is spoken here of nations; the most politic, the 
 most potent, are what God is pleased to make them, and no other. See 
 this explained by Job

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:23"><I>ch.</I> xii. 23</A>),

 <I>He increaseth the nations and destroyeth them; he enlargeth the
 nations and straiteneth them again.</I> See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:33">Ps. cvii. 33</A>,
 
 &c., and compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:29">Job xxxiv. 29</A>.

 <I>All nations before God are as the drop of the bucket,</I> soon wiped
 away, <I>or the small dust of the balance,</I> soon blown away 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:15">Isa. xl. 15</A>),

 and therefore, no doubt, as easily managed as the clay by the potter.

 3. That God will not be a loser by any in his glory, at long run, but,
 if he be not glorified by them, he will be glorified upon them. If the 
 potter's vessel be marred for one use, it shall serve for another; 
 those that will not be monuments of mercy shall be monuments of 
 justice. <I>The Lord has made all things for himself, yea, even the 
 wicked for the day of evil,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+16:4">Prov. xvi. 4</A>.

 God formed us out of the clay

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:6">Job xxxiii. 6</A>),

 nay, and we are still as clay in his hands 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:8">Isa. lxiv. 8</A>);

 and has not he the same power over us that the potter has over the
 clay?

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:21">Rom. ix. 21</A>),
 
 and are not we bound to submit, as the clay to the potter's wisdom and
 will? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:15,16,45:9">Isa. xxix. 15, 16; xlv. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That, in the exercise of this authority and ability, he always goes 
 by fixed rules of equity and goodness. He dispenses favours indeed in a 
 way of sovereignty, but never punishes by arbitrary power. <I>High is 
 his right hand,</I> yet he rules not with a <I>high hand,</I> but, as 
 it follows there, <I>Justice and judgment are the habitation of his 
 throne,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:13,14">Ps. lxxxix. 13, 14</A>.

 God asserts his despotic power, and tells us what he might do, but at
 the same time assures us that he will act as a righteous and merciful 
 Judge.

 1. When God is coming against us in ways of judgment we may be sure
 that it is for our sins, which shall appear by this, that national 
 repentance will stop the progress of the judgments

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>):

 <I>If God speak concerning a nation to pluck up</I> its fences that 
 secure it, and so lay it open, its fruit-trees that adorn and enrich 
 it, and so leave it desolate--to pull down its fortifications, that the 
 enemy may have liberty to enter in, its habitations, that the 
 inhabitants may be under a necessity of going out, and so <I>destroy 
 it</I> as either a vineyard or a city is destroyed--in this case, if 
 <I>that nation</I> take the alarm, repent of their sins and reform 
 their lives, turn every one from his evil way and return to God, God 
 will graciously accept them, will not proceed in his controversy, will 
 return in mercy to them, and, though he cannot change his mind, he will 
 change his way, so that it may be said, He <I>repents him of the evil 
 he said he would do to them.</I> Thus often in the time of the Judges, 
 when the oppressed people were penitent people, still God raised them 
 up saviours; and, when they turned to God, their affairs immediately 
 took a new turn. It was Nineveh's case, and we wish it had oftener been 
 Jerusalem's; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+7:14">2 Chron. vii. 14</A>.

 It is an undoubted truth that a sincere conversion from the evil of sin
 will be an effectual prevention of the evil of punishment; and God can 
 as easily raise up a penitent people from their ruins as the potter can 
 make anew the vessel of clay when it was <I>marred in his hand.</I>

 2. When God is coming towards us in ways of mercy, if any stop be given 
 to the progress of that mercy, it is nothing but sin that gives it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>):

 <I>If God speak concerning a nation to build and to plant it,</I> to 
 advance and establish all the true interests of it, it is <I>his 
 husbandly</I> and <I>his building</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:9">1 Cor. iii. 9</A>),

 and, if he speak in favour of it, it is done, it is increased, it is
 enriched, it is enlarged, its trade flourishes, its government is 
 settled in good hands, and all its affairs prosper and its enterprises 
 succeed. But if this nation, which God is thus loading with benefits,
 <I>do evil in his sight</I> and <I>obey not his voice,</I>--if it lose 
 its virtue, and become debauched and profane,--if religion grow into 
 contempt, and vice to get to be fashionable, and so be kept in 
 countenance and reputation, and there be a general decay of serious 
 godliness among them,--then God will turn his hand against them, will 
 pluck up what he was planting, and pull down what he was building

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+45:4"><I>ch.</I> xlv. 4</A>);

 the good work that was in the doing shall stand still and be let fall,
 and what favours were further designed shall be withheld; and this is 
 called his <I>repenting of the good wherewith he said he would benefit 
 them,</I> as he changed his purpose concerning Eli's house 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:30">1 Sam. ii. 30</A>)
 
 and hurried Israel back into the wilderness when he had brought them
 within sight of Canaan. Note, Sin is the great mischief-maker between
 God and a people; it forfeits the benefit of his promises and spoils 
 the success of their prayers. It defeats his kind intentions concerning 
 them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:1">Hos. vii. 1</A>)

 and baffles their pleasing expectations from him. It ruins their
 comforts, prolongs their grievances, brings them into straits, and 
 retards their deliverances,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the
 inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Behold, I
 frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: return
 ye now every one from his evil way, and make your ways and your
 doings good.
 &nbsp; 12  And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our
 own devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil
 heart.
 &nbsp; 13  Therefore thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Ask ye now among the heathen,
 who hath heard such things: the virgin of Israel hath done a very
 horrible thing.
 &nbsp; 14  Will <I>a man</I> leave the snow of Lebanon <I>which cometh</I> from
 the rock of the field? <I>or</I> shall the cold flowing waters that
 come from another place be forsaken?
 &nbsp; 15  Because my people hath forgotten me, they have burned
 incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their
 ways <I>from</I> the ancient paths, to walk in paths, <I>in</I> a way not
 cast up;
 &nbsp; 16  To make their land desolate, <I>and</I> a perpetual hissing;
 every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and wag his
 head.
 &nbsp; 17  I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I
 will shew them the back, and not the face, in the day of their
 calamity.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These verses seem to be the application of the general truths laid down 
 in the foregoing part of the chapter to the nation of the Jews and 
 their present state.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God was now speaking concerning them <I>to pluck up,</I> and <I>to 
 pull down,</I> and <I>to destroy;</I> for it is that part of the rule 
 of judgment that their case agrees with 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 "<I>Go, and tell</I> them" (saith God), "<I>Behold I frame evil against 
 you and devise against you.</I> Providence in all its operations is 
 plainly working towards your ruin. Look upon your conduct towards God, 
 and you cannot but see that you deserve it; look upon his dealings with 
 you, and you cannot but see that he designs it." He frames evil, as the 
 potter frames the vessel, so as to answer the end.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He invites them by repentance and reformation to meet him in the 
 way of his judgments and so to prevent his further proceedings against 
 them: "<I>Return you now every one from his evil ways,</I> that so 
 (according to the rule before laid down) God may turn from the evil he 
 had purported to do unto you, and that providence which seemed to be 
 framed like a vessel on the wheel against you shall immediately be 
 thrown into a new shape, and the issue shall be in favour of you." 
 Note, The warnings of God's word, and the threatenings of his 
 providence, should be improved by us as strong inducements to us to 
 reform our lives, in which it is not enough to <I>turn from our evil 
 ways,</I> but we must <I>make our ways and our doings good,</I> 
 conformable to the rule, to the law.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He foresees their obstinacy, and their perverse refusal to comply 
 with this invitation, though it tended so much to their own benefit 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>They said, "There is no hope.</I> If we must not be delivered unless 
 we return from our evil ways, we may even despair of ever being 
 delivered, for we are resolved that <I>we will walk after our own 
 devices.</I> It is to no purpose for the prophets to say any more to 
 us, to use any more arguments, or to press the matter any further; we 
 will have our way, whatever it cost us; <I>we will do every one the 
 imagination of his</I> own <I>evil heart,</I> and will not be under the 
 restraint of the divine law." Note, That which ruins sinners is 
 affecting to live as they list. They call it liberty to live at large; 
 whereas for a man to be a slave to his lusts is the worst of slaveries.
 See how strangely some men's hearts are hardened by the deceitfulness 
 of sin that they will not so much as promise amendment; nay, they set 
 the judgments of God at defiance: "We will go on with <I>our own 
 devices,</I> and let God go on with his; and we will venture the 
 issue."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He upbraids them with the monstrous folly of their obstinacy, and 
 their hating to be reformed. Surely never were people guilty of such an 
 absurdity, never any that pretended to reason acted so unreasonably 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Ask you among the heathen,</I> even those that had not the benefit 
 of divine revelation, no oracles, no prophets, as Judah and Jerusalem 
 had, yet, even among them, <I>who hath heart such a thing?</I> The 
 Ninevites, when thus warned, turned from their evil ways. Some of the 
 worst of men, when they are told of their faults, especially when they 
 begin to smart for them, will at least promise reformation and say that 
 they will endeavour to mend. But <I>the virgin of Israel</I> bids 
 defiance to repentance, is resolved to go on frowardly, whatever 
 conscience and Providence say to the contrary, and thus <I>has done a 
 horrible thing.</I> She should have preserved herself pure and chaste 
 for God, who had espoused her to himself; but she has alienated herself 
 from him, and refuses to return to him. Note, It is <I>a horrible 
 thing,</I> enough to make one tremble to think of it, that those who 
 have made their condition sad by sinning should make it desperate by 
 refusing to reform. Wilful impenitence is the grossest self-murder; and 
 that is <I>a horrible thing,</I> which we should abhor the thought 
 of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He shows their folly in two things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In the nature of the sin itself that they were guilty of. They 
 forsook God for idols, which was the most horrible thing that could be, 
 for they put a most dangerous cheat upon themselves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>):
 
 <I>Will a</I> thirsty traveller <I>leave the snow,</I> which, being 
 melted, runs down from the mountains <I>of Lebanon,</I> and, passing 
 over <I>the rock of the field,</I> flows in clear, clean, crystal 
 streams? Will he leave these, pass these by, and think to better 
 himself with some dirty puddle-water? <I>Or shall the cold flowing 
 waters that come from any other place be forsaken</I> in the heat of 
 summer? No; when men are parched with heat and drought, and meet with 
 cooling refreshing streams, they will make use of them, and not turn 
 their backs upon them. The margin reads it, "<I>Will a man</I> that is 
 travelling the road <I>leave my fields,</I> which are plain and level, 
 <I>for a rock,</I> which is rough and hard, <I>or for the snow of 
 Lebanon,</I> which, lying in great drifts, makes the road impassable? 
 <I>Or shall the running waters be forsaken for the strange cold 
 waters?</I> No; in these things men know when they are well off, and 
 will keep so; they will not leave a certainty for an uncertainty. But 
 <I>my people have forgotten me</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 have quitted <I>a fountain of living waters for broken cisterns. They 
 have burnt incense to</I> idols, that are as vain as <I>vanity</I> 
 itself, that are not what they pretend to be nor can perform what is 
 expected from them." They had not the common wit of travellers, but 
 even their leaders caused them to err, and they were content to be 
 misled. 

 (1.) They left <I>the ancient paths,</I> which were appointed by the 
 divine law, which had been walked in by all the saints, which were 
 therefore the right way to their journey's end, a safe way, and, being 
 well-tracked, were both easy to hit and easy to walk in. But, when they 
 were advised to keep to the good old way, they positively said that 
 they would not,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:16"><I>ch.</I> vi. 16</A>.
 
 (2.) They chose by-paths; they walked <I>in a way not cast up,</I> not
 in the highway, the King's highway, in which they might travel safely, 
 and which would certainly lead them to their right end, but in a dirty 
 way, a rough way, a way in which they could not but <I>stumble;</I> 
 such was the way of idolatry (such is the way of all iniquity--it is a
 false way, it is a way full of stumbling-blocks) and yet this way they 
 chose to walk in and lead others in.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In the mischievous consequences of it. Though the thing itself were 
 bad, they might have had some excuse for it if they could have promised 
 themselves any good out of it. But the direct tendency of it was <I>to 
 make their land desolate, and,</I> consequently, themselves miserable 
 (for so the inhabitants must needs be if their country be laid waste), 
 and both themselves and their land <I>a perpetual hissing.</I> Those 
 deserve to be hissed that have fair warning given them and will not 
 take it. <I>Every one that passes by</I> their land shall make his
 remarks upon it, and <I>shall be astonished, and way his head,</I> some 
 wondering, others commiserating, others triumphing in the desolations 
 of a country that had been <I>the glory of all lands.</I> They shall 
 wag their heads in derision, upbraiding them with their folly in 
 forsaking God and their duty, and so pulling this misery upon their own 
 heads. Note, Those that revolt from God will justly be made the scorn 
 of all about them, and, having reproached the Lord, will themselves be 
 a reproach. <I>Their land</I> being made <I>desolate,</I> in pursuance 
 of their destruction, it is threatened 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 <I>I will scatter them as with an east wind,</I> which is fierce and 
 violent; by it they shall be hurried to and fro <I>before the 
 enemy,</I> and find no way open to escape. They shall not only flee 
 before the enemy (that they might do and yet make an orderly retreat), 
 but they shall be scattered, some one way and some another. That which 
 completes their misery is, <I>I will show them the back, and not the 
 face, in the day of their calamity.</I> Our calamities may be easily 
 borne if God look towards us, and smile upon us, when we are under 
 them, if he countenance us and show us favour; but if he turn <I>the 
 back</I> upon us, if he show himself displeased, if he be deaf to our 
 prayers and refuse us his help, if he forsake us, leave us to 
 ourselves, and stand at a distance from us, we are quite undone. <I>If 
 he hide his face, who then can behold him?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:29">Job xxxiv. 29</A>.
 
 Herein God would deal with them as they had dealt with him
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:27"><I>ch.</I> ii. 27</A>),

 <I>They have turned their back unto me, and not their face.</I> It is a
 righteous thing with God to show himself strange to those in the day of 
 their trouble who have shown themselves rude and undutiful to him in 
 their prosperity. This will have its full accomplishment in that day 
 when God will say to those who, though they have been professors of 
 piety, were yet workers of iniquity, <I>Depart from me, I know you 
 not,</I> nay, <I>I never knew you.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against
 Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor
 counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and
 let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any
 of his words.
 &nbsp; 19  Give heed to me, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and hearken to the voice of them
 that contend with me.
 &nbsp; 20  Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a
 pit for my soul. Remember that I stood before thee to speak good
 for them, <I>and</I> to turn away thy wrath from them.
 &nbsp; 21  Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour
 out their <I>blood</I> by the force of the sword; and let their wives
 be bereaved of their children, and <I>be</I> widows; and let their men
 be put to death; <I>let</I> their young men <I>be</I> slain by the sword in
 battle.
 &nbsp; 22  Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring
 a troop suddenly upon them: for they have digged a pit to take
 me, and hid snares for my feet.
 &nbsp; 23  Yet, L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay
 <I>me:</I> forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from
 thy sight, but let them be overthrown before thee; deal <I>thus</I>
 with them in the time of thine anger.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet here, as sometimes before, brings in his own affairs, but 
 very much for instruction to us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. See here what are the common methods of the persecutors. We may see 
 this in Jeremiah's enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They laid their heads together to consult what they should do 
 against him, both to be revenged on him for what he had said and to 
 stop his mouth for the future: <I>They said, Come and let us devise 
 devices against Jeremiah.</I> The enemies of God's people and ministers 
 have been often very crafty themselves, and confederate with one 
 another, to do them mischief. What they cannot act to the prejudice of 
 religion separately they will try to do in concert. <I>The wicked plots 
 against the just.</I> Caiaphas, and the chief priests and elders, did 
 so against our blessed Saviour himself. The opposition which the gates 
 of hell give to the kingdom of heaven is carried on with a great deal 
 of cursed policy. God had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 <I>I devise a device against you;</I> and now, as if they resolved to 
 be quits with him and to outwit Infinite Wisdom itself, they resolve to 
 <I>devise devices against</I> God's prophet, not only against his 
 person, but against the word he delivered to them, which they thought 
 by their subtle management to defeat. O the prodigious madness of those 
 that hope to disannul God's counsel!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Herein they pretended a mighty zeal for the church, which, they 
 suggested, was in danger if Jeremiah was tolerated to preach as he did: 
 "<I>Come,</I>" say they, "let us silence and crush him, <I>for the law 
 shall not perish from the priest; the law of truth is in their 
 mouths</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:6">Mal. ii. 6</A>)

 and there we will seek it; the administration of ordinances according
 to the law is in their hands, and neither the one nor the other shall 
 be wrested from them. <I>Counsel shall not perish from the wise;</I> 
 the administration of public affairs shall always be lodged with the 
 privy-counsellors and ministers of state, to whom it belongs; 
 <I>nor</I> shall <I>the word</I> perish <I>from the prophets</I>" 
 --they mean those of their own choosing, who prophesied to them smooth 
 things, and flattered them with visions of peace. Two things they 
 insinuated:--

 (1.) That Jeremiah could not be himself a true prophet, but was a 
 pretender and a usurper, because he neither was commissioned by the 
 priests, nor concurred with the other prophets, whose authority 
 therefore will be despised if he be suffered to go on. "If Jeremiah be
 regarded as an oracle, farewell the reputation of our priests, our wise 
 men, and prophets; but <I>that</I> must be supported, which is reason 
 enough why he must be suppressed." 

 (2.) That the matter of his prophecies could not be from God, because 
 it reflected sometimes upon the prophets and priests; he had charged 
 them with being the ringleaders of all the mischief

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:31"><I>ch.</I> v. 31</A>)
 
 and deceiving the people
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:14"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 14</A>);

 he had foretold that their <I>heart should perish,</I> and <I>be
 astonished</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:9"><I>ch.</I> iv. 9</A>),

 that <I>the wise men should be dismayed</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:9,10"><I>ch.</I> viii. 9, 10</A>),

 that the priests and prophets should be intoxicated,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:13"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 13</A>.

 Now this galled them more than any thing else. Presuming upon the
 promise of God's presence with their priests and prophets, they could 
 not believe that he would ever leave them. The guides of the church 
 must needs be infallible, and therefore he who foretold their being 
 infatuated must be condemned as a false prophet. Thus, under colour of
 zeal for the church, have its best friends been run down.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They agreed to do all they could to blast his reputation: "<I>Come, 
 let us smite him with the tongue,</I> put him into an ill name, fasten 
 a bad character upon him, represent him to some as despicable and fit 
 to be prosecuted, to all as odious and not fit to be tolerated." This 
 was their device, <I>fortiter calumniari, aliquid adh&aelig;rebit--to
 throw the vilest calumnies at him, in hopes that some would adhere to 
 him.</I> to dress him up in bearskins, otherwise they could not bait 
 him. Those who projected this, it is likely, were men of figure, whose 
 tongue was no small slander, whose representations, though ever so 
 false, would be credited both by princes and people, to make him 
 obnoxious to the justice of the one and the fury of the other. The 
 scourge of such tongues will give not only smart lashes, but deep 
 wounds; it is a great mercy therefore to be <I>hidden from it,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:21">Job v. 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. To set others an example, they resolved that they would not 
 themselves regard any thing he said, though it appeared ever so weighty 
 and ever so well confirmed as a message from God: <I>Let us not give 
 heed to any of his words;</I> for, right or wrong, they will look upon 
 them to be <I>his words,</I> and not the words of God. What good can be 
 done with those who hear the word of God with a resolution not to heed 
 it or believe it? Nay,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. That they may effectually silence him, they resolve to be the death 
 of him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>All their counsel against me</I> is <I>to slay me.</I> They <I>hunt 
 for the precious life;</I> and a precious life indeed it was that they 
 hunted for. Long was this Jerusalem's wretched character, <I>Thou that 
 killedst</I> many of <I>the prophets,</I> and wouldst have killed them 
 all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. See here what is the common relief of the persecuted. This we may 
 see in the course that Jeremiah took when he met with this hard usage. 
 He immediately applied to his God by prayer, and so gave himself 
 ease.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He referred himself and his cause to God's cognizance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 They would not regard a word he said, would not admit his complaints, 
 nor take any notice of his grievances; but, <I>Lord</I> (says he), 
 <I>do thou give heed to me.</I> It is matter of comfort to faithful 
 ministers that, if men will not give heed to their praying. He appeals 
 to God as an impartial Judge, that will hear both sides, as every judge 
 ought to do. "Do not only <I>give heed to me,</I> but <I>hearken to the 
 voice of those that contend with me;</I> hear what they have to say 
 against me and for themselves, and then make it to appear that thou 
 <I>sittest in the throne, judging right.</I> Hear the voice of my 
 contenders, how noisy and clamorous they are, how false and malicious 
 all they say is, and let them be <I>judged out of their own mouth; 
 cause their own tongues to fall upon them.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He complains of their base ingratitude to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 "<I>Shall evil be recompensed for good,</I> and shall it go unpunished? 
 Wilt not thou recompense me good for that evil?" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:12">2 Sam. xvi. 12</A>.

 To render good for good is human, evil for evil is brutish, good for
 evil is Christian, but evil for good is devilish; it is so very absurd 
 and wicked a thing that we cannot think but God will avenge it. See how 
 great the evil was that they did against him: <I>They have dug a pit 
 for my soul;</I> they aimed to take away his life (no less would 
 satisfy them), and that not in a generous way, by an open assault, 
 against which he might have an opportunity of defending himself, but in 
 a base, cowardly, clandestine way: <I>they dug pits for</I> him, which 
 there was no fence against, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:85">Ps. cxix. 85</A>.

 But see how great the good was which he had done for them: <I>Remember
 that I stood before thee to speak good for them;</I> he had been an 
 intercessor with God for them, had used his interest in heaven on their 
 behalf, which was the greatest kindness they could expect from one of 
 his character. <I>He is a prophet and he shall pray for thee,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:7">Gen. xx. 7</A>.

 Moses often did this for Israel, and yet they quarrelled with him, and
 sometimes <I>spoke of stoning him.</I> He did them this kindness when 
 they were in imminent danger of destruction and most needed it. They 
 had themselves provoked God's wrath against them, and it was ready to 
 break in upon them, but he stood in the gap (as Moses,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:23">Ps. cvi. 23</A>)

 <I>and turned away</I> that <I>wrath.</I> Now,

 (1.) This was very base in them. Call a man ungrateful and you can call 
 him no worse. But it was not strange that those who had forgotten their 
 God did not know their best friends. 

 (2.) It was very grievous to him, as the like was to David.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:13,109:4">Ps. xxxv. 13; cix. 4</A>,

 <I>For my love they are my adversaries.</I> Thus disingenuously do
 sinners deal with the great intercessor, crucifying him afresh, and 
 speaking against him on earth, while his blood is speaking for them in 
 heaven. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:32">John x. 32</A>.
 
 But,

 (3.) It was a comfort to the prophet that, when they were so spiteful 
 against him, he had the testimony of his conscience for him that he had 
 done his duty to them; and the same will be our rejoicing in such a day 
 of evil. <I>The blood-thirsty hate the upright, but the just seek his 
 soul,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+29:10">Prov. xxix. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He imprecates the judgments of God upon them, not from a revengeful 
 disposition, but in a prophetical indignation against their horrid 
 wickedness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:21-23"><I>v.</I> 21-23</A>.
 
 He prays, 

 (1.) That their families might be starved for want of bread: 
 "<I>Deliver up the children to the famine,</I> to the famine in the 
 country for want of rain, and that in the city through the straitness 
 of the siege. Thus let this iniquity of the fathers be visited upon the 
 children." 

 (2.) That they might be cut off <I>by the sword</I> of war, which, 
 whatever it was in the enemy's hand, would be, in God's hand, a sword 
 of justice: "<I>Pour them out</I> (so the word is) <I>by the hands of 
 the sword;</I> let <I>their blood</I> be shed as profusely as water, 
 that <I>their wives</I> may be left childless <I>and widows,</I> their 
 husbands being taken away by <I>death</I>" (some think that the prophet 
 refers to <I>pestilence</I>); <I>let their young men,</I> that are the 
 strength of this generation and the hope of the next, <I>be slain by 
 the sword in battle.</I> 

 (3.) That the terrors and desolations of war might seize them suddenly 
 and by surprise, that thus their punishment might answer to their sin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 "<I>Let a cry be heard from their houses,</I> loud shrieks, <I>when 
 thou shalt bring a troop</I> of the Chaldeans <I>suddenly upon 
 them,</I> to seize them and all they have, to make them prisoners and 
 their estates a prey;" for thus they would have done by Jeremiah; they 
 aimed to ruin him at once ere he was aware: "<I>They have dug a pit</I> 
 for <I>me,</I> as for a wild beast, <I>and</I> have <I>hid snares 
 for</I> me, as for some ravenous noxious fowl." Note, Those that think 
 to ensnare others will justly be themselves ensnared in an evil time. 
 
 (4.) That they might be dealt with according to the desert of this sin,
 which was without excuse: "<I>Forgive not their iniquity, neither blot 
 out their sin from thy sight;</I> that is, let them not escape the just 
 punishment of it; let them lie under all the miseries of those whose 
 sins are unpardoned." 

 (5.) That God's wrath against them might be their ruin: <I>Let them be
 overthrown before thee.</I> This intimates that justice was in pursuit 
 of them, that they endeavoured to make their escape from it, but in 
 vain; "they shall be made to stumble in their flight, and being 
 overthrown they will certainly be overtaken." And then, Lord, <I>in the 
 time of thy anger,</I> do to them (he does not say what he would have 
 done to them, but) do to them as thou thinkest fit, as thou usest to do 
 with those whom thou art angry with--<I>deal thus with them.</I> Now 
 this is not written for our imitation. Jeremiah was a prophet, and by 
 the impulse of the spirit of prophecy, in the foresight of the ruin 
 certainly coming upon his persecutors, might pray such prayers as we 
 may not; and, if we think by this example to justify ourselves in such 
 imprecations, we <I>know not what manner of spirit we are of;</I> our 
 Master has taught us, by his precept and pattern, to <I>bless those 
 that curse us and pray for those that despitefully use us.</I> Yet it 
 is written for our instruction, and is of use to teach us,

 [1.] That those who have forfeited the benefit of the prayers of God's 
 prophets for them may justly expect to have their prayers against them.

 [2.] That persecution is a sin that fills the measure of a people's 
 iniquity very fast, and will bring as sure and sore a destruction upon 
 them as any thing.

 [3.] Those who will not be won upon by the kindness of God and his 
 prophets will certainly at length feel the just resentments of 
 both.</P>
