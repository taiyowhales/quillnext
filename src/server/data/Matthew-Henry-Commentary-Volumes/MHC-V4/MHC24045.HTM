 The prophecy we have in this chapter concerns Baruch only, yet is 
 intended for the support and encouragement of all the Lord's people 
 that serve him faithfully and keep closely to him in difficult trying 
 times. It is placed here after the story of the destruction of 
 Jerusalem and the dispersion of the Jews, but was delivered long 
 before, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, as was the prophecy in the 
 next chapter, and probably those that follow. We here find, 

 I. How Baruch was terrified when he was brought into trouble for
 writing and reading Jeremiah's roll, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+45:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. How his fears were checked with a reproof for his great
 expectations and silenced with a promise of special preservation, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+45:4,5">ver. 4, 5</A>.

 Though Baruch was only Jeremiah's scribe, yet this notice is taken of 
 his frights, and this provision made for his comfort; for God despises 
 not any of his servants, but graciously concerns himself for the 
 meanest and weakest, for Baruch the scribe as well as for Jeremiah the 
 prophet.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son
 of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the mouth
 of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah
 king of Judah, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the God of Israel, unto thee, O Baruch;
 &nbsp; 3  Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath added grief
 to my sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest.
 &nbsp; 4  Thus shalt thou say unto him, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> saith thus; Behold,
 <I>that</I> which I have built will I break down, and that which I
 have planted I will pluck up, even this whole land.
 &nbsp; 5  And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek <I>them</I> not:
 for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places
 whither thou goest.
 </FONT></P>

 How Baruch was employed in writing Jeremiah's prophecies, and reading 
 them, we had an account 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:1-32"><I>ch.</I> xxxvi.</A>,

 and how he was threatened for it by the king, warrants being out for
 him and he forced to abscond, and how narrowly he escaped under a 
 divine protection, to which story this chapter should have been 
 subjoined, but that, having reference to a private person, it is here 
 thrown into the latter end of the book, as St. Paul's epistle to 
 Philemon is put after his other epistles. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The consternation that poor Baruch was in when he was sought for by 
 the king's messengers and obliged to hide his head, and the notice 
 which God took of it. He cried out, <I>Woe is me now!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+45:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 He was a young man setting out in the world; he was well affected to
 the things of God, and was willing to serve God and his prophet; but, 
 when it came to suffering, he was desirous to be excused. Being an 
 ingenious man, and a scholar, he stood fair for preferment, and now to 
 be driven into a corner, and in danger of a prison, or worse, was a 
 great disappointment to him. When he read the roll publicly he hoped to 
 gain reputation by it, that it would make him to be taken notice of and 
 employed; but when he found that, instead of that, it exposed him to 
 contempt, and brought him into disgrace, he cried out, "I am undone; I 
 shall fall into the pursuers' hands, and be imprisoned, and put to 
 death, or banished: <I>The Lord has added grief to my sorrow,</I> has 
 loaded me with one trouble after another. After the grief of writing 
 and reading the prophecies of my country's ruin, I have the sorrow of 
 being treated as a criminal; for so doing; and, though another might 
 make nothing of this, yet for my part I cannot bear it; it is a burden 
 too heavy for me. <I>I fainted in my sighing</I> (or <I>I am faint with 
 my sighing;</I> it just kills me) <I>and I find no rest,</I> no 
 satisfaction in my own mind. I cannot compose myself as I should and 
 would to bear it, not have I any prospect of relief or comfort." Baruch 
 was a good man, but, we must say, this was his infirmity. Note, 

 1. Young beginners in religion, like fresh-water soldiers, are apt to
 be discouraged with the little difficulties which they commonly meet 
 with at first in the service of God. They do but <I>run with the 
 footmen,</I> and it <I>wearies them;</I> they <I>faint</I> upon the 
 very dawning of <I>the day of adversity,</I> and it is an evidence that 
 <I>their strength is small</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+24:10">Prov. xxiv. 10</A>),

 that their faith is weak, and that they are yet but babes, who cry for 
 every hurt and every fright. 

 2. Some of the best and dearest of God's saints and servants, when they
 have seen storms rising, have been in frights, and apt to make the 
 worst of things, and to disquiet themselves with melancholy 
 apprehensions more than there was cause for.

 3. God takes notice of the frets and discontents of his people and is
 displeased with them. Baruch should have rejoiced that he was counted
 worthy to suffer in such a good cause and with such good company, but, 
 instead of that, he is vexed at it, and blames his lot, nay, and 
 reflects upon his God, as if he had dealt hardly with him; what he said 
 was spoken in a heat and passion, but God was offended, as he was with 
 Moses, who paid dearly for it, when, his spirit being provoked, he 
 <I>spoke unadvisedly with his lips. Thou didst say</I> so and so, and 
 it was not well said. God keeps account what we say, even when we speak 
 in haste.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The reproof that God gave him for talking at this rate. Jeremiah 
 was troubled to see him in such an agitation, and knew not well what to 
 say to him. He was loth to chide him, and yet thought he deserved it, 
 was willing to comfort him, and yet knew not which way to go about it; 
 but God tells him what he <I>shall say to him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+45:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Jeremiah could not be certain what was at the bottom of these 
 complaints and fear, but God sees it. They came from his corruptions. 
 That the hurt might therefore not be healed slightly, he searches the 
 wound, and shows him that he had raised his expectations too high in 
 this world and had promised himself too much from it, and that made the 
 distress and trouble he was in so very grievous to him and so hard to 
 be borne. Note, The frowns of the world would not disquiet us as they
 do if we did not foolishly flatter ourselves with the hopes of its 
 smiles and court and covet them too much. It is our over-fondness for 
 the good things of this present time that makes us impatient under its 
 evil things. Now God shows him that it was his fault and folly, at this 
 time of day especially, either to desire or to look for an abundance of 
 the wealth and honour of this world. For, 

 1. The ship was sinking. Ruin was coming upon the Jewish nation, an
 utter and universal ruin: "<I>That which I have built,</I> to be a 
 house for myself, <I>I am breaking down, and that which I have 
 planted,</I> to be a vineyard for myself, <I>I am plucking up, even 
 this whole land,</I> the Jewish church and state; and dost thou now 
 <I>seek great things for thyself?</I> Dost thou expect to be rich and 
 honourable and to make a figure now? No." 

 2. "It is absurd for thee to be now painting thy own cabin. Canst thou
 expect to be high when all are brought low, to be full when all about 
 thee are empty?" To seek ourselves more than the public welfare, 
 especially to seek great things to ourselves when the public is in 
 danger, is very unbecoming Israelites. We may apply it to this world, 
 and our state in it; God in his providence is breaking down and pulling 
 up; every thing is uncertain and perishing; we cannot expect any 
 continuing city here. What folly is it then to <I>seek great things
 for ourselves</I> here, where every thing is little and nothing 
 certain!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The encouragement that God gave him to hope that though he should 
 not be great, yet he should be safe: "<I>I will bring evil upon all 
 flesh,</I> all nations of men, all orders and degrees of men, <I>but 
 thy life will I give to thee for a prey" (thy soul,</I> so the word is) 
 "<I>in all places whither thou goest.</I> Thou must expect to be 
 hurried from place to place, and, wherever thou goest, to be in danger,
 but thou shalt escape, though often very narrowly, shalt have thy life, 
 but it shall be as a prey, which is got with much difficulty and 
 danger; thou shalt be saved as by fire." Note, The preservation and 
 continuance of life are very great mercies, and we are bound to account 
 them such, as they are the prolonging of our opportunity to glorify God 
 in this world and to get ready for a better; and at some times, 
 especially when the arrows of death fly thickly about us, life is a 
 signal favour, and what we ought to be very thankful for, and while we 
 have it must not complain though we be disappointed of the great things 
 we expected. <I>Is not the life more than meat?</I></P>
