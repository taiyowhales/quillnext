 The prophet, in this chapter, goes on with the prediction of Babylon's 
 fall, to which other prophets also bore witness. He is very copious and 
 lively in describing the foresight God had given him of it, for the 
 encouragement of the pious captives, whose deliverance depended upon it 
 and was to be the result of it. Here is, 

 I. The record of Babylon's doom, with the particulars of it, intermixed
 with the grounds of God's controversy with her, many aggravations of 
 her fall, and great encouragements given thence to the Israel of God, 
 that suffered such hard things by her,

 II. The representation and ratification of this by the throwing of a
 copy of this prophecy into the river Euphrates,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Behold, I will raise up against Babylon,
 and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up
 against me, a destroying wind;
 &nbsp; 2  And will send unto Babylon fanners, that shall fan her, and
 shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be
 against her round about.
 &nbsp; 3  Against <I>him that</I> bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and
 against <I>him that</I> lifteth himself up in his brigandine: and
 spare ye not her young men; destroy ye utterly all her host.
 &nbsp; 4  Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and
 <I>they that are</I> thrust through in her streets.
 &nbsp; 5  For Israel <I>hath</I> not <I>been</I> forsaken, nor Judah of his God,
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts; though their land was filled with sin
 against the Holy One of Israel.
 &nbsp; 6  Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his
 soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this <I>is</I> the time of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s vengeance; he will render unto her a recompence.
 &nbsp; 7  Babylon <I>hath been</I> a golden cup in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s hand, that
 made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine;
 therefore the nations are mad.
 &nbsp; 8  Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take
 balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.
 &nbsp; 9  We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake
 her, and let us go every one into his own country: for her
 judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up <I>even</I> to the
 skies.
 &nbsp; 10  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let
 us declare in Zion the work of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God.
 &nbsp; 11  Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath
 raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device
 <I>is</I> against Babylon, to destroy it; because it <I>is</I> the
 vengeance of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the vengeance of his temple.
 &nbsp; 12  Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the
 watch strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath both devised and done that which he spake against the
 inhabitants of Babylon.
 &nbsp; 13  O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in
 treasures, thine end is come, <I>and</I> the measure of thy
 covetousness.
 &nbsp; 14  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts hath sworn by himself, <I>saying,</I> Surely I
 will fill thee with men, as with caterpillers; and they shall
 lift up a shout against thee.
 &nbsp; 15  He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the
 world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his
 understanding.
 &nbsp; 16  When he uttereth <I>his</I> voice, <I>there is</I> a multitude of
 waters in the heavens; and he causeth the vapours to ascend from
 the ends of the earth: he maketh lightnings with rain, and
 bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.
 &nbsp; 17  Every man is brutish by <I>his</I> knowledge; every founder is
 confounded by the graven image: for his molten image <I>is</I>
 falsehood, and <I>there is</I> no breath in them.
 &nbsp; 18  They <I>are</I> vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their
 visitation they shall perish.
 &nbsp; 19  The portion of Jacob <I>is</I> not like them; for he <I>is</I> the
 former of all things: and <I>Israel is</I> the rod of his inheritance:
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts <I>is</I> his name.
 &nbsp; 20  Thou <I>art</I> my battle axe <I>and</I> weapons of war: for with thee
 will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy
 kingdoms;
 &nbsp; 21  And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his
 rider; and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his
 rider;
 &nbsp; 22  With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and
 with thee will I break in pieces old and young; and with thee
 will I break in pieces the young man and the maid;
 &nbsp; 23  I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his
 flock; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and
 his yoke of oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces captains
 and rulers.
 &nbsp; 24  And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of
 Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight,
 saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 25  Behold, I <I>am</I> against thee, O destroying mountain, saith
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, which destroyest all the earth: and I will stretch out
 mine hand upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will
 make thee a burnt mountain.
 &nbsp; 26  And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a
 stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 27  Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the
 nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against
 her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a
 captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough
 caterpillers.
 &nbsp; 28  Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes,
 the captains thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all the
 land of his dominion.
 &nbsp; 29  And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall be performed against Babylon, to make the land of
 Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant.
 &nbsp; 30  The mighty men of Babylon have forborne to fight, they have
 remained in <I>their</I> holds: their might hath failed; they became
 as women: they have burned her dwelling-places; her bars are
 broken.
 &nbsp; 31  One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to
 meet another, to shew the king of Babylon that his city is taken
 at <I>one</I> end,
 &nbsp; 32  And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have
 burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.
 &nbsp; 33  For thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, the God of Israel; The
 daughter of Babylon <I>is</I> like a threshing-floor, <I>it is</I> time to
 thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall
 come.
 &nbsp; 34  Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath
 crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me
 up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicates, he
 hath cast me out.
 &nbsp; 35  The violence done to me and to my flesh <I>be</I> upon Babylon,
 shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and my blood upon the
 inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.
 &nbsp; 36  Therefore thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Behold, I will plead thy
 cause, and take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea,
 and make her springs dry.
 &nbsp; 37  And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling-place for dragons,
 an astonishment, and a hissing, without an inhabitant.
 &nbsp; 38  They shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as
 lions' whelps.
 &nbsp; 39  In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them
 drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and
 not wake, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 40  I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like
 rams with he goats.
 &nbsp; 41  How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole
 earth surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the
 nations!
 &nbsp; 42  The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the
 multitude of the waves thereof.
 &nbsp; 43  Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a
 land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth <I>any</I> son of man pass
 thereby.
 &nbsp; 44  And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out
 of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations
 shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of
 Babylon shall fall.
 &nbsp; 45  My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye
 every man his soul from the fierce anger of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 46  And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that
 shall be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come <I>one</I> year,
 and after that in <I>another</I> year <I>shall come</I> a rumour, and
 violence in the land, ruler against ruler.
 &nbsp; 47  Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment
 upon the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be
 confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.
 &nbsp; 48  Then the heaven and the earth, and all that <I>is</I> therein,
 shall sing for Babylon: for the spoilers shall come unto her from
 the north, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 49  As Babylon <I>hath caused</I> the slain of Israel to fall, so at
 Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.
 &nbsp; 50  Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still:
 remember the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your
 mind.
 &nbsp; 51  We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame
 hath covered our faces: for strangers are come into the
 sanctuaries of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s house.
 &nbsp; 52  Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that I
 will do judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land
 the wounded shall groan.
 &nbsp; 53  Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she
 should fortify the height of her strength, <I>yet</I> from me shall
 spoilers come unto her, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 54  A sound of a cry <I>cometh</I> from Babylon, and great
 destruction from the land of the Chaldeans:
 &nbsp; 55  Because the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of
 her the great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters, a
 noise of their voice is uttered:
 &nbsp; 56  Because the spoiler is come upon her, <I>even</I> upon Babylon,
 and her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken:
 for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of recompences shall surely requite.
 &nbsp; 57  And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise <I>men,</I> her
 captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall
 sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name
 <I>is</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts.
 &nbsp; 58  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon
 shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with
 fire; and the people shall labour in vain, and the folk in the
 fire, and they shall be weary.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The particulars of this copious prophecy are dispersed and interwoven, 
 and the same things left and returned to so often that it could not 
 well be divided into parts, but we must endeavor to collect them under 
 their proper heads. Let us then observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. An acknowledgment of the great pomp and power that Babylon had been 
 in and the use that God in his providence had made of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):
 
 <I>Babylon hath been a golden cup,</I> a rich and glorious empire, <I>a 
 golden city</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:4">Isa. xiv. 4</A>),

 <I>a head of gold</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:38">Dan. ii. 38</A>),

 filled with all good things, as a cup with wine. Nay, she had been <I>a
 golden cup in the Lord's hand;</I> he had in a particular manner filled 
 and favoured her with blessings; he had made the earth <I>drunk with 
 this cup;</I> some were intoxicated with her pleasures and debauched by 
 her, others intoxicated with her terrors and destroyed by her. In both 
 senses the New-Testament Babylon is said to have made the kings of the 
 earth drunk,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:2,18:3">Rev. xvii. 2; xviii. 3</A>.

 Babylon had also been God's <I>battle-axe;</I> it was so at this time, 
 when Jeremiah prophesied, and was likely to be yet more so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 The forces of Babylon were God's <I>weapons of war,</I> tools in his 
 hand, with which he broke in pieces, and knocked down, <I>nations and 
 kingdoms,</I>--<I>horses</I> and <I>chariots,</I> which are so much the 
 strength of kingdoms 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),--

 <I>man and woman, young and old,</I> with which kingdoms are 
 replenished 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),--

 <I>the shepherd and his flock, the husbandman and his oxen,</I> with 
 which kingdoms are maintained and supplied, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Such havoc as this the Chaldeans had made when God employed them as 
 instruments of his wrath for the chastising of the nations; and yet now 
 Babylon itself must fall. Note, Those that have carried all before them 
 a great while will yet at length meet with their match, and their day 
 also will come to fall; the rod will itself be thrown into the fire at 
 last. Nor can any think it will exempt them from God's judgments that 
 they have been instrumental in executing his judgments on others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A just complaint made of Babylon, and a charge drawn up against her 
 by the Israel of God. 

 1. She is complained of for her incorrigible wickedness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed.</I> The people 
 of God that were captives among the Babylonians endeavoured, according 
 to the instructions given them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:11">Jer. x. 11</A>),

 to convince them of the folly of their idolatry, but they could not do
 it; still they doted as much as ever upon their graven images, and 
 therefore the Israelites resolved to quit them and go to their own 
 country. Yet some understand this as spoken by the forces they had 
 hired for their assistance, declaring that they had done their best to 
 save her from ruin, but that it was all to no purpose, and therefore 
 they might as well go home to their respective countries; "for <I>her 
 judgment reaches unto heaven,</I> and it is in vain to withstand it or 
 think to avert it." 

 2. She is complained of for her inveterate malice against Israel.
 Other nations had been hardly used by the Chaldeans, but Israel only 
 complains to God of it, and with confidence appeals to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:34,35"><I>v.</I> 34, 35</A>):
 
 "<I>The king of Babylon has devoured me, and crushed me,</I> and never 
 thought he could do enough ruin to me; <I>he has emptied me</I> of all 
 that was valuable, has <I>swallowed me up as a dragon,</I> or whale, 
 swallows up the little fish by shoals; <I>he has filled his belly,</I> 
 filled his treasures, <I>with my delicates,</I> with all my pleasant 
 things, <I>and has cast me out,</I> cast me away as a <I>vessel in 
 which there is no pleasure;</I> and now let them be accountable for all 
 this." <I>Zion and Jerusalem shall say,</I> "Let <I>the violence done 
 to me and</I> my children, that are <I>my</I> own <I>flesh,</I> and 
 pieces of myself, and all the blood of my people, which they have shed 
 like water, <I>be upon</I> them; let the guilt of it lie upon them, and 
 let it be required at their hands." Note, Ruin is not far off from 
 those that lie under the guilt of wrong done to God's people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Judgment given upon this appeal by the righteous Judge of heaven 
 and earth, on behalf of Israel against Babylon. He <I>sits in the
 throne judging right,</I> is ready to receive complaints, and answers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>):

 "<I>I will plead thy cause.</I> Leave it with me; I will in due time 
 plead it effectually <I>and take vengeance for thee,</I> and every drop 
 of Jerusalem's blood shall be accounted for with interest." Israel and 
 Judah seemed to have been neglected and forgotten, but God had an eye 
 to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 It is true <I>their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of 
 Israel.</I> They were a provoking people and their sings were a great 
 offence to God, as a holy God, and as their God, their Holy One; and 
 therefore he justly delivered them up into the hands of their enemies, 
 and might justly have abandoned them and left them to perish in their 
 hands; but God deals better with them than they deserve, and, 
 notwithstanding their iniquities and his severities, <I>Israel is not 
 forsaken,</I> is not cast off, though he be cast out, but is owned and 
 looked after by his God, by the Lord of hosts. God is his God still, 
 and will act for him as the Lord of hosts, a God of power. Note, Though 
 God's people may have broken his laws and fallen under his rebukes, yet 
 it does not therefore follow that they are thrown out of covenant; but 
 God's care of them and love to them will <I>flourish again,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:30-33">Ps. lxxxix. 30-33</A>.

 The Chaldeans thought they should never be called to an account for
 what they had done against God's Israel; but there is <I>a time</I> 
 fixed <I>for vengeance,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 We cannot expect it should come sooner than the time fixed, but then it 
 will come; he <I>will render unto Babylon a recompence,</I> for the 
 avenging of Israel is <I>the vengeance of the Lord,</I> who espouses 
 their cause; it is <I>the vengeance of his temple,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>,

 as before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:28"><I>ch.</I> l. 28</A>.

 <I>The Lord God of recompences,</I> the <I>God to whom vengeance
 belongs, will surely requite</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:56"><I>v.</I> 56</A>),

 will pay them home; he will <I>render unto Babylon all the evil they 
 have done in Zion</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>);

 he will return it <I>in the sight</I> of his people. They shall have
 the satisfaction to see their cause pleaded with jealousy. They shall 
 not only live to see those judgments brought upon Babylon, but they 
 shall plainly see them to be the punishment of the wrong they have done 
 to Zion; any man may see it, and say, <I>Verily there is a God that 
 judges in the earth;</I> for just as <I>Babylon has caused the slain of 
 Israel to fall,</I> has not only slain those that were found in arms, 
 but all without distinction, even <I>all the land</I> (almost all were 
 put to the sword), so <I>at Babylon shall fall</I> the slain not only
 of the city, but of <I>all the country,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>.

 Cyrus shall measure to the Chaldeans the same that they measured to the 
 Jews, so that every observer may discern that God is recompensing them 
 for what they did against his people; but Zion's children shall in a 
 particular manner triumph in it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>The Lord has brought forth our righteousness;</I> he has appeared in 
 our behalf against those that dealt unjustly with us, and has given us 
 redress; he has also made it to appear that he is reconciled to us and 
 that we are yet in his eyes a <I>righteous nation.</I> Let it therefore 
 be spoken of to his praise: <I>Come and let us declare in Zion the work 
 of the Lord our God,</I> that others may be invited to join with us in 
 praising him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. A declaration of the greatness and sovereignty of that God who 
 espouses Zion's cause and undertakes to reckon with this proud and 
 potent enemy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 It is <I>the Lord of hosts</I> that has said it, that has <I>sworn 
 it,</I> has <I>sworn it by himself</I> (for he could swear by no 
 greater), that he will fill Babylon with vast and incredible numbers of 
 the enemy's forces, will <I>fill it with men as with caterpillars,</I> 
 that shall overpower it will multitudes, and need only to <I>lift up a 
 shout</I> against it, for that shall be so terrible as to dispirit all 
 the inhabitants and make them an easy prey to this numerous army. But 
 who, and where, is he that can break so powerful a kingdom as Babylon? 
 The prophet gives an account of him from the description he had 
 formerly given of him, and of his sovereignty and victory over all 
 pretenders 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:12-16">Jer. x. 12-16</A>),

 which was there intended for the conviction of the Babylonian idolaters
 and the confirmation of God's Israel in the faith and worship of the 
 God of Israel; and it is here repeated to show that God will convince 
 those by his judgments who would not be convinced by his word that he 
 is <I>God over all.</I> Let not any doubt but that he who has 
 determined to destroy Babylon is able to make his words good, for,

 1. He is the God that made the world

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 and therefore nothing is too hard for him to do; it is in his name that 
 our help stands, and on him our hope is built. 

 2. He has the command of all the creatures that he has made

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);

 his providence is a continued creation. He has <I>wind and rain</I> at 
 his disposal. If he speak the word, there is a <I>multitude of waters
 in the heavens</I> (and it is a wonder how they hang there), fed by 
 <I>vapours out of the earth,</I> and it is a wonder how they ascend 
 thence. <I>Lightnings and rain</I> seem contraries, as fire and water, 
 and yet they are produced together; and the wind, which seems arbitrary 
 in its motions, and we <I>know not whence it comes,</I> is yet, we are 
 sure, brought <I>out of his treasuries.</I> 

 3. The idols that oppose the accomplishment of his word are a mere sham
 and their worshippers brutish people,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.

 The idols are falsehood, they are vanity, they are <I>the work of 
 errors;</I> when they come to be visited (to be examined and enquired 
 into) <I>they perish,</I> that is, their reputation sinks and they 
 appear to be nothing; and those <I>that make them are like unto 
 them.</I> But between the God of Israel and these gods of the heathen 
 there is no comparison 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>The portion of Jacob is not like them;</I> the God who speaks this 
 and will do it is the <I>former of all things</I> and <I>the Lord of 
 all hosts,</I> and therefore can do what he will; and there is a near 
 relation between him and his people, for he is <I>their portion</I> and 
 they are his; they put a confidence in him as their portion and he is 
 pleased to take a complacency in them and a particular care of them as 
 the <I>lot of his inheritance;</I> and therefore he will do what is 
 best for them. The repetition of these things here, which were said 
 before, intimates both the certainty and the importance of them, and 
 obliges us to take special notice of them; <I>God hath spoken once; 
 yea, twice have we heard this, that power belongs to God,</I> power to 
 destroy the most formidable enemies of his church; and if God thus 
 <I>speak once, yea, twice,</I> we are inexcusable if we do not perceive 
 it and attend to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. A description of the instruments that are to be employed in this 
 service. God has <I>raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 Darius and Cyrus, who come against Babylon by a divine instinct; for 
 <I>God's device is against Babylon to destroy it.</I> They do it, but 
 God devised it, he designed it; they are but accomplishing his purpose, 
 and acting as he directed. Note, God's counsel shall stand, and 
 according to it all hearts shall move. Those whom God employs against 
 Babylon are compared 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)

 to a <I>destroying wind,</I> which either by its coldness blasts the 
 fruits of the earth or by its fierceness blows down all before it. This 
 wind is <I>brought out of God's treasuries</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 and it is here said to be <I>raised up against those that dwell in the 
 midst of the Chaldeans,</I> those of other nations that inhabit among 
 them and are incorporated with them. The Chaldeans rise up against God 
 by falling down before idols, and against them God will raise up 
 destroyers, for he will be too hard for those that contend with him. 
 These enemies are compared to fanners 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 who shall <I>drive them away as chaff</I> is driven away by the fan.
 The Chaldeans had been fanners to winnow God's people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:7"><I>ch.</I> xv. 7</A>)

 and to empty them, and now they shall themselves be in like manner
 despoiled and dispersed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. An ample commission given them to destroy and lay all waste. Let 
 them <I>bend their bow</I> against the archers of the Chaldeans 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)
 
 and <I>not spare her young men,</I> but <I>utterly destroy them,</I> 
 for the Lord has <I>both devised and done what he spoke against 
 Babylon,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 This may animate the instruments he employs, but assuring them of 
 success. The methods they take are such as God has devised and 
 therefore they shall surely prosper; what he has spoken shall be done, 
 for he himself will do it; and therefore let all necessary preparations 
 be made. This they are called to, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:27,28"><I>v.</I> 27, 28</A>.

 Let <I>a standard be set up,</I> under which to enlist soldiers for 
 this expedition; <I>let a trumpet be blown</I> to call men together to 
 it and animate them in it; let the nations, out of which Cyrus's army 
 is to be raised, prepare their recruits; let the kingdoms of 
 <I>Ararat,</I> and <I>Minni, and Ashkenaz,</I> of Armenia, both the 
 higher and the lower, and of Ascania, about Phrygia and Bithynia, send 
 in their quota of men for his service; let general officers be 
 appointed and the cavalry advance; let the horses come up in <I>great 
 numbers,</I> as the <I>caterpillars,</I> and come, like them, leaping 
 and pawing in the valley; let them lay the country waste, as 
 <I>caterpillars</I> do 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:4">Joel i. 4</A>),

 especially rough caterpillars; let the kings and captains prepare
 nations against Babylon, for the service is great and there is occasion 
 for many hands to be employed it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The weakness of the Chaldeans, and their inability to make head 
 against this threatening destroying force. When God employed them 
 against other nations they had spirit and strength to act offensively, 
 and went on with admirable resolution, conquering and to conquer; but 
 now that it comes to their turn to be reckoned with all their might and 
 courage are gone, their hearts fail them, and none of all their men of 
 might and mettle have found their hands to act so much as defensively. 
 They are called upon here to prepare for action, but it is ironically 
 and in an upbraiding way 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>Make bright the arrows,</I> which have grown rusty through disuse; 
 <I>gather the shields,</I> which in a long time of peace and security 
 have been scattered and thrown out of the way 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 <I>set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon,</I> upon the towers 
 on those walls, to summon all that owed suit and service to that 
 mother-city, now to come in to her assistance; let them make the watch 
 as strong as they can, and appoint the sentinels to their respective 
 posts, and prepare ambushes for the reception of the enemy. This 
 intimates that they would be found very secure and remiss, and would 
 need to be thus quickened (and they were so to such a degree that they 
 were in the midst of their revels when the city was taken), but that 
 all their preparations should come to no purpose. Whoever will may call 
 them to it, but they shall have no heart to come at the call, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.
 
 <I>The</I> whole <I>land shall tremble, and sorrow</I> (a universal 
 consternation) shall seize upon them; for they shall see both the 
 irresistible arm and the irreversible counsel and decree of God against 
 them. They shall see that God is making <I>Babylon a desolation,</I> 
 and therein is performing what he has purposed; and then <I>the mighty 
 men of Babylon have forborne to fight,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 God having taken away their strength and spirit, so that they have 
 <I>remained in their holds,</I> not daring so much as to peep forth, 
 the might both of their hearts and of their hands fails; they 
 <I>become</I> as timorous <I>as women,</I> so that the enemy has, 
 without any resistance, <I>burnt her dwelling-places</I> and <I>broken 
 her bars.</I> It is to the same purport with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:56-58"><I>v.</I> 56-58</A>.

 When the spoiler comes upon Babylon her mighty men, who should make 
 head against him, are immediately taken, their weapons of war fail 
 them, <I>every one of their bows is broken</I> and stands them in no 
 stead. Their politics fail them; they call councils of war, but their 
 princes and captains, who sit in council to concert measures for the 
 common safety, are made drunk; they are as men intoxicated through 
 stupidity or despair; they can form no right notions of things; they 
 stagger and are unsteady in their counsels and resolves, and dash one 
 against another, and, like drunken men, fall out among themselves. At 
 length they <I>sleep a perpetual sleep,</I> and never <I>awake</I> from 
 their wine, the wine of God's wrath, for it is to them an opiate that 
 lays them into a fatal lethargy. The <I>walls of their city</I> fail 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:58"><I>v.</I> 58</A>.

 When the enemy had found ways to ford Euphrates, which was thought 
 impassable, yet surely, think they, the walls are impregnable, they are 
 <I>the broad walls of Babylon</I> or (as the margin reads it), <I>the 
 walls of broad Babylon.</I> The compass of the city, within the walls, 
 was 385 furlongs, some say 480, that is, about sixty miles; the walls 
 were 200 cubits high, and fifty cubits broad, so that two chariots 
 might easily pass by one another upon them. Some say that there was a 
 threefold wall about the inner city and the like about the outer, and 
 that the stones of the wall, being laid in pitch instead of mortar 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+11:3">Gen. xi. 3</A>),

 were scarcely separable; and yet these shall be <I>utterly broken,</I>
 and <I>the high gates and towers shall be burnt,</I> and the people 
 that are employed in the defence of the city shall <I>labour in vain in 
 the fire;</I> they shall quite tire themselves, but shall do no 
 good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. The destruction that shall be made of Babylon by these invaders. 
 
 1. It is a certain destruction; the doom has passed and it cannot be
 reversed; a divine power is engaged against it, which cannot be
 resisted

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Babylon is fallen and destroyed,</I> is as sure to fall, to fall
 into destruction, as if it were fallen and destroyed already; though 
 when Jeremiah prophesied this, and many a year after, it was in the 
 height of its power and greatness. God declares, God appears against 
 Babylon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>Behold, I am against thee;</I> and those cannot stand long whom God 
 is against. He will <I>stretch out his hand upon it,</I> a hand which 
 no creature can bear the weight of nor withstand the force of. It is 
 his purpose, which shall be performed, that <I>Babylon</I> must be a 
 <I>desolation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 2. It is a righteous destruction. Babylon has made herself meet for it, 
 and therefore cannot fail to meet with it. For
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>)

 <I>Babylon</I> has been <I>a destroying mountain,</I> very lofty and 
 bulky as a mountain, and <I>destroying all the earth,</I> as the stones 
 that are tumbled from high mountains spoil the grounds about them; but 
 now it shall itself be <I>rolled down from its rocks,</I> which were as 
 the foundations on which it stood. It shall be levelled, its pomp and 
 power broken. It is now a burning mountain, like &AElig;tna and the 
 other volcanoes, that throw out fire, to the terror of all about them. 
 But it shall be a burnt mountain; it shall at length have consumed 
 itself, and shall remain a heap of ashes. So will this world be at the 
 end of time. Again
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 "<I>Babylon is like a threshing-floor,</I> in which the people of God 
 have been long threshed, as sheaves in the floor; but now the time has 
 come that she shall herself be threshed and her sheaves in her; her 
 princes and great men, and all her inhabitants, shall be beaten in 
 their own land, as in the threshing-floor. The threshing-floor is 
 prepared. Babylon is by sin made meet to be a seat of war, and her 
 people, like corn in harvest, are ripe for destruction," 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:15,Mic+4:12">Rev. xiv. 15; Mic. iv. 12</A>.

 3. It is an unavoidable destruction. Babylon seems to be well-fenced 
 and fortified against it: <I>She dwells upon many waters</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);
 
 the situation of her country is such that it seems inaccessible, it is 
 so surrounded, and the march of an enemy into it so embarrassed, by 
 rivers. In allusion to this, the New-Testament Babylon is said to 
 <I>sit upon many waters,</I> that is, to rule over many nations, as the 
 other Babylon did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:15">Rev. xvii. 15</A>.

 <I>Babylon is abundant in treasures;</I> and yet "<I>thy end has 
 come,</I> and neither they waters nor thy wealth shall secure thee." 
 This end that comes shall be <I>the measure of thy covetousness;</I> it 
 shall be the stint of thy gettings, it shall set bounds to thy ambition 
 and avarice, which otherwise would have ben boundless. God, by the 
 destruction of Babylon, said to its proud waves, <I>Hitherto shall you 
 come, and no further.</I> Note, if men will not set a measure to their 
 covetousness by wisdom and grace, God will set a measure to it by his 
 judgments. Babylon, thinking herself very safe and very great, was
 very proud; but she will be deceived 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:53"><I>v.</I> 53</A>):

 <I>Though Babylon should mount</I> her walls and palaces <I>up to 
 heaven,</I> and though (because what is high is apt to totter) she 
 should take care to <I>fortify the height of her strength,</I> yet all 
 will not do; God will send spoilers against her, that shall break 
 through her strength and bring down her height. 

 4. It is a gradual destruction, which, if they had pleased, they might
 have foreseen and had warning of; for

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>)

 "<I>A rumor will come one year</I> that Cyrus is making vast 
 preparations for war, <I>and after that, in another year, shall come a 
 rumour</I> that his design is upon Babylon, and he is steering his 
 course that way;" so that when he was a great way off they might have 
 sent and desired conditions of peace; but they were too proud, too 
 secure, to do that, and their hearts were hardened to their 
 destruction. 

 5. Yet, when it comes, it is a surprising destruction: <I>Babylon has
 suddenly fallen</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 the destruction came upon them when they did not think of it and was 
 perfected in a little time, as that of the New-Testament <I>Babylon--in 
 one hour,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:17">Rev. xviii. 17</A>.

 The king of Babylon, who should have been observing the approaches of 
 the enemy, was himself at such a distance from the place where the 
 attack was made that it was a great while ere he had notice that the 
 city was taken; so that those who were posted near the place sent one 
 messenger, one courier, after another, with advice of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 The foot-posts shall meet at the court from several quarters with this 
 intelligence to the king of Babylon that his <I>city is taken at one 
 end,</I> and there is nothing to obstruct the progress of the 
 conquerors, but they will be at the other end quickly. They are to
 tell him that the enemy has <I>seized the passes</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),

 the forts or blockades upon the river, and that, having got over the 
 river, he has set fire to the reeds on the river side, to alarm and 
 terrify the city, so that all the men of war are affrighted and have 
 thrown down their arms and surrendered at discretion. The messengers 
 come, like Job's, one upon the heels of another, with these tidings, 
 which are immediately confirmed with a witness by the enemies' being in 
 the palace and slaying the king himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:30">Dan. v. 30</A>.

 That profane feast which they were celebrating at the very time when
 the city was taken, which was both an evidence of their strange 
 security and a great advantage to the enemy, seems here to be referred 
 to

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:38,39"><I>v.</I> 38, 39</A>):
 
 <I>They shall roar together like lions,</I> as men in their revels do, 
 when the wine has got into their heads. They call it <I>singing;</I> 
 but in scripture-language, and in the language of sober men, it is 
 called <I>yelling like lions' whelps.</I> It is probable that they were 
 drinking confusion to Cyrus and his army with loud huzzas. Well, says 
 God, in their heat, when they are inflamed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:11">Isa. v. 11</A>)

 and their heads are hot with hard drinking, I will <I>make their
 feasts,</I> I will <I>give them their portion.</I> They have passed 
 their cup round; now <I>the cup of the Lord's right hand shall be 
 turned unto them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:15,16">Hab. ii. 15, 16</A>),

 a cup of fury, which shall <I>make them drunk that they may rejoice</I>
 (or rather <I>that they may revel it</I>) and <I>sleep a perpetual 
 sleep;</I> let them be as merry as they can with that bitter cup, but 
 it shall lay them to sleep never to wake more (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:57"><I>v.</I> 57</A>);

 for <I>on that night,</I> in the midst of the jollity, was 
 <I>Belshazzar slain.</I> 

 6. It is to be a universal destruction. God will make thorough work of
 it; for, as he will perform what he has purposed, so he will perfect 
 what he has begun. <I>The slain shall fall</I> in great abundance 
 throughout <I>the land of the Chaldeans;</I> multitudes shall be 
 <I>thrust through in her streets,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 They are <I>brought down like lambs to the slaughter</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>),

 in such great numbers, so easily, and the enemies make no more of 
 killing them than the butcher does of killing lambs. The strength of 
 the enemy, and their invading them, are here compared to an irruption 
 and inundation of waters 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>):

 <I>The sea has come up upon Babylon,</I> which, when it has once broken 
 through its bounds, there is no fence against, so that she is 
 <I>covered with the multitude of its waves,</I> overpowered by a 
 numerous army; <I>her cities</I> then become <I>a desolation,</I> an 
 uninhabited uncultivated desert, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>.

 7. It is a destruction that shall reach the gods of Babylon, the idols 
 and images, and fall with a particular weight upon them. "In token that 
 <I>the whole land shall be confounded</I> and all <I>her slain shall 
 fall</I> and that throughout all the country <I>the wounded shall 
 groan, I will do judgment upon her graven images,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:47">
 <I>v.</I> 47</A>
 
 and again
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:52"><I>v.</I> 52</A>.

 All must needs perish if their gods perish, from whom they expect 
 protection. Though the invaders are themselves idolaters, yet they 
 shall destroy the images and temples of the gods of Babylon, as an 
 earnest of the abolishing of all counterfeit deities. Bel was the
 principal idol that the Babylonians worshipped, and therefore that is 
 by name here marked for destruction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>):

 <I>I will punish Bel,</I> that great devourer, that image to which such 
 abundance of sacrifices are offered and such rich spoils dedicated, and 
 to whose temple there is such a vast resort. He shall disgorge what he
 has so greedily regaled himself with. God will bring forth out of his 
 temple all the wealth laid up there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:15">Job xx. 15</A>.

 His altars shall be forsaken, none shall regard him any more, and so
 that idol which was thought to be a wall to Babylon shall fall and fail 
 them. 

 8. It shall be a final destruction. You may <I>take balm for her
 pain,</I> but in vain; she that <I>would not be healed</I> by the word 
 of God <I>shall not be healed</I> by his providence,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 <I>Babylon</I> shall <I>become heaps</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>),

 and, to complete its infamy, no use shall be made even of the ruins of 
 Babylon, so execrable shall they be, and attended with such ill omens 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>They shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for 
 foundations.</I> People shall not care for having any thing to do with 
 Babylon, or whatever belonged to it. Or it denotes that there shall be 
 nothing left in Babylon on which to ground any hopes or attempts of 
 raising it into a kingdom again; for, as it follows here, <I>it shall 
 be desolate for ever.</I> St. Jerome says that in his time, though the
 ruins of Babylon's walls were to be seen, yet the ground enclosed by 
 them was a forest of wild beasts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IX. Here is a call to God's people to go out of Babylon. It is their 
 wisdom, when the ruin is approaching, to quit the city and retire into 
 the country 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>Flee out of the midst of Babylon,</I> and get into some remote 
 corner, that you may save your lives, and may not be cut off in her 
 iniquity." When God's judgments are abroad it is good to get as far as 
 we can from those against whom they are levelled, as Israel from the 
 tents of Korah. This agrees with the advice Christ gave his disciples, 
 with reference to the destruction of Jerusalem. <I>Let those who shall 
 be in Judea flee to the mountains,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:16">Matt. xxiv. 16</A>.

 It is their wisdom to <I>get out of the midst of Babylon,</I> lest they
 be involved, if not in her ruins, yet in her fears 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:45,46"><I>v.</I> 45, 46</A>):

 <I>Lest your heart faint, and you fear for the rumour that shall be 
 heard in the land.</I> Though God had told them that Cyrus should be 
 their deliverer, and Babylon's destruction their deliverance, yet they 
 had been told also that <I>in the peace there of they should have 
 peace,</I> and therefore the alarms given to Babylon would put them 
 into a fright, and perhaps they might not have faith and consideration 
 enough to suppress those fears, for which reason they are here advised 
 to get out of the hearing of the alarms. Note, Those who have not grace 
 enough to keep their temper in temptation should have wisdom enough to 
 keep out of the way of temptation. But this is not all; it is not only 
 their wisdom to quit the city when the ruin is approaching, but it is 
 their duty to quit the country too when the ruin is accomplished, and 
 they are set at liberty by the pulling down of the prison over their 
 heads. This they are told, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:50,51">
 <I>v.</I> 50, 51</A>:

 "<I>You</I> Israelites, <I>who have escaped the sword of the 
 Chaldeans</I> your oppressors, and of the Persians their destroyers, 
 now that the year of release has come, <I>go away, stand not still;</I> 
 hasten to your own country again, however you may be comfortably seated 
 in Babylon, for this is not your rest, but Canaan is." 

 1. He puts them in mind of the inducements they had to return:
 "<I>Remember the Lord afar off,</I> his presence with you now, though 
 you are here afar off from your native soil; his presence with your 
 fathers formerly in the temple, though you are now afar off from the 
 ruins of it." Note, Wherever we are, in the greatest depths, at the 
 greatest distances, we may and must remember the Lord our God; and in 
 the time of the greatest fears and hopes it is seasonable to 
 <I>remember the Lord.</I> "And let Jerusalem come into your mind.
 Though it be now in ruins, yet <I>favour its dust</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:14">Ps. cii. 14</A>);

 though few of you ever saw it, yet believe the report you have had
 concerning it from those that <I>wept when they remembered Zion;</I> 
 and think of Jerusalem until you come up to a resolution to make the 
 best of your way thither." Note, When the city of our solemnities is 
 out of sight, yet it must not be out of mind; and it will be of great 
 use to us, in our journey through this world, to let the heavenly 
 Jerusalem come often into our mind. 

 2. He takes notice of the discouragement which the returning captives
 labour under

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>);

 being reminded of Jerusalem, they cry out, "<I>We are confounded;</I> 
 we cannot bear the thought of it; <I>shame covers our faces</I> at the 
 mention of it, for <I>we have heard of the reproach of the 
 sanctuary,</I> that is profaned and ruined by strangers; how can we 
 think of it with any pleasure?" To this he answers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:52"><I>v.</I> 52</A>)

 that the God of Israel will now triumph over the gods of Babylon, and 
 so that reproach will be for ever rolled away. Note, The believing 
 prospect of Jerusalem's recovery will keep us from being ashamed of 
 Jerusalem's ruins.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 X. Here is the diversified feeling excited by Babylon's fall, and it is 
 the same that we have with respect to the <I>New-Testament Babylon,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:9,19">Rev. xviii. 9, 19</A>.

 1. Some shall lament the destruction of Babylon. There is <I>the sound 
 of a cry,</I> a great outcry coming from Babylon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>),

 lamenting this great destruction, the voice of mourning, because the 
 Lord has <I>destroyed the voice</I> of the multitude, that great voice 
 of mirth which used to be heard in Babylon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:55"><I>v.</I> 55</A>.

 We are told what they shall say in their lamentations 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>):

 "<I>How is Sheshach taken,</I> and how are we mistaken concerning her! 
 How is that city surprised and become an <I>astonishment among the 
 nations</I> that was the praise, and glory, and admiration of the whole 
 earth!" See how that may fall into a general contempt which has been 
 universally cried up.

 2. Yet some shall rejoice in Babylon's fall, not as it is the misery of
 their fellow-creatures, but as it is the manifestation of the righteous 
 judgment of God and as it opens the way for the release of God's 
 captives; upon these accounts <I>the heaven and the earth, and all that 
 is in both, shall sing for Babylon</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>);

 the church in heaven and the church on earth shall give to God the 
 glory of his righteousness, and take notice of it with thankfulness to 
 his praise. Babylon's ruin is Zion's praise.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>59  The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the
 son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah
 the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign.
 And <I>this</I> Seraiah <I>was</I> a quiet prince.
 &nbsp; 60  So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come
 upon Babylon, <I>even</I> all these words that are written against
 Babylon.
 &nbsp; 61  And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon,
 and shalt see, and shalt read all these words;
 &nbsp; 62  Then shalt thou say, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, thou hast spoken against this
 place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither man
 nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.
 &nbsp; 63  And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this
 book, <I>that</I> thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the
 midst of Euphrates:
 &nbsp; 64  And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not
 rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be
 weary. Thus far <I>are</I> the words of Jeremiah.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have been long attending the judgment of Babylon in this and the 
 foregoing chapter; now here we have the conclusion of that whole 
 matter. 

 1. A copy is taken of this prophecy, it should seem by Jeremiah
 himself, for Baruch his scribe is not mentioned here

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:60"><I>v.</I> 60</A>):
 
 <I>Jeremiah wrote in a book all these words that are here written 
 against Babylon.</I> He received this notice that he might give it to 
 all whom it might concern. It is of great advantage both to the 
 propagating and to the perpetuating of the word of God to have it 
 written, and to have copies taken of the law, prophets, and epistles. 
 
 2. It is sent to Babylon, to the captives there, by the hand of
 Seraiah, who went there attendant on or ambassador for king Zedekiah, 
 <I>in the fourth year of his reign,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:59"><I>v.</I> 59</A>.

 He <I>went with Zedekiah,</I> or (as the margin reads it) <I>on the 
 behalf of Zedekiah, into Babylon.</I> The character given of him is 
 observable, that this <I>Seraiah was a quiet prince,</I> a prince of 
 rest. He was in honour and power, but not, as most f the princes then 
 were, hot and heady, making parties, and heading factions, and driving 
 things furiously. He was of a calm temper, studied the things that made 
 for peace, endeavoured to preserve a good understanding between the 
 king his master and the king of Babylon, and to keep his master from 
 rebelling. He was no persecutor of God's prophets, but a moderate man.
 Zedekiah was happy in the choice of such a man to be his envoy to the 
 king of Babylon, and Jeremiah might safely entrust such a man with his 
 errand too. Note, it is the real honour of great men to be quiet men, 
 and it is the wisdom of princes to put such into places of trust. 

 3. Seraiah is desired to read it to his countrymen that had already
 gone into captivity: "<I>When thou shalt come to Babylon, and shalt 
 see</I> what a magnificent place it is, how large a city, how strong, 
 how rich, and how well fortified, and shalt therefore be tempted to 
 think, Surely, it will stand forever" (as the disciples, when they 
 observed the buildings of the temple, concluded that nothing would 
 <I>throw them down</I> but the end of the world,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:3">Matt. xxiv. 3</A>),

 "<I>then thou shalt read all these words</I> to thyself and thy
 particular friends, for their encouragement in their captivity: let 
 them with an eye of faith see to the end of these threatening powers, 
 and comfort themselves and one another herewith." 

 4. He is directed to make a solemn protestation of the divine authority
 and unquestionable certainty of that which he had read

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:62"><I>v.</I> 62</A>):

 <I>Then thou shalt</I> look up to God, and say, <I>O Lord! it is thou 
 that hast spoken against this place, to cut it off.</I> This is like 
 the angel's protestation concerning the destruction of the 
 New-Testament Babylon. <I>These are the true sayings of God,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:9">Rev. xix. 9</A>.
 
 <I>These words are true and faithful,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:5">Rev. xxi. 5</A>.

 Though Seraiah sees Babylon flourishing, having read this prophecy he 
 must foresee Babylon falling, and by virtue of it must curse its 
 habitation, though it be <I>taking root</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:3">Job v. 3</A>):

 "<I>O Lord! thou hast spoken against this place,</I> and I believe
 what thou hast spoken, that, as thou knowest every thing, so thou canst 
 do every thing. Thou hast passed sentence upon Babylon, and it shall be 
 executed. <I>Thou hast spoken against this place, to cut it off,</I> 
 and therefore we will neither envy its pomp nor fear its power." When 
 we see what this world is, how glittering its shows are and how 
 flattering its proposals, let us read in the book of the Lord that its 
 <I>fashion passes away,</I> and it shall shortly be <I>cut off</I> and 
 be <I>desolate for ever,</I> and we shall learn to look upon it with a 
 holy contempt. Observe here, When we have been reading the word of God 
 it becomes us to direct to him whose word it is a humble believing 
 acknowledgment of the truth, equity, and goodness, of what we have 
 read. 

 5. He must then tie a stone to the book and throw it into the midst of
 the river Euphrates, as a confirming sign of the things contained in 
 it, saying, "<I>Thus shall Babylon sink, and not rise;</I> for they 
 <I>shall be weary,</I> they shall perfectly succumb, as men tired with 
 a burden, under the load of <I>the evil that I will bring upon 
 them,</I> which they shall never shake off, nor get from under,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:53,64"><I>v.</I> 53, 64</A>.

 In the sign it was the stone that sunk the book, which otherwise would 
 have swum. But in <I>the thing signified</I> it was rather the book 
 that sunk the stone; it was the divine sentence passed upon Babylon in 
 this prophecy that sunk that city, which seemed <I>as firm as a 
 stone.</I> The fall of the New-Testament Babylon was represented by 
 something like this, but much more magnificent, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:21">Rev. xviii. 21</A>.

 <I>A mighty angel cast a great millstone into the sea, saying, Thus 
 shall Babylon fall.</I> Those that sink under the weight of God's wrath 
 and curse sink irrecoverably. The last words of the chapter seal up the 
 vision and prophecy of this book: <I>Thus far are the words of 
 Jeremiah.</I> Not that this prophecy against Babylon was the last of 
 his prophecies; for it was dated in the <I>fourth</I> year of Zedekiah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:59"><I>v.</I> 59</A>),

 long before he finished his testimony; but this is recorded last of his 
 prophecies because it was to be last accomplished of all his prophecies 
 against the Gentiles,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:1"><I>ch.</I> xlvi. 1</A>.

 And the chapter which remains is purely historical, and, as some think,
 was added by some other hand.</P>
