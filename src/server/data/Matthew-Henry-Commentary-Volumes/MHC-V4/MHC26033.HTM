 The prophet has now come off his circuit, which he went as judge, in 
 God's name, to try and pass sentence upon the neighbouring nations, 
 and, having finished with them, and read them all their doom, in the 
 eight chapters foregoing, he now returns to the children of his people, 
 and receives further instructions what to say to them. 

 I. He must let them know what office he was in among them as a prophet,
 that he was a watchman, and had received a charge concerning them, for
 which he was accountable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:1-9">ver. 1-9</A>.

 The substance of this we had before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:17"><I>ch.</I> iii. 17</A>,

 &c.

 II. He must let them know upon what terms they stand with God, that
 they are upon their trial, upon their good behaviour, that if a wicked 
 man repent he shall not perish, but that if a righteous man apostatize 
 he shall perish, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:10-20">ver. 10-20</A>.

 III. Here is a particular message sent to those who yet remained in the 
 land of Israel, and (which is very strange) grew secure there, and 
 confident that they should take root there again, to tell them that 
 their hopes would fail them because they persisted in their sins, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:21-29">ver. 21-29</A>.

 IV. Here is a rebuke to those who personally attended Ezekiel's 
 ministry, but were not sincere in their professions of devotion,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Again the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto
 them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the
 land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman:
 &nbsp; 3  If when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the
 trumpet, and warn the people;
 &nbsp; 4  Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh
 not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood
 shall be upon his own head.
 &nbsp; 5  He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his
 blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver
 his soul.
 &nbsp; 6  But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the
 trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and
 take <I>any</I> person from among them, he is taken away in his
 iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand.
 &nbsp; 7  So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the
 house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth,
 and warn them from me.
 &nbsp; 8  When I say unto the wicked, O wicked <I>man,</I> thou shalt surely
 die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that
 wicked <I>man</I> shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I
 require at thine hand.
 &nbsp; 9  Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from
 it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity;
 but thou hast delivered thy soul.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet had been, by express order from God, taken off from 
 prophesying to the Jews, just then when the news came that Jerusalem 
 was invested, and close siege laid to it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:27"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 27</A>.

 But now that Jerusalem is taken, two years after, he is appointed again
 to direct his speech to them; and there his commission is renewed. If 
 God had abandoned them quite, he would not have sent prophets to them; 
 nor, if he had not had mercy in store for them, would he have <I>shown 
 them such things as these.</I> In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The office of a watchman laid down, the trust reposed in him, the 
 charge given him, and the conditions adjusted between him and those 
 that employ him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:2,6"><I>v.</I> 2, 6</A>.

 1. It is supposed to be a public danger that gives occasion for the 
 appointing of a watchman--when <I>God brings the sword upon a land,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The sword of war, whenever it comes upon a land, is of God's bringing; 
 it is the <I>sword of the Lord,</I> of his justice, how unjustly soever 
 men draw it. At such a time, when a country is in fear of a foreign 
 invasion, that they may be informed of all the motions of the enemy, 
 may not be surprised with an attack, but may have early notice of it, 
 in order to their being at their arms and in readiness to give the 
 invader a warm reception, they <I>set a man of their coast,</I> some 
 likely person, that lives upon the borders of their country, where the 
 threatened danger is expected, and is therefore well acquainted with 
 all the avenues of it, and make him <I>their watchman.</I> Thus 
 <I>wise</I> are the <I>children of this world in their generation.</I> 
 Note, One man may be of public service to a whole country. Princes and 
 statesmen are the watchmen of a kingdom; they are continually to employ 
 themselves, and, if occasion be, as watchmen, to expose themselves for 
 the public safety. 

 2. It is supposed to be a public trust that is lodged in the watchman 
 and that he is accountable to the public for the discharge of it. His 
 business is,

 (1.) To discover the approaches and advances of the enemy; and 
 therefore he must not be blind nor asleep, for then he cannot <I>see 
 the sword coming.</I> 

 (2.) To give notice of them immediately by sound of trumpet, or, as 
 sentinels among us, by the discharge of a gun, as a signal of danger. A 
 special trust and confidence is reposed in him by those that set him to 
 be their watchman that he will faithfully do these two things; and they 
 venture their lives upon his fidelity. Now,

 [1.] If he do his part, if he be betimes aware of all the dangers that 
 fall within his cognizance, and give warning of them, he has discharged 
 his trust, and has not only <I>delivered his soul,</I> but earned his 
 wages. If the people do not take warning, if they either will not 
 believe the notice he gives them, will not believe the danger to be so 
 great or so near as really it is, or will not regard it, and so are 
 surprised by the enemy in their security, it is their own fault; the 
 blame is not to be laid upon the watchman, but their blood is upon 
 their own head. If any person goes presumptuously into the mouth of 
 danger, though he heard the sound of the trumpet, and was told by it 
 where the danger was, and <I>so the sword comes</I> and <I>takes him 
 away</I> in his folly, he is <I>felo de se--a suicide;</I> foolish man, 
 he has <I>destroyed himself.</I> But,

 [2.] If the watchman do not do his duty, if he might have seen the 
 danger, and did not, but was asleep, or heedless, or looking another 
 way, or if he did <I>see the danger</I> (for so the case is put here) 
 and shifted only for his own safety, and <I>blew not the trumpet</I> to 
 <I>warn the people,</I> so that some are surprised and cut off <I>in 
 their iniquity</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 cut off suddenly, without having time to cry, <I>Lord, have mercy upon 
 me,</I> time to repent and make their peace with God (which makes the 
 matter much the worse, that the poor creature is <I>taken away in his 
 iniquity</I>), his blood shall be required <I>at the watchman's 
 hand;</I> he shall be found guilty of his death, because he did not 
 <I>give him warning</I> of his danger. But if the watchman do his part, 
 and the people do theirs, all is well; both he that gives warning and 
 he that takes warning have delivered their souls.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The application of this to the prophet, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:7,9"><I>v.</I> 7, 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He is a <I>watchman to the house of Israel.</I> He had occasionally 
 given warning to the nations about, but to the house of Israel he was a 
 watchman by office, for they were the <I>children of the prophets and 
 the covenant</I> They did not <I>set him for a watchman,</I> as the 
 people of the land, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>

 (for they were not so wise for their souls as to secure the welfare of 
 them, as they would have been for the protection of their temporal 
 interests); but God did it for them; he appointed them a watchman.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His business as a watchman is to give warning to sinners of their 
 misery and danger by reason of sin. This is the word he must <I>hear 
 from God's mouth</I> and <I>speak to them.</I> 

 (1.) God has said, <I>The wicked man shall surely die;</I> he shall be 
 miserable. Unless he repent, he shall be cut off from God and all 
 comfort and hope in him, shall be cut off from all good. He shall fall 
 and lie for ever under the wrath of God, which is the death of the 
 soul, as his favour is its life. The righteous God has said it, and 
 will never unsay it, nor can all the world gainsay it, that the 
 <I>wages of sin is death. Sin, when it is finished, brings froth
 death.</I> The wrath of God is revealed from heaven, not only against 
 wicked nations, speaking ruin to them as nations, but against wicked 
 persons, speaking ruin to them in their personal capacity, their 
 personal interests, which pass into the other world and last to 
 eternity, as national interests do not. 

 (2.) It is the will of God that the wicked man should be warned of 
 this: <I>Warn them from me.</I> This intimates that there is a 
 possibility of preventing it, else it were a jest to give warning of 
 it; nay, and that God is desirous it should be prevented. Sinners are 
 <I>therefore</I> warned of the wrath to come, that they may <I>flee 
 from it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:7">Matt. iii. 7</A>.

 (3.) It is the work of ministers to give him warning, to say to the 
 wicked, <I>It shall be ill with thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:11">Isa. iii. 11</A>.

 God ways in general, <I>The soul that sinneth it shall die.</I> The
 minister's business is to apply this to particular persons, and to say, 
 "<I>O wicked man! thou shalt surely die,</I> whoever thou art; if thou 
 go on still in thy trespasses, they will inevitably be thy ruin. O 
 adulterer! O robber! O drunkard! O swearer! O sabbath-breaker! <I>thou
 shalt surely die.</I>" And he must say this, not in passion, to provoke 
 the sinner, but in compassion, to <I>warn the wicked from hi way,</I> 
 warn him to <I>turn from it,</I> that he may live. This is to be done 
 by the faithful preaching of the word in public, and by personal 
 application to those whose sins are open.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. If souls perish through his neglect of his duty, he brings guilt 
 upon himself. "If the prophet do not warn the wicked of the ruin that 
 is at the end of his wicked way, that <I>wicked man shall die in his 
 iniquity;</I> for, though the watchman did not do his part, yet the 
 sinner might have taken warning from the written word, from his own 
 conscience, and from God's judgments upon others, by which his mouth 
 shall be stopped, and God will be justified in his destruction." Note, 
 It will not serve impenitent sinners to plead in the great day that 
 their watchmen did not give them warning, that they were careless and 
 unfaithful; for, though they were so, it will be made to appear that 
 <I>God left not himself without witness.</I> "But he shall not perish 
 alone in his iniquity; the watchman also shall be called to an account: 
 <I>His blood will I require at thy hand.</I> The blind leader shall 
 fall with the blind follower into the ditch." See what a desire God has 
 of the salvation of sinners, in that he resents it so ill if those 
 concerned do not what they can to prevent their destruction. And see 
 what a great deal those ministers have to answer for another day who 
 palliate sin, and flatter sinners in their evil way, and by their 
 wicked lives countenance and harden them in their wickedness, and 
 encourage them to believe that they shall have peace though they go 
 on.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. If he do his duty, he may take the comfort of it, though he do not 
 see the success of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>If thou warn the wicked of his way,</I> if thou tell him faithfully 
 what will be the end thereof, and call him earnestly to turn from it, 
 and he do not turn, but persist in it, <I>he shall die in his 
 iniquity,</I> and the fair warning given him will be an aggravation of 
 his sin and ruin; but <I>thou hast delivered thy soul.</I>" Note, It is 
 a comfort to ministers that they may through grace save themselves, 
 though they cannot be instrumental to save so many as they wish of 
 those that hear them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of
 Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins
 <I>be</I> upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live?
 &nbsp; 11  Say unto them, <I>As</I> I live, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, I have no
 pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn
 from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for
 why will ye die, O house of Israel?
 &nbsp; 12  Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy
 people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him
 in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the
 wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from
 his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for
 his <I>righteousness</I> in the day that he sinneth.
 &nbsp; 13  When I shall say to the righteous, <I>that</I> he shall surely
 live; if he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity,
 all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his
 iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die for it.
 &nbsp; 14  Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if
 he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;
 &nbsp; 15  <I>If</I> the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had
 robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing
 iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.
 &nbsp; 16  None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned
 unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall
 surely live.
 &nbsp; 17  Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is
 not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.
 &nbsp; 18  When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and
 committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby.
 &nbsp; 19  But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that
 which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.
 &nbsp; 20  Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of
 Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.

 These verses are the substance of what we had before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:20"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 20</A>,

 &c.) and they are so full and express a declaration of the terms on
 which people stand with God (as the former were of the terms on which 
 ministers stand) that it is no wonder that they are here repeated, as 
 those were, though we had the substance of them before. Observe 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The cavils of the people against God's proceedings with them. God 
 was now in his providence contending with them, but their uncircumcised 
 hearts were not as yet humbled, for they were industrious to justify 
 themselves, though thereby they reflected on God. Two things they 
 insisted upon, in their reproaches of God, and in both they added 
 iniquity to their sin and misery to their punishment:--

 1. They quarrelled with his promises and favours, as having no kindness
 nor sincerity in them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 God had <I>set life before them,</I> but they plead that he had set it 
 out of their reach, and therefore did but mock them with the mention of 
 it. The prophet had said, some time ago

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:23"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 23</A>),

 <I>You shall pine away for your iniquities;</I> with that word he had
 concluded his threatenings against Judah and Jerusalem; and this they 
 now upbraided him with, as if it had been spoken absolutely, to drive 
 them to despair; whereas it was spoken conditionally, to bring them to 
 repentance. Thus are the sayings of God's ministers perverted by men of 
 corrupt minds, who are inclined to pick quarrels. He puts them in hopes 
 of life and happiness; and herein they would make him contradict 
 himself; "for" (say they) "<I>if our transgressions and our sins be 
 upon us,</I> as thou hast often told us they are, and if we must, as 
 thou sayest, <I>pine away in them,</I> and wear out a miserable 
 captivity in a fruitless repentance, <I>how shall we then live?</I> If 
 this be our doom, there is no remedy. <I>We die, we perish, we all 
 perish.</I>" Note, It is very common for those that have been hardened 
 with presumption when they were warned against sin to sink into despair 
 when they are called to repent, and to conclude there is no hope of 
 life for them. 

 2. They quarrelled with his threatenings and judgments, as having no 
 justice or equity in them. They said, <I>The way of the Lord is not
 equal</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:17,20"><I>v.</I> 17, 20</A>),

 suggesting that God was partial in his proceedings, that with him there
 was respect of persons and that he was more severe against sin and 
 sinners than there was cause.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is a satisfactory answer given to both these cavils.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Those that despaired of finding mercy with God are here answered 
 with a solemn declaration of God's readiness to show mercy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 When they spoke of <I>pining away in their iniquity</I> God sent the 
 prophet to them, with all speed, to tell them that though their case 
 was sad it was not desperate, but there was yet <I>hope in Israel.</I> 
 
 (1.) It is certain that God has no delight in the ruin of sinners, nor 
 does he desire it. If they will destroy themselves, he will glorify 
 himself in it, but he has no pleasure in it, but would rather they 
 should <I>turn and live,</I> for his goodness is that attribute of his 
 which is most his glory, which is most his delight. He would rather 
 sinners should turn and live than go on and die. He has said it, he has 
 sworn it, that by these two immutable things, in both which it is 
 impossible for God to lie, we might have strong consolation. We have 
 his word and his oath; and, since he could <I>swear by no greater, he 
 swears by himself: As I live.</I> They questioned whether they should 
 <I>live,</I> though they did repent and reform; yea, says God, as sure 
 <I>as I live,</I> true penitents shall live also; for <I>their life is 
 hid with Christ in God.</I> 

 (2.) It is certain that God is sincere and in earnest in the calls he 
 gives sinners to repent: <I>Turn you, turn you, from your evil way.</I> 
 To repent is to turn from our evil way; this God requires sinners to 
 do; this he urges them to do by repeated pressing instances: <I>Turn 
 you, turn you.</I> O that they would be prevailed with to turn, to turn 
 quickly, without delay! This he will enable them to do if they will but 
 <I>frame their doings to turn to the Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:4">Hos. v. 4</A>.

 For he has said, <I>I will pour out my Spirit unto you,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:23">Prov. i. 23</A>.

 And in this he will accept of them; for it is not only what he 
 commands, but what he courts them to. 

 (3.) It is certain that, if sinners perish in their impenitency, it is 
 owing to themselves; they die because they will die; and herein they 
 act most absurdly and unreasonably: <I>Why will you die, O house of 
 Israel?</I> God would have heard them, and they would not be heard.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Those that despaired of finding justice with God are here answered 
 with a solemn declaration of the rule of judgment which God would go by 
 in dealing with the children of men, which carries along with it the 
 evidence of its own equity; he that runs may read the justice of it. 
 The Jewish nation, as a nation, was now <I>dead;</I> it was ruined to 
 all intents and purposes. The prophet must therefore deal with 
 particular persons, and the rule of judgment concerning them is much 
 like that concerning a nation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:8-10">Jer. xviii. 8-10</A>.

 If God speak concerning it to build and to plant, and it do wickedly,
 he will recall his favours and leave it to ruin. But if he speak 
 concerning it to pluck up and destroy, and it repent, he will revoke 
 the sentence and deliver it. So it is here. In short, The most
 plausible professors, if they apostatize, shall certainly perish for 
 ever in their apostasy from God; and the most notorious sinners, if 
 they repent, shall certainly be happy for ever in their return to God. 
 This is here repeated again and again, because it ought to be again and 
 again considered, and preached over to our own hearts. This was 
 necessary to be inculcated upon this stupid senseless people, that 
 said, <I>The way of the Lord is not equal;</I> for these rules of 
 judgment are so plainly just that they need no other confirmation of 
 them than the repetition of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) If those that have made a great profession of religion throw off 
 their profession, quit the good ways of God and grow loose and carnal, 
 sensual and worldly, the profession they made and all the religious 
 performances with which they had for a great while kept up the credit 
 of their profession shall stand them in no stead, but they shall 
 certainly perish in their iniquity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:12,13,18"><I>v.</I> 12, 13, 18</A>.

 [1.] God says to the <I>righteous man</I> that <I>he shall surely 
 live,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 He says it by his word, by his ministers. He that lives regularly, his 
 own heart tells him, his neighbours tell him, He shall live. Surely 
 such a man as this cannot but be happy. And it is certain, if he 
 proceed and persevere in his righteousness, and if, in order to that, 
 he be upright and sincere in it, if he be really as good as he seems to 
 be, he shall live; he shall continue in the love of God and be for ever 
 happy in that love. 

 [2.] Righteous men, who have very good hopes of themselves and whom 
 others have a very good opinion of, are yet in danger of turning to 
 iniquity by trusting to their righteousness. So the case is put here: 
 <I>If he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity,</I> and 
 come to make a trade of sin--if he not only take a false step, but turn 
 aside into a false way and persist in it. This may possibly be the
 case of a righteous man, and it is the effect of his trusting to his 
 own righteousness. Note, Many eminent professors have been ruined by a 
 proud conceitedness of themselves and confidence in themselves. He 
 trust to the merit of his own righteousness, and thinks he has already 
 made God so much his debtor that now he may venture to commit iniquity, 
 for he has righteousness enough in stock to make amends for it; he 
 fancies that whatever evil deeds he may do hereafter he can be in no 
 danger from them, having so many good deeds beforehand to 
 counterbalance them. Or, He trust to the strength of his own 
 righteousness, thinks himself now so well established in a course of 
 virtue that he may thrust himself into any temptation and it cannot 
 overcome him, and so by presuming on his own sufficiency he is brought 
 to commit iniquity. By making bold on the confines of sin he is drawn 
 at length into the depths of hell. This ruined the Pharisees; they 
 <I>trusted to themselves that they were righteous,</I> and that their 
 long prayers, and fasting twice in the week, would atone for their 
 devouring widows' houses.

 [3.] If righteous men <I>turn to iniquity,</I> and return not to their 
 righteousness, they shall certainly perish in their iniquity, and all 
 the righteousness they have formerly done, all their prayers, and all 
 their alms, shall be forgotten. No mention shall be made, no 
 remembrance had, of their good deeds; they shall be overlooked, as if 
 they had never been. The <I>righteousness of the righteous shall not 
 deliver him</I> from the wrath of God, and the curse of the law, <I>in 
 the day of his transgression.</I> When he becomes a traitor and a 
 rebel, and takes up arms against his rightful Sovereign, it will not 
 serve for him to plead in his own defence that formerly he was a loyal 
 subject, and did many good services to the government. No; <I>he shall 
 not be able to live.</I> The remembrance of his former righteousness 
 shall be no satisfaction either to God's justice or his own conscience 
 <I>in the day that he sins,</I> but rather shall, in the estimate of 
 both, highly aggravate the sin and folly of his apostasy. And therefore 
 <I>for his iniquity that he committed he shall die,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 And again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),
 
 <I>He shall even die thereby;</I> and it is owing to himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) If those that have lived a wicked life repent and reform, forsake 
 their wicked ways and become religious, their sins shall be pardoned, 
 and they shall be justified and saved, if they persevere in their 
 reformation. 

 [1.] God says <I>to the wicked, "Thou shalt surely die.</I> The way 
 that thou art in leads to destruction. The wages of thy sin is death, 
 and thy iniquity will shortly be thy ruin." It was said to the 
 righteous man, <I>Thou shalt surely live,</I> for his encouragement to 
 proceed and persevere in the way of righteousness; but he made an ill 
 use of it, and was emboldened by it to commit iniquity. It was said to
 the wicked man, <I>Thou shalt surely die,</I> for warning to him not to 
 persist in his wicked ways; and he makes a good use of it, and is 
 quickened thereby to return to God and duty. Thus even the threatenings 
 of the word are to some, by the grace of God, a savour of life unto 
 life, while even the promises of the word become to others, by their 
 own corruption, a savour of death unto death. When God says to the 
 wicked man, <I>Thou shalt surely die,</I> die eternally, it is to 
 frighten him, not out of his wits, but out of his sins.

 [2.] There is many a wicked man who was hastening apace to his own 
 destruction who yet is wrought upon by the grace of God to return and 
 repent, and live a holy life. He <I>turns from his sin</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 and is resolved that he will have no more to do with it; and, as an 
 evidence of his repentance for wrong done, he <I>restores the 
 pledge</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 which he had taken uncharitably from the poor, <I>he gives again that 
 which he had robbed</I> and taken unjustly from the rich. Nor does he 
 only <I>cease to do evil,</I> but he <I>learns to do well;</I> he 
 <I>does that which is lawful and right,</I> and makes conscience of his 
 duty both to God and man--a great change, since, awhile ago, he neither 
 feared God nor regarded man. But many such amazing changes, and blessed 
 ones, have been wrought by the power of divine grace. He that was going 
 on in the paths of death and the destroyer now walks in <I>the statues 
 of life,</I> in the way of God's commandments, which has both life in 
 it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+12:28">Prov. xii. 28</A>)

 and life at the end of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:17">Matt. xix. 17</A>.

 And in this good way he perseveres <I>without committing iniquity,</I> 
 though not free from remaining infirmity, yet under the dominion of no 
 iniquity. He repents not of his repentance, nor returns to the 
 commission of those gross sins which he before allowed himself in. 

 [3.] He that does thus repent and return shall escape the ruin he was 
 running into, and his former sins shall be no prejudice to his 
 acceptance with God. Let him not pine away in his iniquity, for, if he 
 confess and forsake it, he shall find mercy. He <I>shall surely live; 
 he shall not die,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 Again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 <I>He shall surely live.</I> Again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 <I>He has done that which is lawful and right,</I> and <I>he shall live 
 thereby.</I> But will not his wickednesses be remembered against him?
 No; he shall not be punished for them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>As for the wickedness of the wicked,</I> though it was very heinous, 
 <I>yet he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turns from his 
 wickedness.</I> Now that it has become his grief it shall not be his 
 ruin. Now that there is a settled separation between him and sin there 
 shall be no longer a separation between him and God. Nay, he shall not
 be so much as upbraided with them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>None of his sins that he has committed shall be mentioned unto 
 him,</I> either as a clog to his pardon or an allay to the comfort of 
 it, or as any blemish and diminution to the glory that is prepared for 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now lay all this together, and then judge whether the <I>way of the 
 Lord be not equal,</I> whether this will not justify God in the 
 destruction of sinners and glorify him in the salvation of penitents. 
 The conclusion of the whole matter is 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>"O you house of Israel,</I> though you are all involved now in the 
 common calamity, yet there shall be a distinction of persons made in 
 the spiritual and eternal state, and <I>I will judge you every one 
 after his ways.</I>" Though they were sent into captivity by the lump, 
 good fish and bad enclosed in the same net, yet there he will separate 
 between the precious and the vile and will <I>render to every man 
 according to his works.</I> Therefore God's way is equal and 
 unexceptionable; but, as for the <I>children of thy people,</I> God 
 turns them over to the prophet, as he did to Moses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:7">Exod. xxxii. 7</A>):

 "They are thy people; I can scarcely own them for mine." As for them,
 <I>their way is unequal;</I> this way which they have got of 
 quarrelling with God and his prophets is absurd and unreasonable. In 
 all disputes between God and his creatures it will certainly be found 
 that he is in the right and they are in the wrong.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in
 the tenth <I>month,</I> in the fifth <I>day</I> of the month, <I>that</I> one
 that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city
 is smitten.
 &nbsp; 22  Now the hand of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was upon me in the evening, afore
 he that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came
 to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more
 dumb.
 &nbsp; 23  Then the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 24  Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of
 Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land:
 but we <I>are</I> many; the land is given us for inheritance.
 &nbsp; 25  Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Ye eat
 with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed
 blood: and shall ye possess the land?

 live, surely they that <I>are</I> in the wastes shall fall by the
 sword, and him that <I>is</I> in the open field will I give to the
 beasts to be devoured, and they that <I>be</I> in the forts and in the
 caves shall die of the pestilence.
 &nbsp; 28  For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her
 strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be
 desolate, that none shall pass through.

 the land most desolate because of all their abominations which

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The tidings brought to Ezekiel of the burning of Jerusalem by the 
 Chaldeans. The city was burnt in the eleventh year of the captivity and 
 the fifth month, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:12,13">Jer. lii. 12, 13</A>.

 Tidings hereof were brought to the prophet by one that was an
 eye-witness of the destruction, in the twelfth year, and the tenth 
 month

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 which was a year and almost five months after the thing was done; we 
 may well suppose that, there being a constant correspondence at this 
 time more than ever kept up between Jerusalem and Babylon, he had heard 
 the news long before. But this was the first time he had an account of 
 it from a refugee, from one who escaped, who could be particular, and 
 would be pathetic, in the narrative of it. And the sign given him was 
 the coming of such a one to him as had himself narrowly escaped the 
 flames

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:26"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 26</A>):

 <I>He that escapes in that day shall come unto thee,</I> to <I>cause
 thee to hear it with thy ears,</I> to hear it more distinctly than 
 ever, from one that could say, <I>Qu&aelig;que ipse miserrima 
 vidi--These miserable scenes I saw.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The divine impressions and influences he was under, to prepare him 
 for those heavy tidings 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>The hand of the Lord was upon me before he came, and had opened my 
 mouth</I> to speak to the house of Israel what we had in the former 
 part of this chapter. And now <I>he was no more dumb;</I> he prophesied 
 now with more freedom and boldness, being by the event proved a true 
 prophet, to the confusion of those that contradicted him. All the 
 prophecies from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:1-32:32"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. to this chapter</A>

 have relation purely to the nations about, it is probable that the
 prophet, when he received them from the Lord, did not deliver them by 
 word of mouth, but in writing; for he could not <I>Say to the 
 Ammonites, Say unto Tyrus, Say unto Pharaoh,</I> &c., so and so, but by 
 letters directed to the persons concerned, as Zacharias, when he could 
 not speak, wrote; and herein he was as truly executing his prophetic 
 office as ever. Note, Even silenced ministers may be doing a great deal 
 of good by writing letters and making visits. But now the prophet's
 <I>mouth is opened,</I> that he may <I>speak to the children of his 
 people.</I> It is probable that he had, during these three years, been 
 continually speaking to them as a friend, putting them in mind of what 
 he had formerly delivered to them, but that he never spoke to them as a 
 prophet, by inspiration, till now, when <I>the hand of the Lord came 
 upon him,</I> renewed his commission, gave him fresh instructions, and 
 <I>opened his mouth,</I> furnished him with power to speak to the 
 people <I>as he ought to speak.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The particular message he was entrusted with, relating to these 
 Jews that yet remained in the <I>land of Israel,</I> and <I>inhabited 
 the wastes</I> of that land, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 See what work sin had made. <I>The cities of</I> Israel had now become 
 the wastes of Israel, for they lay all in ruins; some few that had 
 escaped the sword and captivity still continued there and began to 
 think of re-settling. This was so long after the destruction of 
 Jerusalem that it was some time before this that Gedaliah (a modest 
 humble man) and his friends were slain; but probably at this time 
 Johanan, and the <I>proud men</I> that joined with him, were at the 
 height 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+43:2">Jer. xliii. 2</A>);

 and before they came to a resolution to go into Egypt, wherein Jeremiah
 opposed them, it is probable that the project was to establish 
 themselves in the wastes of the land of Israel, in which Ezekiel here 
 opposed them, and probably despatched the message away by the person 
 that brought him the news of Jerusalem's destruction. Or, perhaps, 
 those here prophesied against might be some other party of Jews, that 
 remained in the land, hoping to take root there and to be sole masters 
 of it, after Johanan and his forces had gone into Egypt. Now here we 
 have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. An account of the pride of these remaining Jews, who dwelt in the 
 <I>wastes of the land of</I> Israel. Though the providence of God 
 concerning them had been very humbling, and still was very threatening, 
 yet they were intolerably haughty and secure, and promised themselves 
 peace. He that brought the news to the prophet that Jerusalem was 
 smitten could not tell him (it is likely) what these people said, but 
 God tells him, <I>They say, "The land is given us for inheritance,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Our partners being gone, it is now all our own by survivorship, or, for 
 want of heirs, it comes to us as occupants; we shall now be placed 
 alone in the midst of the earth and have it all to ourselves." This 
 argues great stupidity under the weighty hand of God, and a reigning 
 selfishness and narrow-spiritedness; they pleased themselves in the 
 ruin of their country as long as they hoped to find their own account 
 in it, cared not though it were <I>all waste,</I> so that they might 
 have the sole property--a poor inheritance to be proud of! They have 
 the impudence to compare their case with Abraham's, glorying in this, 
 <I>We have Abraham to our father.</I> "Abraham," say they, "<I>was 
 one,</I> one family, and <I>he inherited the land,</I> and lived many 
 years in the peaceable enjoyment of it; <I>but we are many,</I> many 
 families, more numerous than he; <I>the land is given us for 
 inheritance.</I>" 

 (1.) They think they can make out as good a title from God to this land 
 as Abraham could: "If God <I>gave this land</I> to him, who was but one 
 worshipper of him, as a reward of his service, much more will he give 
 it to us, who are many worshippers of him, as the reward of our 
 service." This shows the great conceit they had of the own merits, as 
 if they were greater than those of Abraham their father, who yet was 
 not justified by works. 

 (2.) They think they can make good the possession of this land against 
 the Chaldeans and all others invaders, as well as Abraham could against 
 those that were competitors with him for it: "If he, who was but one, 
 could hold it, much more shall we, who are many, and have many more at 
 command than his 300 <I>trained servants.</I>" This shows the 
 confidence they had in their own might; they had got possession, and 
 were resolved to keep it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. A check to this pride. Since God's providences did neither humble 
 them nor terrify them, he sends them a message sufficient to do 
 both.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) To humble them, he tells them of the wickedness they still 
 persisted in, which rendered them utterly unworthy to possess this 
 land, so that they could not expect God should give it to them. They 
 had been followed with one judgment after another, but they had not 
 profited by those means of grace as might be expected; they were still 
 unreformed, and how could they expect <I>that they should possess the 
 land? "Shall you possess the land?</I> What! such wicked people as you 
 are? <I>How shall I put thee among the children, and give thee a 
 pleasant land?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:19">Jer. iii. 19</A>.

 Surely you never reflect upon yourselves, else you would rather wonder
 that you are in the land of the living than expect to possess this 
 land. For do you now know how bad you are?"

 [1.] "You make no conscience of forbidden fruit, forbidden food: <I>You 
 eat with the blood,</I>" directly contrary to one of the precepts given 
 to Noah and his sons when God gave them possession of the earth, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:4">Gen. ix. 4</A>.

 [2.] "Idolatry, that covenant-breaking sin, that sin which the jealous
 God has been in a particular manner provoked by to lay your country 
 waste, is still the sin that most easily besets you and which you have 
 a strong inclination to: <I>You lift up your eyes towards your 
 idols,</I> which is a sign that though perhaps you do not bow your knee 
 to them so much as you have done, yet you set your hearts upon them and 
 hanker after them."

 [3.] "You are as fierce, and cruel, and barbarous as ever: <I>You shed 
 blood,</I> innocent blood."

 [4.] "You confide in your own strength, your own arm, your own bow, and 
 have no dependence on, or regard to, God and his providence: <I>You 
 stand upon your sword</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>);

 you think to carry all before you, and make all your own, by force of 
 arms." How can those expect the inheritance of Isaac (as these did) who 
 are of Ishmael's disposition, that had <I>his hand against every 
 man</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+16:12">Gen. xvi. 12</A>),

 and Esau's resolution to <I>live by his sword?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:40">Gen. xxvii. 40</A>.

 We met with those

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:27"><I>ch.</I> xxxii. 27</A>)

 who, when they died, thought they could not lie easy underground unless
 they had their swords under their heads. Here we meet with those who, 
 while they live, think they cannot stand firmly above ground unless 
 they have their swords under their feet, as if swords were both the 
 softest pillows and the strongest pillars; though it was sin, it was 
 sin, that first drew the sword. But, blessed be God, there are those 
 who know better, who stand upon the support of the divine power and 
 promise and lay their heads in the bosom of divine love, <I>not 
 trusting in their own sword,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:3">Ps. xliv. 3</A>.

 [5.] "You are guilty of all manner of abominations, and, particularly, 
 <I>you defile every one his neighbour's wife,</I> which is an 
 abomination of the first magnitude, <I>and shall you possess the 
 land?</I> What! such vile miscreants as you?" Note, Those cannot expect 
 to <I>possess the land,</I> nor to enjoy any true comfort or happiness 
 here or hereafter, who live in rebellion against the Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) To terrify them, he tells them of the further judgments God had in 
 store for them, which should make them utterly unable to possess this 
 land, so that they could not stand it out against the enemy. Do they 
 say that they shall possess the land? God has said they shall not, he
 has sworn it, <I>As I live, saith the Lord.</I> Though he has sworn 
 that he delights not <I>in the death of sinners,</I> yet he has sworn 
 also that those who persist in impenitency and unbelief <I>shall not 
 enter into his rest.</I> 

 [1.] Those that are in the cities, here called the <I>wastes,</I> shall 
 <I>fall by the sword,</I> either by the sword of the Chaldeans, who 
 come to avenge the murder of Gedaliah, or by one another's swords, in 
 their intestine broils.

 [2.] Those that are in the open field shall be <I>devoured by</I> wild 
 <I>beasts,</I> which swarmed, of course, in the country when it was 
 dispeopled, and there were none to master them and keep them under, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:29">Exod. xxiii. 29</A>.

 When the army of the enemy had quitted the country still there was no
 safety in it. <I>Noisome beasts</I> constituted one of the four
 <I>sore judgments,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:15"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 15</A>.

 [3.] Those that are <I>in the forts and in the caves,</I> that think
 themselves safe in artificial or natural fastnesses, because men's eyes 
 cannot discover them nor men's darts reach them, there the arrows of 
 the Almighty shall find them out; they shall <I>die of the 
 pestilence.</I> 

 [4.] The whole land, even the land of Israel, that had been the glory
 of all lands, shall be <I>most desolate,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 <I>It shall be desolation, desolation,</I> all over as desolate as
 desolation itself can make it. The <I>mountain of Israel,</I> the 
 fruitful mountains, Zion itself the holy mountain not excepted, 
 <I>shall be desolate,</I> the roads unfrequented, the houses 
 uninhabited, that <I>none shall pass through;</I> as it was threatened 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:62">Deut. xxviii. 62</A>),
 
 <I>You shall be left few in number.</I>

 [5.] The <I>pomp of her strength,</I> whatever she glories in as her 
 pomp and trusts to as her strength, shall be made to cease.

 [6.] The cause of all this was very bad; it is for <I>all their 
 abominations which they have committed.</I> It is sin that does all 
 this mischief, that makes nations desolate; and therefore we ought to 
 call it an abomination.

 [7.] Yet the effect of all this will be very good: <I>Then shall they
 know that I am the Lord,</I> am their Lord, and shall return to their 
 allegiance, <I>when I have made the land most desolate.</I> Those are 
 untractable unteachable indeed that are not made to know their 
 dependence upon God when all their creature-comforts fail them and are 
 made desolate.</P>

 their heart goeth after their covetousness.
 &nbsp; 32  And, lo, thou <I>art</I> unto them as a very lovely song of one
 that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument:
 for they hear thy words, but they do them not.
 &nbsp; 33  And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall
 they know that a prophet hath been among them.

 The 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:1-29">foregoing verses</A>

 spoke conviction to the Jews who remained in the land of Israel, who
 were monuments of sparing mercy and yet returned not to the Lord; in 
 these verses those are reproved who were now in captivity in Babylon, 
 under divine rebukes, and yet were not reformed by them. They are not 
 indeed charged with the same gross enormities that the others are 
 charged with. They made some show of religion and devotion; but their 
 hearts were not right with God. The thing they are here accused of is 
 <I>mocking the messengers of the lord,</I> one of their measure-filling 
 sins, which brought this ruin upon them, and yet they were not cured of 
 it. Two ways they mocked the prophet Ezekiel:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. By invidious ill natured reflections upon him, privately among 
 themselves, endeavouring by all means possible to render him 
 despicable. The prophet did not know it, but charitably thought that 
 those who spoke so well to him to his face, with so much seeming 
 respect and deference, would surely not speak ill of him behind his 
 back. But God comes and tells him, <I>The children of thy people are 
 still talking against thee</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 or <I>talking of thee,</I> no good, I doubt. Note, Public persons are a 
 common theme or subject of discourse; every one takes a liberty to 
 censure them at pleasure. Faithful ministers know not how much ill is
 said of them every day; it is well that they do not; for, if they did, 
 it might prove a discouragement to them in their work not to be easily 
 got over. God takes notice of all that is said against his ministers, 
 not only what is decreed against them, or sworn against them, not only 
 what is written against them, or spoken with solemnity and 
 deliberation, but of what is said against them in common talk, among 
 neighbours when they meet in an evening, <I>by the walls and in the 
 doors of their houses,</I> where whatever freedom of speech they use, 
 if they reproach and slander any of God's ministers, God will reckon 
 with them for it; his prophets shall not be made the song of the 
 drunkards always. They had no crime to lay to the prophet's charge, but 
 they loved to talk of him in a careless, scornful, bantering way; they 
 said, jokingly, "<I>Come, and let us hear what is the word that comes 
 forth from the Lord;</I> perhaps it will be something new, and will 
 entertain us, and furnish us with matter for discourse." Note, Those 
 have arrived as a great pitch of profaneness who can make so great a 
 privilege, and so great a duty, as the preaching and hearing of the 
 word of God, a matter of sport and ridicule, yea though it be not done 
 publicly, but in private conversation among themselves. Serious things 
 should be spoken of seriously.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. By dissembling with him in their attendance upon his ministry. 
 Hypocrites mock God and mock his prophets. But their hypocrisy is open 
 before God, and the day is coming when, as here, it will be laid open. 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The plausible profession which these people made and the 
 speciousness of their pretensions. They are like those 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:8">Matt. xv. 8</A>)

 who <I>draw nigh to God with their mouths and honour him with their
 lips, but their hearts are far from him.</I>

 (1.) They were diligent and constant in their attendance upon the means 
 of grace: <I>They come unto thee as the people come.</I> In Babylon 
 they had no temple or synagogue, but they went to the prophet's house

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:1"><I>ch.</I> viii. 1</A>),

 and there, it is probable, they spent their <I>new moons and their
 sabbaths</I> in religious exercises, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+4:23">2 Kings iv. 23</A>.

 When the prophet was bound the word of the Lord was not bound; and the
 people, when they had not the help for their souls that they wished 
 for, were thankful for what they had; it was a reviving in their 
 bondage. Now these hypocrites came, <I>according to the coming of the 
 people,</I> as duly and as early as any of the prophet's hearers. Their 
 being said to come <I>as the people came</I> seems to intimate that the 
 reason why they came was because other people came; they did not come 
 out of conscience towards God, but only for company, for fashion-sake, 
 and because it was now the custom of their countrymen. Note, Those that 
 have no inward principle of love to God's ordinances may yet be found 
 much in the external observance of them. Cain brought his sacrifice as 
 well as Abel; and the Pharisee went up to the temple to pray as well as 
 the publican.

 (2.) They behaved themselves very decently and reverently in the public 
 assembly; there were none of them whispering, or laughing, or gazing 
 about them, or sleeping. But <I>they sit before thee as my people,</I> 
 with all the shows of gravity, and sereneness, and composure of mind.
 They sit out the time, without weariness, or wishing the sermon done.
 
 (3.) They were very attentive to the word preached: "They are not
 thinking of something else, but they <I>hear thy words,</I> and take 
 notice of what thou sayest." 

 (4.) They pretended to have a great kindness and respect for the 
 prophet. Though, behind his back, they could not give him a good word, 
 yet, to his face, <I>they showed much love</I> to him and his doctrine; 
 they pretended to have a great concern lest he should spend himself too 
 much in preaching or expose himself to the Chaldeans, for they would be 
 thought to be some of his best friends and well-wishers. 

 (5.) They took a great deal of pleasure in the word; they <I>delighted 
 to know God's word,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:2">Isa. lviii. 2</A>.

 <I>Herod heard John Baptist gladly,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:20">Mark vi. 20</A>.

 <I>Thou art unto them as a very lovely song.</I> Ezekiel's matter was
 surprising, his language fine, his expressions elegant, his similitudes 
 apt, his voice melodious, and his delivery graceful; so that they could 
 sit with as much pleasure to hear him preach as (if I may speak in the 
 language of our times) to see a play or an opera, or to hear a concert 
 of music. Ezekiel was to them as one <I>that had a pleasant voice</I>
 and could sing well, <I>or play well on an instrument.</I> Note, Men 
 may have their fancies pleased by the word, and yet not have their 
 consciences touched nor their hearts changed, the itching ear gratified 
 and yet not the corrupt nature sanctified.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The hypocrisy of these professions and pretensions; it is all a
 sham, it is all a jest. 

 (1.) They have no cordial affection for the word of God. While they 
 <I>show much love</I> it is only <I>with the mouth,</I> from the teeth 
 outward, but <I>their heart goes after their covetousness;</I> they are 
 as much set upon the world as ever, as much in love and league with it 
 as ever. Hearing the word is only their diversion and recreation, a 
 pretty amusement now and then for an hour or two. But still their main 
 business is with their farm and merchandise; the bent and bias of their 
 souls are towards them, and their <I>inward thoughts</I> are employed 
 in projects about them. Note, Covetousness is the ruining sin of 
 multitudes that make a great profession of religion; it is the love of 
 the world that secretly eats the love of God out of their hearts. 
 <I>The cares of</I> this world and the deceitfulness of riches are the 
 <I>thorns</I> that <I>choke the seed,</I> and choke the soul too. And 
 those neither please God nor profit themselves who, when they are 
 hearing the word of God, are musing upon their worldly affairs. God has 
 his eye on the hearts that do so. 

 (2.) They yield no subjection to it. They <I>hear thy words,</I> but
 it is only a hearing that they <I>give thee,</I> for they <I>will not 
 do them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.
 
 And again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),

 they <I>do them not.</I> They will not be persuaded by all the prophet 
 can say, either by authority or argument, to cross themselves in any 
 instance, to part with any one beloved sin, or apply themselves to any 
 one duty that is against the grain to flesh and blood. Note, There are 
 many who take pleasure in hearing the word, but make no conscience of 
 doing it; and so they build upon the sand, and deceive themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Let us see what will be in the end hereof: <I>Shall their 
 unbelief</I> and carelessness <I>make the word of God of no effect?</I> 
 By no means. 

 (1.) God will confirm the prophet's word, though they contemn it, and 
 make light of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 What he says will come to pass, and not one jot or one tittle shall 
 fall to the ground. Note, The curses of the law, though they may be 
 bantered by profane wits, cannot be baffled. 

 (2.) They themselves shall rue their folly when it is too late. When it 
 comes to pass <I>they shall know,</I> shall know to their cost, know to 
 their confusion, that <I>a prophet has been among them,</I> though they 
 made no more of him than as one that <I>had a pleasant voice.</I> Note, 
 Those who will not consider that a prophet is among them, and who 
 improve not the day of their visitation while it is continued, will be 
 made to remember that a prophet has been among them when the things 
 that belong to their peace are <I>hidden from their eyes.</I> The day 
 is coming when vain and worldly men will have other thoughts of things 
 than now they have, and will feel a weight in that which they made 
 light of. They shall know that <I>a prophet has been among them</I> 
 when they see the event exactly answer the prediction, and the prophet 
 himself shall be a witness against them that they had fair warning 
 given them, but would not take it. When Ezekiel is gone, whom now they 
 speak against, and <I>there is no more any prophet,</I> nor any <I>to 
 show them how long,</I> then they will remember that once they had a 
 prophet, but knew not how to use him well. Note, Those who will not 
 know the worth of mercies by the improvement of them will justly be 
 made to know the worth of them by the want of them, as those who should 
 desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, which now they 
 slighted, and might not see it.</P>
