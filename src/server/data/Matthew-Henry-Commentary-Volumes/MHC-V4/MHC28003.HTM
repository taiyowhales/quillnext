 God is still by the prophet inculcating the same thing upon this 
 careless people, and much in the same manner as before, by a type or 
 sign, that of the dealings of a husband with an adulterous wife. In 
 this chapter we have, 

 I. The bad character which the people of Israel now had; they were, as
 is said of the Athenians 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:16">Acts xvii. 16</A>),

 "wholly given to idolatry," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+3:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. The low condition which they should be reduced to by their
 captivity, and the other instances of God's controversy with them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+3:2-4">ver. 2-4</A>.

 III. The blessed reformation that should at length be wrought upon them
 in the latter days,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then said the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of
 <I>her</I> friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and
 love flagons of wine.
 &nbsp; 2  So I bought her to me for fifteen <I>pieces</I> of silver, and
 <I>for</I> a homer of barley, and a half homer of barley:
 &nbsp; 3  And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou
 shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for <I>another</I>
 man: so <I>will</I> I also <I>be</I> for thee.
 &nbsp; 4  For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a
 king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without
 an image, and without an ephod, and <I>without</I> teraphim:
 &nbsp; 5  Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> their God, and David their king; and shall fear the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> and
 his goodness in the latter days.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Some think that this chapter refers to Judah, the two tribes, as the 
 adulteress the prophet married 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:3"><I>ch.</I> i. 3</A>)

 represented the <I>ten tribes;</I> for this was not to be divorced, as
 the ten tribes were, but to be left desolate for a long time, and then 
 to return, as the two tribes did. But these are called the <I>children 
 of Israel,</I> which was the ten tribes, and therefore it is more 
 probable that of them this parable, as well as that before, is to be 
 understood. <I>Go,</I> and repeat it, says God to the prophet; <I>Go 
 yet again.</I> Note, For the conviction and reduction of sinners it is 
 necessary that precept be upon precept, and line upon line. If they 
 will not believe one sign, try another, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:8,9">Exod. iv. 8, 9</A>.
 
 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. In this parable we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God's goodness and Israel's badness strangely serving for a foil to 
 each other, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Israel is as a woman <I>beloved of her friend,</I> either of him that 
 has married her or of him that only courts her, and <I>yet an 
 adulteress;</I> such is the case between God and Israel. We say of 
 those whose affection is mutual that there is <I>no love lost</I> 
 between them; but here we find a great deal of the love even of God 
 himself lost and thrown away upon an unworthy ungrateful people. The
 God of Israel retains a very great love for the <I>children of 
 Israel,</I> and yet they are an evil and adulterous generation. <I>Be 
 astonished, O heavens! at this, and wonder, O earth!</I> 

 (1.) That God's goodness has not put an end to their badness; the Lord 
 loves them, has a kindness for them, and is continually showing 
 kindness to them; they know it, they cannot but own it, that he has 
 been as a friend and Father to them; and yet they <I>look to other 
 gods,</I> gods that they can see, and to the love of which they are 
 drawn by the eye; they look to them with an eye of adoration (they 
 offer up all their services to them) and with an eye of dependence 
 (they expect all their comforts from them); if they were restrained 
 from bowing the knee to idols, yet they gave them an amorous glance, 
 and had <I>eyes full of that</I> spiritual <I>adultery.</I> And they 
 loved <I>flagons of wine;</I> they joined with idolaters because they 
 lived merrily and drank hard; they had a kindness for <I>other gods</I> 
 for the sake of the plenty of good wine with which they had been 
 sometimes treated in their temples. Idolatry and sensuality commonly go 
 together; those that make a god of their belly, as drunkards do, will 
 easily be brought to make a god of any thing else. God's priests were 
 to <I>drink no wine</I> when they went in to minister, and his 
 Nazarites none at all. But the worshippers of other gods <I>drank wine
 in bowls;</I> nay, no less than <I>flagons of wine</I> would content 
 them. 

 (2.) That their badness had not stopped the current of his favours to 
 them. This is a wonder of mercy indeed, that she is thus <I>beloved of 
 her friend, though an adulteress;</I> such is the <I>love of the Lord 
 towards the children of Israel.</I> "Go," says God, "<I>love</I> such a 
 woman; see if thou canst find in thy heart to do it. No, thou canst 
 not, the breast of no man would admit such a love; yet such is my 
 <I>love to the children of Israel;</I> it is love to the loveless, to 
 the unlovely, to those that have a thousand times forfeited it." Note, 
 In God's goodwill to poor sinners his thoughts and ways are infinitely 
 above ours, and his love is more condescending and compassionate than 
 ours is, or can be; in this, as much as any thing, he is <I>God, and 
 not man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:9">Hos. xi. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The method found for the bringing of a God so very good and a people 
 so very bad together again; this is the thing aimed at, and what God 
 aims at he will accomplish. To our great surprise, we find a breach 
 thus wide as the sea effectually healed; miracles cease not so long as 
 divine mercy does not cease. Observe here, 

 (1.) The course God takes to humble them and make them know themselves

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and a homer and a 
 half of barley,</I> that is, I courted her to be reconciled, to leave 
 her ill courses, and return to her first husband, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:14"><I>ch.</I> ii. 14</A>.

 I <I>allured</I> her, and <I>spoke comfortably</I> to her; as the
 <I>Levite who went after</I> his concubine that had <I>played the 
 harlot</I> from him, and had run away with another man, <I>spoke 
 friendly to her,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:3">Judg. xix. 3</A>.

 But here the present which the prophet brought her for the purchasing
 of her favour is observed to be a very small one; but it was all that 
 was intended for her separate maintenance, and in it she is reduced to 
 a short allowance, and, to punish her for her pride, is made to look 
 very mean. When Samson went to be reconciled to his wife that had 
 disobliged him he <I>visited her with a kid</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+15:1">Judg. xv. 1</A>),

 which was a genteel entertainment. But the prophet here visited his
 wife with <I>fifteen pieces of silver,</I> a small sum, which yet she 
 must be content to live upon a great while, so long as till her husband 
 thought fit to restore her to her first estate. She shall also have 
 <I>a homer and a half of barley,</I> for bread-corn, and that is all 
 she must expect till she be sufficiently humbled, and, by a competent 
 time of trial, satisfactory proof given that she is indeed reformed. 
 Let her be made sensible that it is not for her own merit that her 
 husband makes court to her; it is but a lame price that he values her 
 at. The price of a servant was thirty shekels, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+21:32">Exod. xxi. 32</A>.

 This was but half so much; yet let her know that it is more than she is
 worth. God had given Egypt for Israel's ransom once, so precious were 
 they then in his sight, and so honourable,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:3">Isa. xliii. 3, 4</A>.
 
 But now that they have gone a whoring from him he will give but fifteen 
 pieces of silver for them, so much have they lost in their value by 
 their iniquity. Note, Those whom God designs honour and comfort for he 
 first makes sensible of their own worthlessness, and brings them to 
 acknowledge, with the prodigal, <I>I am no more worthy to be called thy 
 son.</I> Time was when Israel was <I>fed with the finest of the 
 wheat,</I> but they grew wanton, <I>and loved flagons of wine,</I> and 
 therefore, in order to the humbling and reducing of them, they must be 
 brought in the land of their captivity to eat barley-bread, and be 
 thankful they can get it, and to eat that too by weight and measure, 
 whereas they did not use to be stinted. Note, Poverty and disgrace
 sometimes prove a happy means of making great sinners true penitents. 

 (2.) The new terms upon which God is willing to come with them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Thou shalt abide for me many days, and shalt not be for another, so
 will I be for thee.</I> He might justly have given them a bill of 
 divorce, and have resolved to have no more to do with them; but he is 
 willing to show them kindness, and that the matter should be 
 compromised; he deals not with them in strict justice, according to the 
 rigour of the law, but according to the multitude of his mercies; and 
 it represents God's gracious dealings with the apostate race of 
 mankind, that had gone a whoring from him; he bought them indeed with 
 an inestimable price, not for their honour, but for the honour of his 
 own justice; and now this is the proposal he makes to them, the 
 covenant of grace he is willing to enter into with them--they must be 
 to him a people, and he will be to them a God, the same with the 
 proposal here made to Israel. 

 [1.] They must take to themselves the shame of their apostasy from him, 
 must submit to, and accept of, the punishment of their iniquity: 
 <I>Thou shalt abide for me many days</I> in <I>solitude</I> and 
 <I>silence,</I> as a widow that is <I>desolate</I> and in sorrow; they 
 must <I>lay aside their ornaments,</I> and wait with patience and 
 submission to know what God will do with them, and whether he will 
 please to admit such unworthy wretches into his favour again, as they 
 did 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+33:4,5">Exod. xxxiii. 4, 5</A>.

 <I>Their father,</I> their husband, has <I>spit in their face</I> (as
 God said concerning Miriam), has put them under the marks of his 
 displeasure, and therefore, like her, they must be <I>ashamed seven 
 days,</I> and be <I>shut out of the camp</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:14">Num. xii. 14</A>),
 
 till <I>their uncircumcised hearts be humbled,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:41">Lev. xxvi. 41</A>.
 
 Let them <I>sit alone</I> and <I>keep silence, waiting for the 
 salvation of the Lord,</I> and in the mean time let them <I>bear the 
 yoke,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:26-28">Lam. iii. 26-28</A>.

 Let them not expect that God should speedily return in mercy to them,;
 no, let them want it, let them wait for it <I>many days,</I> during all 
 the days of their captivity, and reckon it a miracle of mercy, and well 
 worth waiting for, it if come at last. Note, Those whom God designs
 mercy for he will first bring to abase themselves and to put a high 
 value upon his favours.

 [2.] They must never return to folly again; that is the condition upon 
 which God will <I>speak peace to his people and to his saints</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+85:8">Ps. lxxxv. 8</A>),

 and no other. "<I>Thou shalt not play the harlot,</I> shalt not worship
 idols in the land of thy captivity, while thou art there set apart for 
 the uncleanness." Note, It is not enough to take shame to ourselves for 
 the sins we have committed, and to justify God in correcting us for 
 them, but we must resolve, in the strength of God's grace, that we will 
 not offend any more, that we will not again go a whoring from God, 
 after the world and the flesh. Blessed be God, though it is the law of 
 the covenant, it is not the condition of it that we shall never in any 
 thing do amiss: "But thou shalt not <I>play the harlot;</I> thou shalt 
 not serve other gods, <I>shalt not be for another man.</I>" In the land 
 of their captivity they would be courted to worship the idols of the 
 country; that would be a trial for them, a <I>long</I> trial, many 
 days: "But if thou keep thy ground, and hold fast thy integrity, if, 
 when <I>all this comes upon thee,</I> thou dost not <I>stretch out thy 
 hand to a strange god,</I> thou wilt be qualified for the returns of 
 God's favour." Note, It is a certain sign that our afflictions are 
 means of much good to us, and earnests of more, when we are kept by the 
 grace of God from being overcome by the temptations of an afflicted 
 state.

 [3.] Upon these terms their Maker will again be their husband: <I>So 
 will I also be for thee.</I> This is the covenant between God and 
 returning sinners, that, if they will be for him to serve him, he will 
 be for them to save them. Let them renounce and abjure all rivals with 
 God for the throne in the heart, and devote themselves entirely to him 
 and him only, and he will be to them a God all-sufficient. If we be 
 faithful and constant to God in a way of duty, and will never leave nor 
 forsake him, he will be so to us in a way of mercy, and will never 
 leave nor forsake us. And a fairer proposal could not be made.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. In the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+3:4,5">last two verses</A>

 we have the interpretation of the parable and the application of it to
 Israel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They must long <I>sit like a widow,</I> stripped of all their joys 
 and honours, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:1,2">Lam. iv. 1, 2</A>.

 <I>They shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince;</I> 
 and a nation in this condition may well be called <I>a widow.</I> They 
 want the blessing,

 (1.) Of civil government: They shall abide <I>without a king,</I> and 
 <I>without a prince,</I> of their own. There were kings and princes 
 over them to oppress them and rule them with rigour, but they had no 
 king nor prince to protect them, to fight their battles for them, to 
 administer justice to them, and to take care of their common safety and 
 welfare. Note, Magistracy is a very great blessing to a people, and it 
 is a sad and sore judgment to want it. 

 (2.) Of public worship: <I>They shall</I> abide <I>without a 
 sacrifice,</I> and <I>without an image</I> (or a <I>statue,</I> or 
 <I>pillar;</I> the word is used concerning the pillars Jacob erected, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+28:18,31:45,35:20">Gen. xxviii. 18; xxxi. 45; xxxv. 20</A>),

 and <I>without an ephod and teraphim.</I> The <I>teraphim</I> being
 here closely joined to the <I>ephod,</I> some thing the <I>urim</I> and 
 <I>thummim</I> were meant by it in the breast-plate of the high priest. 
 The meaning is that in their captivity they should not only have no 
 face of a nation upon them, but no face of a church; they should not 
 have (as a learned expositor speaks) liberty of any public profession 
 or exercise of religion, either true or false, according to their 
 choice. They shall have <I>no sacrifice or altar</I> (so the LXX.), and
 therefore no sacrifice because no altar. They shall have <I>no 
 ephod,</I> nor <I>teraphim,</I> no legal priesthood, no means of 
 knowing God's mind, no oracle to consult in doubtful cases, but shall 
 be all in the dark. Note, The case of those is very melancholy that
 are deprived of all opportunities to worship God in public. This was 
 the case of the Jews in their captivity; and it is so far the case of 
 the scattered Jews at this day that, though they have their synagogues, 
 they have no temple-service. Desolate indeed is their condition that 
 are shut out from communion with God, that have no opportunity of 
 directing their addresses to God by sacrifice and altar, and of 
 receiving instruction from him by ephod and teraphim.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They shall at length be received again as a wife 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):
 
 <I>Afterwards,</I> in process of time, when they have gone through this 
 discipline, <I>they shall return,</I> that is, they shall repent of 
 their idolatries and forsake them, they shall apply themselves to God 
 and adhere to him, and herein they shall be accepted of him. Two things 
 are here promised as instances of their return, and steps towards their 
 acceptance with God in their return:--

 (1.) The enquiries they shall make after God: <I>They shall seek the 
 Lord their God, and David their king.</I> Note, Those that would find 
 God, and find favour with him, must seek him, must ask after him, covet 
 acquaintance with him, desire to be reconciled to him, set their love 
 on him, and labour in this that they may be accepted of him. Their 
 seeking him implies that they had lost him, that they were lamenting 
 their loss, and that they were solicitous to retrieve what they had 
 lost. They shall seek him as <I>their God;</I> for <I>should not a 
 people seek unto their God?</I> And they shall seek <I>David their 
 King,</I> who can be no other than the Messiah, our Lord Jesus Christ, 
 the Son of David, the <I>root and offspring of David,</I> whom David 
 himself called <I>Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:1">Ps. cx. 1</A>),

 and to whom God gave the <I>throne of his father David,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:32">Luke i. 32</A>.
 
 The Chaldee reads it, They shall <I>seek the service of the Lord their
 God,</I> and <I>shall obey Messiah, the Son of David their king.</I> 
 Compare this with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:9,Eze+34:23,37:25">Jer. xxx. 9; Ezek. xxxiv. 23; xxxvii. 25</A>.

 Note, Those that would seek the Lord so as to find him must apply to
 Jesus Christ, and must seek to him as their King, and become his 
 willing people, and take an oath of fealty and allegiance to him.

 (2.) The reverence they shall have of God: <I>They shall fear the Lord 
 and his goodness.</I> Some by his <I>goodness</I> here understand the 
 temple, towards which they shall look, in worshipping God. The Jews 
 say, There were three things which Israel cast off in the days of 
 Rehoboam--the <I>kingdom of heaven,</I> the <I>family of David,</I> and 
 the <I>house of the sanctuary;</I> and it will never be well with them 
 till they return, and seek them all three, which is here promised. They 
 shall seek the kingdom of heaven in <I>the Lord their God,</I> the 
 royal family in <I>David their King,</I> and the temple in <I>the 
 goodness of the Lord.</I> Others by <I>his goodness</I> understand 
 Christ, the same <I>with David their King.</I> But it is rather to be 
 taken for that attribute of God which he showed as his glory, and by 
 which he proclaimed his name. Note, It is not only the Lord and his 
 greatness that we are to fear, but the Lord and his goodness, not only 
 his majesty, but his mercy. They shall <I>flee for fear to the Lord and 
 his goodness</I> (so some take it), shall flee to it as their city of 
 refuge. We must <I>fear God's goodness,</I> that is, we must admire it, 
 and stand amazed at it, must adore it, and <I>worship</I> as Moses did 
 at the proclaiming of this name, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:6">Exod. xxxiv. 6</A>.

 We must be afraid of offending his goodness, of making any ungrateful
 returns for it, and so forfeiting it. <I>There is forgiveness with God, 
 that he may be feared,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+130:4">Ps. cxxx. 4</A>.

 We must <I>rejoice with trembling</I> in the goodness of God, must not
 be <I>high-minded, but fear.</I> Now this promise had its 
 accomplishment when by the gospel of Christ great multitudes both of 
 Jews and Gentiles were brought home to God, and incorporated in the 
 New-Testament church, served God in Christ, with a filial fear of 
 divine grace, and were accepted of God as his Israel. And some think
 it is to be yet further accomplished in the conversion of those Jews to 
 the faith of Christ who shall remain in unbelief, when they shall seek 
 their Messiah as <I>David their King,</I> and by him <I>all Israel 
 shall be saved,</I> when the <I>fulness of the Gentiles is brought 
 in.</I> Time was when they sought him to put him to death, saying, 
 <I>We have no king but C&aelig;sar;</I> but the day is coming when they 
 shall seek him to <I>appoint him their head,</I> and to lay their necks 
 under his yoke. He that has here promised that they shall do it will
 enable them to do it, and bring about this great work in his own way 
 and time, <I>in the latter days</I> of the <I>last times,</I> the times 
 of the Messiah: but, alas! who shall live when God does this? How far
 we are to expect a general conversion of that nation I cannot say; but
 I am sure we ought to pray that the Jews may be converted.</P>
