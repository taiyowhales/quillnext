 How judgment began at the house of God we have found in the foregoing 
 prophecy and history; but now we shall find that it did not end there. 
 In this and the following chapters we have predictions of the 
 desolations of the neighbouring nations, and those brought upon them 
 too mostly by the king of Babylon, till at length Babylon itself comes 
 to be reckoned with. The prophecy against Egypt is here put first and 
 takes up this whole chapter, in which we have, 

 I. A prophecy of the defeat of Pharaoh-necho's army by the Chaldean
 forces at Carchemish, which was accomplished soon after, in the fourth 
 year of Jehoiakim, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:1-12">ver. 1-12</A>.

 II. A prophecy of the descent which Nebuchadnezzar should make upon the
 land of Egypt, and his success in it, which was accomplished some years
 after the destruction of Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:13-26">ver. 13-26</A>.

 III. A word of comfort to the Israel of God in the midst of those
 calamities, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:27,28">ver. 27, 28</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> which came to Jeremiah the prophet
 against the Gentiles;
 &nbsp; 2  Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaoh-necho king of
 Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which
 Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of
 Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah.
 &nbsp; 3  Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.
 &nbsp; 4  Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth
 with <I>your</I> helmets; furbish the spears, <I>and</I> put on the
 brigandines.
 &nbsp; 5  Wherefore have I seen them dismayed <I>and</I> turned away back?
 and their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and
 look not back: <I>for</I> fear <I>was</I> round about, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 6  Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they
 shall stumble, and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates.
 &nbsp; 7  Who <I>is</I> this <I>that</I> cometh up as a flood, whose waters are
 moved as the rivers?
 &nbsp; 8  Egypt riseth up like a flood, and <I>his</I> waters are moved like
 the rivers; and he saith, I will go up, <I>and</I> will cover the
 earth; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof.
 &nbsp; 9  Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty
 men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the
 shield; and the Lydians, that handle <I>and</I> bend the bow.
 &nbsp; 10  For this <I>is</I> the day of the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> of hosts, a day of
 vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the
 sword shall devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk with
 their blood: for the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> of hosts hath a sacrifice in the
 north country by the river Euphrates.
 &nbsp; 11  Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of
 Egypt: in vain shalt thou use many medicines; <I>for</I> thou shalt
 not be cured.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The first verse is the title of that part of this book, which relates 
 to the neighbouring nations, and follows here. It is <I>the word of the 
 Lord which came to Jeremiah against the Gentiles;</I> for God is King 
 and Judge of nations, knows and will call to an account those who know 
 him not nor take any notice of him. Both Isaiah and Ezekiel prophesied 
 against these nations that Jeremiah here has a separate saying to, and 
 with reference to the same events. In the Old Testament we have <I>the 
 word of the Lord</I> against <I>the Gentiles;</I> in the New Testament 
 we have <I>the word of the Lord</I> for <I>the Gentiles,</I> that those 
 who were <I>afar off are made nigh.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 He begins with Egypt, because they were of old Israel's oppressors and 
 of late their deceivers, when they put confidence in them. In these 
 verses he foretells the overthrow of <I>the army of Pharaoh-necho,</I> 
 by Nebuchadnezzar, <I>in the fourth year of Jehoiakim,</I> which was so 
 complete a victory to the king of Babylon that thereby he recovered 
 from the river of Egypt to <I>the river Euphrates, all that pertained 
 to the king of Egypt,</I> and so weakened him that he <I>came not again 
 any more out of his land</I> (as we find, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:7">2 Kings xxiv. 7</A>),

 and so made him pay dearly for his expedition against the king of
 Assyria four years before, in which he slew Josiah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:29">2 Kings xxiii. 29</A>.

 This is the event that is here foretold in lofty expressions of triumph
 over Egypt thus foiled, which Jeremiah would speak of with a particular 
 pleasure, because the death of Josiah, which he had lamented, was now 
 avenged on Pharaoh-necho. Now here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The Egyptians are upbraided with the mighty preparations they made 
 for this expedition, in which the prophet calls to them to do their 
 utmost, for so they would: "Come then, <I>order the buckler,</I> let 
 the weapons of war be got ready," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Egypt was famous for <I>horses</I>--let them be <I>harnessed</I> and 
 the cavalry well mounted: <I>Get up, you horsemen, and stand forth,</I> 
 &c.,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 See what preparations the children of men make, with abundance of care
 and trouble and at a vast expense, to kill one another, as if they did 
 not die fast enough of themselves. He compares their marching out upon 
 this expedition to the rising of their river Nile 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>):
 
 <I>Egypt</I> now <I>rises up like a flood,</I> scorning to keep within 
 its own banks and threatening to overflow all the neighbouring lands. 
 It is a very formidable army that the Egyptians bring into the field 
 upon this occasion. The prophet summons them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Come up, you horses; rage, you chariots.</I> He challenges them to 
 bring all their confederate troops together, <I>the Ethiopians,</I> 
 that descended from the same stock with the Egyptians 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10"6">Gen. x. 6</A>),

 and were their neighbours and allies, <I>the Libyans and Lydians,</I>
 both seated in Africa, to the west of Egypt, and from them the 
 Egyptians fetched their auxiliary forces. Let them strengthen 
 themselves with all the art and interest they have, yet it shall be all 
 in vain; they shall be shamefully defeated notwithstanding, for God 
 will fight against them, and against him <I>there is no wisdom nor 
 counsel,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+21:30,31">Prov. xxi. 30, 31</A>.

 It concerns those that go forth to war not only to <I>order the 
 buckler,</I> and <I>harness the horses,</I> but to repent of their 
 sins, and pray to God for his presence with them, and that they may 
 have it to keep themselves from every wicked thing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They are upbraided with the great expectations they had from this 
 expedition, which were quite contrary to what God intended in bringing 
 them together. They knew their own thoughts, and God knew them, and sat 
 in heaven and laughed at them,; <I>but they knew not the thoughts of 
 the Lord, for he gathers them as sheaves into the floor,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+4:11,12">Mic. iv. 11, 12</A>.
 
 Egypt saith

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>I will go up; I will cover the earth,</I> and none shall hinder me; 
 <I>I will destroy the city,</I> whatever city it is that stands in my 
 way. Like Pharaoh of old, <I>I will pursue, I will overtake.</I> The 
 Egyptians say that they shall have a day of it, but God saith that it 
 shall be his day: <I>The is the day of the Lord God of hosts</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 the day in which he will be exalted in the overthrow of the Egyptians. 
 They meant one thing, but God meant another; they designed it for the 
 advancement of their dignity and the enlargement of their dominion, but 
 God designed it for the great abasement and weakening of their kingdom.
 It is <I>a day of vengeance</I> for Josiah's death; it is a day of 
 sacrifice to divine justice, to which multitudes of the sinners of 
 Egypt shall fall as victims. Note, When men think to magnify themselves 
 by pushing on unrighteous enterprises, let them expect that God will 
 glorify himself by blasting them and cutting them off.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They are upbraided with their cowardice and inglorious flight when 
 they come to an engagement 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>):

 "<I>Wherefore have I seen them,</I> notwithstanding all these mighty 
 and vast preparations and all these expressions of bravery and 
 resolution, when the Chaldean army faces them, <I>dismayed, turned 
 back,</I> quite disheartened, and no spirit left in them." 

 1. They make a shameful retreat. Even <I>their mighty ones,</I> who,
 one would think, should have stood their ground, <I>flee a flight,</I> 
 flee by consent, make the best of their way, flee in confusion and with 
 the utmost precipitation; they have neither time nor heart to <I>look 
 back,</I> but <I>fear is round about</I> them, for they apprehend it 
 so. And yet, 

 2. They cannot make their escape. They have the shame of flying, and
 yet not the satisfaction of saving themselves by flight; they might as 
 well have stood their ground and died upon the spot; for even <I>the 
 swift shall not flee away.</I> The lightness of their heels shall fail 
 them when it comes to the trial, as well as the stoutness of their 
 hearts; the <I>mighty</I> shall not escape, nay, they <I>are beaten 
 down</I> and broken to pieces. <I>They shall stumble</I> in their 
 flight, <I>and fall towards the north,</I> towards their enemy's 
 country; for such confusion were they in when they took to their feet 
 that instead of making homeward, as men usually do in that case, they 
 made forward. Note, <I>The race is not to the swift nor the battle to 
 the strong.</I> Valiant men are not always victorious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. They are upbraided with their utter inability ever to recover this 
 blow, which should be fatal to their nation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 The damsel, <I>the daughter of Egypt,</I> that lived in great pomp and 
 state, is sorely wounded by this defeat. Let her now seek for <I>balm 
 in Gilead</I> and physicians there; let her use all the medicines her 
 wise men can prescribe for the healing of this hurt, and the repairing 
 of the loss sustained by this defeat; but all in vain; <I>no cure shall 
 be</I> to them; they shall never be able to bring such a powerful army 
 as this into the field again. "<I>The nations</I> that rang of thy 
 glory and strength <I>have</I> now <I>heard of thy shame,</I> how 
 shamefully thou wast routed and how thou are weakened by it." It needs 
 not be spread by the triumphs of the conquerors, the shrieks and 
 outcries of the conquered will proclaim it: <I>Thy cry hath filled 
 the</I> country about. For, when they fled several ways, one <I>mighty 
 man stumbled</I> upon another and dashed against another, such 
 confusion were they in, so that <I>both together</I> became a pray to 
 the pursuers, an easy prey. A thousand such dreadful accidents there 
 should be, which should fill the country with the cry of those that 
 were overcome. <I>Let not the mighty man</I> therefore <I>glory in his 
 might,</I> for the time may come when it will stand him in no 
 stead.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  The nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry hath filled
 the land: for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty,
 <I>and</I> they are fallen both together.
 &nbsp; 13  The word that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake to Jeremiah the prophet, how
 Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come <I>and</I> smite the land
 of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 14  Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in
 Noph and in Tahpanhes: say ye, Stand fast, and prepare thee; for
 the sword shall devour round about thee.
 &nbsp; 15  Why are thy valiant <I>men</I> swept away? they stood not,
 because the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> did drive them.
 &nbsp; 16  He made many to fall, yea, one fell upon another: and they
 said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the
 land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.
 &nbsp; 17  They did cry there, Pharaoh king of Egypt <I>is but</I> a noise;
 he hath passed the time appointed.
 &nbsp; 18  <I>As</I> I live, saith the King, whose name <I>is</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of
 hosts, Surely as Tabor <I>is</I> among the mountains, and as Carmel by
 the sea, <I>so</I> shall he come.
 &nbsp; 19  O thou daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish thyself to go
 into captivity: for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an
 inhabitant.
 &nbsp; 20  Egypt <I>is like</I> a very fair heifer, <I>but</I> destruction
 cometh; it cometh out of the north.
 &nbsp; 21  Also her hired men <I>are</I> in the midst of her like fatted
 bullocks; for they also are turned back, <I>and</I> are fled away
 together: they did not stand, because the day of their calamity
 was come upon them, <I>and</I> the time of their visitation.
 &nbsp; 22  The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall
 march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of
 wood.
 &nbsp; 23  They shall cut down her forest, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, though it
 cannot be searched; because they are more than the grasshoppers,
 and <I>are</I> innumerable.
 &nbsp; 24  The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded; she shall be
 delivered into the hand of the people of the north.
 &nbsp; 25  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, the God of Israel, saith; Behold, I will
 punish the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their
 gods, and their kings; even Pharaoh, and <I>all</I> them that trust in
 him:
 &nbsp; 26  And I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek
 their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon,
 and into the hand of his servants: and afterward it shall be
 inhabited, as in the days of old, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 27  But fear not thou, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed,
 O Israel: for, behold, I will save thee from afar off, and thy
 seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return,
 and be in rest and at ease, and none shall make <I>him</I> afraid.
 &nbsp; 28  Fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: for I
 <I>am</I> with thee; for I will make a full end of all the nations
 whither I have driven thee: but I will not make a full end of
 thee, but correct thee in measure; yet will I not leave thee
 wholly unpunished.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Confusion and terror spoken to Egypt. The accomplishment of the 
 prediction in the former part of the chapter disabled the Egyptians 
 from making any attempts upon other nations; for what could they do 
 when their army was routed? But still they remained strong at home, and 
 none of their neighbours durst make any attempts upon them. Though the 
 kings of Egypt came no more <I>out of their land</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:7">2 Kings xxiv. 7</A>),

 yet they kept safe and easy in their land; and what would they desire
 more than peaceably to enjoy their own? One would think all men should 
 be content to do this, and not covet to invade their neighbours. But 
 the measure of Egypt's iniquity is full, and now they shall not long 
 enjoy their own; those that encroached on others shall not be 
 themselves encroached on. The scope of the prophecy here is to show 
 <I>how the king of Babylon should</I> shortly <I>come and smite the 
 land of Egypt,</I> and bring the war into their own bosoms which they 
 had formerly carried into his borders,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 This was fulfilled by the same hand with the former, even 
 Nebuchadnezzar's, but many years after, twenty at least, and probably 
 the prediction of it was long after the former prediction, and perhaps 
 much about the same time with that other prediction of the same event 
 which we had

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+43:10"><I>ch.</I> xliii. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here is the alarm of war sounded in Egypt, to their great amazement 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 notice given to the country that the enemy is approaching, <I>the sword 
 is devouring round about</I> in the neighbouring countries, and 
 therefore it is time for the Egyptians to put themselves in a posture 
 of defence, to prepare for war, that they may give the enemy a warm 
 reception. This must be proclaimed in all parts of Egypt, particularly 
 in Migdol, Noph, and Tahpanhes, because in these places especially the 
 Jewish refugees, or fugitives rather, had planted themselves, in 
 contempt of God's command

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+44:1"><I>ch.</I> xliv. 1</A>),

 and let them hear what a sorry shelter Egypt is likely to be to
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The retreat hereupon of the forces of other nations which the 
 Egyptians had in their pay is here foretold. Some considerable number 
 of those troops, it is probable, were posted upon the frontiers to 
 guard them, where they were beaten off by the invaders and put to 
 flights. Then were the <I>valiant men swept away</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 as with <I>a sweeping rain</I> (it is the word that is used 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:3">Prov. xxviii. 3</A>);

 they can none of them stand their ground, <I>because the Lord drives 
 them</I> from their respective posts; he drives them by his terrors; he 
 drives them by enabling the Chaldeans to drive them. It is not possible 
 that those should fix whom the wrath of God chases. He it was 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)
 
 that <I>made many to fall, yea,</I> when their day shall come to fall, 
 the enemy needs not throw them down, they shall <I>fall one upon 
 another,</I> every man shall be a stumbling-block to his fellow, to his 
 follower; nay, if God please, they shall be made to <I>fall upon one 
 another,</I> they shall be made to <I>fall upon one another, every 
 man's sword</I> shall be <I>against his fellow. Her hired men,</I> the 
 troops Egypt has in he service, are indeed <I>in the midst of her like 
 fatted bullocks,</I> lusty men, able bodied and high spirited, who were 
 likely for action and promised to make their part good against the 
 enemy; but <I>they are turned back;</I> their hearts failed them, and, 
 instead of fighting, they have <I>fled away together.</I> How could 
 they withstand their fate when <I>the day of their calamity had 
 come,</I> the day in which God will visit them in wrath? Some think 
 they are compared to fatted bullocks for their luxury; they had 
 wantoned in pleasures, so that they were very unfit for hardships, and 
 therefore turned back and could not stand. In this consternation, 

 (1.) They all made homeward towards their own country

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>They said, "Arise, and let us go again to our own people,</I> where 
 we may be safe <I>from the oppressing sword</I> of the Chaldeans, that 
 bears down all before it." In times of exigence little confidence is to 
 be put in mercenary troops, that fight purely for pay, and have no 
 interest in theirs whom they fight for. 

 (2.) They exclaimed vehemently against Pharaoh, to whose cowardice or 
 bad management, it is probably, their defeat was owing. When he posted
 them there upon the borders of his country it is probably that he told 
 them he would within such a time come himself with a gallant army of 
 his own subjects to support them; but he failed them, and, when the 
 enemy advanced, they found they had none to back them, so that they 
 were perfectly abandoned to the fury of the invaders. No marvel then 
 that they quitted their post and deserted the service, crying out, 
 <I>Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);

 he can hector, and talk big of the mighty things he would do, but that 
 is all; he brings nothing to pass. All his promises to those in 
 alliance with him, or that are employed for him, vanish into smoke. He
 brings not the succours he engaged to bring, or not till it is too 
 late: <I>He has passed the time appointed;</I> he did not keep his 
 word, nor keep his day, and therefore they bid him farewell, they will 
 never serve under him any more. Note, Those that make most noise in any 
 business are frequently but a noise. Great talkers are little 
 doers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The formidable power of the Chaldean army is here described as 
 bearing down all before it. <I>The King</I> of kings, <I>whose name is 
 the Lord of hosts,</I> and before whom the mightiest kings on earth, 
 though gods to us, are but as grasshoppers, he hath said it, he hath 
 sworn it, <I>As I live, saith</I> this <I>king, as Tabor</I> overtops 
 <I>the mountains and Carmel</I> overlooks <I>the sea, so shall</I> the 
 king of Babylon overpower all the force of Egypt, such a command shall 
 he have, such a sway shall he bear, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 He and his <I>army shall come against</I> Egypt <I>with axes, as hewers 
 of wood</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 and the Egyptians shall be no more able to resist them than the tree is 
 to resist the man that comes with an axe to <I>cut it down;</I> so that 
 Egypt shall be felled as a <I>forest</I> is <I>by the hewers of 
 wood,</I> which (if there by many of them, and those well provided with 
 instruments for the purpose) will be done in a little time. Egypt is 
 very populous, full of towns and cities, like a forest, the trees of 
 which <I>cannot be searched</I> or numbered, and very rich, full of 
 hidden treasures, many of which will escape the searching eye of the 
 Chaldean soldiers; but they shall make a great spoil in the country, 
 for <I>they are more than the locusts,</I> that come in vast swarms and 
 overrun a country, devouring every green thing 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:6,7">Joel i. 6, 7</A>),

 so shall the Chaldeans do, for <I>they are innumerable.</I> Note, The
 Lord of hosts hath numberless hosts at his command.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The desolation of Egypt hereby is foretold, and the waste that 
 should be made of that rich country. <I>Egypt is</I> now <I>like a very 
 fair heifer,</I> or calf 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 fat and shining, and not <I>accustomed to the yoke</I> of subjection, 
 wanton as a heifer that is well fed, and very sportful. Some think here 
 is an allusion to Apis, the bull or calf which the Egyptians 
 worshipped, from whom the children of Israel learned to worship the 
 golden calf. Egypt is as fair as a goddess, and adores herself, <I>but 
 destruction comes; cutting up comes</I> (so some read it); <I>it comes 
 out of the north;</I> thence the Chaldean soldiers shall come, as so 
 many butchers or sacrificers, to kill and cut up this <I>fair 
 heifer.</I> 

 (1.) The Egyptians shall be brought down, shall be tamed, and their
 tune changed: <I>The daughters of Egypt shall be confounded</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 shall be filled with astonishment. <I>Their voice shall go like a 
 serpent,</I> that is, it shall be very low and submissive; they shall 
 not low like a fair heifer, that makes a great noise, but hiss out of 
 their holes like serpents. They shall not dare to make loud complaints 
 of the cruelty of the conquerors, but vent their griefs in silent 
 murmurs. They shall not now, as they used to do, answer roughly, but, 
 with <I>the poor, use entreaties</I> and beg for their lives. 

 (2.) They shall be carried away prisoners into their enemy's land

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 "<I>O thou daughter! dwelling</I> securely and delicately <I>in
 Egypt,</I> that fruitful pleasant country, do not think this will last 
 always, but <I>furnish thyself to go into captivity;</I> instead of 
 rich clothes, which will but tempt the enemy to strip thee, get plain 
 and warm clothes; instead of fine shoes, provide strong ones; and inure 
 thyself to hardship, that thou mayest bear it the better." Note, It 
 concerns us, among all our preparations, to prepare for trouble. We 
 provide for the entertainment of our friends, let us not neglect to 
 provide for the entertainment of our enemies, nor among all our 
 furniture omit furniture for captivity. The Egyptians must prepare to
 flee; for their cities shall be evacuated. Noph particularly <I>shall
 be desolate, without an inhabitant,</I> so general shall the slaughter 
 and the captivity be. There are some penalties which, we say, the king
 and the multitude are exempted from, but here even these are obnoxious: 
 <I>The multitude of No shall be punished:</I> it is called <I>populous 
 No,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nah+3:8">Nah. iii. 8</A>.

 <I>Though hand join in hand,</I> yet they shall not escape; nor can any
 think to go off in the crowd. Be they ever so many, they shall find God 
 will be too many for them. Their kings and all their petty princes 
 shall fall; and their gods too

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+43:12,13"><I>ch.</I> xliii. 12, 13</A>),

 their idols and their great men. Those which they call their tutelar
 deities shall be no protection to them. Pharaoh shall be brought down, 
 and <I>all those that trust in him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 particularly the Jews that came to sojourn in his country, trusting in 
 him rather than in God. All these shall be <I>delivered into the hands 
 of the northern nations</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 into the hand not only of Nebuchadnezzar that mighty potentate, but 
 <I>into the hands of his servants,</I> according to the curse on Ham's 
 posterity, of which the Egyptians were, that they should be the 
 <I>servants of servants.</I> These seek their lives, and into their 
 hands they shall be delivered.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. An intimation is given that in process of time Egypt shall recover 
 itself again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>Afterwards it shall be inhabited,</I> shall be peopled again, 
 whereas by this destruction it was almost dispeopled. Ezekiel foretels
 that this should be at the end of forty years, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:13">Ezek. xxix. 13</A>.

 See what changes the nations of the earth are subject to, how they are
 emptied and increased again; and let not nations that prosper be 
 secure, nor those that for the present are in thraldom despair.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Comfort and peace are here spoken to the Israel of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:27,28"><I>v.</I> 27, 28</A>.
 
 Some understand it of those whom the king of Egypt had carried into 
 captivity with Jehoahaz, but we read not of any that were carried away 
 captives with him; it may therefore rather refer to the captives in 
 Babylon, whom God had mercy in store for, or, more generally, to all 
 the people of God, designed for their encouragement in the most 
 difficult times, when the judgments of God are abroad among the 
 nations. We had these words of comfort before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:10,11"><I>ch.</I> xxx. 10, 11</A>.

 1. Let the wicked of the earth tremble, they have cause for it; <I>but
 fear not thou, O my servant Jacob! and be not dismayed, O Israel!</I> 
 and again, <I>Fear thou not, O Jacob!</I> God would not have his people 
 to be a timorous people. 

 2. The wicked of the earth <I>shall be put away like dross,</I> not be
 looked after any more; but God's people, in order to their being saved, 
 shall be found out and gathered though they be far off, shall be 
 redeemed though they be held fast in captivity, and shall return. 

 3. The wicked <I>is like the troubled sea when it cannot rest;</I>
 they <I>flee when none pursues.</I> But Jacob, being at home in God, 
 <I>shall be at rest and at ease, and none shall make him afraid;</I> 
 for <I>what time he is afraid</I> he has a <I>God to trust to.</I> 

 4. The wicked God <I>beholds afar off;</I> but, wherever thou art,
 <I>O Jacob! I am with thee, a very present help.</I> 

 5. A <I>full end shall be made</I> of the nations that oppressed God's
 Israel, as Egypt and Babylon; but mercy shall be kept in store for the 
 Israel of God: they shall be corrected, but not cast off; the 
 correction shall be in measure, in respect of degree and continuance.
 Nations have their periods; the Jewish nation itself has come to an end 
 as a nation; but the gospel church, God's spiritual Israel, still 
 continues, and will to the end of time; in that this promise is to have 
 its full accomplishment, that, though God correct it, he will never 
 <I>make a full end of it.</I></P>
