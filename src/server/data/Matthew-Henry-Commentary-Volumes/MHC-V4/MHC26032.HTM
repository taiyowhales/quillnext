 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Still we are upon the destruction of Pharaoh and Egypt, which is
 wonderfully enlarged upon, and with a great deal of emphasis. When we
 read so very much of Egypt's ruin, no less than six several prophecies
 at divers times delivered concerning it, we are ready to think, Surely
 there is some special reason for it. And,

 I. Perhaps it may look as far back as the book of Genesis, where we
 find

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+15:14"><I>ch.</I> xv. 14</A>)

 that God determined to judge Egypt for oppressing his people; and,
 though that was in part fulfilled in the plagues of Egypt and the
 drowning of Pharaoh, yet, in this destruction, here foretold, those old
 scores were reckoned for, and that was to have its full accomplishment.

 II. Perhaps it may look as far forward as the book of the Revelation,
 where we find that the great enemy of the gospel-church, that makes war 
 with the Lamb, is spiritually called Egypt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:8">Rev. xi. 8</A>.

 And, if so, the destruction of Egypt and its Pharaoh was a type of the 
 destruction of that proud enemy; and between this prophecy of the ruin 
 of Egypt and the prophecy of the destruction of the antichristian 
 generation there is some analogy. We have two distinct prophecies in 
 this chapter relating to Egypt, both in the same month, one on the 1st 
 day, the other that day fortnight, probably both on the sabbath day. 
 They are both lamentations, not only to signify how lamentable the fall 
 of Egypt should be, but to intimate how much the prophet himself should 
 lament it, from a generous principle of love to mankind. The 
 destruction of Egypt is here represented under two similitudes:-- 

 1. The killing of a lion, or a whale, or some such devouring creature,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:1-16">ver. 1-16</A>.

 2. The funeral of a great commander or captain-general, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:17-32">ver. 17-32</A>.

 The two prophecies of this chapter are much of the same length.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth
 month, in the first <I>day</I> of the month, <I>that</I> the word of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt,
 and say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations, and
 thou <I>art</I> as a whale in the seas: and thou camest forth with thy
 rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst
 their rivers.
 &nbsp; 3  Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; I will therefore spread out my net
 over thee with a company of many people; and they shall bring
 thee up in my net.
 &nbsp; 4  Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth
 upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven
 to remain upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole
 earth with thee.
 &nbsp; 5  And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the
 valleys with thy height.
 &nbsp; 6  I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou
 swimmest, <I>even</I> to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full
 of thee.
 &nbsp; 7  And when I shall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and
 make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud,
 and the moon shall not give her light.
 &nbsp; 8  All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee,
 and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 9  I will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring
 thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou
 hast not known.
 &nbsp; 10  Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings
 shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword
 before them; and they shall tremble at <I>every</I> moment, every man
 for his own life, in the day of thy fall.
 &nbsp; 11  For thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; The sword of the king of
 Babylon shall come upon thee.
 &nbsp; 12  By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to
 fall, the terrible of the nations, all of them: and they shall
 spoil the pomp of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be
 destroyed.
 &nbsp; 13  I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the
 great waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any
 more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them.
 &nbsp; 14  Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers
 to run like oil, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 15  When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the
 country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full, when I
 shall smite all them that dwell therein, then shall they know
 that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 16  This <I>is</I> the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her:
 the daughters of the nations shall lament her: they shall lament
 for her, <I>even</I> for Egypt, and for all her multitude, saith the
 Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. The prophet is ordered to <I>take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king 
 of Egypt,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 It concerns ministers to be much of a serious spirit, and, in order 
 thereunto, to be frequent in taking up lamentations for the fall and 
 ruin of sinners, as those that have not desired, but dreaded, the 
 woeful day. Note, Ministers that would affect others with the things of 
 God must make it appear that they are themselves affected with the 
 miseries which sinners bring upon themselves by their sins. It becomes 
 us to weep and tremble for those that will not weep and tremble for 
 themselves, to try if thereby we may set them a weeping, set them a 
 trembling.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He is ordered to show cause for that lamentation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Pharaoh has been a troubler of the nations, even of his own nation, 
 which he should have procured the repose of: He is <I>like a young lion 
 of the nations</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 loud and noisy, hectoring and threatening as a lion when he roars. 
 Great potentates, if they by tyrannical and oppressive, are in God's 
 account no better than beasts of prey. He is like <I>a whale,</I> or 
 dragon, like a crocodile (so some) <I>in the seas,</I> very turbulent 
 and vexatious, as the <I>leviathan</I> that <I>makes the deep to boil 
 like a pot,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:31">Job xli. 31</A>.

 When Pharaoh engaged in an unnecessary war with the Cyrenians he
 <I>came forth with his rivers,</I> with his armies, <I>troubled the 
 waters,</I> disturbed his own kingdom and the neighbouring nations, 
 <I>fouled the rivers,</I> and made them muddy. Note, A great deal of
 disquiet is often given to the world by the restless ambition and 
 implacable resentments of proud princes. Ahab is he that troubles 
 Israel, and not Elijah.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He that has troubled others must expect to be himself troubled; for 
 the Lord is righteous, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+7:25">Josh. vii. 25</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) This is set forth here by a comparison. Is Pharaoh like a <I>great 
 whale,</I> which, when it comes up the river, gives great disturbance, 
 a leviathan which Job cannot <I>draw out with a hook?</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:1">Job xli. 1</A>),
 
 yet God has a net for him which is large enough to enclose him and
 strong enough to secure him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>I will spread my net over thee,</I> even the army of the Chaldeans, 
 a <I>company of many people;</I> they shall force him out of his 
 fastnesses, dislodge him out of his possessions, throw him like a great 
 fish upon dry ground, <I>upon the open field</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 where being out of his element, he must die of course, and be a prey to 
 the birds and beasts, as was foretold,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:5"><I>ch.</I> xxix. 5</A>.

 What can the strongest fish do to help itself when it is out of the
 water and lies gasping? <I>The flesh</I> of this great whale shall be 
 <I>laid upon the mountains</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 and the <I>valleys</I> shall be <I>filled with his height.</I> Such 
 numbers of Pharaoh's soldiers shall be slain that the dead bodies shall 
 be scattered upon the hills and there shall be heaps of them piled up 
 in the valleys. Blood shall be shed in such abundance as to swell the 
 rivers in the valleys. Or, Such shall be the bulk, such the height, of 
 this leviathan, that, when he is laid upon the ground, he shall fill a 
 valley. Such vast quantities of blood shall issue from this 
 <I>leviathan</I> as shall <I>water the land of Egypt,</I> the land 
 wherein <I>now he swims,</I> now he sports himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 It shall reach <I>to the mountains,</I> and the waters of Egypt shall 
 again be <I>turned into blood</I> by this means: <I>The rivers shall be 
 full of thee.</I> The judgments executed upon Pharaoh of old are 
 expressed by the <I>breaking</I> of <I>the heads of leviathan in the 
 waters,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:13,14">Ps. lxxiv. 13, 14</A>.

 But now they go further; this old serpent not only has now his head
 bruised, but is all crushed to pieces.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It is set forth by a prophecy of the deep impression which the 
 destruction of Egypt should make upon the neighbouring nations; it 
 would put them all into a consternation, as the fall of the Assyrian 
 monarchy did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:15,16"><I>ch.</I> xxxi. 15, 16</A>.

 When Pharaoh, who had been like a blazing burning torch, is <I>put
 out</I> and <I>extinguished</I> it shall make all about him look black, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The heavens shall be hung with black, the <I>stars darkened,</I> the 
 sun eclipsed, and the moon be deprived of her borrowed light. It is 
 from the upper world that this lower receives its light; and therefore 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 when the <I>bright lights of heaven</I> are <I>made dark</I> above, 
 darkness by consequence is <I>set upon the land,</I> upon the earth; so 
 it shall be on the land of Egypt. Here the plague of darkness, which 
 was upon Egypt of old for three days, seems to be alluded to, as, 
 before, the turning of the waters into blood. For, when former 
 judgments are forgotten, it is just that they should be repeated. When 
 their privy-counsellors, and statesmen, and those that have the 
 direction of the public affairs, are deprived of wisdom and made fools, 
 and the things that belong to their peace are hidden from their eyes, 
 then their lights are darkened and the land is in a mist. This is
 foretold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:13">Isa. xix. 13</A>.

 <I>The princes of Zoan have become fools.</I> Now upon the spreading of
 the report of the fall of Egypt, and the bringing of the news to remote 
 countries, <I>countries which they had not known</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 people shall be much affected, and shall feel themselves sensibly 
 touched by it.

 [1.] It shall fill them with vexation to see such an ancient, wealthy, 
 potent kingdom thus humbled and brought down, and the pride of worldly 
 glory, which they have such a value for, stained. The <I>hearts of many 
 people</I> will be <I>vexed</I> to see the word of the God of Israel 
 fulfilled in the destruction of Egypt, and that all the <I>gods of 
 Egypt</I> were not able to relieve it. Note, The destruction of some 
 wicked people is a vexation to others.

 [2.] It shall fill them with admiration 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 They shall be <I>amazed at thee,</I> shall wonder to see such <I>great 
 riches</I> and power <I>come to nothing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:17">Rev. xviii. 17</A>.

 Note, Those that admire with complacency the pomp of this world will 
 admire with consternation the ruin of that pomp, which to those that 
 know the vanity of all things here below is no surprise at all.

 [3.] It shall fill them with fear: even <I>their kings</I> (that think 
 it their prerogative to be secure) shall be <I>horribly afraid for 
 thee,</I> concluding their own house to be in danger when their 
 neighbour's is on fire. <I>When I shall brandish my sword before them 
 they shall tremble every man for his own life.</I> Note, When the sword 
 of God's justice is drawn against some, to cut them off, it is thereby 
 brandished before others, to give them warning. And those that will not 
 be admonished by it, and made to reform, shall yet be frightened by it, 
 and made to tremble. They shall <I>tremble at every moment, because of 
 thy fall.</I> When others are ruined by sin we have reason to quake for 
 fear, as knowing ourselves guilty and obnoxious. <I>Who is able to 
 stand before this holy Lord God?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) It is set forth by a plain and express prediction of the 
 desolation itself that should come upon Egypt. 

 [1.] The instruments of the desolation appear here very formidable. It 
 is the <I>sword of the king of Babylon,</I> that warlike, that 
 victorious prince, that shall <I>come upon thee</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 the <I>swords of the mighty,</I> even the <I>terrible of the nations, 
 all of them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 an army that there is no standing before. Note, Those that delight in
 war, and are upon all occasions entering into contention, may expect, 
 some time or other, to be engaged with those that will prove too hard 
 for them. Pharaoh had been forward to quarrel with his neighbour and
 to come forth <I>with his rivers,</I> with his armies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 But God will now give him enough of it.

 [2.] The instances of the desolation appear here very frightful, much 
 the same with what we had before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:10-12,30:7"><I>ch.</I> xxix. 10-12; xxx. 7</A>.

 <I>First,</I> The multitude of Egypt shall be destroyed, not decimated,
 some picked out to be made examples, but all cut off. Note, The numbers 
 of sinners, though they be a multitude, will neither secure them 
 against God's power nor entitle them to his pity. <I>Secondly,</I> The 
 pomp of Egypt shall be spoiled, the pomp of their court, what they have 
 been proud of. Note, in renouncing the pomps of this world we did
 ourselves a great kindness, for they are things that are soon spoiled 
 and that cheat their admirers. <I>Thirdly,</I> The cattle of Egypt,
 that used to feed by the rivers, shall be destroyed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 either cut off by the sword or carried off for a prey. Egypt was famous 
 for horses, which would be an acceptable booty to the Chaldeans. The 
 rivers shall be no more frequented as they have been by man and beast, 
 that came thither to drink. <I>Fourthly,</I> The <I>waters of
 Egypt,</I> that used to flow briskly, shall now grow deep, and slow, 
 and heavy, and shall <I>run like oil</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 a figurative expression signifying that there should be such universal 
 sadness and heaviness upon the whole nation that even the rivers should 
 go softly and silently like mourners, and quite forget their rapid 
 motion. <I>Fifthly,</I> The whole country of Egypt shall be stripped
 of its wealth; it shall be <I>destitute of what whereof it was full</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 corn, and cattle, and all the pleasant fruits of the earth; when those 
 are <I>smitten that dwell therein</I> the ground is untilled, and that 
 which is gathered becomes an easy prey to the invader. Note, God can 
 soon empty those of this world's goods that have the greatest fulness 
 of those things and are full of them, that enjoy most and have their 
 hearts set upon those enjoyments. The Egyptians were full of their 
 pleasant and plentiful country, and its rich productions. Every one 
 that talked with them might perceive how much it filled them. But God 
 can soon make their <I>country destitute of that whereof it is 
 full;</I> it is therefore our wisdom to be full of treasures in heaven.
 When the country is made destitute, 

 1. It shall be an instruction to them: <I>Then shall they know that I
 am the Lord.</I> A sensible conviction of the vanity of the world, and 
 the fading perishing nature of all things in it, will contribute much 
 to our right knowledge of God as our portion and happiness. 

 2. It shall be a lamentation to all about them: <I>The daughters of the 
 nations shall lament her</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),
 
 either because, being in alliance with her, they share in her 
 grievances and suffer with her, or, being admirers of her, they at 
 least share in her grief and sympathize with her. They shall lament 
 <I>for Egypt and all her multitude;</I> it shall excite their pity to 
 see so great a devastation made. By enlarging the matters of our joy we 
 increase the occasions of our sorrow.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth
 <I>day</I> of the month, <I>that</I> the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me,
 saying,
 &nbsp; 18  Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them
 down, <I>even</I> her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto
 the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the
 pit.
 &nbsp; 19  Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid
 with the uncircumcised.
 &nbsp; 20  They shall fall in the midst of <I>them that are</I> slain by the
 sword: she is delivered to the sword: draw her and all her
 multitudes.
 &nbsp; 21  The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the
 midst of hell with them that help him: they are gone down, they
 lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword.
 &nbsp; 22  Asshur <I>is</I> there and all her company: his graves <I>are</I>
 about him: all of them slain, fallen by the sword:
 &nbsp; 23  Whose graves are set in the sides of the pit, and her
 company is round about her grave: all of them slain, fallen by
 the sword, which caused terror in the land of the living.
 &nbsp; 24  There <I>is</I> Elam and all her multitude round about her grave,
 all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which are gone down
 uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, which caused
 their terror in the land of the living; yet have they borne their
 shame with them that go down to the pit.
 &nbsp; 25  They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all
 her multitude: her graves <I>are</I> round about him: all of them
 uncircumcised, slain by the sword: though their terror was caused
 in the land of the living, yet have they borne their shame with
 them that go down to the pit: he is put in the midst of <I>them
 that be</I> slain.
 &nbsp; 26  There <I>is</I> Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graves
 <I>are</I> round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the
 sword, though they caused their terror in the land of the living.
 &nbsp; 27  And they shall not lie with the mighty <I>that are</I> fallen of
 the uncircumcised, which are gone down to hell with their weapons
 of war: and they have laid their swords under their heads, but
 their iniquities shall be upon their bones, though <I>they were</I>
 the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.
 &nbsp; 28  Yea, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised,
 and shalt lie with <I>them that are</I> slain with the sword.
 &nbsp; 29  There <I>is</I> Edom, her kings, and all her princes, which with
 their might are laid by <I>them that were</I> slain by the sword: they
 shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down to
 the pit.
 &nbsp; 30  There <I>be</I> the princes of the north, all of them, and all
 the Zidonians, which are gone down with the slain; with their
 terror they are ashamed of their might; and they lie
 uncircumcised with <I>them that be</I> slain by the sword, and bear
 their shame with them that go down to the pit.
 &nbsp; 31  Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his
 multitude, <I>even</I> Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword,
 saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 32  For I have caused my terror in the land of the living: and
 he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with <I>them
 that are</I> slain with the sword, <I>even</I> Pharaoh and all his
 multitude, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This prophecy concludes and completes the burden of Egypt, and leaves 
 it and all its multitude in the pit of destruction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We are here invited to attend the funeral of that once flourishing 
 kingdom, to lament its fall, and to take a view of those who attend it 
 to the grave and accompany it in the grave.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. This dead corpse of a kingdom is here brought to the grave. The 
 prophet is ordered to <I>cast them down</I> to the pit 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 to foretel their destruction as one that had authority, as Jeremiah was 
 set over the kingdoms, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:10">Jer. i. 10</A>.

 He must speak in God's name, and as from him who will cast them down.
 Yet he must foretel it as one that had an affectionate concern for 
 them; he must <I>wail for the multitude of Egypt,</I> even when he 
 <I>casts them down.</I> When Egypt is slain, let her have an honourable 
 funeral, befitting her quality; let her be buried <I>with the daughters 
 of the famous nations,</I> in their burying-places and with the same 
 ceremony. It is but a poor allay to the reproach and terror of death to 
 be buried with those that were famous; yet this is all that is allowed 
 to Egypt. Shall Egypt think to exempt herself from the common fate of 
 proud and imperious nations? No; she must take her lot with them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 "<I>Whom dost thou surpass in beauty?</I> Art thou so much fairer than 
 any other nation that thou shouldst expect therefore to be excused? No; 
 others as fair as thou have sunk into the pit; <I>go down</I> 
 therefore, and <I>be thou laid with the uncircumcised.</I> Thou art 
 like them and art likely to lie among them. The multitude of Egypt 
 shall all <I>fall in the midst of those that are slain with the 
 sword,</I> now that there is a general slaughter made among the 
 nations." Egypt with the rest must drink of the bloody cup, and 
 therefore she is <I>delivered to the sword,</I> to the sword of war 
 (but, in God's hand, the sword of justice), is delivered to be publicly 
 executed. <I>Draw her and all her multitude;</I> draw them either as 
 the dead bodies of great men are drawn in honour to the grave, in a 
 hearse, or as malefactors are drawn in disgrace to the place of 
 execution, on a sledge; draw them to the pit, and let them be made a 
 spectacle to the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. This corpse of a kingdom is bid welcome to the grave, and Pharaoh is 
 made free of the congregation of the dead, and admitted into their 
 regions, not without some pomp and ceremony. As the surprising fall of 
 the king of Babylon is thus illustrated, <I>Hell from beneath is moved 
 for thee to meet thee at thy coming,</I> and to introduce thee into 
 those mansions of darkness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:9">Isa. xiv. 9</A>,

 &c.), so here

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 <I>They shall speak to him out of the midst of hell,</I> as it were
 congratulating his arrival and calling him to join with them in 
 acknowledging that which neither he nor they would be brought to own 
 when they were in their pomp and pride, that it is in vain to think of 
 contesting with God, and none ever hardened their hearts against him 
 and prospered. They shall say to him, and to those that pretended to 
 help him, Where are you now? What have you brought your attempts to at 
 last? Divers nations are here mentioned as gone down to the grave 
 before Egypt that are ready to give her a scornful reception and 
 upbraid her with coming to them at last. These nations here spoken of 
 were probably such as had been of late years ruined and wasted by the 
 king of Babylon, and their princes cut off; let Egypt know that she has 
 <I>neighbour's fare.</I> When she goes to the grave she does but 
 <I>migrare ad plures--migrate to the majority;</I> there are 
 <I>innumerable before her.</I> But it is observable that though Judah 
 and Jerusalem were just about this time, or a little before, utterly 
 ruined and laid waste, yet they are not mentioned here among the 
 nations that welcome Egypt to the pit; for though they suffered the 
 same things that these nations suffered, and by the same hand, yet the 
 kind intentions of their affliction, and its happy issue at last, and 
 the mercy God had yet in reserve for them, altered the property of it; 
 it was not to them a <I>going down to the pit,</I> as it was to the 
 heathen; they were not <I>smitten as others were,</I> nor <I>slain 
 according to the slaughter of other nations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:7">Isa. xxvii. 7</A>.

 But let us see who those are that have <I>gone to the grave</I> before
 Egypt, that <I>lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword,</I> with whom she 
 must now take up her lodging.

 (1.) There lie the Assyrian empire, and all the princes and mighty men 
 of that monarchy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>Asshur is there and all her company,</I> all the countries that were 
 tributaries to and had dependence upon that crown. That mighty 
 potentate who used to lie in state, with his guards and grandees about 
 him, now lies in obscurity, with his <I>graves about him</I> and his 
 soldiers in them, unable any longer to do him service or honour; they 
 are <I>all of them slain, fallen by the sword.</I> The number of their 
 months was <I>cut off in the midst,</I> and, being <I>bloody</I> and 
 <I>deceitful men,</I> they were not suffered to <I>live out half their 
 days.</I> Their <I>braves were set in the sides of the pit,</I> all in 
 a row, like beds in a common chamber, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 All their company is such as were <I>slain, fallen by the sword;</I> a 
 vast congregation there is of such, who had <I>caused terror in the 
 land of the living.</I> But as the death of those to whom they were a 
 terror put an end to their fears (in the grave <I>the prisoners rest 
 together</I> and <I>hear not the voice of the oppressor,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:18">Job iii. 18</A>),
 
 so the death of these mighty men puts an end to their terrors. Who is
 afraid of <I>a dead lion?</I> Note, Death will be a king of terrors to 
 those who, instead of making themselves blessings, make themselves 
 terrors, in their generation.

 (2.) There lies the kingdom of Persia, which perhaps within the memory 
 of man at that time had been wasted and brought down: <I>There is Elam 
 and all her multitude,</I> the king of Elam and his numerous armies,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>.

 They also had <I>caused their terror in the land of the living,</I> had 
 made a fearful noise and bluster among the nations in their day. But 
 Elam has now a grave by herself, and the graves of the common people 
 <I>round about her, fallen by the sword;</I> she has <I>her bed in the 
 midst of the slain</I> that went down <I>uncircumcised, 
 unsanctified,</I> unholy, and not in covenant with God. They have 
 <I>borne their shame with those that go down to the pit;</I> they have 
 fallen under the common disgrace and mortification of mankind, that 
 they die and are buried; nay, they die under particular marks of 
 ignominy, which God and man put upon them. Note, Those who cause their
 terror shall, sooner or later, bear their <I>shame,</I> and be made a 
 terror to themselves. The king of Elam is <I>put in the midst of those 
 that are slain.</I> All the honour he can now pretend to is to be 
 buried in the chief sepulchre. 

 (3.) There lies the Scythian power, which, about this time, was busy in 
 the world. <I>Meshech</I> and <I>Tubal,</I> those barbarous northern
 nations, had lately made a descent upon the Medes, and <I>caused their 
 terror</I> among them, lived among them upon free quarter for some 
 years, making every thing their own that they could lay their hands on; 
 but at length Cyaxares, king of the Medes, drew them by a wile into his 
 power, but off abundance of them, and obliged them to quit his country,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 There lie Meshech and Tubal, and all their multitude; there is a 
 burying place for them, with their chief commander in the midst of 
 them, <I>all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword.</I> These 
 Scythians, dying ingloriously as they lived, are not laid, as the other 
 nations spoken of before, in the bed of honour 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>They shall not lie with the mighty,</I> shall not be buried in 
 state, as those are, even by consent of the enemy, that are slain in 
 the field of battle, that <I>go down to their graves with their weapons 
 of war</I> carried before the hearse, or trailed after it, that have 
 particularly <I>their swords laid under their heads,</I> as if they 
 could sleep the sweeter in the grave when they laid their heads on such 
 a pillow. These Scythians are not buried with these marks of honour, 
 but <I>their iniquities shall be upon their sons;</I> they shall, for 
 their iniquity, be left unburied, though they were the <I>terror</I> 
 even <I>of the mighty in the land of the living.</I> 

 (4.) There lies the kingdom of Edom, which had flourished long, but 
 about this time, at least before the destruction of Egypt, was made 
 quite desolate, as was foretold,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:13"><I>ch.</I> xxv. 13</A>.

 Among the sepulchres of the nations <I>there is Edom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 There lie, not dignified with monuments or inscriptions, but mingled 
 with common dust, <I>her kings and all her princes,</I> her wise 
 statesmen (which Edom was famous for), and her brave soldiers. These 
 <I>with their might are laid by those that were slain by the sword;</I> 
 their might could not prevent it, nay, their might helped to procure 
 it, for that both encouraged them to engage in war and incensed their 
 neighbours against them, who thought it necessary to curb their growing 
 greatness. A great deal of pains they took to ruin themselves, as many 
 do, who <I>with their might,</I> with all their might, are <I>laid by 
 those that were slain with the sword.</I> The Edomites retained 
 circumcision, being of the seed of Abraham. But that shall stand them 
 in no stead; they shall <I>lie with the uncircumcised.</I> 

 (5.) There lie the <I>princes of the north, and all the Zidonians.</I> 
 These were as well acquainted with maritime affairs as the Egyptians 
 were, who relied much upon that part of their strength, but they have 
 <I>gone down with the slain</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 down to the pit. Now they are <I>ashamed of their might,</I> ashamed to 
 think how much they boasted of it and trusted to it; and, as the 
 <I>Edomites with their might,</I> so these <I>with their terror,</I> 
 are laid with those that are <I>slain by the sword</I> and are forced 
 to take their lot with them. They <I>bear their shame with those that
 go down to the pit,</I> die in as much disgrace as those that are cut 
 off by the hand of public justice. 

 (6.) All this is applied to Pharaoh and the Egyptians, who have no 
 reason to flatter themselves with hopes of tranquillity when they see 
 how the wisest, and wealthiest, and strongest, of their neighbours have 
 been laid waste

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 "<I>Yea, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised;</I> 
 when God is pulling down the unhumbled and unreformed nations thou must 
 expect to come down with them."

 [1.] It will be some extenuation of the miseries of Egypt to observe 
 that it has been the case of so many great and mighty nations before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 <I>Pharaoh shall see them and be comforted;</I> it will be some ease to 
 his mind that he is not the first king that has been slain in 
 battle--his not the first army that has been routed, his not the first 
 kingdom that has been made desolate. Mr. Greenhill observes here, "The 
 comfort which wicked ones have after death is poor comfort, not real, 
 but imaginary." They will find little satisfaction in having so many 
 fellow-sufferers; the rich man in hell dreaded it. It is only in point 
 of honour that Pharaoh can <I>see and be comforted.</I>

 [2.] But nothing will be an exemption from these miseries; for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>)
 
 <I>I have caused my terror in the land of the living.</I> Great men 
 have caused their terror, have studied how to make every body <I>fear 
 them. Oderint dum metuant--Let them hate, so that they do but
 fear.</I> But now the great God has <I>caused his terror in the land of 
 the living;</I> and therefore he laughs at theirs, because he sees that 
 <I>his day is coming,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:13">Ps. xxxvii. 13</A>.

 In this day of terror Pharaoh <I>and all his multitude</I> shall be
 <I>laid with those that are slain by the sword.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The view which this prophecy gives us of ruined states may show us 
 something, 

 1. Of this present world, and the empire of death in it. Come, and see
 the calamitous state of human life; see what a dying world this is. The 
 strong die, the mighty die, Pharaoh and all his multitude. See what a 
 killing world this is. They are all <I>slain with the sword.</I> As if 
 men did not die fast enough of themselves, men are ingenious at finding 
 out ways to destroy one another. It is not only a great pit, but a 
 great cock-pit. 

 2. Of the other world. Though it is the destruction of nations as such 
 that perhaps is principally intended here, yet here is a plain allusion 
 to the final and everlasting ruin of impenitent sinners, of those that 
 are uncircumcised in heart; they are <I>slain by the sword</I> of 
 divine justice; their <I>iniquity is upon them,</I> and with it they 
 <I>bear their shame.</I> Those, Christ's enemies, that would not have 
 him to reign over them, <I>shall be brought forth</I> and <I>slain 
 before him,</I> though they be as pompous, though they be as numerous, 
 as Pharaoh and <I>all his multitude.</I></P>
