 Here is another expedient tried to work upon this heedless and untoward 
 people, but it is tried in vain. A roll of a book is provided, 
 containing an abstract or abridgment of all the sermons that Jeremiah 
 had preached to them, that they might be put in mind of what they had 
 heard and might the better understand it, when they had it all before 
 them at one view. Now here we have, 

 I. The writing of this roll by Baruch, as Jeremiah dictated it, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. The reading of the roll by Baruch to all the people publicly on a
 fast-day

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:5-10">ver. 5-10</A>),

 afterwards by Baruch to the princes privately

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:11-19">ver. 11-19</A>),

 and lastly by Jehudi to the king, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:20,21">ver. 20, 21</A>.

 III. The burning of the roll by the king, with orders to prosecute 
 Jeremiah and Baruch, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:22-26">ver. 22-26</A>.

 IV. The writing of another roll, with large additions, particularly of
 Jehoiakim's doom for burning the former, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:27-32">ver. 27-32</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son
 of Josiah king of Judah, <I>that</I> this word came unto Jeremiah from
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words
 that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah,
 and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from
 the days of Josiah, even unto this day.
 &nbsp; 3  It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil
 which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man
 from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their
 sin.
 &nbsp; 4  Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch
 wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, which
 he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.
 &nbsp; 5  And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I <I>am</I> shut up; I
 cannot go into the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 &nbsp; 6  Therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast
 written from my mouth, the words of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in the ears of the
 people in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s house upon the fasting day: and also thou
 shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their
 cities.
 &nbsp; 7  It may be they will present their supplication before the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and will return every one from his evil way: for great <I>is</I>
 the anger and the fury that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath pronounced against this
 people.
 &nbsp; 8  And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that
 Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s house.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the beginning of Ezekiel's prophecy we meet with <I>a roll</I> 
 written <I>in vision,</I> for discovery of the things therein contained 
 to the prophet himself, who was to receive and digest them, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+2:9,10,3:1">Ezek. ii. 9, 10; iii. 1</A>.

 Here, in the latter end of Jeremiah's prophecy, we meet with <I>a
 roll</I> written <I>in fact,</I> for discovery of the things contained 
 therein to the people, who were to hear and give heed to them; for the 
 written word and other good books are of great use both to ministers 
 and people. We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The command which God gave to Jeremiah to write a summary of his 
 sermons, of all the reproofs and all the warnings he had given in God's 
 name to his people, ever since he first began to be a preacher, in the 
 thirteenth year of Josiah, <I>to this day,</I> which was in the fourth 
 year of Jehoiakim, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 What had been only spoken must now be written, that it might be 
 reviewed, and that it might spread the further and last the longer. 
 What had been spoken at large, with frequent repetitions of the same 
 things, perhaps in the same words (which has its advantage one way), 
 must now be contracted and put into less compass, that the several 
 parts of it might be better compared together, which has its advantage 
 another way. What they had heard once must be recapitulated, and 
 rehearsed to them again, that what was forgotten might be called to 
 mind again and what made no impression upon them at the first hearing 
 might take hold of them when they heard it the second time. And what 
 was perhaps already written, and published in single sermons, must be 
 collected into one volume, that none might be lost. Note, The writing 
 of the scripture is by divine appointment. And observe the reason here
 given for the writing of this roll 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>It may be the house of Judah will hear.</I> Not that the divine 
 prescience was at any uncertainty concerning the event: with that there 
 is no peradventure; God knew certainly <I>that they would deal very 
 treacherously,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:8">Isa. xlviii. 8</A>.

 But the divine wisdom directed to this as a proper means for attaining 
 the desired end: and, if it failed, they would be the more inexcusable. 
 And, though God foresaw that they would not hear, he did not tell the 
 prophet so, but prescribed this method to him as a probably one to be 
 used, in the hopes that they would <I>hear,</I> that is, heed and 
 regard what they heard, take notice of it and mix faith with it: for 
 otherwise our hearing the word, though an angel from heaven were to 
 read or preach it to us, would stand us in no stead. Now observe here,

 1. What it is hoped they will thus hear: <I>All that evil which I 
 purpose to do unto them.</I> Note, The serious consideration of the 
 certain fatal consequences of sin will be of great use to us to bring 
 us to God. 

 2. What it is hoped will be produced thereby: <I>They will hear, that 
 they may return every man from his evil way.</I> Note, The conversion 
 of sinners from their evil courses is that which ministers should aim 
 at in preaching; and people hear the word in vain if that point be not 
 gained with them. To what purpose do we hear of the evil God will bring 
 upon us for sin if we continue, notwithstanding, to do evil against 
 him? 

 3. Of what vast advantage their consideration and conversion will be to 
 them: <I>That I may forgive their iniquity.</I> This plainly implies 
 the honour of God's justice, with which it is not consistent that he 
 should forgive the sin unless the sinner repent of it and turn from it; 
 but it plainly expresses the honour of his mercy, that he is very ready 
 to forgive sin and only waits till the sinner be qualified to receive 
 forgiveness, and therefore uses various means to bring us to 
 repentance, <I>that he may forgive.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The instructions which Jeremiah gave to Baruch his scribe, pursuant 
 to the command he had received from God, and the writing of the roll 
 accordingly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 God bade Jeremiah write, but, it should seem, he had not the <I>pen of 
 a ready writer,</I> he could not write fast, or fair, so as Baruch 
 could, and therefore he made use of him as his amanuensis. St. Paul
 wrote but few of his epistles with his own hand, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:11,Ro+16:22">Gal. vi. 11; Rom. xvi. 22</A>.
 
 God dispenses his gifts variously; some have a good faculty at 
 speaking, others at writing, and neither can say to the other, We have 
 <I>no need of you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:21">1 Cor. xii. 21</A>.

 The Spirit of God dictated to Jeremiah, and he to Baruch, who had been
 employed by Jeremiah as trustee for him in his purchase of the field 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:12"><I>ch.</I> xxxii. 12</A>)

 and now was advanced to be his scribe and substitute in his prophetical
 office; and, if we may credit the apocryphal book that bears his name, 
 he was afterwards himself a prophet to the captives in Babylon. Those 
 that begin low are likely to rise high, and it is good for those that 
 are designed for prophets to have their education under prophets and to 
 be serviceable to them. Baruch wrote what Jeremiah dictated in a 
 <I>roll of a book</I> on pieces of parchment, or vellum, which were 
 joined together, the top of one to the bottom of the other, so making 
 one long scroll, which was rolled perhaps upon a staff.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The orders which Jeremiah gave to Baruch to read what he had 
 written to the people. Jeremiah, it seems was <I>shut up,</I> and 
 <I>could not go to the house of the Lord</I> himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Though he was not a close prisoner, for then there would have been no
 occasion to send officers to seize him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 yet he was forbidden by the king to appear in the temple, was shut out 
 thence where he might be serving God and doing good, which was as bad 
 to him as if he had been shut up in a dungeon. Jehoiakim was ripening
 apace for ruin when he thus silenced God's faithful messengers. But, 
 when Jeremiah could not go to the temple himself, he sent one that was 
 deputed by him to read to the people what he would himself have said. 
 Thus St. Paul wrote epistles to the churches which he could not visit 
 in person. Nay, it was what he himself had often said to them. Note, 
 The writing and repeating of the sermons that have been preached may 
 contribute very much towards the answering of the great ends of 
 preaching. What we have heard and known it is good for us to hear
 again, that we may know it better. To preach and write the same thing 
 is safe and profitable, and many times very necessary 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:1">Phil. iii. 1</A>),

 and we must be glad to hear a good word from God, though we have it, as
 here, at second hand. Both ministers and people must do what they can 
 when they cannot do what they would. Observe, When God ordered the
 reading of the roll he said, <I>It may be they will hear and return 
 from their evil ways,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 When Jeremiah orders it, he says, <I>It may be they will pray</I> (they 
 will <I>present their supplications before the Lord</I>) and will 
 <I>return from their evil way.</I> Note, Prayer to God for grace to 
 turn us is necessary in order to our turning; and those that are 
 convinced by the word of God of the necessity of returning to him will 
 present their supplications to him for that grace. And the 
 consideration of this, that <I>great is the anger which God has 
 pronounced against us</I> for sin, should quicken both our prayers and 
 our endeavours. Now, according to these orders, Baruch did read <I>out 
 of the book the words of the Lord,</I> whenever there was a <I>holy 
 convocation,</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of
 Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, <I>that</I> they proclaimed
 a fast before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all
 the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 10  Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the
 house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan
 the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s house, in the ears of all the people.
 &nbsp; 11  When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had
 heard out of the book all the words of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 &nbsp; 12  Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's
 chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, <I>even</I> Elishama the
 scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of
 Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of
 Hananiah, and all the princes.
 &nbsp; 13  Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had
 heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.
 &nbsp; 14  Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah,
 the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take
 in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the
 people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in
 his hand, and came unto them.
 &nbsp; 15  And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our
 ears. So Baruch read <I>it</I> in their ears.
 &nbsp; 16  Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they
 were afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will
 surely tell the king of all these words.
 &nbsp; 17  And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou
 write all these words at his mouth?
 &nbsp; 18  Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words
 unto me with his mouth, and I wrote <I>them</I> with ink in the book.
 &nbsp; 19  Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and
 Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It should seem that Baruch had been frequently reading out of the book, 
 to all companies that would give him the hearing, before the most 
 solemn reading of it altogether which is here spoken of; for the 
 directions were given about it in the <I>fourth year of Jehoiakim,</I> 
 whereas this was done <I>in the fifth year,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 But some think that the writing of the book fairly over took up so much 
 time that it was another year ere it was perfected; and yet perhaps it 
 might not be past a month or two; he might begin in the latter end of 
 the fourth year and finish it in the beginning of the fifth, for 
 <I>thee ninth month</I> refers to the computation of the year in 
 general, not to the year of that reign. Now observe here, 

 1. The government appointed a public fast to be religiously observed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),
 
 on account either of the distress they were brought into by the army of 
 the Chaldeans or of the want of rain

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:1"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 1</A>):

 <I>They proclaimed a fast to the people;</I> whether the king and
 princes or the priests, ordered this fast, is not certain; but it was 
 plain that God by his providence called them aloud to it. Note, Great 
 shows of piety and devotion may be found even among those who, though 
 they keep up these <I>forms of godliness,</I> are strangers and enemies 
 to <I>the power</I> of it. But what will such hypocritical services 
 avail? Fasting, without reforming and turning away from sin, will never 
 turn away the judgments of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+3:10">Jon. iii. 10</A>.

 Notwithstanding this fast, God proceeded in his controversy with this
 people.

 2. Baruch repeated Jeremiah's sermons publicly in the house of the 
 Lord, on the fast-day. He stood in a chamber that belonged to
 Gemariah, and out of a window, or balcony, read to the people that were 
 in the court,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Note, When we are speaking to God we must be willing to hear from him; 
 and therefore, on days of fasting and prayer, it is requisite that the 
 word be read and preached. <I>Hearken unto me, that God may hearken 
 unto you.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:7">Judg. ix. 7</A>.

 For our help in suing out mercy and grace, it is proper that we should
 be told of sin and duty.

 3. An account was brought of this to the princes that attended the 
 court and were now together in the secretary's office, here called 
 <I>the scribe's chamber,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 It should seem, though the princes had called the people to meet in the 
 house of God, to fact, and pray, and hear the word, they did not think 
 fit to attend there themselves, which was a sign that it was not from a 
 principle of true devotion, but merely for fashion sake, that they 
 proclaimed this fast. We are willing to hope that it was not with a bad 
 design, to bring Jeremiah into trouble for his preaching, but with a 
 good design, to bring the princes into trouble for their sins, that 
 Michaiah informed the princes of what Baruch had read; for his father 
 Gemariah so far countenanced Baruch as to lend him his chamber to read 
 out of. Michaiah finds the princes sitting in <I>the scribe's 
 chamber,</I> and tells them they had better have been where he had 
 been, hearing a good sermon in the temple, which he gives them the 
 heads of. Note, When we have heard some good word that has affected and 
 edified us we should be ready to communicate it to others that did not 
 hear it, for their edification. <I>Out of the abundance of the heart 
 the mouth speaks.</I> 

 4. Baruch is sent for, and is ordered to sit down among them and read 
 it all over again to them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>),

 which he readily did, not complaining that he was weary with his public 
 work and therefore desiring to be excused, nor upbraiding the princes 
 with their being absent from the temple, where they might have heard it 
 when he read it there. Note, God's ministers must <I>become all things 
 to all men, if by any means they may gain some,</I> must comply with 
 them in circumstances, that they may secure the substance. St. Paul 
 preached privately to those of reputation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:2">Gal. ii. 2</A>.

 5. The princes were for the present much affected with the word that 
 was read to them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Observe, <I>They heard all the words</I> they did not interrupt him, 
 but very patiently attended to the reading of the whole book; for 
 otherwise how could they form a competent judgment of it? And, <I>when 
 they had heard all, they were afraid,</I> were all afraid, <I>one</I> 
 as well as <I>another;</I> like Felix, who trembled at Paul's 
 reasonings. The reproofs were just, the threatenings terrible, and the 
 predictions now in a fair way to be fulfilled; so that, laying all 
 together, they were in a great consternation. We are not told what 
 impressions this reading of the roll made upon the people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 but the princes were put into a fright by it, and (as some read it) 
 <I>looked one upon another,</I> not knowing what to say. They were all 
 convinced that it was worthy to be regarded, but none of them had 
 courage to second it, only they agreed to <I>tell the king of all these 
 words;</I> and, if he think fit to give credit to them, they will, 
 otherwise not, no, though it were to prevent the ruin of the nation.
 And yet at the same time they knew the king's mind so far that they 
 advised Baruch and Jeremiah to hide themselves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>)

 and to shift as they could for their own safety, expecting no other 
 than that the king, instead of being convinced, would be exasperated. 
 Note, It is common for sinners, under convictions, to endeavour to 
 shake them off, by shifting off the prosecution of them to other 
 persons, as these princes here, or to another <I>more convenient 
 season,</I> as Felix. 

 6. They asked Baruch a trifling question, <I>How he wrote all these
 words</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 as if they suspected there was something extraordinary in it; but 
 Baruch gives them a plain answer, that there was nothing but what was 
 common in the manner of the writing--Jeremiah dictated and he wrote, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 But thus it is common for those who would avoid the convictions of the 
 word of God to start needless questions about the way and manner of the 
 inspiration of it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid
 up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all
 the words in the ears of the king.
 &nbsp; 21  So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it
 out of Elishama the scribe's chamber. And Jehudi read it in the
 ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood
 beside the king.
 &nbsp; 22  Now the king sat in the winter house in the ninth month: and
 <I>there was a fire</I> on the hearth burning before him.
 &nbsp; 23  And it came to pass, <I>that</I> when Jehudi had read three or
 four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast <I>it</I> into the
 fire that <I>was</I> on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in
 the fire that <I>was</I> on the hearth.
 &nbsp; 24  Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, <I>neither</I>
 the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.
 &nbsp; 25  Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made
 intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he
 would not hear them.
 &nbsp; 26  But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and
 Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to
 take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hid
 them.
 &nbsp; 27  Then the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came to Jeremiah, after that the
 king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the
 mouth of Jeremiah, saying,
 &nbsp; 28  Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former
 words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of
 Judah hath burned.
 &nbsp; 29  And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou
 written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come
 and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man
 and beast?
 &nbsp; 30  Therefore thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He
 shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead
 body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night
 to the frost.
 &nbsp; 31  And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for
 their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the
 inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil
 that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not.
 &nbsp; 32  Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the
 scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of
 Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah
 had burned in the fire: and there were added besides unto them
 many like words.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have traced the roll to the people, and to the princes, and here we 
 are to follow it to the king; and we find,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That, upon notice given him concerning it, he sent for it, and 
 ordered it to be read to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.

 He did not desire that Baruch would come and read it himself, who could 
 read it more intelligently and with more authority and affection than 
 any one else; nor did he order one of his princes to do it (though it 
 would have been no disparagement to the greatest of them), much less 
 would he vouchsafe to read it himself; but Jehudi, one of his pages now 
 in waiting, who was sent to fetch it, is bidden to read it, who perhaps 
 scarcely knew how to make sense of it. But those who thus despise the 
 word of God will soon make it to appear, as this king did, that they 
 hate it too, and have not only low, but ill thoughts of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That he had not patience to hear it read through as the princes 
 had, but, when he had heard <I>three or four leaves</I> read, in a rage 
 he <I>cut it with his penknife,</I> and threw it piece by piece <I>into 
 the fire,</I> that he might be sure to see it <I>all consumed,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>.

 This was a piece of as daring impiety as a man could lightly be guilty 
 of, and a most impudent affront to the God of heaven, whose message 
 this was. 

 1. Thus he showed his impatience of reproof; being resolved to persist
 in sin, he would by no means bear to be told of his faults.

 2. Thus he showed his indignation at Baruch and Jeremiah; he would have
 cut them in pieces, and burnt them, if he had had them in his reach, 
 when he was in this passion. 

 3. Thus he expressed an abstinent resolution never to comply with the 
 designs and intentions of the warnings given him; he will do what he 
 will, whatever God by his prophets says to the contrary. 

 4. Thus he foolishly hoped to defeat the threatenings denounced against 
 him, as if God knew not how to execute the sentence when the roll was 
 gone in which it was written.

 5. Thus he thought he had effectually provided that the things 
 contained in this roll should spread no further, which was the care of 
 the chief priests concerning the gospel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:17">Acts iv. 17</A>.

 They had told him how this roll had been read to the people and to the
 princes. "But," says he, "I will take a course that shall prevent its 
 being read any more." See what an enmity there is against God in the 
 carnal mind, and wonder at the patience of God, that he bears with such 
 indignities done to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That neither the king himself nor any of his princes were at all 
 affected with the word: <I>They were not afraid</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 no, not those princes that <I>trembled at the word</I> when they heard 
 it the first time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 So soon, so easily, do good impressions wear off. They showed some
 concern till they saw how light the king made of it, and then they 
 shook off all that concern. They <I>rent not their garments,</I> as 
 Josiah, this Jehoiakim's own father, did when he had the <I>book of the 
 law</I> read to him, though it was not so particular as the contents of 
 this roll were, nor so immediately adapted to the present posture of 
 affairs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That there were three of the princes who had so much sense and 
 grace left as to interpose for the preventing of the burning of the 
 roll, but in vain, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 If they had from the first shown themselves, as they ought to have 
 done, affected with the word, perhaps they might have brought the king 
 to a better mind and have persuaded him to bear it patiently; but 
 frequently those that will not do the good they should put it out of 
 their own power to do the good they would.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. That Jehoiakim, when he had thus in effect burnt God's warrant by 
 which he was arrested, as it were in a way of revenge, now that he 
 thought he had got the better, signed a warrant for the apprehending of 
 Jeremiah and Baruch, God's ministers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>But the Lord hid them.</I> The princes bade them abscond 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),
 
 but it was neither the princes' care for them nor theirs for themselves 
 that secured them; it was under the divine protection that they were 
 safe. Note, God will find out a shelter for his people, though their 
 persecutors be ever so industrious to get them into their power, till 
 their hour be come; nay, and then he will himself be their hiding 
 place.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. That Jeremiah had orders and instructions to write in another roll 
 the same words that were written in the roll which Jehoiakim had burnt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:27,28"><I>v.</I> 27, 28</A>.

 Note, Though the attempts of hell against the word of God are very 
 daring, yet not one iota or tittle of it shall fall to the ground, nor 
 shall the unbelief of man make the word of God of no effect. Enemies 
 may prevail to burn many a Bible, but they cannot abolish the word of 
 God, can neither extirpate it nor defeat the accomplishment of it. 
 Though the tables of the law were broken, they were renewed again; and 
 so out of the ashes of the roll that was burnt arose another Phoenix. 
 <I>The word of the Lord endures for ever.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. That the king of Judah, though a king, was severely reckoned with 
 by the King of kings for this indignity done to the written word. God 
 noticed what it was in the roll that Jehoiakim took so much offense at. 
 Jehoiakim was angry because it was <I>written therein, saying,</I> 
 Surely <I>the king of Babylon shall come and destroy this land,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 And did not <I>the king of Babylon</I> come two years before this, and 
 go far towards <I>the destroying of this land?</I> He did so 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:6,7">2 Chron. xxxvi. 6, 7</A>)
 
 in his third year,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:1">Dan. i. 1</A>.

 So that God and his prophets had <I>therefore become his enemies
 because they told him the truth,</I> told him of the desolation that 
 was coming, but at the same time putting him into a fair way to prevent 
 it. But, if this be the thing he takes so much amiss, let him know,

 1. That the wrath of God shall come upon him and his family, in the 
 first place, by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar. He shall be cut off, and in 
 a few weeks his son shall be dethroned, and exchange his royal robes 
 for prison-garments, so that <I>he shall have none to sit upon the 
 throne of David;</I> the glory of that illustrious house shall be 
 eclipsed, and die in him; <I>his dead body</I> shall lie unburied, or, 
 which comes all to one, <I>he shall be buried with the burial of an 
 ass,</I> that is, thrown into the next ditch; it shall lie exposed to 
 all weathers, <I>heat and frost,</I> which will occasion its putrefying 
 and becoming loathsome the sooner. "Not that his body" (says Mr.
 Gataker) "could be sensible of such usage, or himself, being deceased, 
 of aught that should befal his body; but that the king's body in such a 
 condition should be a hideous spectacle, and a horrid monument of God's 
 heavy wrath and indignation against him, unto all that should behold 
 it." Even <I>his seed and his servants</I> shall fare the worse for 
 their relation to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),
 
 for they shall be punished, not for his iniquity, but so much the 
 sooner for their own. 

 2. That all the evil pronounced against Judah and Jerusalem in that 
 roll shall be brought upon them. Though the copy be burnt, the original 
 remains in the divine counsel, which shall again be copied out after 
 another manner in bloody characters. Note, There is no escaping God's 
 judgments by struggling with them. <I>Who ever hardened his heart 
 against God, and prospered?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. That, when the roll was written anew, <I>there were added</I> to 
 the former <I>many like words</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),

 many more threatenings of wrath and vengeance; for, since they will yet 
 <I>walk contrary to God,</I> he will <I>heat the furnace seven times 
 hotter.</I> Note, As God is in one mind, and none can turn him, so he 
 has still more arrows in his quiver; and those who contend with God's 
 woes do but prepare for themselves heavier of the same kind.</P>
