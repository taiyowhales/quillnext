 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The scope of this chapter is to prosecute the exhortation given to 
 Israel in the close of the foregoing chapter to prepare to meet their 
 God; the prophet here tells them, 

 I. What preparation they must make; they must "seek the Lord," and not
 seek any more to idols 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:4-8">ver. 4-8</A>);

 they must seek good, and love it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:14,15">ver. 14, 15</A>.

 II. Why they must make this preparation to meet their God, 

 1. Because of the present deplorable condition they were in,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 2. Because it was by sin that they were brought into such a condition,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:7,10-12">ver. 7, 10-12</A>.

 3. Because it would be their happiness to seek God, and he was ready to
 be found of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:8,9,14">ver. 8, 9, 14</A>.

 4. Because he would proceed, in his wrath, to their utter ruin, if they
 did not seek him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:5,6,13,16,17">ver. 5, 6, 13, 16, 17</A>.

 5. Because all their confidences would fail them if they did not seek
 unto God, and make him their friend. 

 (1.) Their profane contempt of God's judgments, and setting them at
 defiance, would not secure them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:18-20">ver. 18-20</A>.

 (2.) Their external services in religion, and the shows of devotion,
 would not avail to turn away the wrath of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:21-24">ver. 21-24</A>.

 (3.) Their having been long in possession of church-privileges, and in
 a course of holy duties, would not be their protection, while all along 
 they had kept up their idolatrous customs, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:25-27">ver. 25-27</A>.

 They have therefore no way left them to save themselves, but by
 repentance and reformation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Hear ye this word which I take up against you, <I>even</I> a
 lamentation, O house of Israel.
 &nbsp; 2 The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she
 is forsaken upon her land; <I>there is</I> none to raise her up.
 &nbsp; 3 For thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; The city that went out <I>by</I> a
 thousand shall leave a hundred, and that which went forth <I>by</I>
 a hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter begins, as those two next foregoing began, with, <I>Hear 
 this word.</I> Where God has a mouth to speak we must have an ear to 
 hear; it is our duty, it is our interest, yet so stupid are most men 
 that they need to be again and again called upon to <I>hear the word of 
 the Lord,</I> to give audience, to give attention. <I>Hear this 
 word.</I> this convincing awakening word must be heard and heeded, as 
 well as words of comfort and peace; the word that is taken up against 
 us, as well as that which makes for us; for, whether we hear or 
 forbear, the word of God shall take effect, and not a tittle of it 
 shall fall to the ground. It is the <I>word which I take up</I>--not the
 prophet only, but the God that sent him. It is <I>the word that the 
 Lord has spoken,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:1"><I>ch.</I> iii. 1</A>.

 The word to be heard is <I>a lamentation,</I> a lamentable account of
 the present calamitous state of the kingdom of Israel, and a lamentable 
 prediction of its utter destruction. Their condition is sad: <I>The 
 virgin of Israel has fallen</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 has come down from what she was; that state, though not pure and chaste 
 as a virgin, yet was beautiful and gay, and had its charms; she looked 
 high herself, and was courted by many as a virgin; but <I>she has 
 fallen</I> into contempt and poverty, and is universally slighted. Nay, 
 and their condition is helpless: <I>She shall no more rise,</I> shall 
 never recover her former dignity again. God had lately begun to <I>cut 
 Israel short</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:32">2 Kings x. 32</A>),

 and, because they repented not, it was not long before he <I>cut Israel
 down.</I> 

 1. Their princes, that should have helped them up, were disabled:
 <I>She is forsaken upon her land.</I> Not only those she was in 
 alliance with abroad failed her, but her friends at home deserted her; 
 she would not have been carried captive into a strange land if she had 
 not first been <I>forsaken upon her own land</I> and <I>thrown to the 
 ground</I> there, and all her true interests abandoned by those that 
 should have had them at heart. <I>There is none to raise her up,</I>
 none that can do it, not that cares to lend her a hand.

 2. Their people, that should have helped them up, were diminished,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 "The city that had a militia, 1000 strong, and, in the beginning of the 
 war, had furnished out 1000 effective men, able-bodied and well-armed, 
 when they come to review their troops after the battle, shall find but 
 100 <I>left;</I> and, in proportion, the city that sent out 100 shall 
 have but <I>ten</I> come back, so great a slaughter shall be made, and 
 so few left to the house of Israel for the public service and safety." 
 Scarcely one in ten shall escape of the hands that should relieve this 
 abject, this dejected, nation. Note, The lessening of the numbers of 
 God's spiritual Israel, by death or desertion, is just a matter for 
 lamentation; for <I>by whom shall Jacob arise,</I> by whom shall the 
 decays of piety be repaired, when he is thus <I>made small?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4 For thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me,
 and ye shall live:
 &nbsp; 5 But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to
 Beer-sheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel
 shall come to nought.
 &nbsp; 6 Seek the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire
 in the house of Joseph, and devour <I>it,</I> and <I>there be</I> none to
 quench <I>it</I> in Bethel.
 &nbsp; 7 Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness
 in the earth,
 &nbsp; 8 <I>Seek him</I> that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth
 the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark
 with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth
 them out upon the face of the earth: The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> his name:
 &nbsp; 9 That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that
 the spoiled shall come against the fortress.
 &nbsp; 10 They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him
 that speaketh uprightly.
 &nbsp; 11 Forasmuch therefore as your treading <I>is</I> upon the poor, and
 ye take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn
 stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant
 vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.
 &nbsp; 12 For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty
 sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn
 aside the poor in the gate <I>from their right.</I>
 &nbsp; 13 Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for
 it <I>is</I> an evil time.
 &nbsp; 14 Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.
 &nbsp; 15 Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in
 the gate: it may be that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of hosts will be gracious
 unto the remnant of Joseph.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is a message from God to the house of Israel, in which,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They are told of their faults, that they might see what occasion 
 there was for them to repent and reform, and that, when they were 
 called to return, they might not need to ask, <I>Wherein shall we 
 return?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God tells them, in general 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 "<I>I know your manifold transgressions, and your mighty sins;</I> and 
 you shall be made to know them too." In our penitent reflections upon 
 our sins we must consider, as God does in his judicial remarks upon 
 them, and will do in the great day, 

 (1.) That they are very numerous; they are our <I>manifold 
 transgressions,</I> sins of various kinds and often repeated. Oh what a 
 multitude of vain and vile thoughts lodge within us! What a multitude 
 of idle, foolish, wicked words have been spoken by us! In what a 
 multitude of instances have we gratified and indulged our corrupt 
 appetites and passions! And how many our own omissions of duty and in 
 duty! Who can understand his errors? Who can tell how often he offends?
 God knows how many, just how many, our transgressions are; none of them 
 pass him unobserved; we know that they are to us innumerable; <I>more 
 than the hairs of our head;</I> and we have reason to see what danger 
 we have brought ourselves into, and what abundance of work we have made 
 for repentance, by our <I>manifold transgressions,</I> by the 
 numberless number of our sins of daily incursion. 

 (2.) That some of them are very heinous; they are <I>our mighty</I> 
 sins; sins that are more exceedingly sinful in their own nature and by 
 being committed presumptuously and with a high hand, sins against the 
 light of nature, flagrant crimes, that are mighty to overpower your 
 convictions and to pull down judgments upon you.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He specifies some of these mighty sins. 

 (1.) They corrupted the worship of God, and turned to idols; this is 
 implied

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 They had <I>sought to Bethel,</I> where one of the golden calves was; 
 they had frequented Gilgal, a place which they chose to set up idols 
 in, because it had been made famous in the days of Joshua by God's 
 wonderful appearances to and for his people. Beer-sheba likewise, a 
 place that had been famous in the days of the patriarchs, was now 
 another rendezvous of idols; as we find also,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+8:14"><I>ch.</I> viii. 14</A>.

 And thither <I>they passed,</I> though it lay at a distance, in the
 land of Judah. Now, having thus shamefully gone a whoring from God, no 
 doubt they should have felt themselves concerned to return to him. 

 (2.) They perverted justice among themselves

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "<I>You turn judgment to wormwood,</I> that is, you make your 
 administrations of justice bitter and nauseous, and highly displeasing 
 both to God and man." That fruit has become a <I>weed,</I> a weed in 
 the garden; as nothing is more venerable, nothing more valuable, than 
 justice duly administered, so nothing is more hurtful, nothing more 
 abominable, than designedly doing wrong under colour and pretence of 
 doing right. <I>Corruptio optimi est pessima</I>--<I>The best, when 
 corrupted, becomes the worst. "You leave off righteousness in the
 earth,</I> as if those that do wrong were accountable to the God of 
 heaven only, and not to the princes and <I>judges of the earth.</I>" 
 Thus it was as before the flood, when the <I>earth was filled with 
 violence.</I> 

 (3.) They were very oppressive to the poor, and made them poorer; they 
 trod upon the poor

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 trampled upon them, hectored over them, made them their footstool, and 
 were most imperious and barbarous to those that were most obsequious 
 and submissive; they care not what shame and slavery they put those to 
 who were poor and such as they could get nothing by. The judges aimed
 at nothing but to enrich themselves; and therefore they <I>took 
 from</I> the poor <I>burdens of wheat,</I> took it by extortion, either 
 by way of bribe or by usury. The poor had no other way to save
 themselves from being trodden upon, and trodden to dirt, by them, than 
 by presenting to them horse-loads of that corn which they and their 
 families should have had to subsist upon, and they forced them to do 
 it. They took from the poor <I>debts of wheat,</I> so some read it. It 
 was legally due either for rent or for corn lent, but they exacted it 
 with rigour from those who were disabled by the providence of God to 
 pay it, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:2,5">Neh. v. 2, 5</A>.

 In demanding and recovering even a just debt we must take heed left we
 act either unjustly or uncharitably. This sin of oppression by are 
 again charged with

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>They afflict the just,</I> by turning the edge of the law and of the 
 sword of justice against those that are the innocent and <I>quiet in 
 the land;</I> they hated men because they were more righteous than 
 themselves, and he that <I>departed from evil</I> thereby <I>made 
 himself a prey</I> to them. They take a bribe from the rich to
 patronize and protect them in oppressing the poor, so that he who has 
 money in his hand is sure to have the judgment on his side, be his 
 cause ever so bad. Thus they <I>turn aside the poor in the gate,</I> in 
 the courts of justice, <I>from their right.</I> If the poor sue for 
 their right, who cannot bribe them, or are so honest that they will 
 not, though they have it ever so clear in view and ever so <I>near,</I> 
 yet they are turned away from it by their unrighteous sentence and 
 cannot come at it. And <I>therefore the prudent will keep silence,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Men will reckon it their prudence, when they are wronged and injured, 
 to be silent, and make no complaints to the magistrates, for it will be 
 to no purpose; they shall not have justice done them. 

 (4.) They were malicious persecutors of God's faithful ministers and 
 people,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 Their hearts were so fully set in them to do evil that they could not 
 bear to be reproved,

 [1.] By the ministry of the word, by the reading and expounding of the 
 law, and the messages which prophets delivered to them in the name of 
 the Lord. <I>They hate him that rebukes in the gate,</I> in the gate of 
 the Lord's house, or in their courts of justice, or in the places of 
 concourse, where Wisdom is lifting up her voice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:21">Prov. i. 21</A>.

 Reprovers in the gate are reprovers by office; these they hated, 
 counting them their <I>enemies because they told them the truth,</I> as 
 Ahab hated Micaiah. They not only despised them, but had an enmity to 
 them, and sought to do them mischief. Those that hate reproof love
 ruin.

 [2.] By the conversation of their honest neighbours. Though things
 were generally very bad, yet there were some among them that <I>spoke 
 uprightly</I> that made conscience of what they said, and, as it was 
 their praise, so it was the shame of those that spoke deceitfully, and 
 condemned them, as Noah's faith condemned the unbelief of the old 
 world, and for that reason <I>they abhorred them;</I> they were such 
 inveterate enemies to the thing called honesty that they could not 
 endure the sight of an honest man. All that have any sense of the 
 common interest of mankind will love and value such as speak uprightly, 
 for veracity is the bond of human society; to what a pitch of folly and 
 madness then have those arrived who, having banished all notions of 
 justice out of their own hearts, would have them banished out of the 
 world too, and so put mankind into a state of war, for the <I>abhor him 
 that speaks uprightly!</I> And for this reason <I>the prudent shall 
 keep silence in that time,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Prophets cannot, dare not, keep silence; the impulse they are under 
 will not allow them to act on prudential considerations; they must 
 <I>cry aloud, and not spare.</I> But as for other wise and good men 
 they shall keep silence, and shall reckon it is their prudence to do 
 so, because it is an evil time. <I>First,</I> They shall think it
 dangerous to complain, and therefore shall keep silence; this was one 
 way in which they afflicted the just, that by false suggestions and 
 strained innuendos they made men <I>offenders for a word</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:21">Isa. xix. 21</A>);

 and therefore the <I>prudent,</I> who were <I>wise as serpents,</I>
 because they knew not how what they said might be misinterpreted and 
 misrepresented, were so cautious as to say nothing, lest they should 
 run themselves into a premunire, because it was an evil time. Note, 
 Through the iniquity of the times, as good men are hidden, so good men 
 are silent, and it is their wisdom to be so; <I>little said soon 
 amended.</I> But it is their comfort that they may speak freely to God 
 when they know not to whom else they can speak freely. <I>Secondly,</I> 
 They shall think if fruitless to reprove. They see what wickedness is 
 committed, and their spirits are stirred up, as Paul's at Athens; but 
 they shall think it prudent not to bear an open testimony against it, 
 because it is to no purpose. They are <I>joined to their idols; let 
 them alone. Let no man strive or rebuke another;</I> for it is but 
 <I>casting pearls before swine.</I> The cautious men will say to a bold 
 reprover, as Erasmus to Luther, "<I>Abi in cellam, et dic, Miserere 
 mei, Domine</I>--<I>Away to thy cell, and cry, Have mercy on me, O 
 Lord!</I>" Let grave lessons and counsels be kept for better men and 
 better times. And there is <I>a time to keep silence</I> as well as 
 <I>a time to speak,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:7">Eccl. iii. 7</A>.

 <I>Evil times</I> will not bear plain dealing, that is <I>evil men</I>
 will not; and the men the prophet here speaks of had reason to think 
 themselves evil men indeed, when wise and good them thought it in vain 
 to speak to them and were afraid of having any thing to do with 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They are told of their danger and what judgments they lay exposed 
 to for their sins. 

 1. The places of their idolatry are in danger of being ruined in the
 first place,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 <I>Gilgal,</I> the head-quarters of idolatry, <I>shall go into 
 captivity,</I> not only its inhabitants, but its images, <I>and 
 Bethel,</I> with its golden calf <I>shall come to nought.</I> The 
 victorious enemy shall make nothing of it, so easily shall it be 
 spoiled, and shall bring it to nothing, so effectually shall it be 
 spoiled. Idols were always vanity, and <I>things of nought,</I> and so 
 they shall prove when God appears to abolish them.

 2. The body of the kingdom is in danger of being ruined with them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 There is danger lest, if you seek him not in time, he <I>break out like 
 a fire in the house of Joseph and devour it;</I> for our God is a 
 righteous Judge, is a <I>consuming fire,</I> and the men of Israel, as 
 criminals, are stubble before him; woe to those that make themselves 
 fuel to the fire of God's wrath. It follows, <I>And there shall be none 
 to quench it in Bethel.</I> There their idols were, and their 
 idolatrous priests; thither they brought their sacrifices, and there 
 they offered up their prayers. But God tells them that when the fire of 
 his judgments should kindle upon them all the gods they served at 
 Bethel should not be able to quench it, should not turn away the 
 judgment, nor be any relief to them under it. Thus those that make an 
 idol of the world will find it insufficient to protect them when God 
 comes to reckon with them for their spiritual idolatry. 

 3. What they have got by oppression and extortion shall be taken from
 them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):
 
 "<I>You have built houses of hewn stone,</I> which you thought would be 
 lasting; <I>but you shall not dwell in them,</I> for your enemies shall 
 burn them down, or possess them for themselves, or take you into 
 captivity. <I>You have planted pleasant vineyards,</I> have contrived 
 how to make them every way agreeable, and have promised yourselves many 
 a pleasant walk in them; but you shall be forced to walk off, and shall 
 never <I>drink wine of them.</I>" The law had tenderly provided that if 
 a man had <I>built a house,</I> or <I>planted a vineyard,</I> he should 
 be at his liberty to return from the wars, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:5,6">Deut. xx. 5, 6</A>.

 But now the necessity would be so urgent that it would not be allowed;
 all must go to the battle, and many of those who had lately been 
 building and planting should fall in battle, and never enjoy what they 
 had been labouring for. What is not honestly got is not likely to be 
 long enjoyed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They are told their duty, and have great encouragement to set 
 about it in good earnest, and good reason. The duties here prescribed 
 to them are godliness and honesty, seriousness in their applications to 
 God and justice in their dealings with men; and each of these is here 
 pressed upon them with proper arguments to enforce the exhortation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They are here exhorted to be sincere and devout in their addresses 
 to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 God says to the <I>house of Israel, Seek you me,</I> and with good
 reason, for <I>should not a people seek unto their God?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:19">Isa. viii. 19</A>.
 
 Whither else should they go but to their protector? Israel was a 
 <I>prince with God;</I> let his descendants <I>seek the Lord,</I> as he 
 did, and they shall be so too. Now, in order to their doing this, they 
 must abandon their idolatries. God is not sought truly if he be not 
 sought exclusively, for he will endure no rivals: "<I>Seek you the 
 Lord, and seek not Bethel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 consult not your idol-oracles, nor ask at the mouth of the priests of
 Bethel; seek not to the golden calf there for protection, nor bring 
 your prayers and sacrifices any longer thither, or to Gilgal, for you 
 <I>forsake your own mercies</I> if you observe those <I>lying 
 vanities.</I> But <I>seek the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:6,8"><I>v.</I> 6, 8</A>);

 enquire after him; enquire of him; seek to know his mind as your rule, 
 to secure his favour as your felicity." To press this exhortation we 
 are told to consider, 

 (1.) What we shall get by seeking God; it will be <I>our life;</I> we 
 shall find him, and shall be happy in him. So he tells them himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Seek you me, and you shall live.</I> Those that seek perishing gods 
 shall perish with them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 but those that seek the living God shall live with him: "You shall be 
 delivered from the killing judgments which you are threatened with; 
 your nation shall live, shall recover from its present languishings; 
 your souls shall live; you shall be sanctified and comforted, and made 
 for ever blessed. <I>You shall live.</I>"

 (2.) What a God he is whom we are to <I>seek,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 [1.] He is a God of almighty power himself. The idols were impotent 
 things, could do neither good nor evil, and therefore it was folly 
 either to fear or trust them; but the God of Israel does every thing, 
 and can do any thing, and therefore we ought to seek him; he challenges 
 our homage who has all power in his hand, and it is our interest to 
 have him on our side. Divers proofs and instances are here given of 
 God's power, as Creator, in the kingdom of nature, as both founding and 
 governing that kingdom. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+4:13"><I>ch.</I> iv. 13</A>.

 <I>First,</I> The stars are the work of his hands; those stars which
 the heathens worshipped 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 the <I>stars of your god,</I> those stars are God's creatures and 
 servants. He <I>makes the seven stars and Orion,</I> two very 
 remarkable constellations, which Amos, a herdsman, while he kept his 
 cattle by night, had particularly observed the motions of. He made them 
 at the first, he still makes them to be what they are to this earth and 
 either <I>binds</I> or <I>looses</I> the <I>sweet influences of 
 Peliades</I> and <I>Orion,</I> the two constellations here mentioned. 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:31,Job+9:9">Job xxxviii. 31; ix. 9</A>,

 to which passages Amos seems here to refer, putting them in mind of 
 those ancient discoveries of the glory of God before he was called the 
 <I>God of Israel. Secondly,</I> The constant succession of day and 
 night is under his direction, and is kept up by his power and 
 providence. It is he that <I>turns</I> the night (which is dark as 
 <I>the shadow of death</I>) <I>into the morning</I> by the rising of 
 the sun, and by the setting of the sun <I>makes the day dark with 
 night;</I> and the same power can, for humble penitents, easily turn 
 affliction and sorrow into prosperity and joy, but can as easily turn 
 the prosperity of presumptuous sinners into darkness, into utter 
 darkness. <I>Thirdly,</I> The rain rises and falls as he appoints. He 
 <I>calls for the waters of the sea;</I> out of them vapours are drawn 
 up by the heat of the sun, which gather into clouds, and are <I>poured 
 out upon the face of the earth,</I> to water it and make it fruitful.
 This was the mercy that had been <I>withholden from them</I> of late

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+4:7"><I>ch.</I> iv. 7</A>);

 and therefore to whom should they apply but to him who had power to 
 give it? For all the <I>vanities of the heathen</I> could not <I>give 
 rain,</I> nor could the <I>heavens</I> themselves <I>give showers</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:22">Jer. xiv. 22</A>.

 It is God that has <I>made these things; Jehovah is his name,</I> the
 name by which the God of nature, the God of the whole earth, has made 
 himself known to his people Israel and covenanted with them.

 [2.] As he is God of almighty power himself, so he <I>gives strength 
 and power unto his people</I> that seek him, and <I>renews strength</I> 
 to those that had lost it, if they <I>wait upon him</I> for it; for 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 he <I>strengthens the spoiled against the strong</I> to such a degree 
 that the spoiled come <I>against the fortress</I> and make bold and 
 brave attacks upon those that had spoiled them. This is an 
 encouragement to the people to <I>seek the Lord,</I> that, if they do 
 so, they shall find him above to retrieve their affairs, when they are 
 brought to the lowest ebb; though they are the spoiled, and their 
 enemies are the strong, if they can but engage God for them, they shall 
 soon recruit so as the next time to be not only the aggressors, but the 
 conquerors; they <I>come against the fortress,</I> to make reprisals 
 and become masters of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They are here exhorted to be honest and just in their dealings with 
 men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>,
 
 where observe, 

 (1.) The duty required: <I>Seek good, and not evil. Hate the evil, and 
 love the good, and establish judgment in the gate;</I> re-establish it 
 there, whence it has been banished, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Note, Things are not so bad but that they may be amended if the right 
 course be taken; we must not despair but that grievances may be 
 redressed and abuses rectified; justice may yet triumph where injustice 
 tyrannizes. In order to this, good must be loved and sought, evil must 
 be hated and no longer sought. We must love good principles and adhere
 to them, love to do good and abound in doing it, love good people, and 
 good converse, and good duties; and, whatever good we do, we must do it 
 from a principle of love, do it of choice and with delight. Those who 
 thus <I>love good</I> will <I>seek it,</I> will contrive to do all the 
 good they can, enquire for opportunities of doing it, and endeavor to 
 do it to the utmost of their power. They will also <I>hate evil,</I> 
 will abhor the thought of doing an unjust thing, and abstain from all 
 appearance of it. In vain do we pretend to seek God in our devotions if 
 we do not seek good in our whole conversations. 

 (2.) The reasons annexed.

 [1.] This is the sure way to be happy ourselves and to have the 
 continual presence of God with us: "<I>Seek good, and not evil, that 
 you may live,</I> may escape the punishment of the evil you have sought 
 and loved (<I>righteousness delivereth from death</I>), that you may 
 have the favour of God, which is your life, which is better than life 
 itself, that you may have comfort in yourselves and may live to some 
 good purpose. You shall live, for <I>so the Lord God of hosts shall be 
 with you</I> and be your life." Note, Those that keep in the way of 
 duty have the presence of God with them, as the <I>God of hosts,</I> a 
 God of almighty power. "He will be with you <I>as you have spoken,</I> 
 that is, as you have <I>gloried;</I> you shall have that really which, 
 while you went on in unrighteous ways, you only seemed to have and 
 boasted of as if you had." Those that truly repent and reform enter 
 into the enjoyment of that comfort which before they had only flattered 
 themselves with the imagination of. Or, "As you have prayed when <I>you 
 sought the Lord.</I> Live up to your prayers, and you shall have what 
 you pray for."

 [2.] This is the likeliest way to make the nation happy: "If you seek 
 and love that which is good, you may contribute to the saving of the 
 land from ruin." <I>It may be, the Lord God of hosts will be gracious 
 to the remnant of Joseph;</I> though there is but a remnant left, yet, 
 if God be gracious to that remnant, it will rise to a great nation 
 again; and if some among them turn from sin, especially if 
 <I>judgment</I> be <I>established in the gate,</I> though we cannot be 
 certain, yet there is a great probability that public affairs will take 
 a new and happy turn, and every thing will mend if men mend their 
 lives. Temporary promises are made with an <I>It may be;</I> and our 
 prayers must be made accordingly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A very terrible threatening of destruction approaching, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.
 
 Since they would not take the right course to obtain the favour of God, 
 God would take an effectual course to make them feel the weight of his 
 displeasure. The threatening is introduced with more than ordinary 
 solemnity, to strike an awe upon them; it is not the word of the 
 prophet only (if so, it might be made light of) but it is the <I>Lord 
 Jehovah,</I> who has an infinite eternal being; it is the <I>God of 
 hosts,</I> who has a boundless irresistible power, and it is 
 <I>Adonai--the Lord,</I> who has an absolute incontestable sovereignty, 
 and a universal dominion; it is he who says it, who can and will make 
 his words good, and he has said, 

 1. That the land of Israel shall be put in mourning, true mourning,
 that all places shall be filled with lamentation for the calamities 
 coming upon them. Look into the cities, and <I>wailing shall be in all 
 streets,</I> in the great streets, in the by-streets. Look into the 
 country, and <I>they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas!</I> we 
 are all undone! The lamentation shall be so great as not to be confined 
 within doors, nor kept within the bounds of decency, but it shall be 
 proclaimed in the streets and highways, and shall run wild. The 
 husbandman shall be called from the plough by the calamities of his 
 country to the natural expressions of mourning; and, because those who 
 will come short of the merits of the cause, such as are skilful of 
 lamentation shall be called to artificial mourning, to put accents upon 
 the lamentations of the real mourners with their <I>Ahone, ahone.</I> 
 Even in all vineyards, where there used to be nothing but mirth and 
 pleasure, there shall be general wailing, when a foreign force invades 
 the country, lays all waste, and there is no making any head against 
 it, no weapons left but prayers and tears. 

 2. That the land of Israel shall be brought to ruin, and the advances
 of that ruin are the occasion of all this wailing: <I>I will pass 
 through thee,</I> as the destroying angel passed through the land of 
 Egypt to destroy the first-born, but then passed over the houses of the 
 Israelites. God's judgments had often passed by them, but now they 
 shall pass through them, shall run them through.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A just and severe reproof to those who made light of these 
 threatenings, and impudently bade defiance to the justice of God and 
 his judgments, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Woe unto you that <I>desire the day of the Lord,</I> that really wish 
 for times of war and confusion, as some do who have restless spirits, 
 and long for changes, or who choose to <I>fish in troubled waters,</I> 
 hoping to raise their families, as some had done, upon the ruins of 
 their country; but the prophet tells them that this should be so great 
 a desolation that nobody could get by it. Or it is spoken to those
 who, in their wailings and lamentations for the calamities they were 
 in, wished they might die, and be delivered out of their misery, as Job 
 did, with passion. The prophet shows them the folly of this. Do they 
 know what death is to those who are unprepared for it, and how much 
 more terrible it will be than any thing that can befal them in this 
 life? Or, rather, it is spoken to those who speak jestingly of that day 
 of the Lord which the prophet spoke so seriously of; they desired it, 
 that is, they challenged it; they said, Let him do his worst; <I>let 
 him make speed,</I> and <I>hasten his work,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:19">Isa. v. 19</A>.

 <I>Where is the promise of his coming?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:4">2 Pet. iii. 4</A>.
 
 It intimates,

 1. That they do not believe it. They say that they wish it would come
 because they do not believe it will ever come; nor will they believe it 
 unless they see it. 

 2. That they do not fear it; though they may have some belief of it,
 yet they had so little consideration of it, and their mind is so intent 
 upon other things, that they are under no apprehension at all of peril 
 from it; instead of having the conscience to dread it, they have the 
 curiosity to desire it. In answer to this,

 (1.) He shows the folly of those who impudently wished for any of God's 
 judgments, and made a jest of any of the terrors of the Lord: "<I>To 
 what end is it for you</I> that the day of the Lord should come? You 
 will find it both certain and sad; not a thing to be bantered, for it 
 is neither a thing to be questioned whether it will come or no nor a 
 thing to be turned off with a slight when it does come. <I>The day of 
 the Lord is darkness, and not light,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.
 
 <I>Shall it not be so?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 
 Do not your own consciences tell you that it will be so, that it will 
 be <I>very dark,</I> and <I>no brightness in it?</I>" Note, The <I>day 
 of the Lord</I> will be a dark, dismal, gloomy day to all impenitent 
 sinners; the <I>day of judgment</I> will be so; and sometimes the day 
 of their present trouble. And, when God makes a day dark, all the world 
 cannot make it light. 

 (2.) He shows the folly of those who impatiently wished for a change of 
 God's judgment, in hopes that the next would be better and more 
 tolerable. They desire <I>the day of the Lord,</I> in hopes to better 
 themselves (though their hearts and lives be not amended), or, at 
 least, to know the worst. But the prophet tells them that they know not 
 what they ask,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 It is <I>as if a man did flee from a lion and a bear met him,</I> a 
 beast of prey more cruel and ravenous than a lion, or as if a man, to 
 escape all dangers abroad, <I>went into the house for security,</I> and 
 <I>leaned his hand on the wall</I> to rest himself, and there a 
 <I>serpent bit him.</I> Note, Those who are not reformed by the 
 judgments of God will be pursued by them; and, if they escape one, 
 another stands ready to seize them; <I>fear and the pit and snare</I> 
 surround them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:17,18">Isa. xxiv. 17, 18</A>.

 It is madness therefore to <I>defy the day of the Lord.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21 I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The scope of these verses is to show how little God valued their shows 
 of devotion, nay, how much he detested them, while they went on in 
 their sins. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How unpleasing, nay, how displeasing, their hypocritical services 
 were to God. They had their <I>feast-days</I> at Bethel, in imitation 
 of those at Jerusalem, in which they pretended to rejoice before God. 
 They had their <I>solemn assemblies</I> for religious worship, in which 
 they put on the gravity of those who <I>come before God as his people 
 come, and sit before him as his people sit.</I> They offered to God 
 <I>burnt-offerings,</I> to the honour of God, together with the 
 <I>meat-offerings</I> which by the law were to be offered with them; 
 they offered the <I>peace-offerings,</I> to implore the favour of God, 
 and they offered them of the <I>fat beasts</I> that they had, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.

 In imitation likewise of the temple-music, they had the <I>noise of 
 their songs</I> and the <I>melody of their viols</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 vocal and instrumental music, with which they praised God. With these 
 services they hoped to make God amends for the sins they had committed, 
 and to obtain leave to go on in sin; and therefore they were so far 
 from being acceptable to God that they were abominable. He 
 <I>hated,</I> he <I>despised,</I> their <I>feast-days,</I> not only 
 despised them as no valuable services done to him, but hated them as an 
 affront and provocation to him, as we hate to see men dissemble with 
 us, pretend a respect for us when really they have none. Nothing more 
 hateful, more despicable, than hypocrisy. <I>He that blesseth his 
 friend with a loud voice, it shall be counted a curse,</I> when it 
 appears that his heart is not with him. God will not <I>smell</I> in 
 <I>their solemn assemblies,</I> for there is nothing in them that is 
 grateful to him, but a great deal that is offensive. Their sacrifices 
 are not to him <I>of a sweet smelling savour,</I> as Noah's was, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:21">Gen. viii. 21</A>.

 He will not accept them; he will not regard them, will not take any
 notice of them; he will not hear the melody of their viols; for, when 
 sin is a jar in the harmony, it grates in his ears: "<I>Take it 
 away,</I>" says God, "I cannot bear it." Now this intimates,

 1. That sacrifice itself is of small account with God in comparison
 with moral duties; to love God and our neighbour is <I>better than all 
 burnt offering and sacrifice.</I> 

 2. That the sacrifice of the wicked is really an abomination to him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+15:8">Prov. xv. 8</A>.

 Dissembled piety is double iniquity, and so it will be found when, if 
 any place in hell be hotter than another, that will be the hypocrite's 
 portion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What it was that he required in order to the acceptableness of 
 their sacrifices and without which no sacrifice would be acceptable 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>Let judgment run down as waters,</I> among you, <I>and righteousness 
 as a mighty stream,</I> that is 

 1. "Let there be a general reformation of manners among you; let
 religion (God's <I>judgment</I>) and <I>righteousness</I> have their 
 due influence upon you; let your land be watered with it, and let it 
 bear down all the opposition of vice and profaneness; let it run wide 
 as overflowing waters, and yet run strong as might stream."

 (2.) "In particular, let justice be duly administered by magistrates 
 and rulers; let not the current of it be stopped by partiality and 
 bribery, but let it come freely as waters do, in the natural course; 
 let it be pure as running waters, not muddied with corruption or 
 whatever may pervert justice; let it run <I>like a might stream,</I> 
 and not suffer itself to be obstructed, or its course retarded, by the 
 fear of man; let all have free access to it as a common stream, and 
 have benefit by it as <I>trees planted by the rivers of waters.</I>" 
 The great thing laid to Israel's charge was <I>turning judgment into 
 wormwood</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 in that matter therefore they must reform, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+7:9">Zech. vii. 9</A>.

 This was what God desired <I>more than sacrifices,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:6,1Sa+15:22">Hos. vi. 6; 1 Sam. xv. 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What little stress God had laid upon the law of sacrifices, though 
 it was his own law, in comparison with the moral precepts 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):
 
 "<I>Did you offer unto me sacrifices in the wilderness forty years?</I> 
 No, you did not." For the greatest part of that time sacrifice was very 
 much neglected, because of the unsettledness of their state; after the 
 second year, the passover was not kept till they came into Canaan, and 
 other institutions were in like manner intermitted; and yet, because 
 God will have mercy and not sacrifice, he never imputed the omission to 
 them as their fault, but continued his care of them and kindness to 
 them: it was not that, but their murmuring and unbelief, for which God 
 was displeased with them. He that so owned his people, though they did 
 not sacrifice, when in other things they kept close to him, will 
 certainly disown them, though they do sacrifice, if in other things 
 they depart from him. But, though ritual sacrifices may thus be 
 dispensed with, spiritual sacrifices will not; even justice and honesty 
 will not excuse for the want of prayer and praise, a broken heart and 
 the love of God. Stephen quotes this passage 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:42">Acts vii. 42</A>),

 to show the Jews that they ought not to think it strange that
 ceremonial law was repealed when from the beginning it was 
 comparatively made light of. Compare
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:22,23">Jer. vii. 22, 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. What little reason they had to expect that their sacrifices should
 be acceptable to God, when they and their fathers had been all along
 addicted to the worship of other gods. So some take 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>,

 "<I>Did you offer to me sacrifices,</I> that is, to me only? No, and 
 therefore not at all to me acceptably;" for the law of worshipping the 
 Lord our God is, <I>Him only we must serve.</I> "<I>But you have borne 
 the tabernacle of your Moloch</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 little shrines that you made to carry about with you, pocket-idols for 
 your private superstition, when you durst not be seen to do it 
 publicly. You have had the images of your <I>Moloch--your king</I>" 
 (probably representing <I>the sun,</I> that sits king among the 
 heavenly bodies), "and <I>Chiun,</I> or <I>Remphan</I>" (as Stephen 
 calls it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:43">Acts vii. 43</A>,

 after the LXX.), which it is supposed, represented Saturn, the highest
 of the seven planets. The worship of the sun, moon, and stars, was the 
 most ancient, most general, and most plausible idolatry. They <I>made
 to themselves</I> the <I>star of their God,</I> some particular star 
 which they took to be their god, or the name of which they gave to 
 their god. This idolatry Israel was from the beginning prone to

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:19">Deut. iv. 19</A>);

 and those that retain an affection for false gods cannot expect the
 favour of the true God.</P>

 V. What punishment God would inflict upon them for their persisting in
 idolatry 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>I will cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus.</I> They were 
 led captive by Satan into idolatry, and therefore God caused them to go 
 into captivity among idolaters, and hurried them into a strange land, 
 since they were so fond of strange gods. They were carried <I>beyond 
 Damascus.</I> Their captivity by the Assyrians was far beyond that by 
 the Syrians; for, if less judgments do not work that for which they 
 were sent, God will send greater. Or the captivity of Israel under 
 Shalmaneser was far beyond that of Damascus under Tiglath-pileser, and 
 much more grievous and destructive, which was foretold

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+1:5"><I>ch.</I> i. 5</A>.

 For, as the sins of God's professing people are greater than the sins
 of others, so it may be expected that their punishments will be 
 proportionable. We find the spoil of Damascus and that of Samaria 
 carried off together by the king of Assyria, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:4">Isa. viii. 4</A>.

 Stephen reads it, <I>I will carry you away beyond Babylon</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:43">Acts vii. 43</A>),

 further than Judah shall be carried, so far further as not to return.
 And, to make this sentence appear both the more certain and the more 
 dreadful, he that passes it calls himself <I>the Lord, whose name is, 
 The God of hosts,</I> and who is therefore able to execute the 
 sentence, having hosts at command.</P>
