 In the close of the foregoing chapter we had a general prediction of 
 the utter ruin of Jerusalem, that it should be forsaken and forgotten, 
 which, whatever effect it had upon others, we have reason to think made 
 the prophet himself very melancholy. Now, in this chapter, God
 encourages him, by showing him that, though the desolation seemed to be 
 universal, yet all were not equally involved in it, but God knew how to 
 distinguish, how to separate, between the precious and the vile. Some 
 had gone into captivity already with Jeconiah; over them Jeremiah 
 lamented, but God tells him that it should turn to their good. Others 
 yet remained hardened in their sins, against whom Jeremiah had a just 
 indignation; but those, God tells him, should go into captivity, and it 
 should prove to their hurt. To inform the prophet of this, and affect 
 him with it, here is, 

 I. A vision of two baskets of figs, one very good and the other very
 bad, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+24:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. The explication of this vision, applying the good figs to those
 that were already sent into captivity for their good 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+24:4-7">ver. 4-7</A>),

 the bad figs to those that should hereafter be sent into captivity for
 their hurt,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs <I>were</I>
 set before the temple of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, after that Nebuchadrezzar king
 of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim
 king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and
 smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.
 &nbsp; 2  One basket <I>had</I> very good figs, <I>even</I> like the figs <I>that
 are</I> first ripe: and the other basket <I>had</I> very naughty figs,
 which could not be eaten, they were so bad.
 &nbsp; 3  Then said the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I
 said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil,
 that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.
 &nbsp; 4  Again the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 5  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the God of Israel; Like these good figs,
 so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of
 Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the
 Chaldeans for <I>their</I> good.
 &nbsp; 6  For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring
 them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull
 <I>them</I> down; and I will plant them, and not pluck <I>them</I> up.
 &nbsp; 7  And I will give them a heart to know me, that I <I>am</I> the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for
 they shall return unto me with their whole heart.
 &nbsp; 8  And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so
 evil; surely thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, So will I give Zedekiah the
 king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem,
 that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of
 Egypt:
 &nbsp; 9  And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms
 of the earth for <I>their</I> hurt, <I>to be</I> a reproach and a proverb,
 a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them.
 &nbsp; 10  And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence,
 among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave
 unto them and to their fathers.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This short chapter helps us to put a very comfortable construction upon 
 a great many long ones, by showing us that the same providence which to 
 some is a <I>savour of death unto death</I> may by the grace and 
 blessing of God be made to others a <I>savour of life unto life;</I> 
 and that, though God's people share with others in the same calamity, 
 yet it is not the same to them that it is to others, but is designed 
 for their good and shall issue in their good; to them it is a 
 correcting rod in the hand of a tender Father, while to others it is an 
 avenging sword in the hand of a righteous Judge. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The date of this sermon. It was after, a little after, Jeconiah's 
 captivity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+24:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Jeconiah was himself a <I>despised broken vessel,</I> but with him were 
 carried away some very valuable persons, Ezekiel for one 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:12">Ezek. i. 12</A>);

 many of the <I>princes of Judah</I> then went into captivity, Daniel
 and his fellows were carried off a little before; of the people only 
 <I>the carpenters and the smiths</I> were forced away, either because 
 the Chaldeans needed some ingenious men of those trades (they had a 
 great plenty of astrologers and stargazers, but a great scarcity of 
 smiths and carpenters) or because the Jews would severely feel the loss 
 of them, and would, for want of them, be unable to fortify their cities 
 and furnish themselves with weapons of war. Now, it should seem, there
 were many good people carried away in that captivity, which the pious 
 prophet laid much to heart, while there were those that triumphed in 
 it, and insulted over those to whose lot it fell to go into captivity. 
 Note, We must not conclude concerning the first and greatest sufferers 
 that they were the worst and greatest sinners; for perhaps it may 
 appear quite otherwise, as it did here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The vision by which this distinction of the captives was 
 represented to the prophet's mind. He saw <I>two baskets of figs, set 
 before the temple,</I> there ready to be offered as first-fruits to the 
 honour of God. Perhaps the priests, being remiss in their duty, were 
 not ready to receive them and dispose of them according to the law, and 
 therefore Jeremiah sees them standing <I>before the temple.</I> But 
 that which was the significancy of the vision was that the figs in one 
 basket were extraordinarily good, those in the other basket extremely 
 bad. The children of men are all as the fruits of the fig-tree, capable 
 of being made serviceable to God and man 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:11">Judg. ix. 11</A>);

 but some are as good figs, than which nothing is more pleasant, others
 as damaged rotten figs, than which nothing is more nauseous. What 
 creature viler than a wicked man, and what more valuable than a godly 
 man! The good figs were like those that are first ripe, which are most 
 acceptable

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:1">Mic. vii. 1</A>)

 and most prized when newly come into season. The bad figs are such as
 could <I>not be eaten, they were so evil;</I> they could not answer the 
 end of their creation, were neither pleasant nor good for food; and 
 what then were they good for? If God has no honour from men, nor their 
 generation any service, they are even like the bad figs, that cannot be 
 eaten, that will not answer any good purpose. <I>If the salt have lost 
 its savour, it is thenceforth</I> fit for nothing but <I>the 
 dunghill.</I> Of the persons that are presented to the Lord at the door 
 of his tabernacle, some are sincere, and they are very good; others 
 dissemble with God, and they are very bad. Sinners are the worst of 
 men, hypocrites the worst of sinners. <I>Corruptio optimi est 
 pessima--That which is best becomes, when corrupted, the worst.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The exposition and application of this vision. God intended by it 
 to raise the dejected spirit of those that had gone into captivity, by 
 assuring them of a happy return, and to humble and awaken the proud and 
 secure spirits of those who continued yet in Jerusalem, by assuring 
 them of a miserable captivity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here is the moral of the good figs, that were very good, the first 
 ripe. These represented the pious captives, that seemed first ripe for 
 ruin, for they went first into captivity, but should prove first ripe 
 for mercy, and their captivity should help to ripen them; these are 
 pleasing to God, as good figs are to us, and shall be carefully 
 preserved for use. Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Those that were already carried into captivity were the good figs 
 that God would own. This shows, 

 [1.] That we cannot determine of God's love or hatred <I>by all that is 
 before us.</I> When God's judgments are abroad those are not always the 
 worst that are first seized by them.

 [2.] That early suffering sometimes proves for the best to us. The
 sooner the child is corrected the better effect the correction is 
 likely to have. Those that went first into captivity were as the son 
 whom the <I>father loves, and chastens betimes,</I> chastens while 
 there is hope; and it did well. But those that staid behind were like a 
 child long <I>left to himself,</I> who, when afterwards corrected, is 
 stubborn, and made worse by it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:37">Lam. iii. 27</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) God owns their captivity to be his doing. Whoever were the
 instruments of it, he ordered and directed it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+24:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>I have sent them out of this place into the land of the 
 Chaldeans.</I> It is God that puts his gold into the furnace, to be 
 tried; his hand is, in a special manner, to be eyed in the afflictions 
 of good people. The judge orders the malefactor into the hand of an 
 executioner, but the father corrects the child with his own hand.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Even this disgraceful uncomfortable captivity God intended for 
 their benefit; and we are sure that his intentions are never 
 frustrated: <I>I have sent them into the land of the Chaldeans for 
 their good.</I> It seemed to be every way for their hurt, not only as 
 it was the ruin of their estates, honours, and liberties, separated 
 them from their relations and friends, and put them under the power of 
 their enemies and oppressors, but as it sunk their spirits, discouraged 
 their faith, deprived them of the benefit of God's oracles and 
 ordinances, and exposed them to temptations; and yet it was designed 
 for their good, and proved so, in the issue, as to many of them. <I>Out 
 of the eater came forth meat.</I> By their afflictions they were 
 convinced of sin, humbled under the hand of God, weaned from the world, 
 made serious, taught to pray, and turned from their iniquity; 
 particularly they were cured of their inclination to idolatry; and thus 
 it was <I>good for them that they were afflicted,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:67,71">Ps. cxix. 67, 71</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) God promises them that he will own them in their captivity. Though
 they seem abandoned, they shall be acknowledged; the scornful relations 
 they left behind will scarcely own them, or their kindred to them, but 
 God says, <I>I will acknowledge them.</I> Note, <I>The Lord knows those 
 that are his,</I> and will own them in all conditions; nakedness and 
 sword shall not separate them from his love.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) God assures them of his protection in their trouble, and a 
 glorious deliverance out of it in due time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+24:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Being sent into captivity <I>for their good,</I> they shall not be lost 
 there; but it shall be with them as it is with gold which the refiner 
 puts into the furnace.

 [1.] He has his eye upon it while it is there, and it is a careful eye, 
 to see that it sustain no damage: "<I>I will set my eyes upon them for 
 good,</I> to order every thing for the best, that all the circumstances 
 of the affliction may concur to the answering of the great intention of 
 it."

 [2.] He will be sure to take it out of the furnace again as soon as the 
 work designed upon it is done: <I>I will bring them again to this 
 land.</I> They were sent abroad for improvement awhile, under a severe 
 discipline; but they shall be fetched back, when they have gone through 
 their trial there, to their Father's house.

 [3.] He will fashion his gold when he has refined it, will make it a 
 vessel of honour fit for his use; so, when God has brought them back 
 from their trial, he <I>will build them</I> and make them a habitation 
 for himself, will <I>plant them</I> and make them a vineyard for 
 himself. Their captivity was to square the rough stones and make them 
 fit for his building, to prune up the young trees and make them fit for 
 his planting.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) He engages to prepare them for these temporal mercies which he
 designed for them by bestowing spiritual mercies upon them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+24:7"><I>v.</I>7</A>.

 It is this that will make their captivity be for their good; this shall 
 be both the improvement of their affliction and their qualification for 
 deliverance. When our troubles are sanctified to us, then we may be 
 sure that they will end well. Now that which is promised is,

 [1.] That they should be better acquainted with God; they should learn 
 more of God by his providences in Babylon than they had learned by all 
 his oracles and ordinances in Jerusalem, thanks to divine grace, for, 
 if that had not wrought mightily upon them in Babylon, they would for 
 ever have forgotten God. It is here promised, <I>I will give them,</I> 
 not so much a head to know me, but <I>a heart to know me,</I> for the 
 right knowledge of God consists not in notion and speculation, but in 
 the convictions of the practical judgment directing and governing the 
 will and affections. <I>A good understanding have all those that do his 
 commandments,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+111:10">Ps. cxi. 10</A>.

 Where God gives a sincere desire and inclination to know him he will
 give that knowledge. It is God himself that gives a heart to know him, 
 else we should perish for ever in our ignorance.

 [2.] That they should be entirely converted to God, to his will as 
 their rule, his service as their business, and his glory as their end: 
 <I>They shall return to me with their whole heart.</I> God himself 
 undertakes for them that they shall; and, if he turn us, we shall be 
 turned. This follows upon the former; for those that have a heart to 
 know God aright will not only turn to him, but turn with their whole 
 heart; for those that are either obstinate in their rebellion, or 
 hypocritical in their religion, may truly be said to be ignorant of 
 God.

 [3.] That thus they should be again taken into covenant with God, as 
 much to their comfort as ever: <I>They shall be my people, and I will 
 be their God.</I> God will own them, as formerly, for his people, in 
 the discoveries of himself to them, in his acceptance of their 
 services, and in his gracious appearances on their behalf; and they 
 shall have liberty to own him for their God in their prayers to him and 
 their expectations from him. Note, Those that have backslidden from 
 God, if they do in sincerity return to him, are admitted as freely as 
 any to all the privileges and comforts of the everlasting covenant, 
 which is herein well-ordered, that every transgression in the covenant 
 does not throw us out of covenant, and that afflictions are not only 
 consistent with, but flowing from, covenant-love.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here is the moral of the bad figs. <I>Zedekiah and his princes</I> 
 and partizans <I>yet remain in the land,</I> proud and secure enough, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:3">Ezek. xi. 3</A>.

 Many had fled into Egypt for shelter, and they thought they had shifted
 well for themselves and their own safety, and boasted that though 
 therein they had gone contrary to the command of God yet they had acted 
 prudently for themselves. Now as to both these, that looked so 
 scornfully upon those that had gone into captivity, it is here 
 threatened,

 (1.) That, whereas those who were already carried away were settled in 
 one country, where they had the comfort of one another's society, 
 though in captivity, these should be dispersed <I>and removed into all 
 the kingdoms of the earth,</I> where they should have no joy one of 
 another. 

 (2.) That, whereas those were carried captives for their good, these 
 should be removed into all countries <I>for their hurt.</I> Their 
 afflictions should be so far from humbling them that they should harden 
 them, not bring them nearer to God, but set them at a greater distance 
 from him. 

 (3.) That, whereas those should have the honour of being owned of God
 in their troubles, these should have the shame of being abandoned by
 all mankind: <I>In all places whither I shall drive them they shall be
 a reproach and a proverb.</I> "Such a one is as false and proud as a
 Jew"--"Such a one is as poor and miserable as a Jew." All their
 neighbours shall make a jest of them, and of the calamities brought 
 upon them. 

 (4.) That, whereas those should <I>return to their own land,</I> never 
 to see it more, and it shall be of no avail to them to plead that it 
 was the land God gave to their fathers, for they had it from God, and 
 he gave it to them upon condition of their obedience.

 (5.) That, whereas those were reserved for better times, these were 
 reserved for worse; wherever they are removed <I>the sword, and famine, 
 and pestilence,</I> shall be sent after them, shall soon overtake them, 
 and, coming with commission so to do, shall overcome them. God has 
 variety of judgments wherewith to prosecute those that fly from 
 justice; and those that have escaped one may expect another, till they 
 are brought to repent and reform.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Doubtless this prophecy had its accomplishment in the men of that 
 generation yet, because we read not of any such remarkable difference 
 between those of Jeconiah's captivity and those of Zedekiah's, it is
 probable that this has a typical reference to the last destruction of 
 the Jews by the Romans, in which those of them that believed were taken 
 care of, but those that continued obstinate in unbelief were driven 
 into all countries for <I>a taunt and a curse,</I> and so they remain 
 to this day.</P>
