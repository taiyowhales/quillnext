 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 After the threatenings of wrath in the foregoing chapter we have here, 
 
 I. Thankful praises for what God had done, which the prophet, in the
 name of the church, offers up to God, and teaches us to offer the like, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. Precious promises of what God would yet further do for his church,
 especially in the grace of the gospel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:6-8">ver. 6-8</A>.

 III. The church's triumph in God over her enemies thereupon,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:9-12">ver. 9-12</A>.

 This chapter looks as pleasantly upon the church as the former looked
 dreadfully upon the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, thou <I>art</I> my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise
 thy name; for thou hast done wonderful <I>things; thy</I> counsels of
 old <I>are</I> faithfulness <I>and</I> truth.
 &nbsp; 2  For thou hast made of a city a heap; <I>of</I> a defenced city a
 ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be
 built.
 &nbsp; 3  Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of
 the terrible nations shall fear thee.
 &nbsp; 4  For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the
 needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the
 heat, when the blast of the terrible ones <I>is</I> as a storm
 <I>against</I> the wall.
 &nbsp; 5  Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in
 a dry place; <I>even</I> the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the
 branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is said in the close of the foregoing chapter that the <I>Lord of 
 hosts shall reign gloriously;</I> now, in compliance with this, the 
 prophet here speaks of <I>the glorious majesty of his kingdom</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:12">Ps. cxlv. 12</A>),

 and gives him the glory of it; and, however this prophecy might have an
 accomplishment in the destruction of Babylon and the deliverance of the 
 Jews out of their captivity there, it seems to look further, to the 
 praises that should be offered up to God by the gospel church for 
 Christ's victories over our spiritual enemies and the comforts he has 
 provided for all believers. Here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The prophet determines to praise God himself; for those that would 
 stir up others should in the first place stir up themselves to praise 
 God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 "<I>O Lord! thou art my God,</I> a God in covenant with me." When God
 is punishing <I>the kings of the earth upon the earth,</I> and making 
 them to tremble before him, a poor prophet can go to him, and, with a 
 humble boldness, say, <I>O Lord! thou art my God,</I> and therefore 
 <I>I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name.</I> Those that have the 
 Lord for their God are bound to praise him; for <I>therefore</I> he 
 took us to be his people <I>that we might be unto him for a name and 
 for a praise,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:11">Jer. xiii. 11</A>.

 In praising God we exalt him; not that we can make him higher than he
 is, but we must make him to appear to ourselves and others than he 
 does. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:2">Exod. xv. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He pleases himself with the thought that others also shall be 
 brought to praise God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 "<I>Therefore,</I> because of the <I>desolations thou hast made in the
 earth</I> by thy providence

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:8">Ps. xlvi. 8</A>)

 and the just vengeance thou hast taken on thy and thy church's enemies,
 <I>therefore shall the strong people glorify thee</I> in concert, 
 <I>and the city</I> (the metropolis) <I>of the terrible nations fear 
 thee.</I>" This may be understood, 

 1. Of those people that have been strong and terrible against God.
 Those that have been enemies to God's kingdom, and have fought against 
 the interests of it with a great deal of strength and terror, shall 
 either be converted, and glorify God by joining with his people in his 
 service, or at least convinced, so as to own themselves conquered. 
 Those that have been the terror of the mighty shall be forced to 
 tremble before the judgments of God and call in vain to rocks and 
 mountains to hide them. Or, 

 2. Of those that shall be now made strong and terrible for God and by
 him, though before they were weak and trampled upon. God shall so 
 visibly appear for and with those that fear him and glorify him that 
 all shall acknowledge them a strong people and shall stand in awe of 
 them. There was a time when <I>many of the people of the land became 
 Jews, for the fear of the Jews fell upon them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+8:17">Esther viii. 17</A>),

 and when those that knew their God were strong and did exploits

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:32">Dan. xi. 32</A>),

 for which they glorified God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He observes what is, and ought to be, the matter of this praise. 
 We and others must exalt God and praise him; for, 

 1. He has done wonders, according to the counsel of his own will,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 We exalt God by admiring what he has done as truly wonderful, wonderful
 proofs of his power beyond what any creature could perform, and 
 wonderful proofs of his goodness beyond what such sinful creatures as 
 we are could expect. These <I>wonderful things,</I> which are new and 
 surprising to us, and altogether unthought of, are according to his 
 <I>counsels of old,</I> devised by his wisdom and designed for his own 
 glory and the comfort of his people. All the operations of providence 
 are according to God's eternal counsels (and those faithfulness and 
 truth itself), all consonant to his attributes, consistent with one 
 another, and sure to be accomplished in their season. 

 2. He has in particular humbled the pride, and broken the power, of the
 mighty ones of the earth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):
 
 "<I>Thou hast made of a city,</I> of many a city, <I>a heap</I> of
 rubbish. Of many a defenced city, that thought itself well guarded by 
 nature and art, and the multitude and courage of its militia, thou hast 
 made a ruin." What created strength can hold out against Omnipotence? 
 "Many a city so richly built that it might be called a <I>palace,</I> 
 and so much frequented and visited by persons of the best rank from all 
 parts that it might be called a <I>palace of strangers,</I> thou hast 
 made to be no city; it is levelled with the ground, and not one stone 
 left upon another, and it shall never be built again." This has been 
 the case of many cities in divers parts of the world, and in our own 
 nation particularly; cities that flourished once have gone to decay and 
 are lost, and it is scarcely known (except by urns or coins digged up 
 out of the earth) where they stood. How many of the cities of Israel 
 have long since been heaps and ruins! God hereby teaches us that 
 <I>here we have no continuing city</I> and must therefore seek one to 
 come which will never be a ruin or go to decay. 

 3. He has seasonably relieved and succoured his necessitous and
 distressed people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):
 
 <I>Thou has been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy.</I>
 As God weakens the strong that are proud and secure, so he strengthens 
 the weak that are humble and serious, and stay themselves upon him. 
 Nay, he not only makes them strong, but he is himself their strength; 
 for in him they strengthen themselves, and it is his favour that is the 
 <I>strength of their hearts.</I> He is a <I>strength to the needy in 
 his distress,</I> when he needs strength, and when his distress drives 
 him to God. And, as he strengthens them against their inward decays, so 
 he shelters them from outward assaults. He is <I>a refuge from the 
 storm</I> of rain or hail, and <I>a shadow from the</I> scorching 
 <I>heat</I> of the sun in summer. God is a sufficient protection to his 
 people in all weathers, hot and cold, wet and dry. The armour of 
 righteousness serves both <I>on the right hand</I> and <I>on the 
 left,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:7">2 Cor. vi. 7</A>.

 Whatever dangers or troubles God's people may be in, effectual care is
 taken that they shall sustain no real hurt or damage. When perils are 
 most threatening and alarming God will then appear for the safety of 
 his people: <I>When the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm 
 against the wall,</I> which makes a great noise, but cannot overthrow 
 the wall. The enemies of God's poor are terrible ones; they do all they 
 can to make themselves so to them. Their rage is like a blast of wind, 
 loud, and blustering, and furious; but, like the wind, it is under a 
 divine check; for God <I>holds the winds in his fist,</I> and God will 
 be such a shelter to his people that they shall be able to stand the 
 shock, keep their ground, and maintain their integrity and peace. A 
 storm beating on a ship tosses it, but that which beats on a wall never 
 stirs it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:10,138:7">Ps. lxxvi. 10; cxxxviii. 7</A>.

 4. That he does and will shelter those that trust in him from the
 insolence of their proud oppressors

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Thou shalt,</I> or thou dost, <I>bring down the noise of
 strangers;</I> thou shalt abate and still it, as <I>the heat in a dry 
 place</I> is abated and moderated <I>by the shadow of a cloud</I> 
 interposing. <I>The branch,</I> or rather the son or triumph, <I>of the 
 terrible ones shall be brought low,</I> and they shall be made to 
 change their note and lower their voice. Observe here,

 (1.) The oppressors of God's people are called <I>strangers;</I> for
 they forget that those they oppress are made of the same mould, of the 
 same blood, with them. They are called <I>terrible ones;</I> for so 
 they affect to be, rather than amiable ones: they would rather be 
 feared than loved.

 (2.) Their insolence towards the people of God is noisy and hot, and
 that is all; it is but the noise of strangers, who think to carry their 
 point by hectoring and bullying all that stand in their way, and 
 talking big. <I>Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:17">Jer. xlvi. 17</A>.
 
 It is like the heat of the sun scorching in the middle of the day; but
 where is it when the sun has set? 

 (3.) Their noise, and heat, and all their triumph, will be humbled and
 brought low, when their hopes are baffled and all their honours laid in 
 the dust. The branches, even the top branches, of the terrible ones, 
 will be broken off, and thrown to the dunghill.

 (4.) If the labourers in God's vineyard be at any time called to
 <I>bear the burden and heat of the day,</I> he will find some way or 
 other to refresh them, as with the shadow of a cloud, that they may not 
 be pressed above measure.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  And in this mountain shall the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts make unto all
 people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of
 fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.
 &nbsp; 7  And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering
 cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all
 nations.
 &nbsp; 8  He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> will
 wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people
 shall he take away from off all the earth: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath
 spoken <I>it.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 If we suppose (as many do) that this refers to the great joy which 
 there should be in Zion and Jerusalem when the army of the Assyrians 
 was routed by an angel, or when the Jews were released out of their 
 captivity in Babylon, or upon occasion of some other equally surprising 
 deliverance, yet we cannot avoid making it to look further, to the 
 grace of the gospel and the glory which is the crown and consummation 
 of that grace; for it is at our resurrection through Christ that the 
 saying here written <I>shall be brought to pass;</I> then, and not till 
 then (if we may believe St. Paul), it shall have its full 
 accomplishment: <I>Death is swallowed up in victory,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:54">1 Cor. xv. 54</A>.
 
 This is a key to the rest of the promises here connected together. And
 so we have here a prophecy of the salvation and the grace brought unto 
 us by Jesus Christ, into which <I>the prophets enquired and searched 
 diligently,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:10">1 Pet. i. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That the grace of the gospel should be a royal feast for all people; 
 not like that of Ahasuerus, which was intended only to show the 
 grandeur of the master of the feast 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:4">Esther i. 4</A>);

 for this is intended to gratify the guests, and therefore, whereas all
 <I>there</I> was for show, all <I>here</I> is for substance. The 
 preparations made in the gospel for the kind reception of penitents and 
 supplicants with God are often in the New Testament set forth by the 
 similitude of <I>a feast,</I> as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:1">Matt. xxii. 1</A>,

 &c., which seems to be borrowed from this prophecy.

 1. God himself is the Master of the feast, and we may be sure he 
 prepares like himself, as becomes him to give, rather than as becomes 
 us to receive. <I>The Lord of hosts</I> makes this feast. 

 2. The guests invited are <I>all people,</I> Gentiles as well as Jews.
 <I>Go preach the gospel to every creature.</I> There is enough for all, 
 and whoever will may come, and partake freely, even those that are 
 gathered out of the highways and the hedges. 

 3. The place is <I>Mount Zion.</I> Thence the preaching of the gospel
 takes rise: the preachers must begin at Jerusalem. The gospel church is 
 the Jerusalem that is above; there this feast is made, and to it all 
 the invited guests must go. 

 4. The provision is very rich, and every thing is of the best. It is a
 <I>feast,</I> which supposes abundance and variety; it is a continual 
 feast to believers, it is their own fault if it be not. It is <I>a 
 feast of fat things and full of marrow;</I> so relishing, so 
 nourishing, are the comforts of the gospel to all those that feast upon 
 them and digest them. The returning prodigal was entertained with the 
 fatted calf; and David has that pleasure in communion with God with 
 which his soul is satisfied as with marrow and fatness. It is a feast
 <I>of wines on the lees,</I> the strongest-bodied wines, that have been 
 kept long upon the lees, and then are well refined from them, so that 
 they are clear and fine. There is that in the gospel which, like wine 
 soberly used, makes glad the heart and raises the spirits, and is fit 
 for those that are of a heavy heart, being under convictions of sin and 
 mourning for it, that they may drink and forget their misery (for that 
 is the proper use of wine--it is a cordial for those that need it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:5,6">Prov. xxxi. 5, 6</A>),

 may be of good cheer, knowing that their sins are forgiven, and may be
 vigorous in their spiritual work and warfare, as a strong man refreshed 
 with wine.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That the world should be freed from that darkness of ignorance and 
 mistake in the mists of which it had been so long lost and buried 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>He will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering</I> (the
 covering of the face) with which all people are covered (hood-winked or 
 blind-folded) so that they cannot see their way nor go about their 
 work, and by reason of which they wander endlessly. Their faces are
 covered as those of men condemned, or dead men. There is <I>a veil 
 spread over all nations,</I> for they all sit in darkness; and no 
 marvel, when the Jews themselves, among whom <I>God was known,</I> had 
 a <I>veil upon their hearts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:15">2 Cor. iii. 15</A>.

 But this veil the Lord will destroy, by the light of his gospel shining
 in the world, and the power of his Spirit opening men's eyes to receive 
 it. He will raise those to spiritual life that have long been dead in 
 trespasses and sins.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That death should be conquered, the power of it broken, and the 
 property of it altered: <I>He will swallow up death in victory,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 1. Christ will himself, in his resurrection, triumph over death, will 
 break its bands, its bars, asunder, and cast away all its cords. The
 grave seemed to swallow him up, but really he swallowed it up. 

 2. The happiness of the saints shall be out of the reach of death,
 which puts a period to all the enjoyments of this world, embitters 
 them, and stains the beauty of them. 

 3. Believers may triumph over death, and look upon it as a conquered
 enemy: <I>O death! where is thy sting?</I> 

 4. When the dead bodies of the saints shall be raised at the great day,
 and their mortality swallowed up of life, then death will be for ever 
 swallowed up of victory; and it is the last enemy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That grief shall be banished, and there shall be perfect and 
 endless joy: <I>The Lord God will wipe away tears from off all 
 faces.</I> Those that mourn for sin shall be comforted and have their 
 consciences pacified. In the covenant of grace there shall be that 
 provided which is sufficient to counterbalance all the sorrows of this 
 present time, to wipe away our tears, and to refresh us. Those 
 particularly that suffer for Christ shall have consolations abounding 
 as their afflictions do abound. But in the joys of heaven, and nowhere 
 short of them, will fully be <I>brought to pass this saying,</I> as 
 that before, for there it is that God shall <I>wipe away all tears,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:17,21:4">Rev. vii. 17; xxi. 4</A>.

 And <I>there shall be no more sorrow,</I> because <I>there shall be no
 more death.</I> The hope of this should now wipe away all excessive 
 tears, all the weeping that hinders sowing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. That all the reproach cast upon religion and the serious professors 
 of it shall be for ever rolled away: <I>The rebuke of his people,</I> 
 which they have long lain under, the calumnies and misrepresentations 
 by which they have been blackened, the insolence and cruelty with which 
 their persecutors have trampled on them and trodden them down, <I>shall 
 be taken away.</I> Their righteousness shall be brought forth as the 
 light, in the view of all the world, who shall be convinced that they 
 are not such as they have been invidiously characterized; and so their 
 salvation from the injuries done them as such shall be wrought out. 
 Sometimes in this world God does that for his people which <I>takes 
 away their reproach from among men.</I> However, it will be done 
 effectually at the great day; for the <I>Lord has spoken it,</I> who 
 can, and will, make it good. Let us patiently bear sorrow and shame 
 now, and improve both; for shortly both will be done away.</P>

 have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his

 &nbsp; 10  For in this mountain shall the hand of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> rest, and
 Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden
 down for the dunghill.
 &nbsp; 11  And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as
 he that swimmeth spreadeth forth <I>his hands</I> to swim: and he
 shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their
 hands.
 &nbsp; 12  And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, I. The welcome which the church shall give to these blessings 
 promised in the foregoing verses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>It shall be said in that day,</I> with a humble holy triumph and
 exultation, <I>Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him!</I> Thus 
 will the deliverance of the church out of long and sore troubles be 
 celebrated; thus will it be as life from the dead. With such transports 
 of joy and praise will those entertain the glad tidings of the Redeemer 
 who looked for him, and for redemption in Jerusalem by him; and with 
 such a triumphant song as this will glorified saints <I>enter into the 
 joy of their Lord.</I> 

 1. God himself must have the glory of all: "<I>Lo, this is our God, 
 this is the Lord.</I> This which is done is his doing, and it is 
 marvellous in our eyes. Herein he has done like himself, has magnified 
 his own wisdom, power, and goodness. Herein he has done for us like our 
 God, a God in covenant with us, and whom we serve." Note, Our triumphs 
 must not terminate in what God does for us and gives to us, but must 
 pass through them to himself, who is the author and giver of them: 
 <I>This is our God.</I> Have any of the nations of the earth such a God 
 to trust to? No, <I>their rock is not as our rock. There is none like 
 unto the God of Jerusalem.</I> 

 2. The longer it has been expected the more welcome it is. "This is he
 whom we have waited for, in dependence upon his word of promise, and a 
 full assurance that he would come in the set time, in due time, and 
 therefore we were willing to tarry his time; and now we find it is not 
 in vain to wait for him, for the mercy comes at last, with an abundant 
 recompence for the delay." 

 3. It is matter of joy unspeakable: "<I>We will be glad and rejoice in
 his salvation.</I> We that share in the benefits of it will concur in 
 the joyful thanksgivings for it." 

 4. It is an encouragement to hope for the continuance and perfection of
 this salvation: <I>We have waited for him, and he will save us,</I> 
 will carry on what he has begun; for <I>as for God,</I> our God, <I>his 
 work is perfect.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A prospect of further blessings for the securing and perpetuating 
 of these. 

 1. The power of God shall be engaged for them and shall continue to
 take their part: <I>In this mountain shall the hand of the Lord 
 rest,</I>

 The church and people of God shall have continued proofs of God's
 presence with them and residence among them: his hand shall be 
 continually over them, to protect and guard them, and continually 
 stretched out to them, for their supply. Mount Zion is <I>his rest for 
 ever;</I> here he will dwell.

 2. The power of their enemies, which is engaged against them, shall be
 broken. <I>Moab</I> is here put for all the adversaries of God's 
 people, that are vexatious to them; they <I>shall</I> all <I>be trodden 
 down</I> or threshed (for <I>then</I> they beat out the corn by 
 treading it) and shall be thrown out as <I>straw to the dunghill,</I> 
 being good for nothing else. God having <I>caused his hand to rest upon 
 this mountain,</I> it shall not be a hand that hangs down, or is folded 
 up, feeble and inactive; but he shall <I>spread forth his hands, in the 
 midst</I> of his people, <I>like one that swims,</I> which intimates 
 that he will employ and exert his power for them vigorously,--that he 
 will be doing for them on all sides,--that he will easily and 
 effectually put by the opposition that is given to his gracious 
 intentions for them, and thereby further and push forward his good work 
 among them,--and that on their behalf he will be continually active, 
 for so the swimmer is. It is foretold, particularly, what he shall do 
 for them.

 (1.) <I>He shall bring down the pride</I> of their enemies (and Moab
 was notoriously guilty of pride,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+16:6"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 6</A>)

 by one humbling judgment after another, stripping them of that which
 they are proud of. 

 (2.) He shall bring down <I>the spoils of their hands,</I> shall take 
 from them that which they have got by spoil and rapine. He shall bring 
 down the arms of their hands, which are lifted up against God's Israel; 
 he shall quite break their power, and disable them to do mischief.

 (3.) He shall ruin all their fortifications, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Moab has his walls, and his high forts, with which he hopes to secure
 himself, and from which he designs to annoy the people of God; but God 
 shall <I>bring them all down, lay them low, bring them to the ground, 
 to the dust;</I> and so those who trusted to them will be left exposed. 
 There is no fortress impregnable to Omnipotence, no fort so high but 
 the arm of the Lord can overtop it and bring it down. This destruction 
 of Moab is typical of Christ's victory over death (spoken of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),
 
 his spoiling principalities and powers in his cross

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:15">Col. ii. 15</A>),

 his pulling down Satan's strong-holds by the preaching of his gospel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:4">2 Cor. x. 4</A>),

 and his reigning till all his enemies be <I>made his footstool,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:1">Ps. cx. 1</A>.</P>
