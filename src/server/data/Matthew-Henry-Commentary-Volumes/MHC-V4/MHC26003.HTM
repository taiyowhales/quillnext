 work to which God called him. 

 I. His eating the roll that was presented to him in the close of the
 foregoing chapter,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest;
 eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.
 &nbsp; 2  So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.
 &nbsp; 3  And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and
 fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat
 <I>it;</I> and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.
 &nbsp; 4  And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house
 of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.
 &nbsp; 5  For thou <I>art</I> not sent to a people of a strange speech and
 of a hard language, <I>but</I> to the house of Israel;
 &nbsp; 6  Not to many people of a strange speech and of a hard
 language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I
 sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.
 &nbsp; 7  But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they
 will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel <I>are</I>
 impudent and hard-hearted.
 &nbsp; 8  Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and
 thy forehead strong against their foreheads.
 &nbsp; 9  As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead:
 fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they
 <I>be</I> a rebellious house.
 &nbsp; 10  Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I
 shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine
 ears.
 &nbsp; 11  And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children
 of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the
 Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.
 &nbsp; 12  Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of
 a great rushing, <I>saying,</I> Blessed <I>be</I> the glory of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 from his place.
 &nbsp; 13  <I>I heard</I> also the noise of the wings of the living
 creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels
 over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.
 &nbsp; 14  So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in
 bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 was strong upon me.
 &nbsp; 15  Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt
 by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained
 there astonished among them seven days.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These verses are fitly joined by some translators to the foregoing
 chapter, as being of a piece with it and a continuation of the same 
 vision. The prophets received the word from God that they might deliver 
 it to the people of God, furnished themselves that they might furnish 
 them with the knowledge of the mind and will of God. Now here the 
 prophet is taught,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How he must receive divine revelation himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Christ (whom he saw <I>upon the throne,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:26"><I>ch.</I> i. 26</A>)

 said to him, "<I>Son of man, eat this roll,</I> admit this revelation
 into thy understanding, take it, take the meaning of it, understand it 
 aright, admit it into thy heart, apply it, and be affected with it; 
 imprint it in thy mind, ruminate and chew the cud upon it; take it as 
 it is entire, and make no difficulty of it, nay, take a pleasure in it 
 as thou dost in thy meat, and let thy soul be nourished and 
 strengthened by it; let it be meat and drink to thee, and as thy 
 necessary food; be full of it, as thou art of the meat thou hast 
 eaten." Thus ministers should in their studies and meditations take in 
 that word of God which they are to preach to others. <I>Thy words were 
 found, and I did eat them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:16">Jer. xv. 16</A>.

 They must be both well acquainted and much affected with the things of
 God, that they may speak of them both clearly and warmly, with a great 
 deal of divine light and heat. Now observe,

 1. How this command is inculcated upon the prophet. In the foregoing
 chapter, <I>Eat what I give thee;</I> and here

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 "<I>Eat that thou findest,</I> that which is presented to thee by the 
 hand of Christ." Note, Whatever we find to be the word of God, whatever 
 is brought to us by him who is the Word of God, we must receive it 
 without disputing. What we find set before us in the scripture, that we 
 must eat. And again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 "<I>Cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll;</I> do 
 not eat it and bring it up again, as that which is nauseous, but eat it 
 and retain it, as that which is nourishing and grateful to the stomach.
 Feast upon this vision till thou be <I>full of matter,</I> as Elihu 
 was, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:18">Job xxxii. 18</A>.

 Let the word have a place in thee, the innermost place." We must take
 pains with our own hearts, that we may cause them duly to receive and 
 entertain the word of God, that every faculty may do its office, in 
 order to the due digesting of the word of God, that it may be turned 
 <I>in succum et sanguinem--into blood and spirits.</I> We must empty 
 ourselves of worldly things, that we may <I>fill our bowels with this 
 roll.</I>

 2. How this command is explained
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:10">(<I>v.</I> 10</A>):
 
 "<I>All my words that I shall speak unto thee,</I> to be spoken unto 
 the people, <I>thou must receive in thy heart,</I> as well as <I>hear 
 with thy ears,</I> receive them in the love of them." <I>Let these 
 sayings sink down into your ears,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:44">Luke ix. 44</A>.

 Christ demands the prophet's attention not only to what he now says,
 but to all that he shall at any time hereafter speak: <I>Receive</I> it 
 all <I>in thy heart; meditate on these things and give thyself wholly 
 to them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:15">1 Tim. iv. 15</A>.

 3. How this command was obeyed in vision. He <I>opened his mouth</I>
 and Christ <I>caused him to eat the roll,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 If we be truly willing to receive the word into our hearts, Christ will 
 by his Spirit bring it into them and cause it to <I>dwell in us 
 richly.</I> If he that <I>opens the roll,</I> and by his Spirit, as a 
 <I>Spirit of revelation,</I> spreads it before us, did not also <I>open 
 our understanding,</I> and by his Spirit, as a <I>Spirit of wisdom,</I> 
 give us the knowledge of it and <I>cause us to eat</I> it, we should be 
 for ever strangers to it. The prophet had reason to fear that the roll 
 would be an unpleasant morsel and a sorry dish to make a meal of, but 
 it proved to be in his <I>mouth as honey for sweetness.</I> Note, if we 
 readily obey even the most difficult commands, we shall find that 
 comfort in the reflection which will make us abundant amends for all 
 the hardships we meet with in the way of our duty. Though <I>the roll 
 was filled with lamentations, and mourning, and woe,</I> yet it was to 
 the prophet <I>as honey for sweetness.</I> Note, Gracious souls can 
 receive those truths of God with great delight which speak most terror 
 to wicked people. We find St. John let into some part of the revelation 
 by such a sign as this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+10:9,10">Rev. x. 9, 10</A>.

 He <I>took the book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up, and it 
 was,</I> as this, <I>in</I> his <I>mouth sweet as honey;</I> but it was 
 <I>bitter in the belly;</I> and we shall find that this was so too, for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)
 
 the prophet <I>went in bitterness.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How he must deliver that divine revelation to others which he 
 himself had received 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>Eat this roll, and</I> then <I>go, speak to the house of Israel.</I> 
 He must not undertake to preach the things of God to others till he did 
 himself fully understand them; let him not go without his errand, nor 
 take it by the halves. But when he does himself fully understand them 
 he must be both busy and bold to preach them for the good of others. We 
 must not <I>conceal the words of the Holy One</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:10">Job vi. 10</A>),

 for that is burying a talent which was given us to trade with. He must
 <I>go and speak to the house of Israel;</I> for it is their privilege 
 to have God's statutes and judgments made known to them; as <I>the 
 giving of the law</I> (the lively oracles), so prophecy (the living 
 oracles) <I>pertains to them.</I> He is not sent to the Chaldeans to 
 reprove them for their sins, but <I>to the house of Israel</I> to 
 reprove them for theirs; for the father corrects his own child if he do 
 amiss, not the child of a stranger.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The instructions given him in speaking to them are much the same 
 with those in the foregoing chapter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He must speak to them all that, and that only, which God spoke to 
 him. He had said before
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+2:7"><I>ch.</I> ii. 7</A>):

 <I>Thou shalt speak my words to them;</I> here he says 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 <I>Thou shalt speak with my words unto them,</I> or <I>in my words.</I> 
 He must not only say that which for substance is the same that God had 
 said to him, but as near as may be in the same language and 
 expressions. Blessed Paul, though a man of a very happy invention, yet
 speaks of the things of God <I>in the words which the Holy Ghost 
 teaches,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:13">1 Cor. ii. 13</A>.

 Scripture truths look best in scripture language, their native dress;
 and how can we better speak God's mind than with his words?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He must remember that they are <I>the house of Israel</I> whom he 
 is sent to speak to, God's house and his own; and therefore such as he 
 ought to have a particular concern for and to deal faithfully and 
 tenderly with. They were such as he had an intimate acquaintance with, 
 being not only their countryman, but their <I>companion in 
 tribulation;</I> they and he were fellow-sufferers, and had lately been 
 fellow-travellers, in very melancholy circumstances, from Judea to 
 Babylon, and had often mingled their tears, which could not but knit 
 their affections to each other. It was well for the people that they 
 had a prophet who knew experimentally how to sympathize with them, and 
 could not but be touched with the feeling of their infirmities. It was 
 well for the prophet that he had to do with those of his own nation, 
 not <I>with a people of strange speech and a hard language,</I> deep of 
 lip, so that thou canst not fathom their meaning, and heavy of tongue, 
 whom it is intolerable and impossible to converse with. Every strange 
 language seems to us to be deep and heavy. "Thou art not sent to 
 <I>many such people,</I> whom thou couldst neither speak to nor hear 
 from, neither understand nor be understood among but by an 
 interpreter." The apostles indeed were sent to <I>many people of a 
 strange speech,</I> but they could not have done any good among them if 
 they had not had <I>the gift of tongues;</I> but Ezekiel was sent only 
 to one people, those but a few, and his own, whom having acquaintance 
 with he might hope to find acceptance with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He must remember what God had already told him of the bad
 character of those to whom he was sent, that, if he met with 
 discouragement and disappointment in them, he might not be offended. 
 They <I>are impudent and hard-hearted</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 no convictions of sin would make them blush, no denunciations of wrath 
 would make them tremble. Two things aggravated their obstinacy:--

 [1.] That they were more obstinate than their neighbours would have 
 been if the prophet had been sent to them. Had God sent him to any
 other people, though of a <I>strange speech, surely they would have 
 hearkened</I> to him; they would at least have given him a patient 
 hearing and shown him that respect which he could not obtain of his own 
 countrymen. The Ninevites were wrought upon by Jonah's preaching when 
 the house of Israel, that was compassed about with so great a cloud of 
 prophets, was unhumbled and unreformed. But what shall we say to these 
 things? The means of grace are given to those that will not improve 
 them and withheld from those that would have improved them. We must 
 resolve this into the divine sovereignty, and say, Lord, <I>thy 
 judgments are a great deep.</I>

 [2.] That they were obstinate against God himself: "They <I>will not 
 hearken unto thee,</I> and no marvel, <I>for they will not hearken unto 
 me;</I>" they will not regard the word of the prophet, for they will 
 not regard the rod of God, by which the <I>Lord's voice cries in the 
 city.</I> If they believe not God speaking to them by a minister, 
 neither would they believe though he should speak to them by <I>a voice 
 from heaven;</I> nay, <I>therefore</I> they reject what the prophet 
 says, because it comes from God, whom <I>the carnal mind is enmity</I> 
 to. They are prejudiced against the law of God, and for that reason 
 turn a deaf ear to his prophets, whose business it is to enforce his 
 law.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) He must resolve to put on courage, and Christ promises to steel 
 him with it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 He is sent to such as <I>are impudent and hard-hearted,</I> who will 
 receive no impressions nor be wrought upon either by fair means or 
 foul, who will take a pride in affronting God's messenger and 
 confronting the message. It will be a hard task to know how to deal 
 with them; but, 

 [1.] God will enable him to put a good face on it: "<I>I have made thy 
 face strong against their faces,</I> endued thee with all the firmness 
 and boldness that the case calls for." Perhaps Ezekiel was naturally 
 bashful and timorous, but, if God did not find him fit, yet by his 
 grace he made him fit, to encounter the greatest difficulties. Note, 
 The more impudent wicked people are in their opposition to religion the 
 more openly and resolutely should God's people appear in the practice 
 and defence of it. Let the <I>innocent stir up himself against the
 hypocrite,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+17:8">Job xvii. 8</A>.

 When vice is daring let not virtue be sneaking. And, when God has work
 to do, he will animate men for it and give them strength according to 
 the day. If there be occasion, God can and will by his grace make the 
 <I>foreheads</I> of faithful ministers <I>as an adamant,</I> so that 
 the most threatening powers shall not dash them out of countenance.
 <I>The Lord God will help men, therefore have I set my face like a 
 flint,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:7">Isa. l. 7</A>.

 [2.] He is therefore commanded to have a good heart on it, and to go on 
 in his work with a holy security, not valuing either the censures or 
 the threats of his enemies: "<I>Fear not, neither be dismayed at their 
 looks;</I> let not the menaces of their impotent malice cast either a 
 damp upon thee or a stumbling-block before thee." Bold sinners must 
 have bold reprovers; <I>evil beasts</I> must be <I>rebuked</I> 
 cuttingly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:12,13">Tit. i. 12, 13</A>),

 must be <I>saved with fear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:23">Jude 23</A>.

 Those that keep closely to the service of God may be sure of the favour
 of God, and then they need not be dismayed at the proud looks of men.
 Let not the angry countenance that drives away a back-biting tongue 
 give any check to a reproving tongue.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) He must continue instant with them in his preaching, whatever the 
 success was, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 He must <I>go to those of the captivity,</I> who, being in affliction, 
 it was to be hoped would receive instruction; he must look upon them as 
 <I>the children of his people,</I> to whom he was nearly allied, and 
 for whom he therefore ought to have a very tender concern, as Paul for 
 his kinsmen, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:3">Rom. ix. 3</A>.

 And he must <I>tell them</I> not only what the Lord said, but that the
 Lord said it; let him speak in God's name, and back what he said with 
 his authority: <I>Thus saith the Lord God; tell them</I> so, <I>whether 
 they will hear or whether they will forbear.</I> Not that it may be 
 indifferent to us what success our ministry has, but, whatever it be, 
 we must go on with our work and leave the issue to God. We must not say 
 "Here are some so good that we do not need to speak to them," or, "Here 
 are others so bad that it is to no purpose to speak to them;" but, 
 however it be, deliver thy message faithfully, <I>tell them, The Lord 
 God saith</I> so and so, let them reject it at their peril.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Full instructions being thus given to the prophet, pursuant to his 
 commission, we are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) With what satisfaction this mission of his was applauded by the 
 holy angels, who were very well pleased to see one of a nature inferior 
 to their own thus honourable employed and entrusted. He <I>heard a 
 voice of a great rushing</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 as if the angels thronged and crowded to see the inauguration of a 
 prophet; for to them <I>is known by the church</I> (that is, by 
 reflection from the church) <I>the manifold wisdom of God,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:10">Eph. iii. 10</A>.

 They seemed to strive who should get nearest to this great sight. He
 <I>heard the noise of their wings that touched,</I> or (as the word is) 
 <I>kissed one another,</I> denoting the mutual affections and 
 assistances of the angels. He heard also <I>the noise of the wheels</I> 
 of Providence moving <I>over-against</I> the angels and in concert with 
 them. All this was to engage his attention and to convince him that the 
 God who sent him, having such a glorious train of attendants, no doubt 
 had power sufficient to bear him out in his work. But all this noise
 ended in the voice of praise. He heard them saying, <I>Blessed be the 
 glory of the Lord from his place.</I>

 [1.] From heaven, his place above, whence his glory was now in vision 
 descending, or whither perhaps it was now returning. Let the 
 innumerable company of angels above join with those employed in this 
 vision in saying, <I>Blessed be the glory of the Lord. Praise you the
 Lord from the heavens. Praise him, all his angels,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+148:1,2">Ps. cxlviii. 1, 2</A>.

 [2.] From the temple, his place on earth, whence his glory was now 
 departing. They lament the departure of the glory, but adore the 
 righteousness of God in it: however it be, yet God is blessed and 
 glorious, and ever will be so. The prophet Isaiah heard God thus 
 praised when he received his commission 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:3">Isa. vi. 3</A>);

 and a comfort it is to all the faithful servants of God, when they see
 how much God is dishonoured in this lower world, to think how much he 
 is admired and glorified in the upper world. <I>The glory of the 
 Lord</I> has many slights from our place, but many <I>praises from his 
 place.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) With what reluctance of his own spirit, and yet with what a mighty 
 efficacy of <I>the Spirit of God,</I> the prophet was himself brought 
 to the execution of his office. <I>The grace given to him was not in 
 vain;</I> for, 

 [1.] The Spirit led him with a strong hand. God bade him go, but he 
 stirred not till <I>the Spirit took him up. The Spirit of the living 
 creatures</I> that was <I>in the wheels</I> now was in the prophet too, 
 and <I>took him up,</I> first to hear more distinctly the acclamations 
 of the angels

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),
 
 but afterwards 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)

 <I>lifted him up, and took him away</I> to his work, which he was 
 backward to, being very loth either to bring trouble upon himself or 
 foretel it to his people. He would gladly have been excused, but must
 own, as another prophet does 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+20:7">Jer. xx. 7</A>),

 <I>Thou was stronger than I, and hast prevailed.</I> Ezekiel would
 willingly have kept all he heard and saw to himself, that it might go 
 no further, <I>but the hand of the Lord was strong upon him</I> and 
 overpowered him; he was carried on contrary to his own inclinations by 
 the prophetical impulse, so that he could not <I>but speak the things 
 which he had heard and seen,</I> as the apostles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:20">Acts iv. 20</A>.

 Note, Those whom God calls to the ministry, as he furnishes their heads
 for it, so he bows their hearts to it.

 [2.] He followed with a sad heart: <I>The Spirit took me away,</I> says 
 he, <I>and</I> then <I>I went,</I> but it was <I>in bitterness, in the 
 heat of my spirit.</I> He had perhaps seen what a hard task Jeremiah 
 had at Jerusalem when he appeared as a prophet, what pains he took, 
 what opposition he met with, how he was abused by hand and tongue, and 
 what ill treatment he met with, and all to no purpose. "And" (thinks 
 Ezekiel) "must I be set up for a mark like him?" The life of a captive 
 was bad enough; but what would the life of a prophet in captivity be?
 Therefore he went in this fret and under this discomposure. Note, There 
 may in some cases be a great reluctance of corruption even where there 
 is a manifest predominance of grace. "<I>I went,</I> not <I>disobedient 
 to the heavenly vision,</I> or shrinking from the work, as Jonah, but 
 <I>I went in bitterness,</I> not at all pleased with it." When he
 received the divine revelation himself, it was to him <I>sweet as 
 honey</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 he could with abundance of pleasure have spent all his days in 
 meditating upon it; but when he is to preach it to others, who, he 
 foresees, will be hardened and exasperated by it, and have their 
 condemnation aggravated, then he goes <I>in bitterness.</I> Note, It is 
 a great grief to faithful ministers, and makes them go on in their work 
 with a heavy heart, when they find people untractable and hating to be 
 reformed. He <I>went in the heat of his spirit,</I> because of the
 discouragements he foresaw he should meet with; <I>but the hand of the 
 Lord was strong upon</I> him, not only to compel him to his work, but 
 to fit him for it, to carry him through it, and animate him against the 
 difficulties he would meet with (so we may understand it); and, when he 
 found it so, he was better reconciled to his business and applied 
 himself to it: <I>Then he came to those of the captivity</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),
 
 to some place where there were many of them together, <I>and sat where 
 they sat,</I> working, or reading, or talking, and continued <I>among 
 them seven days</I> to hear what they said and observe what they did; 
 and all that time he was waiting for <I>the word of the Lord</I> to 
 come to him. Note, Those that would speak suitably and profitably to 
 people about their souls must acquaint themselves with them and with 
 their case, must do as Ezekiel did here, must <I>sit where they 
 sit,</I> and speak familiarly to them of the things of God, and put 
 themselves into their condition, yea, though they <I>sit by the rivers 
 of Babylon.</I> But observe, He was <I>there astonished,</I> 
 overwhelmed with grief for the sins and miseries of his people and 
 overpowered by the pomp of the vision he had seen. He was <I>there
 desolate</I> (so some read it); God showed him no visions, men made him 
 no visit. Thus was he left to digest his grief, and come to a better 
 temper, before <I>the word of the Lord</I> should come to him. Note,
 Those whom god designs to exalt and enlarge he first humbles and 
 straitens for a time.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 17  Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of
 Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them
 warning from me.
 &nbsp; 18  When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou
 givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his
 wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked <I>man</I> shall die in
 his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.
 &nbsp; 19  Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his
 wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his
 iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.
 &nbsp; 20  Again, When a righteous <I>man</I> doth turn from his
 righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block
 before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him
 warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he
 hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require
 at thine hand.
 &nbsp; 21  Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous <I>man,</I> that the
 righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live,
 because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These further instructions God gave to the prophet <I>at the end of 
 seven days,</I> that is, on the seventh day after the vision he had; 
 and it is very probably that both that and this were on the sabbath 
 day, which <I>the house of Israel,</I> even in their captivity, 
 observed as well as they could in those circumstances. We do not find 
 that their conquerors and oppressors tied them to any constant service, 
 as their Egyptian task-masters had formerly done, but that they might 
 observe the sabbath-rest for a sign to distinguish between them and 
 their neighbours; but for the sabbath-work they had not the convenience 
 of temple or synagogue, only it should seem they had a <I>place by the 
 river side where prayer was wont to be made</I> (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:13">Acts xvi. 13</A>);

 there they met on the sabbath day; there their enemies upbraided them
 with <I>the songs of Zion</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:1,3">Ps. cxxxvii. 1, 3</A>);

 there Ezekiel met them, and <I>the word of the Lord</I> then and there
 <I>came to</I> him. He that had been musing and meditating on the 
 things of God all the week was fit to speak to the people in God's name 
 on the sabbath day, and disposed to hear God speak to him. This sabbath 
 day Ezekiel was not so honoured with visions of the glory of God as he 
 had been the sabbath before; but he is plainly, and by a very common 
 similitude, told his duty, which he is to communicate to the people. 
 Note, Raptures and transports of joy are not the daily bread of God's 
 children, however they may upon special occasions be feasted with them. 
 We must not deny but that we have truly communion with God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:3">1 John i. 3</A>)

 though we have it not always so sensibly as at some times. And, though
 the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven may sometimes be looked into, 
 yet ordinarily it is plain preaching that is most for edification. God
 here tells the prophet what his office was, and what the duty of that 
 office; and this (we may suppose) he was to tell the people, that they 
 might attend to what he said and improve it accordingly. Note, It is 
 good for people to know and consider what a charge their ministers have 
 of them and what an account they must shortly give of that charge.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What the office is to which the prophet is called: <I>Son of man, I 
 have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 The vision he saw astonished him: he knew not what to make of that, and 
 therefore God used this plain comparison, which served better to lead 
 him to the understanding of his work and so to reconcile him to it. He
 sat among the captives, and said little, but God comes to him, and 
 tells him that will not do; he is <I>a watchman,</I> and has something 
 to say to them; he is appointed to be as <I>a watchman</I> in the city, 
 to guard against fire, robbers, and disturbers of the peace, as <I>a 
 watchman</I> over the flock, to guard against thieves and beasts of 
 prey, but especially as <I>a watchman</I> in the camp, in an invaded 
 country or a besieged town, that is to watch the motions of the enemy, 
 and to sound an alarm upon the approach, nay, upon the first 
 appearance, of danger. This supposes <I>the house of Israel</I> to be 
 in a military state, and exposed to enemies, who are subtle and 
 restless in their attempts upon it; yea, and each of the particular 
 members of that house to be in danger and concerned to stand upon their 
 guard. Note, Ministers are <I>watchmen on the church's walls</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:6">Isa. lxii. 6</A>),

 <I>watchmen that go about the city,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:3">Cant. iii. 3</A>.

 It is a toilsome office. Watchmen must keep awake, be they ever so
 sleepy, and keep abroad, be it ever so cold; they must stand all 
 weathers <I>upon the watch-tower,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:8,Ge+31:40">Isa. xxi. 8; Gen. xxxi. 40</A>.

 It is a dangerous office. Sometimes they cannot keep their post, but
 are in peril of death from the enemy, who gain their point if they kill 
 the sentinel; and yet they dare not quit their post upon pain of death 
 from their general. Such a dilemma are the church's watchmen in; men 
 will curse them if they be faithful, and God will curse them if they be 
 false. But it is a needful office; <I>the house of Israel</I> cannot be 
 safe without watchmen, and yet, <I>except the Lord keep</I> it, <I>the 
 watchman waketh but in vain,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+127:1,2">Ps. cxxvii. 1, 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What is the duty of this office. The work of a watchman is to take 
 notice and to give notice.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The prophet, as a watchman, must take notice of what God said 
 concerning this people, not only concerning the body of the people, to 
 which the prophecies of Jeremiah and other prophets had most commonly 
 reference, but concerning particular persons, according as their 
 character was. He must not, as other watchmen, look round to spy danger 
 and gain intelligence, but he must look up to God, and further he need 
 not look: <I>Hear the word at my mouth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Note, Those that are to preach must first hear; for how can those teach 
 others who have not first learned themselves?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He must give notice of what he heard. As a watchman must have eyes 
 in his head, so he must have a tongue in his head; if he be dumb, it is 
 as bad as if he were blind, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:10">Isa. lvi. 10</A>.

 Thou shalt <I>give them warning from me,</I> sound an alarm in the
 <I>holy mountain;</I> not in his own name, or as from himself, but in 
 God's name, and from him. Ministers are God's mouth to the children of 
 men. The scriptures are written for our admonition. <I>By them is thy 
 servant warned,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:11">Ps. xix. 11</A>.

 But, because that which is delivered <I>viv&acirc; voce--by the living
 voice,</I> commonly makes the deepest impression, God is pleased, by 
 men like ourselves, who are equally concerned, to enforce upon us the 
 warnings of the written word. Now the prophet, in his preaching, must 
 distinguish between the wicked and the righteous, the precious and the 
 vile, and in his applications must suit his alarms to each, giving 
 every one his portion; and, if he did this, he should have the comfort 
 of it, whatever the success was, but, if not, he was accountable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Some of those he had to do with were wicked, and he must warn them 
 not to go on in their wickedness, but to turn from it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 We may observe here, 

 [1.] That the God of heaven has said, and does say, to every wicked 
 man, that if he go on still in his trespasses he <I>shall surely die. 
 His iniquity</I> shall undoubtedly be his ruin; it tends to ruin and 
 will end in ruin. Dying <I>thou shalt die, thou shalt die</I> so great 
 a death, <I>shalt die</I> eternally, be ever dying, but never dead.
 <I>The wicked man shall die in his iniquity, shall fie</I> under the 
 guilt of it, <I>die</I> under the dominion of it.

 [2.] That if a <I>wicked man turn from his wickedness,</I> and <I>from 
 his wicked way, he shall live,</I> and the ruin he is threatened with 
 shall be prevented; and, that he may do so, he is warned of the danger 
 he is in. <I>The wicked man shall die</I> if he go on, but <I>shall
 live</I> if he repent. Observe, he is to turn <I>from his 
 wickedness</I> and <I>from his wicked way.</I> It is not enough for a 
 man to turn <I>from his wicked way</I> by an outward reformation, which 
 may be the effect of his sins leaving him rather than of his leaving 
 his sins, but he must <I>turn from his wickedness,</I> from the love of 
 it and the inclination to it, by an inward regeneration; if he do not 
 so much as turn <I>from his wicked way,</I> there is little hope that 
 he will turn <I>from his wickedness.</I>

 [3.] That it is the duty of ministers both to warn sinners of the 
 danger of sin and to assure them of the benefit of repentance, to set 
 before them how miserable they are if they go on in sin, and how happy 
 they may be if they will but repent and reform. Note, The ministry of
 the word is concerning matters of <I>life and death,</I> for those are 
 the things it sets before us, <I>the blessing and the curse,</I> that 
 we may escape the curse and inherit the blessing.

 [4.] That, though ministers do not warn wicked people as they ought of 
 their misery and danger, yet that shall not be admitted as an excuse 
 for those that go on still in their trespasses; for, though the 
 watchman did not <I>give them warning,</I> yet they <I>shall die in 
 their iniquity,</I> for they had sufficient warning given them by the 
 providence of God and their own consciences; and, if they would have 
 taken it, they might have <I>saved</I> their <I>lives.</I>

 [5.] That if ministers be not faithful to their trust, if they do not 
 warn sinners of the fatal consequences of sin, but suffer them to go on 
 unreproved, the <I>blood</I> of those that perish through their 
 carelessness <I>will be required at their hand.</I> It shall be charged 
 upon them in the day of account that it was owing to their 
 unfaithfulness that such and such precious souls perished in sin; for 
 who knows but if they had had fair warning given them they might have 
 fled in time <I>from the wrath to come?</I> And, if it contract so 
 heinous a guilt as it does to be accessory to the murder of a dying 
 body, what is it to be accessory to the ruin of an immortal soul?

 [6.] That if ministers do their duty in giving warning to sinners, 
 though the warning be not taken, yet they may have this satisfaction, 
 that they are j<I>clear from</I> their <I>blood,</I> and have 
 <I>delivered their own souls,</I> though they cannot prevail to deliver 
 theirs. Those that are faithful shall have their reward, though they
 be not successful.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Some of those he had to deal with were <I>righteous,</I> at least 
 he had reason to think, in a judgment of charity, that they were so; 
 and he must warn them not to apostatize and <I>turn away from their 
 righteousness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.
 
 We may observe here, 

 [1.] That the best men in the world have need to be warned against 
 apostasy, and to be told of the danger they are in of it and the danger 
 they are in by it. God's servants must be warned
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:11">Ps. xix. 11</A>)

 that they do not neglect his work and quit his service. One good means 
 to keep us from falling is to keep up a holy fear of falling,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:1">Heb. iv. 1</A>.

 <I>Let us therefore fear;</I> and

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:20">Rom. xi. 20</A>)

 even those that <I>stand by faith</I> must <I>not be high-minded, but
 fear,</I> and must therefore be warned.

 [2.] There is a <I>righteousness</I> which a man may <I>turn from,</I> 
 a seeming <I>righteousness,</I> and, if men turn from this, it thereby 
 appears that it was never sincere, how passable, nay, how plausible 
 soever it was; for, <I>if they had been of us, they would no doubt have 
 continued with us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:19">1 John ii. 19</A>.

 There are many that <I>begin in the spirit,</I> but <I>end in the
 flesh,</I> that set their faces heavenward, but look back; that had a 
 first love, but have lost it, and <I>turned from the holy 
 commandment.</I>

 [3.] When men <I>turn from their righteousness</I> they soon learn to 
 commit iniquity. When they grow careless and remiss in the duties of 
 God's worship, neglect them, or a re negligent in them, they become an 
 easy prey to the tempter. Omissions make way for commissions.

 [4.] <I>When men turn from their righteousness, and commit 
 iniquity,</I> it is just with God to lay <I>stumbling-blocks before 
 them,</I> that they may grow worse and worse, till they are ripened for 
 destruction. When Pharaoh hardened his heart God hardened it. When 
 sinners turn their back upon God, desert his service, and so cast a 
 reproach upon it, he does, in a way of righteous judgment, not only 
 withdraw his restraining grace and give them up to their own hearts' 
 lusts, but order them by his providence into such circumstances as 
 occasion their sin and hasten their ruin. There are those to whom
 Christ himself is <I>a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:8">1 Pet. ii. 8</A>.

 [5.] The righteousness which men relinquish shall never be remembered 
 to their honour or comfort; it will stand them in no stead in this 
 world or the other. Apostates lose all that they have wrought; their 
 services and sufferings are all in vain, and shall never be brought to 
 an account, because not continued in. It is a rule in the law, 
 <I>Factum non dicitur, quod non perseverat--We are said to do only that 
 which we do perseveringly,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:3,4">Gal. iii. 3, 4</A>.

 [6.] If ministers do no give fair warning, as they ought, of the 
 weakness of the best, their aptness to stumble and fall, the particular 
 temptations they are in and the fatal consequences of apostasy, the 
 ruin of those that do apostatize will be laid at their door, and they 
 shall answer for it. Not but that there are those who are warned 
 against it, and yet <I>turn from their righteousness;</I> but that case 
 is not put here, as was concerning the wicked man, but, on the 
 contrary, that a <I>righteous man,</I> being warned, takes the warning 
 and <I>does not sin</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>);

 for, if you <I>give instruction to a wise man, he will be yet 
 wiser.</I> We must not only not flatter the wicked, but not flatter 
 even the righteous as if they were perfectly safe any where on this 
 side heaven. 

 [7.] If ministers give warning, and people take it, it is well for 
 both. Nothing is more beautiful than <I>a wise reprover upon an
 obedient ear;</I> the one <I>shall live because he is warned</I> and 
 the other <I>has delivered his soul.</I> What can a good minister 
 desire more than to <I>save himself and those that hear him?</I>

 the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.

 thine house.
 &nbsp; 25  But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon
 thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out

 &nbsp; 26  And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 After all this large and magnificent discovery which God had made of 
 himself to the prophet, and the full instructions he had given him how 
 to deal with those to whom he sent him with an ample commission, we 
 should have expected presently to see him preaching the word of God to 
 a great congregation of Israel; but here we find it quite otherwise. 
 his work here, at first, seems not at all proportionable to the pomp of 
 his call.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We have him here retired for further learning. By his unwillingness 
 to go it should seem as if he were not so thoroughly convinced as he 
 might have been of the ability of him that sent him to bear him out; 
 and therefore, to encourage him against the difficulties he foresaw, 
 God will favour him with another vision of his glory, which (if any 
 thing) would put life into him and animate him for his work. In order 
 for this, God calls him out <I>to the plain</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>)

 and there he will have some <I>talk with him.</I> See and admire the 
 condescension of God in conversing thus familiarly with a man, a <I>son 
 of man,</I> a poor captive, nay, with a sinful man, who, when God sent 
 him <I>went in bitterness of spirit,</I> and was at this time out of 
 humour with his work. And let us own ourselves for ever indebted to the 
 mediation of Christ for this blessed intercourse and communion between 
 God and man, between heaven and earth. See here the benefit of 
 solitude, and how much it befriends contemplation. It is very 
 comfortable to be alone with God, withdrawn from the word for converse 
 with him, to hear from him, to speak to him; and a good man will say 
 that he is never less along than when thus alone. Ezekiel <I>went forth 
 into the plain</I> more willingly than he went <I>among those of the 
 captivity</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);

 for those that know what it is to have communion with God cannot but 
 prefer that before any converse with this world, especially such as is 
 commonly met with. He <I>went out into the plain,</I> and there he saw 
 the same vision that he had seen <I>by the river of Chebar;</I> for God 
 is not tied to places. Note, Those who follow God shall meet with his 
 consolations, wherever they go. God called him out to <I>talk with 
 him,</I> but did more than that: he showed him his <I>glory,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.
 
 We are not now to expect such visions, but we must own that we have a 
 favour done us no way inferior if we so by faith <I>behold the glory of 
 the Lord</I> as to be <I>changed into the same image, by the Spirit of 
 the Lord;</I> and this <I>honour have all his saints. Praise you the 
 Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:18">2 Cor. iii. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We have him here restrained from further teaching for the present. 
 When he saw <I>the glory of the Lord</I> he <I>fell on his face,</I> 
 being struck with an awe of God's majesty and a dread of his 
 displeasure; but <I>the Spirit entered into</I> him to raise him up, 
 and then he recovered himself and got <I>upon his feet</I> and heard 
 what the Spirit whispered to him, which is very surprising. One would 
 have expected now that God would send him directly to the chief place 
 of concourse, would give him favour in the eyes of his brethren, and 
 make him and his message acceptable to them, that he would have a wider 
 door of opportunity opened to him and that God would give him a door of 
 utterance to open his mouth boldly; but what is here said to him is the 
 reverse of all this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Instead of sending him to a public assembly, he orders him to
 confine himself to his own lodgings: <I>Go, shut thyself within thy 
 house,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 He was not willing to appear in public, and, when he did, the people 
 did not regard him, nor show him the respect he deserved, and as a just 
 rebuke both to him and them, to him for his shyness of them and to them 
 for their coldness towards him, God forbids him to appear in public. 
 Note, Our choice is often made our punishment; and it is a righteous 
 thing with God to remove teachers into corners when they, or their 
 people, or both, grow indifferent to solemn assemblies. Ezekiel must 
 shut up himself, some think, to give a sign of the besieging of 
 Jerusalem, in which the people should be closely shut up as he was in 
 his house, and which he speaks of in the next chapter. He must <I>shut
 himself within his house,</I> that he might receive further discoveries 
 of the mind of God and might abundantly furnish himself with something 
 to say to the people when he went abroad. We find that <I>the elders of 
 Judah</I> visited him and <I>sat before</I> him sometimes <I>in his 
 house</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:1"><I>ch.</I> viii. 1</A>),

 to be witnesses of his ecstasies; but it was not till

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:25"><I>ch.</I> xi. 25</A>

 that he <I>spoke to those of the captivity all the things that the Lord
 had shown him.</I> Note, Those that are called to preach must find time 
 to study, and a great deal of time too, must often shut themselves up 
 in their houses, that they may give attendance to reading and 
 meditation, and so their profiting may appear to all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Instead of securing him an interest in the esteem and affections of 
 those to whom he sent him he tells him that <I>they shall put bands 
 upon him and bind him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 either 

 (1.) As a criminal. <I>They shall bind him</I> in order to the further 
 punishing of him as a disturber of the peace; though they were 
 themselves sent into bondage in Babylon for persecuting the prophets, 
 yet there they continue to persecute them. Or, rather, 

 (2.) As a distracted man. <I>They</I> would go about to <I>bind him</I> 
 as one beside himself; for to that they imputed his violent motions in 
 his raptures. The captains asked Jehu, <I>Wherefore came this mad 
 fellow unto thee?</I> Festus said to Paul, <I>Thou art beside 
 thyself;</I> and so the Jews said of our Lord Jesus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:21">Mark iii. 21</A>.

 Perhaps this was the reason why he must keep within doors, because
 otherwise they would bind him, under pretence of his being mad, and 
 therefore he must not <I>go out among them.</I> Justly are prophets 
 forbidden to go to those that will abuse them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Instead of opening his lips that his mouth might show forth God's 
 praise, God silence him, made his <I>tongue cleave to the roof of his 
 mouth,</I> so that he was dumb for a considerable time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 The pious captives in Babylon used this imprecation upon themselves, 
 that, <I>if</I> they should <I>forget Jerusalem,</I> there 
 <I>tongue</I> might <I>cleave to the roof of their mouth,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:6">Ps. cxxxvii. 6</A>.

 Ezekiel remembers Jerusalem more than any of them, and yet his
 <I>tongue cleaves to the roof of his mouth,</I> and he that can speak 
 best is forbidden to speak at all; and the reason given is because 
 <I>they are a rebellious house</I> to whom he is sent, and they are not 
 worthy to have him for <I>a reprover.</I> He shall not give them 
 instructions and admonitions, for they are lost and thrown away upon 
 them. He is before commanded to speak boldly to them because <I>they
 are most rebellious</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+2:7"><I>ch.</I> ii. 7</A>);

 but, since that proves to no purpose, he is now for that reason
 enjoined silence and shall not speak at all to them. Note, Those whose 
 hearts are hardened against conviction are justly deprived of the mans 
 of conviction. Why should not the reprovers be dumb, if, after long 
 trials, it be found that the reproved resolve to be deaf? If Ephraim be 
 <I>joined to idols, let him alone. Thou shalt be dumb, and not be a 
 reprover,</I> implying that unless he were dumb he would be reproving; 
 if he could speak at all, he would witness against the wickedness of 
 the wicked. <I>But when</I> God <I>speaks with</I> him, and designs to 
 speak by him, he <I>will open</I> his <I>mouth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Note, Though God's prophets may be silenced awhile, there will come a 
 time when God will give them the opening of the mouth again. And, when 
 God speaks to his ministers, he not only opens their ears to hear what 
 he says, but opens their mouth to return an answer. Moses, who had a 
 veil on his face when he went down to the people, took it off when he 
 went up again to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:34">Exod. xxxiv. 34</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Instead of giving him assurance of success when he should at any 
 time speak to the people, he here leaves the matter very doubtful, and 
 Ezekiel must not perplex and disquiet himself about it, but let it be 
 as it will. <I>He that hears, let him hear,</I> and he is welcome to 
 the comfort of it; <I>let him hear, and his soul shall live;</I> but
 <I>he that forbears, let him forbear</I> at his peril, and take what 
 comes. If <I>thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it;</I> neither God 
 nor his prophet shall be any losers by it; but the prophet shall be 
 rewarded for his faithfulness in reproving the sinner, and God will 
 have the glory of his justice in condemning him for not taking the 
 reproof.</P>
