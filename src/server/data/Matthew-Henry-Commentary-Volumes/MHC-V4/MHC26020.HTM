 In this chapter, 

 I. The prophet is consulted by some of the elders of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. He is instructed by his God what answer to give them. He must,

 1. Signify God's displeasure against them,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:2,3">ver. 2, 3</A>.
 
 And, 

 2. He must show them what just cause he had for that displeasure, by
 giving them a history of God's grateful dealings with their fathers and
 their treacherous dealings with God. 

 (1.) In Egypt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:5-9">ver. 5-9</A>.
 
 (2.) In the wilderness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:10-26">ver. 10-26</A>.

 (3.) In Canaan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:27-32">ver. 27-32</A>.

 3. He must denounce the judgments of God against them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:33-36">ver. 33-36</A>.

 4. He must tell them likewise what mercy God had in store for them,
 when he would bring a remnant of them to repentance, re-establish them 
 in their own land, and set up his sanctuary among them again, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:37-44">ver. 37-44</A>.

 5. Here is another word dropped towards Jerusalem, which is explained
 and enlarged upon in the next chapter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:45-49">ver. 45-49</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth
 <I>month,</I> the tenth <I>day</I> of the month, <I>that</I> certain of the
 elders of Israel came to enquire of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and sat before me.
 &nbsp; 2  Then came the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 3  Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto
 them, Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Are ye come to enquire of me? <I>As</I>
 I live, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, I will not be enquired of by you.
 &nbsp; 4  Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge <I>them?</I>
 cause them to know the abominations of their fathers:
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The occasion of the message which we have in this chapter. That
 sermon which we had

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:1-32"><I>ch.</I> xviii.</A>

 was occasioned by their presumptuous reflections upon God; this was
 occasioned by their hypocritical enquiries after him. Each shall have 
 his own. This prophecy is exactly dated, in the <I>seventh year of
 the</I> captivity, about two years after Ezekiel began to prophesy. God 
 would have them to keep account how long their captivity lasted, that 
 they might see how the years went on towards their deliverance, though 
 very slowly. <I>Certain of the elders of Israel came to enquire of the 
 Lord,</I> not statedly (as those

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:1"><I>ch.</I> viii. 1</A>),

 but, as it should seem, occasionally, and upon a particular emergency.
 Whether they were of those that were now in captivity, or elders lately 
 come from Jerusalem upon business to Babylon, is not certain; but, by 
 what the prophet says to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),

 it should seem, their enquiry was whether now that they were captives 
 in Babylon, at a distance from their own country, where they had not 
 only no temple, but no synagogue, for the worship of God, it was not 
 lawful for them, that they might ingratiate themselves with their lords 
 and masters, to join with them in their worship and do <I>as the 
 families of these countries</I> do, that <I>serve wood and stone.</I> 
 This matter was palliated as well as it would bear, like Naaman's 
 pleading with Elisha for leave to bow in the house of Rimmon, in 
 compliment to the king; but we have reason to suspect that their 
 enquiry drove at this. Note, Those hearts are wretchedly hardened which 
 ask God leave to go on in sin, and that when they are suffering for it.
 They came and <I>sat</I> very demurely and with a show of devotion 
 <I>before the prophet,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:31"><I>ch.</I> xxxiii. 31</A>.

 2. The purport of this message.

 (1.) They must be made to know that <I>God is angry with them;</I> he 
 takes it as an affront that they come to enquire of him when they are 
 resolved to go on still in their trespasses: <I>As I live, saith the 
 Lord God, I will not be enquired of by you,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Their shows of devotion shall be neither acceptable to God nor 
 advantageous to themselves. God will not take notice of their 
 enquiries, nor give them any satisfactory answers. Note, A hypocritical 
 attendance on God and his ordinances is so far from being pleasing to 
 him that it is provoking. 

 (2.) They must be made to know that God is justly angry with them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge them?</I> Thou 
 art a prophet, surely thou wilt not <I>plead for them,</I> as an 
 intercessor with God; but surely thou wilt <I>pass sentence</I> on them 
 as a judge for God. <I>See, I have set thee over the nation;</I> wilt 
 thou not declare to them the judgments of the Lord? Cause them 
 therefore <I>to know the abominations of their fathers.</I>" So the 
 orders run now, as before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:2"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 2</A>)

 he must cause them to <I>know their own abominations.</I> Though their
 own abominations were sufficient to justify God in the severest of his 
 proceedings against them, yet it would be of use for them to know the 
 <I>abominations of their fathers,</I> that they might see what a 
 righteous thing it was with God now at last to cut them off from being 
 a people, who from the first were such a provoking people.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; In the day when I
 chose Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house
 of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt,
 when I lifted up mine hand unto them, saying, I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 your God;
 &nbsp; 6  In the day <I>that</I> I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring
 them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for
 them, flowing with milk and honey, which <I>is</I> the glory of all
 lands:
 &nbsp; 7  Then said I unto them, Cast ye away every man the
 abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the
 idols of Egypt: I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God.
 &nbsp; 8  But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me:
 they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes,
 neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said, I will
 pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them
 in the midst of the land of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 9  But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be
 polluted before the heathen, among whom they <I>were,</I> in whose
 sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out
 of the land of Egypt.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The history of the ingratitude and rebellion of the people of Israel 
 here begins as early as their beginning; so does the history of man's 
 apostasy from his Maker. No sooner have we read the story of our first 
 parents' creation than we immediately meet with that of their 
 rebellion; so we see here it was with Israel, a people designed to 
 represent the body of mankind both in their dealings with God and in 
 his with them. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The gracious purposes of God's law concerning Israel in Egypt, where 
 they were bond-slaves to Pharaoh. Be it spoken, be it written, to the 
 immortal honour of free grace, that then and there, 

 1. He chose Israel to be a peculiar people to himself, though their
 condition was bad and their character worse, that he might have the 
 honour of mending both. He <I>therefore</I> chose them, because they
 were <I>the seed of the house of Jacob,</I> the posterity of that 
 prince with God, <I>that he might keep the oath which he had sworn unto 
 their fathers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:7,8">Deut. vii. 7, 8</A>.

 2. He <I>made himself known to them</I> by his name <I>Jehovah</I> (a 
 new name, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:3">Exod. vi. 3</A>),

 when by reason of their servitude they had almost lost the knowledge of
 that name by which he was known to their fathers, <I>God Almighty.</I> 
 Note, As the foundation of our blessedness is laid in God's choosing 
 us, so the first step towards it is God's making himself known to us. 
 And whatever distance we are at, whatever distress we are in, he that 
 made himself known to Israel even in the land of Egypt can find us out, 
 and follow us with the gracious discoveries and manifestations of his 
 favour.

 3. He made over himself to them as their God in covenant: <I>I lifted
 up my hand unto them,</I> saying it, and confirming it with an oath. 
 "<I>I am the Lord your God,</I> to whom you are to pay your homage, and 
 from whom and in whom you are to expect your bliss." 

 4. He promised to bring them out of Egypt; and made good what he 
 promised. He <I>lifted up his hand,</I> that is, he swore unto them, 
 that he would deliver them; and, they being very unworthy, and their 
 deliverance very unlikely, it was requisite that the promise of it 
 should be <I>confirmed by an oath.</I> Or, He <I>lifted up his 
 hand,</I> that is, he put forth his almighty power to do it; he did it 
 with an <I>outstretched arm,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:12">Ps. cxxxvi. 12</A>.

 5. He assured them that he would put them in possession of the land of
 Canaan. He <I>therefore</I> brought them out of Egypt, <I>that he might 
 bring them into a land that he had spied</I> out <I>for them,</I> a 
 second garden of Eden, which was <I>the glory of all lands.</I> So he 
 found it, the climate being temperate, the soil fruitful, the situation 
 pleasant, and every thing agreeable 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:7,11:12">Deut. viii. 7; xi. 12</A>);

 or, however this might be, so he made it, by setting up his sanctuary
 in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The reasonable commands he gave them, and the easy conditions of 
 his covenant with them at that time. Having told them what they might 
 expect from him, he next tells them what was all he expected from them; 
 it was no more than this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "<I>Cast you away every man</I> his images that he uses for worship, 
 that are the adorations, but should be the <I>abominations, of his 
 eyes.</I> Let him abominate them, and put them out of his sight, and 
 <I>defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt.</I>" Of these, it 
 seems, many of them were fond; the golden calf was one of them. It was 
 just, and what might reasonably be expected, that, being delivered from 
 the Egyptian slavery, they should quit the Egyptian idolatry, 
 especially when God, at bringing them out, <I>executed judgment upon 
 the gods of Egypt</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+33:4">Num. xxxiii. 4</A>)

 and thereby showed himself above them. And, whatever other idols they
 might have an inclination to, one would think they should have had a 
 rooted aversion to the gods of Egypt for Egypt's sake, which had been 
 to them a house of bondage. Yet, it seems, they needed this caution, 
 and it is backed with a good reason: <I>I am the Lord your God,</I> who 
 neither need an assistant nor will admit a rival.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Their unreasonable disobedience to these commands, for which God 
 might justly have cut them off as soon as ever they were formed into a 
 people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>They rebelled against God,</I> not only refused to comply with his 
 particular precepts, but shook off their allegiance, and in effect told 
 him that they should be at liberty to worship what God they pleased. 
 And even then when God came down to deliver them, and sent Moses for 
 that purpose, yet they would not <I>forsake the idols of Egypt,</I> 
 which perhaps made them speak so affectionately of the <I>onions of 
 Egypt</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:5">Num. xi. 5</A>),

 for among other things the Egyptians worshipped an onion. It was
 strange that all the plagues of Egypt would not prevail to cure them of 
 their affection to the <I>idols of Egypt.</I> For this God said he 
 would <I>pour out his fury upon them,</I> even while they were yet 
 <I>in the midst of the land of Egypt.</I> Justly might he have said, 
 "Let them die with the Egyptians." This magnifies the riches of God's 
 goodness, that he was pleased to work so great a salvation for them 
 even when he saw them ripe for ruin. Well might Moses tell them, It is 
 <I>not for your righteousness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:4,5">Deut. ix. 4, 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The wonderful deliverance which God wrought for them, 
 notwithstanding. Though they forfeited the favour while it was in the 
 bestowing, and when God <I>would have healed them</I> then their 
 <I>iniquity was discovered</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:1">Hos. vii. 1</A>),

 yet <I>mercy rejoiced against judgment,</I> and God did what he
 designed purely <I>for his own name's sake,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 When nothing in us will furnish him with a reason for his favours he 
 furnishes himself with one. God <I>made himself known</I> to them <I>in 
 the sight of the heathen</I> when he ordered Moses publicly to say to 
 Pharaoh, Israel is <I>my son, my first-born,</I> let them go, <I>that 
 they may serve me.</I> Now, if he had left them to perish for their 
 wickedness as they deserved, the Egyptians would have reflected upon 
 him for it, and his name would have been polluted, which ought to be 
 sanctified and shall be so. Note, The church is secured, even when it 
 is corrupt, because God will secure his own honour.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of
 Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.
 &nbsp; 11  And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments,
 which <I>if</I> a man do, he shall even live in them.
 &nbsp; 12  Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between
 me and them, that they might know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> that
 sanctify them.
 &nbsp; 13  But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the
 wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my
 judgments, which <I>if</I> a man do, he shall even live in them; and
 my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I said, I would pour out
 my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.
 &nbsp; 14  But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be
 polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.
 &nbsp; 15  Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness,
 that I would not bring them into the land which I had given
 <I>them,</I> flowing with milk and honey, which <I>is</I> the glory of all
 lands;
 &nbsp; 16  Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my
 statutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after
 their idols.
 &nbsp; 17  Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them,
 neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness.
 &nbsp; 18  But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye
 not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their
 judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols:
 &nbsp; 19  I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my
 judgments, and do them;
 &nbsp; 20  And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me
 and you, that ye may know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God.
 &nbsp; 21  Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they
 walked not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them,
 which <I>if</I> a man do, he shall even live in them; they polluted my
 sabbaths: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them, to
 accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.
 &nbsp; 22  Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name's
 sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen,
 in whose sight I brought them forth.
 &nbsp; 23  I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that
 I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through
 the countries;
 &nbsp; 24  Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised
 my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were
 after their fathers' idols.
 &nbsp; 25  Wherefore I gave them also statutes <I>that were</I> not good,
 and judgments whereby they should not live;
 &nbsp; 26  And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused
 to pass through <I>the fire</I> all that openeth the womb, that I
 might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I
 <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The history of the struggle between the sins of Israel, by which they 
 endeavoured to ruin themselves, and the mercies of God, by which he 
 endeavoured to save them and make them happy, is here continued: and 
 the instances of that struggle in these verses have reference to what 
 passed between God and them in the wilderness, in which God honoured 
 himself and they shamed themselves. The story of Israel in the 
 wilderness is referred to in the New Testament 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:1-33,Heb+3:1-19">1 Cor. x. and Heb. iii.</A>),

 as well as often in the Old, for warning to us Christians; and
 therefore we are particularly concerned in these verses. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The great things God did for them, which he puts them in mind of, 
 not as grudging them his favours, but to show how ungrateful they had 
 been. And we say, If you call a man ungrateful, you can call him no 
 worse. It was a great favour, 

 1. That God <I>brought them forth out of Egypt</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 though, as it follows, he <I>brought them into the wilderness</I> and 
 not into Canaan immediately. It is better to be at liberty in a 
 wilderness than bond-slaves in a land of plenty, to enjoy God and 
 ourselves in solitude than to lose both in a crowd; yet there were many 
 of them who had such base servile spirits as not to understand this, 
 but, when they met with the difficulties of a desert, wished themselves 
 in Egypt again. 
 
 2. That he gave them the law upon Mount Sinai
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),
 
 not only instructed them concerning good and evil, but by his authority 
 bound them from the evil and to the good. He <I>gave them his 
 statutes,</I> and a valuable gift it was. <I>Moses commanded them a law 
 that was the inheritance of the congregation of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:4">Deut. xxxiii. 4</A>.
 
 God <I>made them to know his judgments,</I> not only enacted laws for
 them, but showed them the reasonableness and equity of those laws, with 
 what judgment they were formed. The laws he gave them they were 
 encouraged to observe and obey; for, <I>if a man do them, he shall even 
 live in them;</I> in keeping God's commandments there is abundance of 
 comfort and a great reward. Christ says, <I>If thou wilt into enter 
 life,</I> and enjoy it, <I>keep the commandments.</I> Though those who 
 are the most strict in their obedience are thus far unprofitable 
 servants that they do no more than is their duty to do, yet it is thus 
 richly recompensed: <I>This do, and thou shalt live.</I> The Chaldee 
 says, <I>He shall live an eternal life in them.</I> St. Paul quotes 
 this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:12">Gal. iii. 12</A>)

 to show that <I>the law is not of faith,</I> but proposes life upon
 condition of perfect obedience, which we are not capable of rendering, 
 and therefore must have recourse to the grace of the gospel, without 
 which we are all undone.

 3. That he revived the ancient institution of the sabbath day, which
 was lost and forgotten while they were bond-slaves in Egypt; for their 
 task-masters there would by no means allow them to rest one day in 
 seven. In the wilderness indeed every day was a day of rest; for what 
 need had those to labour who lived upon manna, and whose raiment waxed 
 not old? But one day in seven must be a holy rest

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>I gave them my sabbaths to be a sign between me and them</I> (the 
 institution of the sabbath was a sign of God's good-will to them, and 
 their observance of it a sign of their regard to him), <I>that they 
 might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them.</I> By this God made 
 it to appear that he had distinguished them from the rest of the world, 
 and designed to model them for a peculiar people to himself; and by 
 their attendance on God in solemn assemblies on sabbath days they were 
 made to increase in the knowledge of God, in an experimental knowledge 
 of the powers and pleasures of his sanctifying grace. Note, 

 (1.) Sabbaths are privileges, and are so to be accounted; the church 
 acknowledges as a great favour, in that chapter which is parallel to 
 this and seems to have a reference to this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:14">Neh. ix. 14</A>),

 <I>Thou madest known unto them thy holy sabbaths.</I>

 (2.) Sabbaths are signs; it is a sign that men have a sense of 
 religion, and that there is some good correspondence between them and 
 God, when they make conscience of keeping holy and sabbath day. 

 (3.) Sabbaths, if duly sanctified, are the means of our sanctification; 
 if we do the duty of the day, we shall find, to our comfort, <I>it is 
 the Lord that sanctifies us,</I> makes us holy (that is, truly happy) 
 here, and prepares us to be happy (that is, perfectly holy) 
 hereafter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Their disobedient undutiful conduct towards God, for which he might 
 justly have thrown them out of covenant as soon as he had taken them 
 into covenant 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>They rebelled in the wilderness.</I> There where they received so 
 much mercy from God, and had such a dependence upon him, and were in 
 their way to Canaan, yet there they broke out in many open rebellions 
 against the God that led them and fed them. They did not only not 
 <I>walk in God's statutes,</I> but they <I>despised his judgments</I> 
 as not worth observing; instead of sanctifying the sabbaths, they 
 polluted them, greatly polluted them; one gathered sticks, many went 
 out to gather manna on this day. Hereupon God was ready sometimes to 
 cut them off; he said, more than once, that he would <I>consume them in 
 the wilderness.</I> But Moses interceded, so did God's own mercy more 
 powerfully, and most of all a concern for his own glory, that <I>his 
 name might not be polluted and profaned among the heathen</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),
 
 that the Egyptians might not say that for mischief he brought them thus 
 far, or that he was not able to bring them any further, or that he had 
 no such good land as was talked of to bring them to,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:12,Nu+14:13">Exod. xxxii. 12; Num. xiv. 13</A>,

 &c. Note, God's strongest reasons for his sparing mercy are those which
 are fetched from his own glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. God's determination to cut off that generation of them in the 
 wilderness. He who <I>lifted up his hand</I> for them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 now <I>lifted up his hand against them;</I> he who by an oath confirmed 
 his promise to bring them out of Egypt now by an oath confirmed his 
 threatenings that he would not bring them into Canaan 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>):

 <I>I lifted up my hand unto them,</I> saying, <I>As truly as I live, 
 these men who have tempted me these ten times shall never see the land 
 which I swore unto their fathers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:22,23,Ps+95:11">Num. xiv. 22, 23; Ps. xcv. 11</A>.

 By their contempt of God's laws, and particularly of his sabbaths, they
 put a bar in their own door; and that which was at the bottom of their 
 disobedience to God, and their neglect of his institutions, was a 
 secret affection to the gods of Egypt: <I>Their heart went after their 
 idols.</I> Note, The bias of the mind towards the world and the flesh, 
 the money and the belly (those two great objects of spiritual 
 idolatry), is the root of bitterness from which springs all 
 disobedience to the divine law. The heart that goes after those idols 
 despises God's judgments.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The reservation of a seed that should be admitted upon a new trial, 
 and the instructions given to that seed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Though they thus deserved ruin, and were doomed to it, yet <I>my eye 
 spared them.</I> When he looked upon them he had compassion on them, 
 and did not <I>make an end of them,</I> but reprieved them till a new 
 generation was reared. Note, It is owing purely to the mercy of God 
 that he has not long ago <I>made an end of us.</I> This new generation 
 is well educated. Moses in Deuteronomy reported and enforce the laws 
 which had been given to those that came out of Egypt, that their 
 children might have them as it were sounding in their ears afresh when 
 they entered Canaan 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "<I>I said unto their children in the wilderness,</I> in the plains of 
 Moab, Walk in the statutes of your God and <I>walk not in the statutes 
 of your fathers;</I> do not imitate their superstitious usages nor 
 retain their foolish wicked customs; away with their vain conversation, 
 which has nothing else to say for itself but that it was <I>received by 
 the tradition of your fathers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:18">1 Pet. i. 18</A>.

 <I>Defile not yourselves with their idols,</I> for you see how odious
 they rendered themselves to God by them. But <I>keep my judgments</I> 
 and <I>hallow my sabbaths,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 Note, If parents be careless, and do not give their children good 
 instructions as they ought, the children ought to make up the want by 
 studying the word of God so much the more carefully and diligently 
 themselves when they grow up; and the bad examples of parents must be 
 made use of by their children for admonition, and not for 
 imitation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The revolt of the next generation from God, by which they also made 
 themselves obnoxious to the wrath of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>The children rebelled against me</I> too. And the same that was said 
 of the fathers' rebellion is here said <I>of the children's,</I> for 
 they were a seed of evil-doers. Moses told them that he <I>knew their 
 rebellion and their stiff neck,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:27">Deut. xxxi. 27</A>.
 
 And 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:24">Deut. ix. 24</A>,

 <I>You have been rebellious against the Lord from the day that I knew
 you. They walked not in my statutes</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>);

 nay, <I>they despised my statutes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Those who disobey God's statutes despise them, they show that they have 
 a mean opinion of them and of him whose statutes they are. They
 <I>polluted God's sabbaths,</I> as their fathers. Note, The profanation 
 of the sabbath day is an inlet to all impiety; those who pollute holy 
 time will keep nothing pure. It was said of the fathers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 that <I>their heart went after their idols;</I> they worshipped idols 
 because they had an affection for them. It is said of the children 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>)

 that <I>their eyes went after their fathers' idols;</I> they had grown 
 atheistical, and had no affection for any gods at all, but they 
 worshipped <I>their fathers' idols</I> because they were their fathers' 
 and they had them before their eyes. They were used to them; and, if 
 they must have gods, they would have such as they could see, such as 
 they could manage. And that which aggravated their disobedience to 
 God's statutes was that, <I>if they had done them, they might have 
 lived in them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 might have been a happy thriving people. Note, Those that go contrary
 to their duty go contrary to their interest; they will not obey, will 
 not come to Christ, that they may have life, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:40">John v. 40</A>.

 And it is therefore just that those who will not live and flourish as
 they might in their obedience should die and perish in their 
 disobedience. Now the great instance of that generation's rebellion and 
 inclination to idolatry was the <I>iniquity of Peor,</I> as that of 
 their fathers was the <I>golden calf.</I> Then <I>the anger of the Lord 
 was kindled against Israel,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:3">Num. xxv. 3</A>.

 Then there was a plague in the congregation of the Lord, which, if it
 had not been seasonably stayed by Phinehas's zeal, had cut them all 
 off; and yet they owned, in Joshua's time, We ware not <I>cleansed from 
 that iniquity unto this day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+22:17,Ps+106:29">Josh. xxii. 17; Ps. cvi. 29</A>.

 Then it was that God said he would <I>pour out his fury upon them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 that he <I>lifted up his hand unto them in the wilderness,</I> when 
 they were a second time just ready to enter Canaan, <I>that he would 
 scatter them among the heathen.</I> This very thing he said to them by 
 Moses in his parting song, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:20">Deut. xxxii. 20</A>.

 Because they <I>provoked him to jealousy with strange gods,</I> he
 said, <I>I will hide my face form them;</I> and

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>)

 he said, <I>I would scatter them into corners, were it not that I 
 feared the wrath of the enemy,</I> which explains this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>),
 
 <I>I said I would pour out my fury upon them,</I> but <I>I withdrew</I> 
 my hand <I>for my name's sake.</I> Note, When the corruptions of the 
 visible church are such, and so provoking, that we have reason to fear 
 its total extirpation, yet then we may be confident of this, to our 
 comfort, that God will secure his own honour, by making good his 
 purpose, that while the world stands he will have a church in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The judgments of God upon them for their rebellion. They would not 
 regard the statutes and judgments by which God prescribed them their 
 duty, but despised them, and therefore God <I>gave them statutes and 
 judgments</I> which <I>were not good,</I> and <I>by which they should 
 not live,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 By this we may understand the several ways by which God punished them 
 while they were in the wilderness--the plague that broke in upon them, 
 the fiery serpent, and the like--which, in allusion to the law they had 
 broken, are called <I>judgments,</I> because inflicted by the justice 
 of God, and <I>statutes,</I> because he gave orders concerning them and 
 commanded desolations as sometimes he had commanded deliverances, and 
 appointed Israel's plagues as he had done the plagues of Egypt. When 
 God said, <I>I will consume them in a moment</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:21">Num. xvi. 21</A>),

 when he said, <I>Take the heads of the people and hang them up</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:4">Num. xxv. 4</A>),

 when he threatened them with the curse and obliged them to say
 <I>Amen</I> to every curse

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:28">Deut. xxvii. 28</A>),

 then he gave them judgments by <I>which they should not live.</I> More
 is implied than is expressed; they are judgments by which they should 
 die. Those that will not be bound by the precepts of the law shall be 
 bound by the sentence of it; for one way or other the word of God will 
 <I>take hold</I> of men, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:6">Zech. i. 6</A>.

 Spiritual judgments are the most dreadful; and these God punished them
 with. The statutes and judgments which the heathen observed in the 
 worship of their idols were not good, and in practising them they could 
 not live; and God gave them up to those. He made their sin to be their 
 punishment, gave them up to a <I>reprobate mind,</I> as he did the 
 Gentile idolaters

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:24,26">Rom. i. 24, 26</A>),

 gave them up to their own heart's lusts

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:12">Ps. lxxxi. 12</A>),

 punished them for those superstitious customs which were against the
 written law by giving them up to those which were against the very 
 light and law of nature; he left them to themselves to be guilty of the 
 most impure idolatries, as in the worship of Baal-peor (he <I>polluted 
 them,</I> that is, her permitted them to pollute themselves, <I>in 
 their own gifts,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 and of the most barbarous idolatries, as in the worship of Moloch, when 
 they <I>caused their children,</I> especially their first-born, which 
 God challenged a particular property in (<I>the first-born of thy sons 
 shalt thou give unto me</I>), to pass <I>through the fire,</I> to be 
 sacrificed to their idols; that thus he might <I>make them 
 desolate,</I> not only that he might justly do it, but that he might do 
 it by their own hands; for this must needs be a great weakening to 
 their families and a diminution of the honour and strength of their 
 country. Note, God sometimes makes sin to be its own punishment, and 
 yet is not the author of sin; and there needs no more to make men 
 miserable than to give them up to their own vile appetites and 
 passions. Let them be put into the hand of their own counsels, and they 
 will ruin themselves and make themselves desolate. And thus God makes 
 them know that he is the Lord, and that he is a righteous God, which 
 they themselves will be compelled to own when they see how much their 
 wilful transgressions contribute to their own desolations. Note, Those 
 who will not acknowledge God as the Lord their ruler shall be made to 
 acknowledge him as the Lord their judge when it is too late.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>27  Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and
 say unto them, Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Yet in this your fathers
 have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass
 against me.
 &nbsp; 28  <I>For</I> when I had brought them into the land, <I>for</I> the which
 I lifted up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every
 high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their
 sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their
 offering: there also they made their sweet savour, and poured out
 there their drink offerings.
 &nbsp; 29  Then I said unto them, What <I>is</I> the high place whereunto ye
 go? And the name thereof is called Bamah unto this day.
 &nbsp; 30  Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord
 G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit
 ye whoredom after their abominations?
 &nbsp; 31  For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass

 unto this day: and shall I be enquired of by you, O house of
 Israel? <I>As</I> I live, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, I will not be enquired
 of by you.
 &nbsp; 32  And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all,
 that ye say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the
 countries, to serve wood and stone.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the prophet goes on with the story of their rebellions, for their 
 further humiliation, and shows,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That they had persisted in them after they were settled in the land 
 of Canaan. Though God had so many times testified his displeasure 
 against their wicked courses, "yet <I>in this</I> (that is, in the very 
 same thing) <I>your fathers have blasphemed me,</I> continued to 
 affront me, that they <I>also have trespassed a trespass against 
 me,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Note, It is a great aggravation of sin when men will not take warning 
 by the mischievous consequences of sin in those that have gone before 
 them: this is <I>blaspheming God;</I> it is speaking reproachfully of 
 his judgments, as if they were of no significancy and were not worth 
 regarding. 

 1. God had made good his promise: <I>I brought them into the land</I>
 that I had sworn to give them. Though their unbelief and disobedience 
 had made the performance slow, and much retarded it, yet it did not 
 <I>make the promise of no effect.</I> They were often very near being 
 cut off in the wilderness, but a step between them and ruin, and yet 
 they came to Canaan at last. Note, Even God's Israel get to heaven by 
 hell-gates; so many are their transgressions, and so strong their 
 corruptions, that it is a miracle of mercy they are happy at last; as 
 hypocrites go to hell by heaven-gates. <I>The righteous scarcely are 
 saved. Per tot discrimina rerum tendimus ad c&oelig;lum--Ten thousand
 dangers fill the road to haven.</I> 

 2. They had broken his precept by their abominable idolatries. God had 
 appointed them to destroy all the monuments of idolatry, that they 
 might not be tempted to desert his sanctuary; but, instead of defacing 
 them, they fell in love with them, and when they <I>saw every high 
 hill</I> whence they had the most delightful prospects, and all the 
 <I>thick trees</I> where they had the most delightful shades (the 
 former to show forth their pompous idolatries, the latter to conceal 
 their shameful ones), <I>there they offered their sacrifices</I> and 
 <I>made their sweet savour,</I> which should have been presented upon 
 God's altar only. <I>There they presented the provocation of their
 offering</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),
 
 that is, their offerings, which, instead of pacifying God, or pleasing 
 him, were highly provoking-sacrifices which, though costly, yet being 
 misplaced, were an abomination to the Lord. 

 3. They obstinately persisted herein notwithstanding all the
 admonitions that were given them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 "<I>Then I told them,</I> by my servants the prophets, told them 
 <I>where the high place was, to which they went;</I> nay, I put them 
 upon considering it, and asking their own consciences concerning it, by 
 putting this question to them, <I>Which is the high place whereunto you 
 go?</I> What do you find there so inviting that you will leave God's 
 altars, where he requires your attendance, to frequent such places as 
 he has forbidden you to worship in? Do you not know that those high 
 places are of a heathenish extraction, and that the things which the 
 Gentiles sacrificed they sacrificed to devils and not to God? Did not
 Moses tell you so? 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:17">Deut. xxxii. 17</A>.

 <I>And will you have fellowship with devils? What is that high place to
 which you go</I> when you turn your back on God's altars? <I>O 
 foolish</I> Israelites, <I>who</I> or what <I>has bewitched you,</I> 
 that you will forsake the fountain of life for broken cisterns, that 
 worship which God appoints, and will accept, for that which he forbids, 
 which he abhors, and which he will punish?" And yet <I>the name is 
 called Bamah unto this day;</I> they will have their way, let God and 
 his prophets say what they please to the contrary. They are wedded to 
 their <I>high places;</I> even in the best reigns those were not taken 
 away; you could not prevail to take away the name of <I>Bamah--the high 
 place,</I> out of their mouths, but still they would have that in the 
 place of their worship. The sin and the sinner are with difficulty 
 parted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That this generation, after they were unsettled, continued under 
 the dominion of the same corrupt inclinations to idolatry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 He must <I>say to</I> the present <I>house of Israel,</I> some of whose 
 elders were now sitting before him, "<I>Are you polluted after the 
 manner of your fathers?</I> After all that God has said against you by 
 a succession of prophets, and done against you by a series of 
 judgments, yet will you take no warning? Will you still be as bad as 
 your fathers were, and commit the same abominations that they 
 committed? I see you will; you are bent upon returning to the old 
 abominations; you <I>offer your gifts</I> in the high places, and you 
 <I>make your sons to pass through the fire;</I> either you actually do 
 it or you do it in purpose and imagination, and so you continue 
 idolaters <I>to this day.</I>" These elders seem now to have been 
 projecting a coalition with the heathen; their hearts they will reserve 
 for the God of Israel, but their knees they will be at liberty to bow 
 to the gods of the nations among whom they live, that they may have the 
 more respect and the fairer quarter among them. Now the prophet is here 
 ordered to tell those who were forming this scheme, and were for 
 compounding the matter between God and Baal, that they should have no 
 comfort or benefit from either. 

 1. They should have no benefit by their consulting in private with the
 prophets of the Lord; for, because they were hearkening after idols, 
 God would have nothing to do with them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 <I>As I live, saith the Lord God, I will not be enquired of by you.</I> 
 What he had said before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 having largely shown how just it was, he here repeats, as that which he 
 would abide by. Let them not think that they honoured him by their 
 enquiries, nor expect an answer of peace from him, as long as they 
 continued in love and league with their idols. Note, Those reap no 
 benefit by their religion that are not entire and sincere in it; nor 
 can we have any comfortable communion with God in ordinances of worship 
 unless we be inward and upright with him therein. We make nothing of 
 our profession if it be but a profession. Nay, 

 2. They should have no benefit from their conforming in public to the 
 practice of their neighbours

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):

 "<I>That which comes into your mind</I> as a piece of refined politics 
 in the present difficult juncture, and which you would be advised to 
 for your own preservation, and that you may not by being singular 
 expose yourselves to abuses, it <I>shall not be at all,</I> it shall 
 turn to no account to you. You say, <I>'We will be as the heathen,</I> 
 we will join with them in worshipping their gods, though at the same 
 time we do not believe them to be gods, but <I>wood and stone,</I> and 
 then we should be taken <I>as the families of the countries;</I> they 
 will not know, or in a little while will have forgotten, that we are 
 Jews, and will allow us the same privileges with their own countrymen.' 
 Tell them," says God, "that this project shall <I>never prosper.</I> 
 Either their neighbours will not admit them to join with them in their 
 worship, or, if they do, will think never the better, but the worse, of 
 them for it, and will look upon them as dissemblers, and not fit to be 
 trusted, who are thus false to their God, and put a cheat upon their 
 neighbours." Note, There is nothing got by sinful compliances; and the 
 carnal projects of hypocrites will stand them in no stead. It is only 
 integrity and uprightness that will preserve men, and recommend them to 
 God and man.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>33  <I>As</I> I live, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, surely with a mighty hand,
 and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I
 rule over you:
 &nbsp; 34  And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather
 you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty
 hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.
 &nbsp; 35  And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and
 there will I plead with you face to face.
 &nbsp; 36  Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the
 land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 37  And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring
 you into the bond of the covenant:
 &nbsp; 38  And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them
 that transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the
 country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the
 land of Israel: and ye shall know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 39  As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Go
 ye, serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter <I>also,</I> if ye
 will not hearken unto me: but pollute ye my holy name no more
 with your gifts, and with your idols.
 &nbsp; 40  For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of
 Israel, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, there shall all the house of Israel,
 all of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and
 there will I require your offerings, and the first-fruits of your
 oblations, with all your holy things.
 &nbsp; 41  I will accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you
 out from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein
 ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before
 the heathen.
 &nbsp; 42  And ye shall know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, when I shall bring
 you into the land of Israel, into the country <I>for</I> the which I
 lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers.
 &nbsp; 43  And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings,
 wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall loathe yourselves in
 your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed.
 &nbsp; 44  And ye shall know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, when I have wrought
 with you for my name's sake, not according to your wicked ways,
 nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith
 the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The design which was now on foot among the elders of Israel was that 
 the people of Israel, being scattered among the nations, should lay 
 aside all their peculiarities and conform to those among whom they 
 lived; but God had told them that the design should not take effect, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 Now, in these verses, he shows particularly how it should be 
 frustrated. They aimed at the <I>mingling</I> of the families of 
 <I>Israel with the families of the countries;</I> but it will prove in 
 the issue that the wicked Israelites, notwithstanding their 
 compliances, shall not mingle with them in their prosperity, but shall 
 be distinguished from them for destruction; for idolatrous Israelites, 
 that are apostates from God, shall be sooner and more sorely punished 
 than idolatrous Babylonians that never knew the way of righteousness.
 Read and tremble at the doom here passed upon them; it is backed with 
 an oath not to be reversed: <I>As I live, saith the Lord God,</I> thus 
 and thus will I deal with you. They think to make both Jerusalem and 
 Babylon their friends by halting between two; but God threatens that 
 neither of them shall serve for a rest or refuge for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Babylon shall not protect them, nor any of the countries of the 
 heathen; for God will cast them out of his protection and then what 
 prince, what people, what place, can serve to be a sanctuary to them? 
 God was Israel's King of old, and had they continued his loyal subjects 
 he would have <I>ruled over them</I> with care and tenderness for their 
 good, but now <I>with a stretched-out arm, and with fury poured out, 
 will I rule over them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 That power which should have been exerted fore their protection shall 
 be exerted for their destruction. Note, There is no shaking off God's
 dominion; rule he will, either with the golden sceptre or with the iron 
 rod; and those that will not yield to the power of his grace shall be 
 made to sink under the power of his wrath. Now when God is angry with 
 them, though they may think that they shall be lost in the crowd of the 
 heathen among whom they are scattered, they will be disappointed; for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>)

 <I>I will gather you out of the countries wherein you are
 scattered,</I> as, when the rebels are dispersed in battle, those that 
 have escaped the sword of war are pursued and brought together out of 
 all the places whither they were scattered, to be punished by the sword 
 of justice. They shall be brought <I>into the wilderness of the 
 people</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>),

 either into Babylon, which is called a <I>wilderness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+19:13"><I>ch.</I> xix. 13</A>),

 and the <I>desert of the sea</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:1">Isa. xxi. 1</A>),

 or into some place which, though full of people, shall be to them as
 the wilderness was to Israel after they came out of Egypt, a place 
 where God will <I>plead with them face to face,</I> as he <I>pleaded 
 with their fathers in the wilderness of Egypt</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>),--

 where their carcases shall fall and where he will swear concerning them 
 that they shall never return to Canaan, as he did swear concerning 
 their fathers that they should never come into Canaan,--where he will 
 avenge the breach of his law with as much terror as that with which he 
 gave it in the wilderness of Sinai. Note, God has a good action against 
 apostates, and will find not only time, but a proper place, to plead 
 with them in upon that action, a wilderness even in the midst of the 
 people for that purpose.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Israel shall be no more able to protect them than Babylon could; 
 nor shall their relation to God's people stand them in any more stead 
 for the other world than their compliance with idolaters shall for this 
 world; nor shall they stand <I>in the congregation of the righteous</I> 
 any more than in the congregation of evil-doers; for there will come a 
 distinguishing day, when God will separate between the precious and the 
 vile; he will <I>cause them,</I> as the shepherd causes his sheep, to 
 <I>pass under the rod,</I> when he tithes them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+27:32">Lev. xxvii. 32</A>),

 that he may mark which is for God. God will take particular notice of 
 each of them, one by one, as sheep are counted, and <I>he will bring 
 them into the bond of the covenant</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>);

 he will try them and judge of them according to the tenour of the 
 covenant, and the difference made between some and others by the 
 blessings and curses of the covenant. Or it may refer to those among 
 them that repented and reformed; he will cause them to pass under the 
 rod of affliction, and, having done them good by it, he will bring them 
 again <I>into the bond of the covenant,</I> will be to them a God in 
 covenant, and use them again as <I>heirs of promise.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He will separate the wicked from among them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>):

 "<I>I will purge out from among you the rebels,</I> who have been a 
 grief and scandal to you, and who have by their rebellions brought all 
 these calamities upon you." The judgments of God shall find them out, 
 and their naming the name of Israel shall be no shelter to them. They 
 shall be <I>brought out of the countries where they sojourn,</I> and 
 shall not have that rest in them which they promised themselves. But 
 they <I>shall not enter into the land of Israel,</I> nor enjoy the 
 benefit of that rest which God has promised to his people. Note, Though 
 godly people may share with the wicked in the calamities of the world, 
 yet wicked people shall have no share with the godly in the heavenly 
 Canaan; but it shall be part of the blessedness of that world that they 
 shall be <I>purged out from among them,</I> the tares from the wheat, 
 the chaff from the corn,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:9"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 9</A>.

 But wherever these idolaters of <I>the house of Israel</I> were
 contriving to worship both God and their idols, thinking to please 
 both, God here protests against it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>),

 as Elijah had done in his name: "<I>If the Lord be God, then follow 
 him, but, if Baal, then follow him;</I> if you will serve your idols, 
 do, and take what comes of it; but then do not pretend relation to God 
 and a religious regard to him, nor <I>pollute his holy name with your 
 gifts</I> at his altar." Spiritual judgments are the sorest judgments. 
 Two of that kind of judgments are threatened in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:39">this verse</A>

 against those that were for dividing between the God of Israel and the 
 gods of the nations:--

 (1.) That they should be given up to the service of their idols. To 
 them he said ironically, "<I>Since you will not hearken unto me, go 
 you, serve every one his idols,</I> now that you think it will be for 
 your interest, <I>and hereafter also.</I> You shall go on in it. 
 <I>Ephraim is joined to idols, let him alone;</I> let him take his 
 course, and see what he will get by it at last." Note, Those who think 
 to serve themselves by sin will find in the end that they have but 
 enslaved themselves to sin. 

 (2.) That they should be cut off from the service of God and communion 
 with God: "You <I>shall not pollute my holy name</I> with your <I>vain 
 oblations,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:11">Isa. i. 11</A>.

 You bring your gifts in your hands, wherewith you pretend to honour me,
 but at the same time you bring your idols in your hearts, and therefore 
 you do but pollute me, which I will not suffer any more," 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:21,22">Amos v. 21, 22</A>.

 Note, Those are justly forbidden God's house that profane his
 house.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He will separate them to himself again.

 (1.) He will <I>gather them</I> in mercy <I>out of the countries 
 whither they were scattered,</I> to be monuments of mercy, as the 
 incorrigible were gathered to be vessels of wrath,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>.

 Not one of God's jewels shall be lost in the lumber of this world. 

 (2.) He will <I>bring them to the land of Israel,</I> which he had 
 promised to <I>give to their fathers;</I> and the discontinuance of 
 their possession shall be no defeasance of their right; it is the 
 <I>land of Israel</I> still, and thither God will bring them safely 
 again,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.
 
 (3.) He will re-establish his ordinances among them, will set up his 
 sanctuary in his holy mountain, which is here called <I>the mountain of 
 the height of Israel;</I> for, though the Mount Zion was none of the 
 highest mountains, yet the temple there was one of the highest honours 
 of Israel. It is promised that those who preserved their integrity, and 
 would not serve idols, in other lands, shall return to their prosperity 
 and shall serve the true God in their own land: <I>All of them in the 
 land shall serve me.</I> Note, It is the true happiness of a people, 
 and a sure token for good to them, when there is a prevailing 
 disposition in them to serve God. Whereas God had forbidden the 
 idolaters to bring their gifts to his altar, of these he will 
 <I>require offerings and first-fruits,</I> and will accept them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.
 
 What he does not require he will not accept, but what is done with a 
 regard to his precepts he will be well pleased with. He will <I>accept
 them with their sweet savour,</I> or <I>savour of rest</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>),

 as being very grateful to him and what he takes a complacency in; 
 whereas, to hypocritical worshippers, he says, <I>I will not smell in 
 your solemn assemblies.</I> 

 (4.) He will give them true repentance for their sins,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>.

 When they find how gracious God is to them they will be overcome with 
 his kindness, and blush to think of their bad behaviour towards so 
 <I>good a God:</I> "There, in <I>my holy mountain,</I> when you come to 
 enjoy the privileges of that again, <I>there</I> shall you <I>remember 
 your doings,</I> wherein you have been defiled." Note, The more 
 conversant we are with God's holiness the more we shall see of the 
 odious nature of sin. There <I>you shall loathe yourselves in your own 
 sight.</I> Note, Ingenuous evangelical repentance makes people loathe 
 themselves for their sins, as 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+42:5,6">Job xlii. 5, 6</A>.

 (5.) He will give them the knowledge of himself: <I>They shall know</I> 
 by experience that <I>he is the Lord,</I> that he is a God of almighty 
 power and inexhaustible goodness, kind to his people and faithful to 
 his covenant with them. Note, All the favours we receive from God
 should lead us into a more intimate acquaintance with him.

 (6.) He will do all this for his own name's sake, notwithstanding their 
 undeservings and ill-deservings

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>);

 he has <I>wrought with them,</I> that is, wrought for them, wrought in 
 favour of them, wrought in concurrence with them, they doing their 
 endeavour; he has wrought with them purely <I>for his name's sake.</I> 
 His reasons were all fetched from himself. Had he dealt with them 
 <I>according to their wicked ways and their corrupt doings,</I> though 
 they were the better and sounder part of the house of Israel, he would 
 have left them to be scattered and lost with the rest; but he recovered 
 and restored them for the sake of his own name, not only that it might 
 not be <I>polluted</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 but that he might be <I>sanctified in them before the heathen</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>),

 that he might <I>sanctify himself</I> (so the word is); for it is God's 
 work to glorify his own name. He will do well for his people that he 
 may have the glory of it, that he may manifest himself to be a God 
 pardoning sin and so keeping promise, that his people may praise him, 
 and that their neighbours may likewise take notice of him, as they did 
 when God <I>burned again their captivity,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+126:3">Ps. cxxvi. 3</A>.

 <I>Then said they among the heathen, The Lord has done great things for
 them.</I></P>

 &nbsp; 46  Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop <I>thy

 parables?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a prophecy of wrath against Judah and Jerusalem, which 
 would more fitly have begun the next chapter than conclude this; for it 
 has no dependence on what goes before, but that which follows in the 
 beginning of the next chapter is the explication of it, when the people 
 complained that this was a parable which they understood not. In this 
 parable, 

 1. It is a forest that is prophesied against, <I>the forest of the
 south field,</I> Judah and Jerusalem. These lay south from Babylon, 
 where Ezekiel now was, and therefore he is directed to <I>set his face 
 towards the south</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>),

 to intimate to them that God had set his face against them, was 
 displeased with them, and determined to destroy them. But, though it be 
 a message of wrath which he has to deliver, he must deliver it with 
 mildness and tenderness; he must <I>drop his word towards the 
 south;</I> his doctrine must <I>distil as the rain</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:2">Deut. xxxii. 2</A>),
 
 that people's hearts might be softened by it, as the earth by the
 <I>river of God,</I> which <I>drops upon the pastures of the 
 wilderness</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:12">Ps. lxv. 12</A>)

 and which a south land more especially calls for, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:19">Josh. xv. 19</A>.

 Judah and Jerusalem are called <I>forests,</I> not only because they
 had been full of people, as a wood of trees, but because they had been 
 empty of fruit, for fruit-trees grow not in a forest; and a forest is 
 put in opposition to a fruitful field,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:15">Isa. xxxii. 15</A>.

 Those that should have been as the garden of the Lord, and his
 vineyard, had become like a forest, all overgrown with <I>briers and 
 thorns;</I> and those that are so, that bring not forth the fruits of 
 righteousness, God's word prophesies against.

 2. It is a fire kindled in his forest that is prophesied of,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>.

 All those judgments which wasted and consumed both the city and the 
 country-sword, famine, pestilence, and captivity, are signified by this 
 fire. 

 (1.) It is a fire of God's own kindling: <I>I will kindle a fire in
 thee;</I> the <I>breath of the Lord</I> is not as a drop, but <I>as a 
 stream, of brimstone</I> to set it on fire, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:33">Isa. xxx. 33</A>.

 He that had been himself a protecting fire about Jerusalem is now a
 consuming fire in it. <I>All flesh shall see</I> by the fury of this 
 fire, and the desolations it shall make, especially when they compare 
 it with the sins which had made them fuel for this fire, that it is 
 <I>the Lord</I> that <I>has kindled it</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>),

 as a just avenger of his own injured honour.

 (2.) This conflagration shall be general: all orders and degrees of men 
 shall be devoured by it--young and old, rich and poor, high and low.
 Even <I>green trees,</I> which the fire does not easily fasten upon, 
 shall be devoured by this fire; even good people shall some of them be 
 involved in these calamities; and <I>if this be done in the green 
 trees, what shall be done in the dry?</I> The dry trees shall be as 
 tinder and touch-wood to this fire. <I>All faces</I> (that is, all that 
 covers the face of the earth) <I>from the south</I> of Canaan to the 
 north, from Beer-sheba to Dan, shall be <I>burnt therein.</I> 

 (3.) The fire <I>shall not be quenched;</I> no attempts to give check 
 to the dissolution shall prevail. When God will ruin a nation, who or 
 what can save it?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now observe, 

 1. The people's reflection upon the prophet on occasion of this
 discourse. They said, <I>Does he not speak parables?</I> This was the 
 language either of their ignorance or infidelity (the plainest truths 
 were as parables to them), or of their malice and ill-will to the 
 prophet. Note. It is common for those who will not be wrought upon by 
 the word to pick quarrels with it; it is either too plain or too 
 obscure, too fine or too homely, too common or too singular; something 
 or other is amiss in it. 

 2. The prophet's complaint to God: <I>Ah, Lord God! they say</I> so and
 so of me. Note, It is a comfort to us, when people speak ill of us
 unjustly, that we have a God to complain to.</P>
