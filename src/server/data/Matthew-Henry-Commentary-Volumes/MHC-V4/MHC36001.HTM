 After the title of the book 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:1">ver. 1</A>)
 
 here is,

 I. A threatening of the destruction of Judah and Jerusalem, an utter
 destruction, by the Chaldeans, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:2-4">ver. 2-4</A>.

 II. A charge against them for their gross sin, which provoked God to 
 bring that destruction upon them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:5,6">ver. 5, 6</A>);
 
 and so he goes on in the
 rest of the chapter, setting both the judgments before them, that they 
 might prevent them or prepare for them, and the sins that destroy them, 
 that they might judge themselves, and justify God in what was brought 
 upon them. 

 1. They must hold their peace because they had greatly sinned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:7-9">ver. 7-9</A>.
 
 But, 
 
 2, They shall howl because the trouble will be great. The day of
 the Lord is near, and it will be a terrible day, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:10-18">ver. 10-18</A>.

 Such fair and timely warning as this did God give to the Jews of the 
 approaching captivity; but they hardened their neck, which made their 
 destruction remediless.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 The word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> which came unto Zephaniah the son of
 Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of
 Hizkiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.
 &nbsp; 2 I will utterly consume all <I>things</I> from off the land, saith
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 3 I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the
 heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumbling-blocks with
 the wicked; and I will cut off man from off the land, saith the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 4 I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all
 the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of
 Baal from this place, <I>and</I> the name of the Chemarims with the
 priests;
 &nbsp; 5 And them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops;
 and them that worship <I>and</I> that swear by the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and that
 swear by Malcham;

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is,

 I. The title-page of this book 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 in which we observe, 

 1. What authority it has, and who gave it that authority; it is from
 heaven, and not of men: It is <I>the word of the Lord.</I> 

 2. Who was the instrument of conveying it to the church. His name was
 Zephaniah, which signifies the <I>servant of the Lord,</I> for God 
 <I>revealed his secrets to his servants the prophets.</I> The pedigree 
 of other prophets, whose extraction we have an account of, goes no 
 further back than their father, except Zecharias, whose grandfather 
 also is named. But this of Zephaniah goes back four generations, and
 the highest mentioned is <I>Hizkiah;</I> it is the very same name in 
 the original with that of Hezekiah king of Judah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:1">2 Kings xviii. 1</A>),

 and refers probably to him; if so, our prophet, being lineally
 descended from that pious prince, and being of the royal family, could 
 with the better grace reprove the folly of the king's children as he 
 does,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 3. When this prophet prophesied--<I>in the days of Josiah king of 
 Judah,</I> who reigned well, and in the twelfth year of his reign began 
 vigorously, and carried on a work of reformation, in which he destroyed 
 idols and idolatry. Now it does not appear whether Zephaniah prophesied 
 in the beginning of his reign; if so, we may suppose his prophesying 
 had a great and good influence on that reformation. When he, as God's 
 messenger, reproved the idolatries of Jerusalem, Josiah, as God's 
 vice-gerent, removed them; and reformation is likely to go on and 
 prosper when both magistrates and ministers do their part towards it.
 If it were towards the latter end of his reign that he prophesied, we 
 sadly see how a corrupt people relapse into their former distempers.
 The idolatries Josiah had abolished, it should seem, returned in his 
 own time, when the heat of the reformation began a little to abate and 
 wear off. What good can the best reformers do with a people that hate 
 to be reformed, as if they longed to be ruined?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The summary, or contents, of this book. The general proposition 
 contained in it is, That utter destruction is coming apace upon Judah 
 and Jerusalem for sin. Without preamble, or apology, he begins abruptly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>By taking away I will make an end of all things from off the face of 
 the land, Saith the Lord.</I> Ruin is coming, utter ruin, destruction 
 from the Almighty. He has said it who can, and will, make good what he 
 has said: "<I>I will utterly consume all things.</I> I will 
 <I>gather</I> all things" (so some); "I will recall all the blessings I 
 have bestowed, because they have abused them and so forfeited them." 
 The consumption determined shall take away, 

 1. The inferior creatures: <I>I will consume the beasts, the fowls of
 the heaven, and the fishes of the sea</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 as, in the deluge, <I>every living substance was destroyed that was 
 upon the face of the ground,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:23">Gen. vii. 23</A>.

 The creatures were made for man's use, and therefore when he has
 perverted the use of them, and made them <I>subject to vanity,</I> God, 
 to show the greatness of his displeasure against the sin of man, 
 involves them in his punishment. The expressions are figurative,
 denoting universal desolation. Those that fly ever so high, as the 
 fowls of heaven, and think themselves out of the reach of the enemies' 
 hand--those that hide ever so close, as the fishes of the sea, and 
 think themselves out of the reach of the enemies' eye--shall yet become 
 a prey to them, and be utterly consumed.

 2. The children of men: "<I>I will consume man; I will cut off man from
 the land.</I> The land shall be dispeopled and left uninhabited; I will
 destroy, not only Israel, but <I>man.</I> The land shall enjoy her
 sabbaths. I will cut off, not only the wicked men, but all men; even
 the few among them that are good shall be involved in this common
 calamity. Though they shall not be cut off from the Lord, yet they
 shall be <I>cut off from the land.</I>" It is with Judah and Jerusalem
 that God has this quarrel, both city and country, and upon them he will
 <I>stretch out his hand,</I> the hand of his power, the hand of his
 wrath; and <I>who knows the power of his anger?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Those that will not humble themselves under God's mighty hand shall be
 humbled and brought down by it. Note, Even Judah, where God is known, 
 and Jerusalem, where his dwelling-place is, if they revolt from him and 
 rebel against him, shall have his hand stretched out against them. 

 3. All wicked people, and all those things that are the matter of
 their wickedness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>I will consume the stumbling-blocks with the wicked,</I> the idols 
 with the idolaters, the offences with the offenders." Josiah had taken 
 away the stumbling-blocks, and, as far as he could, had purged the land 
 of the monuments of idolatry, hoping that there would be no more 
 idolatry; but <I>the wicked will do wickedly,</I> the dog will return 
 to his vomit, and therefore, since the sin will not otherwise be cured, 
 the sinners must themselves be consumed, even the <I>wicked with the 
 stumbling-blocks</I> of their iniquity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:3">Ezek. xiv. 3</A>.

 Since it was not done by the sword of justice, it shall be done by the
 sword of war. See who the sinners are that shall be consumed.

 (1.) The professed idolaters, who avowed idolatry, and were wedded to 
 it. The <I>remnant of Baal</I> shall be <I>cut off,</I> the images of 
 Baal, and the worshippers of those images. Josiah cut off a great deal 
 of Baal; but that which was so close as to escape the eye, or so bold 
 as to escape the hand, of his justice, God will cut off, even all the 
 remains of it. The Chaldeans would spare none of the images of Baal,
 or the worshippers of those images. The <I>Chemarim</I> shall be <I>cut 
 off;</I> we read of them in the history of Josiah's reformation. 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:5">2 Kings xxiii. 5</A>,

 <I>He put down the idolatrous priests:</I> the word is the
 <I>Chemarim.</I> The word signifies <I>black men,</I> some think 
 because they wore black clothes, affecting to appear grave, others 
 because their faces were black with attending the altars, or the fires 
 in which they burnt their children to Moloch. They seem to have been 
 immediate attendants upon the service of Baal. They shall be <I>cut off 
 with the priests,</I> the regulars with the seculars. The very name of 
 them shall be cut off; the order shall be quite abolished, so as to be 
 forgotten, or remembered with detestation. And, among other idolaters, 
 the <I>worshippers of the host of heaven upon the house-tops</I> shall 
 be cut off

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 who justified themselves in their idolatry with those that did not 
 worship images, the work of their own hands, but offered their 
 sacrifices and burnt their incense to the sun, moon, and stars, 
 immediately upon the tops of their houses. But God will let them know
 that he is a jealous God, and will not endure any rival; and, though 
 some have thought that the most specious and plausible idolatry, yet it 
 will appear as great an offence to God to give divine honours to a star 
 as to give them to a stone or a stock. Even the worshippers of the
 host of heaven shall be consumed as well as the worshippers of the 
 beasts of the earth or the fiends of hell. The sin of the adulteress is 
 not the less sinful for the gaiety of the adulterer. 

 (2.) Those also shall be consumed that think to compound the matter 
 between God and idols, and keep an even hand between them, that halt 
 between God and Baal, and worship between Jehovah and Moloch, and 
 <I>swear by both;</I> or, as it might better be read, swear <I>to the 
 Lord and to Malcham.</I> They bind themselves by oath and covenant to 
 the service both of God and idols. They have a good opinion of the 
 worship of the God of Israel; it is the religion of their country, and 
 has been long so, and therefore they will by no means quit it; but they 
 think it will be very much improved and beautified if they join with it 
 the worship of Moloch, for that also is much used in other countries, 
 and travellers admire it; there is a great deal of good fancy and 
 strong flame in it. They cannot keep always to the worship of a God 
 whom they have no visible representation of, and therefore they must 
 have an image; and what better than the image of <I>Moloch--a king?</I> 
 They think they shall effectually atone for their sin if they <I>swear 
 to Moloch,</I> and, pursuant to that oath, burn their children in 
 sacrifice to that idol; and yet, if they do amiss in that, they hope to 
 atone for it in worshipping the God of Israel too. Note, Those that 
 think to divide their affections and adorations between God and idols 
 will not only come short of acceptance with God, but will have their 
 doom with the worst of idolaters; for what communion can there be 
 between light and darkness, Christ and Belial, God and mammon? She 
 whose own the child is not pleads for the dividing of it, for, if Satan 
 have half, he will have all; but the true mother says, <I>Divide it 
 not,</I> for, if God have but half, he will have none. Such waters will 
 not be long sweet, if they come from a fountain that sends forth bitter 
 water too; what have those to do to swear by the Lord that swear by 
 Malcham? 

 (3.) Those also shall be consumed that have apostatized from God, 
 together with those that never gave up their names to him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 I will cut off, 

 [1.] Those <I>that are turned back from the Lord,</I> that were well 
 taught, and began well, that had given up their names to him, and set 
 out at first in the worship of him, but have flown off, and turned 
 aside, and fallen in with idolaters, and deserted those good ways of 
 God which they were brought up in, and despised them. Those God will be 
 sure to reckon with who are renegadoes from his service, who began in 
 the Spirit and ended in the flesh; they shall be treated as deserters, 
 to whom no mercy is shown. 

 [2.] Those that <I>have not sought the Lord,</I> nor ever <I>enquired 
 for him,</I> never made any profession of religion, and think to excuse 
 themselves with that, shall find that this will not excuse them; nay, 
 this is the thing laid to their charge; they are atheistical careless 
 people, that <I>live without God in the world;</I> and those that do so 
 are certainly unworthy to live upon God in the world.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7 Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>: for the day
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> at hand: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath prepared a sacrifice,
 he hath bid his guests.
 &nbsp; 8 And it shall come to pass in the day of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s sacrifice,
 that I will punish the princes, and the king's children, and all
 such as are clothed with strange apparel.
 &nbsp; 9 In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the
 threshold, which fill their masters' houses with violence and
 deceit.
 &nbsp; 10 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>that
 there shall be</I> the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and an
 howling from the second, and a great crashing from the hills.
 &nbsp; 11 Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people
 are cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off.
 &nbsp; 12 And it shall come to pass at that time, <I>that</I> I will search
 Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on
 their lees: that say in their heart, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will not do good,
 neither will he do evil.
 &nbsp; 13 Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses
 a desolation: they shall also build houses, but not inhabit
 <I>them;</I> and they shall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine
 thereof.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Notice is here given to Judah and Jerusalem that God is coming forth 
 against them, and will be with them shortly; his <I>presence,</I> as a 
 just avenger, <I>his day,</I> the day of his judgment and his wrath, 
 are not far off, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Those that improve not the presence of God with them as a Father, but 
 sin away that presence, may expect his presence with them as a Judge, 
 to call them to an account for the contempt put upon his grace. The 
 <I>day of the Lord</I> will come. Men have their day now, when they 
 take a liberty to do what they please; but <I>God's day is at hand;</I> 
 it is here called his <I>sacrifice,</I> a sacrifice of his preparing, 
 for the punishing of presumptuous sinners is a sacrifice to the justice 
 of God, some reparation to his injured honour. Those that brought
 their offerings to other gods were themselves justly made victims to 
 the true God. On a day of sacrifice great slaughter was made; so shall 
 there be in Jerusalem; men shall be killed up as fast as lambs for the 
 altar, with as little regret, with as much pleasure: <I>The slain of 
 the Lord shall be many.</I> On a day of sacrifice great feasts were 
 made upon the sacrifices; so the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem 
 shall be feasted upon by their enemies the Chaldeans; these are the 
 guests God has prepared and invited to come and glut themselves--their 
 revenge with slaughter and their covetousness with plunder. Now 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Who those are that are marked to be sacrificed, that shall be 
 visited and punished in this day of reckoning, and what it is they 
 shall be called to an account for. 

 1. The royal family, because of the dignity of their place, shall be
 first reckoned with for their pride, and vanity, and affectation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>I will punish the princes, and the king's children,</I> who think 
 themselves accountable to God, and that, high as they are, he is above 
 them. They shall be punished, and all such as, like them, are clothed 
 <I>with strange apparel,</I> such as, in contempt of their own country 
 (where, probably, it was the custom to go in a very plain dress, as 
 became the seed of Jacob that <I>plain man</I>), affected to appear in 
 the fashion of other nations and introduced their modes in apparel, 
 studying to resemble those from whom God had appointed them, even in 
 their clothes, industriously to distinguish themselves. <I>The princes 
 and the king's children</I> scorned to wear any home-made stuffs, 
 though God had provided them <I>fine linen</I> and <I>silks</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:10">Ezek. xvi. 10</A>),

 but they must send abroad to strange countries for their clothes, which
 would not please unless they were far-fetched and dear-bought; and even 
 those of inferior rank affected to imitate the princes and the king's 
 children. Pride in apparel is displeasing to God, and a symptom of the
 degeneracy of a people.

 2. The noblemen, and their stewards and servants, come next to be 
 reckoned with 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>In the same day will I punish those that leap on the threshold,</I> 
 a phrase, no doubt, well understood then, and which probably signified 
 the invading of their neighbour's rights. Entering their houses by
 force and violence, and seizing their possessions, they <I>leap on the 
 threshold,</I> as much as to say that the house is their own and they 
 will keep their hold of it; and, accordingly, they make all in it their 
 own that they can lay their hands on, and so <I>fill their masters' 
 houses</I> with goods gotten <I>by violence and deceit</I> and with all 
 the guilt thereby contracted. Nor shall it suffice them to say that the 
 ill-gotten gains were not for themselves but for their masters, and 
 that what they did was by their order; for the obligations we lie under 
 to keep God's commandments are prior and superior to the obligations we 
 lie under to serve the interests of any master on earth. 

 3. The trading people, and the rich merchants, are next called to
 account. Iniquity is found in their end of the town, among <I>the 
 inhabitants of Maktesh,</I> a low part of Jerusalem, deep like a mortar 
 (for so the word signifies); the <I>goldsmiths</I> lived there

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+3:32">Neh. iii. 32</A>)

 and the merchants; and they are now <I>cut down</I> (they are broken,
 and have shut up their shops, and become bankrupts); nay, <I>All those 
 that bear silver are cut off,</I> in the first place, by the invaders, 
 for the sake of the silver they carry, which is so far from being a 
 protection to them that it will expose and betray them. The conquerors 
 aimed at the wealthy men, and carried them off first, while <I>the poor 
 of the land escaped.</I> Or it may be meant of a general decay of 
 trade, which was a preface and introduction to the general destruction 
 of the land. It is the token of a declining state when great dealers
 are cut down, and great bankers are cut off and become bankrupts, who 
 cannot fall alone, but with themselves ruin many. 

 4. All the secure and careless people, the sons of pleasure, that live
 a loose idle life, are next reckoned with

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 they come from all parts of the country, to take up their quarters in 
 the head-quarters of the kingdom, where they take private lodgings, and 
 indulge themselves in ease and luxury; but God will find them out, and 
 punish them: <I>At that time I will search Jerusalem with candles,</I> 
 to discover them, that they may be brought out to condign punishment. 
 This intimates that they conceal themselves, as being either ashamed of 
 the sin or afraid of the punishment of it; when the judgments of God 
 are abroad they hope to escape by absconding and getting out of the 
 way, but God will <I>search Jerusalem,</I> as search is made for a 
 malefactor in disguise, that is harboured by his accomplices. God's 
 hand will <I>find out all his enemies,</I> wherever they lie hid, and 
 will punish not only the secret idolaters, but the secret epicures and 
 profane; and those are the persons that are here described, and marks 
 are given by which they will be discovered when strict search is made 
 for them. 

 (1.) Their dispositions are sensual: They <I>are settled on their 
 lees,</I> intoxicated with their pleasures, strengthening themselves in 
 their wealth and wickedness; they are secure and easy, and, because 
 they have had no changes, they fear none, as Moab, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:11">Jer. xlviii. 11</A>.

 They <I>have not been emptied from vessel to vessel.</I> They <I>fill
 themselves with wine and strong drink,</I> and banish all thought,
 saying, <I>To-morrow shall be as this day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:12">Isa. lvi. 12</A>.

 Their being <I>settled on their lees</I> signifies the same with being
 <I>enclosed in their own fat,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:10">Ps. xvii. 10</A>.

 (2.) Their notions are atheistical. They could not live such loose
 lives but that they say <I>in their heart, The Lord will not do good, 
 neither will he do evil;</I> that is, <I>He will do nothing.</I> They 
 deny his providential government of the world: "What good and evil 
 there is in the world comes by the wheel of fortune, and not by the 
 disposal of a wise and supreme director." They deny his moral 
 government, and his dispensing rewards and punishments: "<I>The Lord 
 will not do good</I> to those that serve him, nor <I>do evil</I> to 
 those that rebel against him; and therefore there is nothing got by 
 religion, nor lost by sin." This was the effect of their sensuality; if 
 they were not drowned in sense, they could not be thus senseless, nor 
 could they be so stupid if they had not stupefied themselves with the 
 love of pleasure. It was also the cause of their sensuality; men would 
 not make a god of their belly if they had not at first become so vain, 
 so vile, in their imaginations, as to think the God that made them 
 <I>altogether such a one as themselves.</I> But God will <I>punish 
 them; their end is destruction,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:19">Phil. iii. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What the destruction will be with which God will punish these 
 sinners, and what course he will take with them. 

 1. He will silence them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord.</I> He will force them 
 to hold their peace, will strike them dumb with horror and amazement. 
 They shall be speechless. All the excuses of their sin, and exceptions 
 against the sentence, will be overruled, and they shall not have a word 
 to say for themselves. 

 2. He will <I>sacrifice</I> them, for it is <I>the day of the Lord's 
 sacrifice</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 he will give them into the hands of their enemies, and glorify himself 
 thereby. 
 
 3. He will fill both city and country with lamentation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>In that day there shall be a noise of a cry from the fish-gate,</I> 
 so called because near either to the fish-ponds or to the fish-market. 
 It belonged to the city of David 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+33:14,Ne+3:3">2 Chron. xxxiii. 14; Neh. iii. 3</A>);

 perhaps the same with that which is called the <I>first gate</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:10">Zech. xiv. 10</A>),

 and, if so, it will explain what follows here, <I>And a howling from
 the second,</I> that is, the second gate, which was next to that 
 <I>fish-gate.</I> The alarm shall go round the walls of Jerusalem from 
 gate to gate; and there shall be <I>a great crashing from the 
 hills,</I> a mighty noise from the mountains round about Jerusalem, 
 from the acclamations of the victorious invaders, or from the 
 lamentations of the timorous invaded, or from both. The inhabitants of 
 the city, even of the closest safest part of the city, shall 
 <I>howl</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 so clamorous shall the grief be. 

 4. They shall be stripped of all they have; it shall be a prey to the 
 enemy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Their household goods,</I> and <I>shop-goods,</I> shall <I>become a 
 booty,</I> and a rich booty they shall be; <I>their houses shall be</I> 
 levelled with the ground and be <I>a desolation;</I> those of them that 
 have <I>built</I> new houses <I>shall not inherit them,</I> but the 
 invaders shall get and keep possession of them. And the 
 <I>vineyards</I> they have planted they shall not <I>drink the wine 
 of,</I> but, instead of having it for the relief of their friends that 
 faint among them, they shall part with it for the animating of their 
 foes that fight against them,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14 The great day of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> near, <I>it is</I> near, and
 hasteth greatly, <I>even</I> the voice of the day of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: the
 mighty man shall cry there bitterly.
 &nbsp; 15 That day <I>is</I> a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress,
 a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and
 gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness,
 &nbsp; 16 A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities,
 and against the high towers.
 &nbsp; 17 And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk
 like blind men, because they have sinned against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and
 their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the
 dung.
 &nbsp; 18 Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver
 them in the day of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s wrath; but the whole land shall be
 devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he shall make even a
 speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Nothing could be expressed with more spirit and life, nor in words more 
 proper to startle and awaken a secure and careless people, than the 
 warning here given to Judah and Jerusalem of the approaching 
 destruction by the Chaldeans. That is enough to make the sinners in 
 Zion tremble--that it is <I>the day of the Lord,</I> the day in which he
 will manifest himself by taking vengeance on them. It is <I>the great 
 day of the Lord,</I> a specimen of the day of judgment, a kind of 
 doom's-day, as the last destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans is 
 represented to be in our Saviour's prediction concerning it, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:27">Matt. xxiv. 27</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. This <I>day of the Lord</I> is here spoken of as very near. The 
 vision is not <I>for a great while to come,</I> as those imagine who 
 <I>put the evil day far from them.</I> Those deceive themselves who 
 look upon it as a thing at a distance, for <I>it is near--it is near--it
 hastens greatly.</I> The prophet gives the alarm like one that is in 
 earnest, like one that awakens a family with the cry of <I>Fire! 
 fire!</I> when it is at the next door that the danger is: "<I>It is 
 near! it is near!</I> and therefore it is high time to bestir 
 yourselves, and do what you can for your own safety before it be too 
 late." It is madness for those to slumber whose <I>damnation slumbers 
 not,</I> and to linger when it hastens.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It is spoken of as a very dreadful day. The very <I>voice</I> of 
 this <I>day of the Lord,</I> the noise of it, when it is coming, shall 
 be so terrible as to make <I>the mighty men cry there bitterly,</I> cry 
 for fear as children do. <I>It shall be a vexation</I> to <I>hear the 
 report</I> of it. In the last great day of the Lord the mighty men 
 shall cry bitterly to rocks and mountains to shelter them; but in vain. 
 Observe how emphatically the prophet speaks of this day approaching 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 It is <I>a day of wrath,</I> God's wrath, wrath in perfection, wrath to 
 the utmost. It will be a day of <I>trouble and distress</I> to the 
 sinners; they shall be in pain, and shall see no ways of easing or 
 helping themselves. The miseries of the damned are summed up (perhaps 
 with reference to this) in the <I>indignation and wrath of God,</I> 
 which are the cause, and the <I>tribulation and anguish</I> of the 
 sinner's <I>soul,</I> which are the effect, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:8,9">Rom. ii. 8, 9</A>.

 It will be a day of <I>trouble and distress</I> to the inhabitants, and
 a day of <I>wasteness and desolation</I> to the whole land; that 
 fruitful land shall be turned into a wilderness. It shall be <I>a day 
 of darkness and gloominess;</I> every thing shall look dismal, and 
 there shall not be the least gleam of comfort, or glimpse of hope; look 
 round, and it is all black. It is <I>a day of clouds and thick 
 darkness;</I> there is not only nothing encouraging, but every thing 
 threatening; the thick clouds are big with storms and tempests.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. It is spoken of as a destroying day, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 It shall be destroying, 

 1. To places, even the strongest and best fortified: <I>A day of the 
 trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities,</I> to break into them, 
 and against the <I>high towers,</I> to bring them down; for what forts, 
 what fences, can hold out against the wrath of God? 
 
 2. To persons

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 "<I>I will bring distress upon men,</I> the strongest and stoutest of 
 men; their hearts and hands shall fail them; they shall <I>walk like 
 blind men,</I> wandering endlessly, <I>because they have sinned against 
 the Lord.</I>" Note, Those that walk as bad men will justly be left to 
 walk as blind men, always in the dark, in doubt and danger, without any 
 guide or comfort, and falling at length into the ditch. Because they 
 have <I>sinned against the Lord</I> he will deliver them into the hands 
 of cruel enemies, that shall <I>pour out their blood as dust,</I> so 
 profusely, and with as little regret, and <I>their flesh</I> shall be 
 thrown <I>as dung</I> upon the dunghill.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The destruction of that day will be unavoidable and universal,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 1. There shall be no escaping it by ransom: <I>Neither their silver nor
 their gold,</I> which they have hoarded up so covetously against the
 evil day, or which they have spent so prodigally to make friends for
 such a time, <I>shall be able to deliver them in the day of the Lord's
 wrath.</I> Another prophet borrowed these words from this, with
 reference to the same event, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:19">Ezek. vii. 19</A>.

 Note, Riches profit not in the day of wrath,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+11:4">Prov. xi. 4</A>.

 Nay, riches expose to the wrath of men 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:13">Eccl. v. 13.</A>),

 and riches abused to the wrath of God. 

 2. There shall be no escaping it by flight or concealment; for the 
 <I>whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy,</I> and 
 where then can a hiding-place be found? See what the fire of God's 
 jealousy is, and what the force of it; it will devour whole lands; how 
 then can particular persons stand before it? He shall make riddance, 
 <I>a speedy riddance, of all those that dwell in the land,</I> as the 
 husbandman, when he rids his ground, cuts up all the briers and thorns 
 for the fire. Note, Sometimes the judgments of God make riddance, even
 utter riddance, with sinful nations, a speedy riddance; their
 destruction is effected, is completed, in a little time. Let not
 sinners be laid asleep by the patience of God, for when the measure of
 their iniquity is full his justice will both overtake and overcome,
 will make quick work and thorough work.</P>
