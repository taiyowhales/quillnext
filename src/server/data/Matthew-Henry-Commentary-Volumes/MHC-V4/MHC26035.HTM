 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It was promised, in the foregoing chapter, that when the time to favour 
 Zion, yea, the set time, should come, especially the time for sending 
 the Messiah and setting up his kingdom in the world, God would cause 
 the enemies of his church to cease and the blessings and comforts of 
 the church to abound. This chapter enlarges upon the former promise, 
 concerning the destruction of the enemies of the church; the next 
 chapter upon the latter promise, the replenishing of the church with 
 blessings. Mount Seir (that is, Edom) is the enemy prophesied against 
 in this chapter, but fitly put here, as in the prophecy of Obadiah, for 
 all the enemies of the church; for, as those all walked in the way of 
 Cain that hated Abel, so those all walked in the way of Esau who hated 
 Jacob, but over whom Jacob, by virtue of a particular blessing, was to 
 have dominion. Now here we have, 

 I. The sin charged upon the Edomites, and that was their spite and
 malice to Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+35:5,10-13">ver. 5, 10-13</A>.

 II. The ruin threatened, that should come upon them for this sin. God
 will be against them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+35:3">ver. 3</A>)

 and then their country shall be laid waste

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+35:4">ver. 4</A>),

 depopulated, and made quite desolate

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+35:6-9">ver. 6-9</A>),

 and left so when other nations that had been wasted should recover
 themselves,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+35:14,15">ver. 14, 15</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Moreover the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy
 against it,
 &nbsp; 3  And say unto it, Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Behold, O mount
 Seir, I <I>am</I> against thee, and I will stretch out mine hand
 against thee, and I will make thee most desolate.
 &nbsp; 4  I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and
 thou shalt know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 5  Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed <I>the
 blood of</I> the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the
 time of their calamity, in the time <I>that their</I> iniquity <I>had</I>
 an end:
 &nbsp; 6  Therefore, <I>as</I> I live, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, I will prepare
 thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not
 hated blood, even blood shall pursue thee.
 &nbsp; 7  Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from
 it him that passeth out and him that returneth.
 &nbsp; 8  And I will fill his mountains with his slain <I>men:</I> in thy
 hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they fall
 that are slain with the sword.
 &nbsp; 9  I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall
 not return: and ye shall know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Mount Seir was mentioned as partner with Moab in one of the 
 threatenings we had before 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:8"><I>ch.</I> xxv. 8</A>);

 but here it is convicted and condemned by itself, and has woes of its
 own. The prophet must boldly <I>set his face against Edom,</I> and 
 <I>prophesy</I> particularly <I>against it;</I> for the God of Israel 
 has said, <I>O Mount Seir! I am against thee.</I> Note, Those that have 
 God against them have the word of God against them, and the face of his 
 ministers, nor dare they prophesy any good to them, but evil. The 
 prophet must tell the Edomites that God has a controversy with them, 
 and let them know,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What is the cause and ground of that controversy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+35:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 God espouses his people's cause, and will plead it, takes what is done 
 against them as done against himself, and will reckon for it; and it is 
 upon their account that God now contends with the Edomites. 

 1. Because of the enmity they had against the people of God, that was
 rooted in the heart. "Thou hast had a <I>perpetual hatred</I> to them, 
 to the very name of an Israelite." The Edomites kept up an 
 <I>hereditary</I> malice against Israel, the same that Esau bore to 
 Jacob, because he got the birth-right and the blessing. Esau had been 
 reconciled to Jacob, had embraced and kissed him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+33:1-20">Gen. xxxiii.</A>),

 and we do not find that ever he quarrelled with him again. But the
 posterity of Esau would never be reconciled to the seed of Jacob, but 
 hated them with a perpetual hatred. Note, Children will be more apt to 
 imitate the vices than the virtues of their parents, and to tread in 
 the steps of their sin than in the steps of their repentance. Parents 
 should therefore be careful not to set their children any bad example, 
 for though, through the grace of God, they may return, and prevent the 
 mischief of what they have done amiss to themselves, they may not be 
 able to obviate the bad influence of it upon their children. It is 
 strange how deeply rooted national antipathies sometimes are, and how 
 long they last; but it is not to be wondered at that profane Edomites 
 hate pious Israelites, since the old <I>enmity</I> that was put between 
 the <I>seed of the woman</I> and the seed of the serpent

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:15">Gen. iii. 15</A>)
 
 will continue to the end. <I>Marvel not if the world hate you.</I>

 2. Because of the injuries they had done to the people of God. They
 <I>shed their blood by the force of the sword, in the time of their 
 calamity;</I> they did not attack them as fair and open enemies, but 
 laid wait for them, to <I>cut off</I> those of them that had escaped

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:14">Obad. 14</A>),

 or they drove them back upon the sword of the pursuers, by which they
 fell. It was cowardly, as well as barbarous, to take advantage of their 
 distress; and for neighbours, with whom they had lived peaceably, to 
 <I>smite them secretly</I> when strangers openly invaded them. It was 
 in the time <I>that their iniquity had an end,</I> when the measure of 
 it was full and destruction came. Note, Even those that suffer justly, 
 and for their sins, are yet to be pitied and not trampled upon. If the 
 father corrects one child, he expects the rest should tremble at it, 
 not triumph in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What should be the effect and issue of that controversy. If God 
 stretch out his hand against the country of Edom, he will <I>make it 
 most desolate,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+35:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 <I>Desolation and desolation.</I> 

 1. The inhabitants shall be slain with the sword

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+35:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>I will prepare thee unto blood.</I> Edom shall be gradually 
 weakened, and so be the more easily conquered, and the enemy shall 
 gather strength the more effectually to subdue it. Thus preparation is 
 in the making a great while before for this destruction. <I>Thou hast
 not hated blood;</I> it implies, "Thou hast delighted in it and 
 thirsted after it." Those that do not keep up a rooted hatred of sin, 
 when a temptation to it is very strong, will be in danger of yielding 
 to it. Some read it, "<I>Unless thou hatest blood</I>" (that is, 
 "unless thou dost repent, and put off this bloody disposition) <I>blood 
 shall pursue thee.</I>" And then it is an intimation that the judgment 
 may yet be prevented by a thorough reformation. <I>If he turn not, he 
 will whet his sword,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:12">Ps. vii. 12</A>.

 But, if he turn, he will lay it by. <I>Blood shall pursue thee,</I>
 the <I>guilt</I> of the blood which thou hast shed or the 
 <I>judgment</I> of blood; thy blood-thirsty enemies shall pursue thee, 
 which way soever thou seekest to make thy escape. A great and general 
 slaughter shall be made of the Idumeans, such as had been foretold

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:6">Isa. xxxiv. 6</A>):

 The <I>mountains and hills, the valleys and rivers,</I> shall be
 <I>filled with the slain,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+35:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 The pursuers shall overtake those that flee and shall give no quarter, 
 but put them all to the sword. Note, When God comes to make inquisition 
 for blood those that have shed the blood of his Israel shall have blood 
 given them to drink, for they are worthy. <I>Satia te sanguine quem 
 sitisti--Glut thyself with blood, after which thou hast thirsted.</I> 
 
 2. The country shall be laid waste. The cities shall be destroyed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+35:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 the <I>country made most desolate</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+35:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 for God will <I>cut off</I> from both him that <I>passes out</I> and 
 <I>him that returns;</I> and when the inhabitants are cut off that 
 should keep the cities in repair they will decay and go into ruins, and 
 when those are cut off that should till the land that will soon be 
 over-run with briers and thorns and become a wilderness. Note, Those 
 that help forward the desolations of Israel may expect to be themselves 
 made desolate. And that which completes the judgment is that Edom shall 
 be made <I>perpetual desolations</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+35:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 and the cities shall never return to their former state, nor the 
 inhabitants of them come back from their captivity and dispersion.
 Note, Those that have a perpetual enmity to God and his people, as the 
 carnal mind has, can expect no other than to be made a perpetual 
 desolation. Implacable malice will justly be punished with irreparable 
 ruin.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two
 countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 was there:
 &nbsp; 11  Therefore, <I>as</I> I live, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, I will even do
 according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou
 hast used out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself
 known among them, when I have judged thee.
 &nbsp; 12  And thou shalt know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>and that</I> I have
 heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the
 mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are
 given us to consume.
 &nbsp; 13  Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have
 multiplied your words against me: I have heard <I>them.</I>
 &nbsp; 14  Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I
 will make thee desolate.
 &nbsp; 15  As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of
 Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou
 shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, <I>even</I> all of
 it: and they shall know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A further account of the sin of the Edomites, and their bad conduct 
 towards the people of God. We find the church complaining of them for 
 setting on the Babylonians, and irritating them against Jerusalem, 
 saying, <I>Rase it, rase it,</I> down with it, down with it 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:7">Ps. cxxxvii. 7</A>),

 inflaming a rage that needed no spur; here it is further charged upon
 them that they triumphed in Jerusalem's ruin and in the desolations of 
 the country. Many <I>blasphemies</I> they spoke against the 
 <I>mountains of Israel,</I> saying, with pride and pleasure, <I>They 
 are laid desolate,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+35:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Note, The troubles of God's church, as they give proofs of the 
 constancy and fidelity of its friends, so they discover and draw out 
 the corruptions of its enemies, in whom there then appears more brutish 
 malice than one would have thought of. Now their triumphing in 
 Jerusalem's ruin is here said to proceed, 

 1. From a sinful passion against the people of Israel; from
 <I>anger</I> and <I>envy,</I> and <I>hatred against them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+35:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 that <I>perpetual hatred</I> spoken of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+35:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Though they were not a match for them, and therefore could not do them 
 a mischief themselves, yet they were glad when the Chaldeans did them a 
 mischief. 

 2. From a sinful appetite to the land of Israel. They pleased
 themselves with hopes that when the people of Israel were destroyed 
 they should be let into the possession of their country, which they had 
 so often grudged and envied them. They thought they could make out 
 something of a title to it, <I>ob defectum sanguinis--for want of other 
 heirs.</I> If Jacob's issue fail, they think that they are next in the 
 entail, and that the remainder will be to his brother's issue: 
 "<I>These two nations of Judah and Israel shall be mine.</I> Now is the 
 time for me to put in for them." At least they hope to come in as first 
 occupants, being near neighbours: <I>We will possess it</I> when it is 
 deserted. <I>Ceditur occupanti--Let us get possession and that will be
 title enough.</I> Note, Those have the spirit of Edomites who desire 
 the death of others because they hope to get by it, or are pleased with 
 their failing because they expect to come into their business. When we 
 see the vanity of the world in the disappointments, losses, and 
 crosses, that others meet with in it, instead of showing ourselves, 
 upon such an occasion, greedy of it, we should rather be made thereby 
 to sit more loose to it, and both take our affections off it and lower 
 our expectations from it. But in this case of the Edomites' coveting
 the land of Israel, and gaping for it, there was a particular affront 
 to God, when they said, "<I>These lands are given us to devour,</I> and 
 we shall have our bellies full of their riches." God says, <I>You have 
 boasted against me and have multiplied your words against me;</I> for 
 they expected possession upon a vacancy, because Israel was driven out, 
 <I>whereas the Lord was</I> still <I>there,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+35:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 His temple indeed was burnt, and the other tokens of his presence were 
 gone; but his promise to give that land to the seed of Jacob for an 
 inheritance was not made void, but remained in full force and virtue; 
 and by that promise he did in effect still keep possession for Israel, 
 till they should in due time be restored to it. That was Immanuel's
 land 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:8">Isa. viii. 8</A>);

 in that land he was to be born, and therefore that people shall
 continue in it of whom he is to be born, till he has passed his time in 
 it, and then let who will take it. <I>The Lord is there,</I> the Lord
 Jesus is to be there; and therefore Israel's discontinuance of 
 possession is no defeasance of their right, but it shall be kept for 
 them, and they shall have, hold, and enjoy it by virtue of the divine 
 grant, till the promise of this Canaan shall by the Messiah be changed 
 into the promise of a far better. Note, It is a piece of presumption 
 highly offensive to God for Edomites to lay claim to those privileges 
 and comforts that are peculiar to God's chosen Israel and are reserved 
 for them. It is <I>blasphemy against the mountains of Israel,</I> the 
 holy mountains, to say, because they are for the present made a prey of 
 and <I>trodden under foot of the Gentiles</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:2">Rev. xi. 2</A>),

 even the <I>holy city</I> itself, that therefore the <I>Lord has 
 forsaken them,</I> their <I>God has forgotten them.</I> The apostle 
 will by no means admit such a thought as this, that <I>God hath cast 
 away his people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:1">Rom. xi. 1</A>.

 No; though they are cast down for a time, they are not cast off for
 ever. Those <I>reproach the Lord</I> who say they are.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The notice God took of the barbarous insolence of the Edomites, and 
 the doom passed upon them for it: <I>I have heard all thy 
 blasphemies,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+35:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 
 And again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+35:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 <I>You have multiplied your words against me,</I> and <I>I have heard 
 them,</I> I have observed them, I have kept an account of them. Note, 
 In the multitude of words, not one escapes God's cognizance; let men 
 speak ever so much, ever so fast, though they multiply words, which 
 they themselves regard not, but forget immediately, yet none of them 
 are lost in the crowd, not the most idle words; but God hears them, and 
 will be able to charge the sinner with them. All the haughty and hard 
 speeches, particularly, which are spoken against the Israel of God, the 
 words which are <I>magnified</I> (as it is in the margin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+35:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)

 as well as the words which are multiplied, God takes notice of. For, as 
 the most trifling words are not below his cognizance, so the most 
 daring are not above his rebuke. <I>I have heard all thy 
 blasphemies.</I> This is a good reason why we should bear reproach as 
 if we heard it not, because <I>God will hear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+38:13,15">Ps. xxxviii. 13, 15</A>.

 God has heard the Edomites' blasphemy; let them therefore hear their
 doom,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+35:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 It was a national sin (the blasphemies charged upon them were the sense 
 and language of all the Edomites), and therefore shall be punished with 
 a national desolation. And, 

 1. It shall be a distinguishing punishment. As God has peculiar
 favours for Israelites, so he has peculiar plagues for Edomites: so 
 that "<I>When the whole earth rejoices I will make thee desolate;</I> 
 when other nations have their desolations repaired, to their joy, thine 
 shall be <I>perpetual,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+35:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 2. The punishment shall answer to the sin: "<I>As thou didst rejoice in 
 the desolation of the house of Israel,</I> God will give thee enough of 
 desolation; since thou art so fond of it, <I>thou shalt be desolate; I 
 will make thee so.</I>" Note, Those who, instead of weeping with the 
 mourners, make a jest of their grievances, may justly be made to weep 
 like the mourners, and themselves to feel the weight, to feel the 
 smart, of those grievances which they set so light by. Some read 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+35:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>

 so as to complete the resemblance between the sin and the punishment:
 <I>The whole earth shall rejoice when I make thee desolate, as thou 
 didst rejoice when Israel</I> was made desolate. Those that are glad
 at the death and fall of others may expect that others will be glad of 
 their death, of their fall. 

 3. In the destruction of the enemies of the church God designs his own
 glory, and we may be sure that he will not come short of his design.

 (1.) That which he intends is to manifest himself, as a just and 
 jealous God, firm to his covenant and faithful to his people and their 
 injured cause

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+35:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>I will make myself known among them when I have judged thee.</I> The 
 Lord is and will be known by the judgments which he executes. 

 (2.) His intention shall be fully answered; not only his own people 
 shall be made to know it to their comfort, but even the Edomites 
 themselves, and all the other enemies of his name and people, <I>shall 
 know that he is the Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+35:4,9,15"><I>v.</I> 4, 9, 15</A>.

 As the works of creation and common providence demonstrate that there 
 is a God, so the care taken of Israel shows that Jehovah, the God of 
 Israel, is that God alone, the true and living God.</P>
