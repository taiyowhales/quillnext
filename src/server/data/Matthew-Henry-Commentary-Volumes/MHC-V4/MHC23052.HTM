 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The greater part of this chapter is on the same subject with the 
 chapter before, concerning the deliverance of the Jews out of Babylon, 
 which yet is applicable to the great salvation Christ has wrought out 
 for us; but the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:13-15">last three verses</A>

 are on the same subject with the following chapter, concerning the
 person of the Redeemer, his humiliation and exaltation. Observe, 

 I. The encouragement that is given to the Jews in captivity to hope
 that God would deliver them in his own way and time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. The great joy and rejoicing that shall be both with ministers and
 people upon that occasion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:7-10">ver. 7-10</A>.

 III. The call given to those that remained in captivity to shift for
 their own enlargement when liberty was proclaimed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:11,12">ver. 11, 12</A>.

 IV. A short idea given here of the Messiah, which is enlarged upon in 
 the next chapter, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:13-15">ver. 13-15</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy
 beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth
 there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the
 unclean.
 &nbsp; 2  Shake thyself from the dust; arise, <I>and</I> sit down, O
 Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive
 daughter of Zion.
 &nbsp; 3  For thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Ye have sold yourselves for nought;
 and ye shall be redeemed without money.
 &nbsp; 4  For thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, My people went down aforetime
 into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them
 without cause.
 &nbsp; 5  Now therefore, what have I here, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that my
 people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make
 them to howl, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and my name continually every day
 <I>is</I> blasphemed.
 &nbsp; 6  Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore <I>they shall
 know</I> in that day that I <I>am</I> he that doth speak: behold, <I>it is</I>
 I.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. God's people are stirred up to appear vigorous for their own 
 deliverance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 They had desired that God would <I>awake</I> and <I>put on his 
 strength,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:9"><I>ch.</I> li. 9</A>.

 Here he calls upon them to <I>awake</I> and <I>put on their 
 strength,</I> to bestir themselves; let them awake from their 
 despondency, and pluck up their spirits, encourage themselves and one 
 another with the hope that all will be well yet, and no longer succumb 
 and sink under their burden. Let them awake from their distrust, look 
 above them, look about them, look into the promises, look into the 
 providences of God that were working for them, and let them raise their 
 expectations of great things from God. Let them awake from their
 dullness, sluggishness, and incogitancy, and raise up their endeavours, 
 not to take any irregular courses for their own relief, contrary to the 
 law of nations concerning captives, but to use all likely means to 
 recommend themselves to the favour of the conqueror and make an 
 interest with him. God here gives them an assurance, 

 1. That they should be reformed by their captivity: <I>There shall no
 more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>);

 their idolatrous customs should be no more introduced, or at least not
 harboured; for when by the marriage of strange wives, in Ezra's time 
 and Nehemiah's, the unclean crept in, they were soon by the vigilance 
 and zeal of the magistrates expelled again, and care was taken that 
 Jerusalem should be a holy city. Thus the gospel Jerusalem is purified 
 by the blood of Christ and the grace of God, and made indeed a holy 
 city. 

 2. That they should be relieved and rescued out of their captivity, 
 that the bands of their necks should be loosed, that they should not 
 now be any longer oppressed, nay, that they should not be any more 
 invaded, as they had been: <I>There shall no more come against thee</I> 
 (so it may be read) <I>the uncircumcised and the clean.</I> The heathen 
 shall not again enter into God's sanctuary and profane his temple, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:1">Ps. lxxix. 1</A>.

 This must be understood with a condition. If they keep close to God,
 and keep in with him, God will keep off, will keep out of the enemy; 
 but, if they again corrupt themselves, Antiochus will profane their 
 temple and the Romans will destroy it. However, for some time they
 shall have peace. And to this happy change, now approaching, they are
 here called to accommodate themselves.

 (1.) Let them prepare for joy: "<I>Put on thy beautiful garments,</I> 
 no longer to appear in mourning weeds and the habit of thy widowhood. 
 Put on a new face, a smiling countenance, now that a new and pleasant 
 scene begins to open." The beautiful garments were laid up then, when 
 the harps were hung on the willow trees; but, now there is occasion for 
 both, let both be resumed together. "Put on thy strength, and, in
 order to that, put on thy beautiful garments, in token of triumph and 
 rejoicing." Note, <I>The joy of the Lord will be our strength</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:10">Neh. viii. 10</A>),

 and our beautiful garments will serve for armour of proof against the
 darts of temptation and trouble. And observe, Jerusalem must put on her 
 beautiful garments when she becomes a holy city, for the beauty of 
 holiness is the most amiable beauty, and the more holy we are the more 
 cause we have to rejoice.

 (2.) Let them prepare for liberty: "<I>Shake thyself from the dust</I> 
 in which thou hast lain, and into which thy proud oppressors have 
 trodden thee

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:23"><I>ch.</I> li. 23</A>),

 or into which thou hast in thy extreme sorrow rolled thyself."
 <I>Arise, and set up;</I> so it may be read. "O Jerusalem! prepare to 
 get clear of all the marks of servitude thou hast been under and to 
 shift thy quarters: <I>Loose thyself from the bands of thy neck;</I> be 
 inspired with generous principles and resolutions to assert thy own 
 liberty." The gospel proclaims liberty to those who were bound with 
 fears and makes it their duty to take hold of their liberty. Let those 
 who have been weary and heavily laden under the burden of sin, finding 
 relief in Christ, shake themselves from the dust of their doubts and 
 fears and loose themselves from those bands; for, <I>if the Son make 
 them free, they shall be free indeed.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God stirs up himself to appear jealous for the deliverance of his 
 people. He here pleads their cause with himself, and even stirs up 
 himself to come and save them, for his reasons of mercy are fetched 
 from himself. Several things he here considers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That the Chaldeans who oppressed them never acknowledged God in the 
 power they gained over his people, any more than Sennacherib did, who, 
 when God made use of him as an instrument for the correction and 
 reformation of his people, meant not so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:6,7"><I>ch.</I> x. 6, 7</A>.

 "<I>You have sold yourselves for nought;</I> you got nothing by it, nor
 did I," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 (God considers that when they by sin had sold themselves he himself,
 who had the prior, nay, the sole, title to them, <I>did not increase 
 his wealth by their price,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:12">Ps. xliv. 12</A>.

 They did not so much as pay their debts to him with it; the Babylonians
 gave him no thanks for them, but rather reproached and blasphemed his 
 name upon that account.) "And therefore they, having so long had you 
 for nothing, shall at last restore you for nothing: <I>You shall be 
 redeemed without price,</I>" as was promised,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:13"><I>ch.</I> xlv. 13</A>.

 Those that give nothing must expect to get nothing; however, God is a
 debtor to no man.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That they had been often before in similar distress, had often 
 smarted for a time under the tyranny of their task-masters, and 
 therefore it was a pity that they should now be left always in the hand 
 of these oppressors 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>My people went down into Egypt,</I> in an amicable way to settle 
 there; but they enslaved them, and ruled them with rigour." And then 
 they were delivered, notwithstanding the pride, and power, and policies 
 of Pharaoh. And why may we not think God will deliver his people now? 
 At other times <I>the Assyrian oppressed</I> the people of God 
 <I>without cause,</I> as when the ten tribes were carried away captive 
 by the king of Assyria; soon afterwards Sennacherib, another Assyrian, 
 with a destroying army oppressed and made himself master of all the 
 defenced cities of Judah. The Babylonians might not unfitly be called 
 <I>Assyrians,</I> their monarchy being a branch of the Assyrians; and 
 they now oppressed them without cause. Though God was righteous in 
 delivering them into their hands, they were unrighteous in using them 
 as they did, and could not pretend a dominion over them as their 
 subjects, as Pharaoh might when they were settled in Goshen, part of 
 his kingdom. When we suffer by the hands of wicked and unreasonable men 
 it is some comfort to be able to say that as to them it is without 
 cause, that we have not given them any provocation,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:3-5">Ps. vii. 3-5</A>,

 &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That God's glory suffered by the injuries that were done to his 
 people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>What have I here,</I> what do I get by it, <I>that my people are 
 taken away for nought?</I> God is not worshipped as he used to be in 
 Jerusalem, his altar there is gone and his temple in ruins; but if, in 
 lieu of that, he were more and better worshipped in Babylon, either by 
 the captives or by the natives, it were another matter--God might be 
 looked upon as in some respects a gainer in his honour by it; but, 
 alas! it is not so. 

 (1.) The captives are so dispirited that they cannot praise him; 
 instead of this they are continually howling, which grieves him and 
 moves his pity; <I>Those that rule over them make them to howl,</I> as 
 the Egyptians of old made them to sigh, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:23">Exod. ii. 23</A>.

 So the Babylonians now, using them more hardly, extorted from them
 louder complaints and made them to howl. This gives us no pleasing idea 
 of the temper the captives were now in; their complaints were not so 
 rational and pious as they should have been, but brutish rather; they 
 <I>howled,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:14">Hos. vii. 14</A>.

 However God heard them, and came down to deliver them, as he did out of
 Egypt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:7,8">Exod. iii. 7, 8</A>.

 (2.) The natives are so insolent that they will not praise him, but, 
 instead of that, they are continually blaspheming, which affronts him 
 and moves his anger. They boasted that they were too hard for God
 because they were too hard for his people, and set him at defiance, as 
 unable to deliver them, and thus his <I>name continually every day was 
 blasphemed among them.</I> When they praised their own idols they 
 <I>lifted up themselves against the Lord of heaven,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:23">Dan. v. 23</A>.
 
 "Now," says God, "this is not to be suffered. I will go down to
 deliver them; for what honour, what rent, what tribute of praise have I 
 from the world, when my people, who should be to me for a name and 
 praise, are to me for a reproach? For their oppressors will neither 
 praise God themselves nor let them do it." The apostle quotes this with 
 application to the wicked lives of the Jews, by which God was 
 dishonoured among the Gentiles then, as much as now he was by their 
 sufferings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:23,24">Rom. ii. 23, 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That his glory would be greatly manifested by their deliverance 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>Therefore,</I> because my name is thus blasphemed, I will arise, 
 and <I>my people shall know my name,</I> my name Jehovah." By this name 
 he had made himself known in delivering them out of Egypt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:3">Exod. vi. 3</A>.

 God will do something to vindicate his own honour, something for his
 great name; and his people, who have almost lost the knowledge of it, 
 shall know it to their comfort and shall find it their strong tower. 
 They shall know that God's providence governs the world, and all the 
 affairs of it, that it is he who speaks deliverance for them by the 
 word of his power, that it is he who speaks deliverance for them by the 
 word of his power, that it is he only, who at first spoke and it was 
 done. They shall know that God's word, which Israel is blessed with 
 above other nations, shall without fail have its accomplishment in due 
 season, that it is he who speaks by the prophet; it is he, and they do 
 not speak of themselves; for not one iota or tittle of what they say 
 shall fall to the ground.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The removal of the Jews from Babylon to their own land again is here 
 spoken of both as a mercy and as a duty; and the application of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>

 to the preaching of the gospel (by the apostle,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:15">Rom. x. 15</A>)

 plainly intimates that that deliverance was a type and figure of the
 redemption of mankind by Jesus Christ, to which what is here said of 
 their redemption out of Babylon ought to be accommodated.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It is here spoken of as a great blessing, which ought to be welcomed 
 with abundance of joy and thankfulness. 

 1. Those that bring the tidings of their release shall be very
 acceptable

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "<I>How beautiful upon the mountains,</I> the mountains round about 
 Jerusalem, over which these messengers are seen coming at a distance, 
 <I>how beautiful are their feet,</I> when it is known what tidings they 
 bring!" It is not meant so much of the common posts, or the messengers 
 sent express by the government to disperse the proclamation, but rather 
 of some of the Jews themselves, who, being at the fountain-head of 
 intelligence, had early notice of it, and immediately went themselves, 
 or sent their own messengers, to all parts, to disperse the news, and 
 even to Jerusalem itself, to tell the few who remained there that their 
 brethren would be with them shortly; for it is published not merely as 
 matter of news, but as a proof that Zion's God reigns, for in that 
 language it is published: they say unto Zion, <I>Thy God reigns.</I> 
 Those who bring the tidings of peace and salvation, that Cyrus has 
 given orders for the release of the Jews, tidings which were so long 
 expected by those that waited for the consolation of Israel, those 
 <I>good tidings</I> (so the original reads it, without the tautology of 
 our translation, <I>good tidings of good</I>), put this construction 
 upon it, <I>O Zion! thy God reigns.</I> Note, When bad news is abroad 
 this is good news, and when good news is abroad this is the best news, 
 that Zion's God reigns, that God is Zion's God, in covenant with her, 
 and as such he reigns, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+146:10,Zec+9:9">Ps. cxlvi. 10; Zech. ix. 9</A>.

 <I>The Lord has founded Zion,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:32"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 32</A>.

 All events have their rise in the disposals of the kingdom of his
 providence and their tendency to the advancement of the kingdom of his 
 grace. This must be applied to the preaching of the gospel, which is a 
 proclamation of peace and salvation; it is gospel indeed, good news, 
 glad tidings, tidings of victory over our spiritual enemies and liberty 
 from our spiritual bondage. The good news is that the Lord Jesus reigns 
 and all power is given to him. Christ himself brought these tidings 
 first 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:18,Heb+2:3">Luke iv. 18, Heb. ii. 3</A>),

 and of him the text speaks: <I>How beautiful are his feet!</I> his feet
 that were nailed to the cross, how beautiful upon Mount Calvary! his 
 feet when he came <I>leaping upon the mountains</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:8">Cant. ii. 8</A>),

 how beautiful were they to those who knew his voice and knew it to be
 the voice of their beloved! His ministers proclaim these good tidings; 
 they ought to keep their feet clean from the pollutions of the world, 
 and then they ought to be beautiful in the eyes of those to whom they 
 are sent, who sit at their feet, or rather at Christ's in them, to hear 
 his word. They must be <I>esteemed in love</I> for <I>their work's 
 sake</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:13">1 Thess. v. 13</A>),

 for their message sake, which is well worthy of all acceptation.

 2. Those to whom the tidings are brought shall be put thereby into a 
 transport of joy.

 (1.) Zion's watchmen shall then rejoice because they are surprisingly 
 illuminated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 The watchmen on Jerusalem's walls shall lead the chorus in this
 triumph. Who they were we are told,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:6"><I>ch.</I> lxii. 6</A>.

 They were such as God set on the walls of Jerusalem, to make mention of
 his name, and to continue instant in prayer to him, till he again 
 <I>made Jerusalem a praise in the earth.</I> These watchmen stand upon 
 their watch-tower, waiting for an answer to their prayers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:1">Hab. ii. 1</A>);
 
 and therefore when the good news comes they have it first, and the
 longer they have continued and the more importunate they have been in 
 praying for it the more will they be elevated when it comes: They shall 
 <I>lift up the voice, with the voice together shall they sing</I> in 
 concert, to invite others to join with them in their praises. And that 
 which above all things will transport them with pleasure is that 
 <I>they shall see eye to eye,</I> that is, face to face. Whereas God 
 had been a God hiding himself, and they could scarcely discern any 
 thing of his favour through the dark cloud of their afflictions, now 
 that the cloud is scattered they shall plainly see it. They shall see 
 <I>Zion's king eye to eye;</I> so it was fulfilled when the Word was 
 made flesh and dwelt among us, and there were those that <I>saw his 
 glory</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:14">John i. 14</A>)

 <I>and looked upon it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:1">1 John i. 1</A>.

 They shall see an exact agreement and correspondence between the
 prophecy and the event, the promise and the performance; they shall see 
 how they look one upon another eye to eye, and be satisfied that the 
 same God spoke the one and did the other. When the Lord shall bring 
 again Zion out of her captivity the prophets shall thence receive and 
 give fuller discoveries than ever of God's good-will to his people. 
 Applying this also, as the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:8">foregoing verse</A>,

 to gospel times, it is a promise of the pouring out of the Spirit upon
 gospel ministers, as a spirit of wisdom and revelation, to lead them 
 into all truth, so that they shall see eye to eye, shall see God's 
 grace more clearly than the Old-Testament saints could see it: and they 
 shall herein be unanimous; in these great things concerning the common 
 salvation they shall concur in their sentiments as well as their songs. 
 Nay, St. Paul seems to allude to this when he makes it the privilege of 
 our future state that <I>we shall see face to face.</I> 

 (2.) Zion's waste places shall then rejoice because they shall be 
 surprisingly comforted

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Break forth into joy, sing together, you waste places of 
 Jerusalem;</I> that is, all parts of Jerusalem, for it was all in 
 ruins, and even those parts that seemed to lie most desolate shall 
 share in the joy; and they, having little expected it, shall break 
 forth into joy, as men that dream, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+126:1,2">Ps. cxxvi. 1, 2</A>.

 Let them sing together. Note, Those that share in mercies ought to join 
 in praises. Here is matter for joy and praise.

 [1.] God's people will have the comfort of this salvation; and what is 
 the matter of our rejoicing ought to be the matter of our thanksgiving. 
 <I>He has redeemed Jerusalem</I> (the inhabitants of Jerusalem that 
 were sold into the hands of their enemies) and thereby he has 
 <I>comforted his people</I> that were in sorrow. The redemption of 
 Jerusalem is the joy of all God's people, whose character it is that 
 they look for that redemption, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:38">Luke ii. 38</A>.

 [2.] God will have the glory of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 He <I>has made bare his holy arm</I> (manifested and displayed his
 power) <I>in the eyes of all the nations.</I> God's arm is a holy arm, 
 stretched out in purity and justice, in defence of holiness and in 
 pursuance of his promise.

 [3.] All the world will have the benefit of it. In the great salvation 
 wrought out by our Lord Jesus the <I>arm of the Lord was revealed and 
 all the ends of the earth were made to see the great salvation,</I> not 
 as spectators of it only, as they saw the deliverance of the Jews out 
 of Babylon, but as sharers in it; some of all nations, the most remote, 
 shall partake of the benefits of the redemption. This is applied to our 
 salvation by Christ. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:6">Luke iii. 6</A>,

 <I>All flesh shall see the salvation of God,</I> that <I>great
 salvation.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It is here spoken of as a great business, which ought to be managed 
 with abundance of care and circumcision. When the liberty is 
 proclaimed, 

 1. Let the people of God hasten out of Babylon with all convenient
 speed; though they are ever so well settled there, let them not think 
 of taking root in Babylon, but <I>Depart, depart</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),
 
 <I>go out from the midst of her;</I> not only those that are in the 
 borders, but those that are in the midst, in the heart of the country, 
 let them be gone. Babylon is no place for Israelites. As soon as they
 have leave to let go, let them lose no time. With this word God stirred 
 up the spirits of those that were moved to go up, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:5">Ezra i. 5</A>.

 And it is a call to all those who are yet in the bondage of sin and
 Satan to make use of the liberty which Christ has proclaimed to them. 
 And, if the Son <I>make them free, they shall be free indeed.</I>

 2. Let them take heed of carrying away with them any of the pollutions 
 of Babylon: <I>Touch no unclean thing.</I> Now that God makes bare his 
 holy arm for you, <I>be you holy as he is, and keep yourselves from 
 every wicked thing.</I> When they came out of Egypt they brought with 
 them the idolatrous customs of Egypt 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:3">Ezek. xxiii. 3</A>),

 which were their ruin; let them take heed of doing so now that they come
 out of Babylon. Note, When we are receiving any special mercy from God
 we ought more carefully than ever to watch against all impurity. But 
 especially let those be <I>clean</I> who <I>bear the vessels of the 
 Lord,</I> that is, the priests, who had the charge of the vessels of 
 the sanctuary (when they were restored by a particular grant) to carry 
 them to Jerusalem,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:7,8:23">Ezra i. 7; viii. 24</A>,

 &c. Let them not only avoid touching any unclean thing, but be very
 careful to <I>cleanse themselves according to the purification of the 
 sanctuary.</I> Christians are made to our God spiritual priests, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:6">Rev. i. 6</A>.

 They are to bear the vessels of the Lord, are entrusted to keep the
 ordinances of God pure and entire; it is a good thing that is committed 
 to them, and they ought to be clean, to wash their hands in innocency 
 and so to compass God's altars and carry his vessels, and keep 
 themselves pure.

 3. Let them depend upon the presence of God with them and his
 protection in their removal

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>You shall not go out with haste.</I> They were to go with a diligent 
 haste, not to lose time nor linger as Lot in Sodom, but they were not 
 to go with a diffident distrustful haste, as if they were afraid of 
 being pursued (as when they came out of Egypt) or of having the orders 
 for their release recalled and countermanded: no, they shall find that, 
 as for God, his work is perfect, and therefore they need not make more 
 haste than good speed. Cyrus shall give them an honourable discharge, 
 and they shall have an honourable return, and not steal away; <I>for 
 the Lord will go before them</I> as their general and 
 commander-in-chief, <I>and the God of Israel will be their 
 rearward,</I> or he that will gather up those that are left behind. God 
 will both lead their van and bring up their rear; he will secure them 
 from enemies that either meet them or follow them, for with his favour 
 will he compass them. The pillar of cloud and fire, when they came out 
 of Egypt, sometimes went behind them, to secure their rear 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:19">Exod. xiv. 19</A>),
 
 and God's presence with them would now be that to them which that
 pillar was a visible token of. Those that are in the way of their duty 
 are under God's special protection; and he that believes this will not 
 make haste.</P>

 Here, as in other places, for the confirming of the faith of God's 
 people and the encouraging of their hope in the promises of temporal 
 deliverances, the prophet passes from them to speak of the great 
 salvation which should in the fulness of time be wrought out by the 
 Messiah. As the prophecy of Christ's incarnation was intended for the 
 ratification of the promise of their deliverance from the Assyrian 
 army, so this of Christ's death and resurrection is to confirm the 
 promise of their return out of Babylon; for both these salvations were 
 typical of the great redemption and the prophecies of them had a 
 reference to that. This prophecy, which begins here and is continued to 
 the end of the next chapter, points as plainly as can be at Jesus 
 Christ; the ancient Jews understood it of the Messiah, though the 
 modern Jews take a great deal of pains to pervert it, and some of ours 
 (no friends therein to the Christian religion) will have it understood 
 of Jeremiah; but Philip, who hence preached Christ to the eunuch, has 
 put it past dispute that <I>of him speaks the prophet this,</I> of him 
 and of no other man, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:34,35">Acts viii. 34, 35</A>.
 
 Here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God owns Christ to be both commissioned and qualified for his 
 undertaking. 

 1. He is appointed to it. "He is <I>my servant,</I> whom I employ and
 therefore will uphold." In his undertaking he does his Father's will, 
 seeks his Father's honour, and serves the interests of his Father's 
 kingdom. 

 2. He is qualified for it. He <I>shall deal prudently,</I> for the 
 <I>spirit of wisdom and understanding shall rest upon him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:2"><I>ch.</I> xi. 2</A>.

 The word is used concerning David when he <I>behaved himself
 wisely,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:14">1 Sam. xviii. 14</A>.

 Christ is wisdom itself, and, in the contriving and carrying on the
 work of our redemption, there appeared much of <I>the wisdom of God in 
 a mystery,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:7">1 Cor. ii. 7</A>.

 Christ, when he was here upon earth, dealt very prudently, to the
 admiration of all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He gives a short prospect both of his humiliation and his 
 exaltation. See here, 

 1. How he humbled himself: <I>Many were astonished at him,</I> as they
 were at David when by reason of his sorrows and troubles he became a 
 <I>wonder unto many,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:7">Ps. lxxi. 7</A>.

 Many wondered to see what base usage he met with, how inveterate people
 were against him, how inhuman, and what indignities were done him: 
 <I>His visage was marred more than any man's</I> when he was buffeted, 
 smitten on the cheek, and crowned with thorns, and <I>hid not his face 
 from shame and spitting. His face was foul with weeping,</I> for he was 
 <I>a man of sorrows;</I> he that really was <I>fairer than the children 
 of men</I> had his face spoiled with the abuses that were done him.
 Never was man used so barbarously; his form, when he took upon him 
 <I>the form of a servant,</I> was more mean and abject than that of any 
 of the sons of men. Those that saw him said, "Surely never man looked 
 so miserably, <I>a worm and no man,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:6">Ps. xxii. 6</A>.
 
 The <I>nation abhorred him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:7"><I>ch.</I> xlix. 7</A>),

 treated him as the <I>off-scouring of all things. Never was sorrow like
 unto his sorrow.</I> 

 2. How highly God exalted him, and exalted him because he humbled 
 himself. Three words are used for this

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):
 
 <I>He shalt be exalted and extolled and be very high.</I> God shall 
 exalt him, men shall extol him, and with both he shall be very high, 
 higher than the highest, higher than the heavens. He shall prosper in 
 his work, and succeed in it, and that shall raise him very high. 

 (1.) Many nations shall be the better for him, for <I>he shall sprinkle 
 them,</I> and not the Jews only; the blood of sprinkling shall be 
 applied to their consciences, to purify them. He suffered, and died, 
 and so sprinkled many nations; for in his death there was <I>a fountain 
 opened,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:1">Zech. xiii. 1</A>.

 He shall sprinkle many nations by his heavenly doctrine, which shall
 drop as the rain and distil as the dew. Moses's did so only on one 
 nation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:2">Deut. xxxii. 2</A>),

 but Christ's on many nations. He shall do it by baptism, which is the
 washing of the body with pure water, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:22">Heb. x. 22</A>.

 So that this promise had its accomplishment when Christ sent his
 apostles to disciple all nations, by baptizing or sprinkling them.

 (2.) The great ones of the nation shall show him respect: <I>Kings 
 shall shut their mouths at him,</I> that is, they shall not open their 
 mouths against him, as they have done, to contradict and blaspheme his 
 sacred oracles; nay, they shall acquiesce in, and be well pleased with, 
 the methods he takes of setting up his kingdom in the world; they shall 
 with great humility and reverence receive his oracles and laws, as 
 those who, when they heard Job's wisdom, <I>after his speech spoke not 
 again,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+29:9,22">Job xxix. 9, 22</A>.
 
 <I>Kings shall see and arise,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:7"><I>ch.</I> xlix. 7</A>.

 (3.) The mystery which was kept secret from the beginning of the world
 shall by him be <I>made known to all nations for the obedience of 
 faith,</I> as the apostle speaks, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:25,26">Rom. xvi. 25, 26</A>.

 <I>That which had not been told them shall they see;</I> the gospel
 brings to light things new and unheard of, which will awaken the 
 attention and engage the reverence of kings and kingdoms. This is 
 applied to the preaching of the gospel in the Gentile world,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:21">Rom. xv. 21</A>.

 These words are there quoted according to the Septuagint translation:
 <I>To whom he was not spoken of they shall see, and those that have not 
 heard shall understand.</I> As the things revealed had long been kept 
 secret, so the persons to whom they were revealed had long been kept in 
 the dark; but now they shall see and consider the glory of God shining 
 in the face of Christ, which before they had not been told of--<I>they 
 had not heard.</I> That shall be discovered to them by the gospel of 
 Christ which could never be told them by all the learning of their 
 philosophers, or the art of their diviners, or any of their pagan 
 oracles. Much had been said in the Old Testament concerning the 
 Messiah; much had been told them, and they had heard it. But, as the 
 queen of Sheba found concerning Solomon, what they shall see in him, 
 when he comes, shall far exceed what had been told them. Christ 
 disappointed the expectations of those who looked for a Messiah 
 according to their fancies, as the carnal Jews, but outdid theirs who 
 looked for such a Messiah as was promised. According to their faith,
 nay, and beyond it, it was to them.</P>
