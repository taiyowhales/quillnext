 prophets were his witnesses to his church, each in his day, for several 
 ages, witnesses for him and his authority, witnesses against sin and 
 sinners, attesting the true intents of God's providences in his 
 dealings with his people then and the kind intentions of his grace 
 concerning his church in the days of the Messiah, to whom all the 
 prophets bore witness, for they all agreed in their testimony; and now 
 we have only one witness more to call, and we have done with our 
 evidence; and though he be the last, and in him prophecy ceased, yet 
 the Spirit of prophecy shines as clearly, as strongly, as brightly in 
 him as in any that went before, and his testimony challenges an equal 
 regard. The Jews say, Prophecy continued forty years under the second 
 temple, and this prophet they call the <I>seal of prophecy,</I> because 
 in him the series or succession of prophets broke off and came to a 
 period. God wisely ordered it so that divine inspiration should cease 
 for some ages before the coming of the Messiah, that that great prophet 
 might appear the more conspicuous and distinguishable and be the more 
 welcome. Let us consider, 

 I. The person of the prophet. We have only his name, <I>Malachi,</I> 
 and no account of his country or parentage. <I>Malachi</I> signifies
 <I>my angel,</I> which has given occasion for a conjecture that this 
 prophet was indeed an angel from heaven and not a man, as that 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:1">Judges ii. 1</A>.

 But there is no just ground for the conjecture. Prophets were
 messengers, God's messengers; this prophet was so; his name is the very
 same with that which we find in the original 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:1"><I>ch.</I> iii. 1</A>)

 for <I>my messenger;</I> and perhaps from that word he might (though,
 probably, he had another name) be called <I>Malachi.</I> The Chaldee 
 paraphrase, and some of the Jews, suggest that Malachi was the same 
 with Ezra; but that also is groundless. Ezra was a scribe, but we never 
 read that he was a prophet. Others, yet further from probability, make 
 him to be Mordecai. But we have reason to conclude he was a person 
 whose proper name was that by which he is here called; the tradition of 
 some of the ancients is that he was of the tribe of Zebulun, and that 
 he died young.

 II. The scope of the prophecy. Haggai and Zechariah were sent to
 reprove the people for delaying to build the temple; Malachi was sent 
 to reprove them for the neglect of it when it was built, and for their 
 profanation of the temple-service (for from idolatry and superstition 
 they ran into the other extreme of impiety and irreligion), and the 
 sins he witnesses against are the same that we find complained of in 
 Nehemiah's time, with whom, it is probable, he was contemporary. And 
 now that prophecy was to cease he speaks more clearly of the Messiah, 
 as nigh at hand, than any other of the prophets had done, and concludes 
 with a direction to the people of God to keep in remembrance the law of 
 Moses, while they were in expectation of the gospel of Christ.</P>
