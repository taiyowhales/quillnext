 The two kingdoms of providence and grace are what we are all very 
 nearly interested in, and therefore are concerned to acquaint ourselves 
 with, all our temporal affairs being in a necessary subjection to 
 divine Providence, and all our spiritual and eternal concerns in a 
 necessary dependence upon divine grace; and these two are represented 
 to us in this chapter--the former by a vision, the latter by a type.
 Here is, 

 I. God, as King of nations, ruling the world by the ministry of angels,
 in the vision of the four chariots, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>.

 II. God, as King of saints, ruling the church by the mediation of
 Christ, in the figure of Joshua the high priest crowned, the ceremony 
 performed, and then explained concerning Christ,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and,
 behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains;
 and the mountains <I>were</I> mountains of brass.
 &nbsp; 2 In the first chariot <I>were</I> red horses; and in the second
 chariot black horses;
 &nbsp; 3 And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth
 chariot grisled and bay horses.
 &nbsp; 4 Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me,
 What <I>are</I> these, my lord?
 &nbsp; 5 And the angel answered and said unto me, These <I>are</I> the four
 spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the
 Lord of all the earth.
 &nbsp; 6 The black horses which <I>are</I> therein go forth into the north
 country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go
 forth toward the south country.
 &nbsp; 7 And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk
 to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to
 and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the
 earth.
 &nbsp; 8 Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold,
 these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in
 the north country.

 The prophet is forward to receive this vision, and, as if he expected 
 it, he <I>turned and lifted up his eyes and looked.</I> Though this was 
 the seventh vision he had had, yet he did not think he had had enough; 
 for the more we know of God and his will, if we know it aright, the 
 more desirous we shall be to get a further acquaintance with God. Now 
 observe here the sight that the prophet had of<I>four chariots</I> 
 drawn by horses of divers colours, together with the explication of the 
 sight, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:1-5"><I>v.</I> 1-5</A>.

 He did not look long before he discovered that which was worth seeing,
 and which would serve very much for the encouraging of himself and his 
 friends in this dark day. We are very much in the dark concerning the 
 meaning of this vision. Some by the <I>four chariots</I> understand the 
 four monarchies; and then they read 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 <I>These are the four winds of the heavens,</I> and suppose that 
 therein reference is had to 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:2">Dan. vii. 2</A>,

 where Daniel saw, in vision, the <I>four winds of the heavens striving 
 upon the great sea,</I> representing the four monarchies. The 
 Babylonian monarchy, they think, is here represented by the <I>red 
 horses,</I> which are not afterwards mentioned, because that monarchy 
 was now extinct. The second chariot with the <I>black horses</I> is the 
 Persian monarchy, which went forth northward against the Babylonians, 
 and <I>quieted God's Spirit in the north country,</I> by executing his 
 judgments on Babylon and freeing the Jews from their captivity. The 
 <I>white,</I> the Grecians, go <I>forth after them</I> in the north, 
 for they overthrow the Persians. The <I>grizzled,</I> the Romans, who
 conquered the Grecian empire, are said to <I>go forth towards the south 
 country,</I> because Egypt, which lay southward, was the last branch of 
 the Grecian empire that was subdued by the Romans. The <I>bay 
 horses</I> had been with the <I>grizzled,</I> but afterwards went forth 
 by themselves; and by these they understand the Goths and Vandals, who 
 with their victorious arms walked to and fro through the earth, or the 
 Seleucid&aelig; and Lagid&aelig;, the two branches of the Grecian 
 empire. Thus Grotius and others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But I incline rather to understand this vision more generally, as 
 designing to represent the administration of the kingdom of Providence 
 in the government of this lower world. The <I>angels</I> are often 
 called the <I>chariots of God,</I> as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:17,Ps+18:10">Ps. lxviii. 17; xviii. 10</A>.

 The various providences of God concerning nations and churches are 
 represented by the different colours of horses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:2,4,5,8">Rev. vi. 2, 4, 5, 8</A>.

 And so we may observe here, 

 1. That the counsels and decrees of God are the spring and original of 
 all events, and they are immovable, as <I>mountains of brass.</I> The 
 <I>chariots</I> came <I>from between the two mountains;</I> for God 
 <I>performs the thing that is appointed for us:</I> his appointments 
 are the originals, and his performances are but copies from them; he 
 does all <I>according to the counsel of his will.</I> We could as soon 
 grasp the mountains in our arms as comprehend the divine counsels in 
 our finite understandings, and as soon remove <I>mountains of brass</I> 
 as alter any of God's purposes; for <I>he is in one mind, and who can 
 turn him?</I> Whatever the providences of God are concerning us, as to 
 public or private affairs, we should see them all coming from 
 <I>between the mountains of brass,</I> and therefore see it as much our 
 folly to quarrel with them as it is our duty to acquiesce in them. Who 
 may say to God, <I>What doest thou, or why doest thou so?</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:23,4:28">Acts ii. 23; iv. 28</A>.

 2. That God executes his decrees in the works of Providence, which are
 as chariots, in which he rides as a prince in an open chariot, to show 
 his glory to the world, in which, as in chariots of war, he rides forth 
 <I>conquering and to conquer,</I> and triumphing over all the enemies 
 of his glory and government. God is great and terrible in his doings

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:3">Ps. lxvi. 3</A>),

 and in them we <I>see the goings of our God, our King,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:24">Ps. lxviii. 24</A>.
 
 His providences move swiftly and strongly as chariots, but all directed
 and governed by his infinite wisdom and sovereign will, as chariots by
 their drivers. 

 3. That the holy angels are the ministers of God's providence, and are
 employed by him, as <I>the armies of heaven,</I> for the executing of 
 his counsels among <I>the inhabitants of the earth;</I> they are the 
 <I>chariots,</I> or, which comes all to one, they are the horses that 
 draw the chariots, great in power and might, and who, like the horse 
 that God himself describes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:19">Job xxxix. 19</A>,

 &c.), are clothed with thunder, are terrible, but cannot be
 <I>terrified</I> nor <I>made afraid;</I> they are <I>chariots of fire,
 and horses of fire,</I> to carry one prophet to heaven and guard
 another on earth. They are as observant of and obsequious to the will
 of God as well-managed horses are to their rider or driver. Not that
 God needs them or their services, but he is pleased to make use of
 them, that he may put honour upon them, and encourage our trust in his
 providence. 

 4. That the events of Providence have different aspects and the face of
 the times often changes. The <I>horses</I> in the <I>first chariot</I> 
 were <I>red,</I> signifying war and bloodshed, <I>blood to the 
 horse-bridles,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:20">Rev. xiv. 20</A>.

 Those in the <I>second chariot</I> were <I>black,</I> signifying the 
 dismal melancholy consequences of war; it puts all into mourning, lays 
 all waste, introduces famines, and pestilences, and desolations, and 
 makes whole lands to languish. Those in the <I>third chariot</I> were 
 <I>white,</I> signifying the return of comfort, and peace, and 
 prosperity, after these dark and dismal times: though God cause grief 
 to the children of men, yet will he have compassion. Those in the 
 <I>fourth chariot</I> were of a mixed colour, <I>grizzled</I> and 
 <I>bay;</I> some <I>speckled</I> and <I>spotted,</I> and 
 <I>ash-coloured,</I> signifying events of different complexions 
 interwoven and counter-changed, a day of prosperity and a day of 
 adversity set <I>the one over-against the other.</I> The cup of 
 Providence in the hand of the Lord is<I>full of mixture,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+75:8">Ps. lxxv. 8</A>.

 5. That all the instruments of Providence, and all the events of it,
 come from God, and from him they receive their commissions and
 instructions

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>These are the four spirits of heaven, the four winds</I> (so some),
 which seem to blow as they list, from the various points of the 
 compass; but God has them <I>in his fists</I> and brings them out of 
 <I>his treasuries.</I> Or, rather, These are <I>the angels</I> that 
 <I>go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth,</I> to 
 attend upon him and minister to him, to behold his glory in the upper 
 world, which is their blessedness, and to serve his glory in their 
 blessedness, and to serve his glory in this lower world, which is their 
 business. They <I>stand before him</I> as the <I>Lord of the whole 
 earth,</I> to receive orders from him and give up their accounts to him 
 concerning their services on this earth, for it is all within his 
 jurisdiction. But, when he appoints, they <I>go forth</I> as messengers 
 of his counsels and ministers of his justice and mercy. Those secret
 motions and impulses upon the spirits of men by which the designs of 
 Providence are carried on, some think, are these <I>four spirits of the 
 heavens,</I> which <I>go forth from God</I> and fulfil what he
 appoints, who is <I>the God of the spirits of all flesh.</I> 

 6. That there is an admirable beauty in Providence, and one event
 serves for a balance to another

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>The black horses went forth,</I> carrying with them very dark and
 melancholy events, such as made every person and every thing look 
 black; but presently <I>the white went forth after them,</I> carrying 
 joy to those that mourned, and, by a new turn given to affairs, making 
 them to look pleasant again. Such are God's dealings with his church 
 and people: if the black horses go forth, the white ones presently go 
 after them; for <I>as affliction abounds consolation much more 
 abounds.</I> 

 7. That the common general aspect of providence is mixed and
 compounded. The <I>grizzled</I> and <I>bay horses</I> were both in the 
 <I>fourth chariot</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and though they went forth, at first, towards the <I>south country,</I> 
 yet afterwards they <I>sought to walk to and fro through the earth</I> 
 and were directed to do so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 If we go to and fro through the earth, we shall find the events of 
 Providence neither all black nor all white, but ash-coloured, or gray, 
 mixed of black and white. Such is the world we live in; that before us 
 is unmixed. Here we are singing, at the same time, of <I>mercy and 
 judgment,</I> and we must <I>sing unto God</I> of both 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+101:1">Ps. ci. 1</A>)

 and labour to accommodate ourselves to God's will and design in the
 mixtures of Providence, rejoicing in our comforts as though we rejoiced 
 not, because they have their allays, and weeping for our afflictions as 
 though we wept not, because there is so much mercy mixed with them. 

 8. That God is well-pleased with all the operations of his own
 providence

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>These have quieted my spirit,</I> these <I>black horses</I> which
 denote extraordinary judgments, and the <I>white</I> ones which denote 
 extraordinary deliverances, both which <I>went towards the north 
 country,</I> while the common mixed providences went all the world 
 over. These have <I>quieted my spirit in the north-country,</I> which 
 had of late been the most remarkable scene of action with reference to 
 the church; that is, by these uncommon appearances and actings of 
 providence God's wrath is executed upon the enemies of the church, and 
 his favours are conferred upon the church, both which had long been 
 deferred, and in both God had fulfilled his will, accomplished his 
 word, and so <I>quieted his Spirit. The Lord is well-pleased for his 
 righteousness' sake;</I> and, as he speaks, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:24">Isa. i. 24</A>,

 made himself easy.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God did not only at <I>sundry times,</I> but <I>in divers manners,</I> 
 speak in time past by the prophets to his church. In the former part of 
 this chapter he spoke by a vision, which only the prophet himself saw; 
 here, in this latter part, he speaks by a sign, or type, which many 
 saw, and which, as it was explained, was an illustrious prediction of 
 the Messiah as the priest and king of his church. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The significant ceremony which God appointed, and that was the 
 <I>coronation of Joshua</I> the high priest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 It is observable that there should be two eminent types of Christ in 
 the Old Testament that were both named <I>Joshua</I> (the same name 
 with <I>Jesus,</I> and by the LXX., and in the New Testament, rendered 
 <I>Jesus,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:45">Acts vii. 45</A>)--

 Joshua the chief captain, a type of Christ the captain of our
 salvation, and Joshua the chief priest, a type of Christ the high 
 priest of our profession, and both in their day saviours and leaders 
 into Canaan. And this is peculiar to Joshua the high priest, that here 
 was something done to him by the divine appointment on purpose that he 
 might be a type of Christ, a priest after the order of Melchizedek, who 
 was both a king and a priest. Joshua was far from being ambitious of a
 crown, and the people of having a crowned head over them; but the 
 prophet, to the great surprise of both, is ordered to crown Joshua as 
 if he had been a king. And, as Zerubbabel's prudence and piety kept 
 this from being any affront to him (as the setting up of a rival with 
 him), so God's providence kept the kings of Persia from taking umbrage 
 at it, as raising a rebellion against them. In doing what we are sure 
 is God's pleasure, as this was, we may well venture men's displeasure. 
 
 1. Here were some Jews come from Babylon that brought an offering to
 the house of God, <I>some of the captivity,</I> here named to their 
 honour, that <I>came from Babylon</I> on a visit to Jerusalem. They 
 ought to have bidden a final farewell to Babylon, and to have come and 
 settled with their brethren in their own land, and for their remissness 
 and indifference in not doing so they thought to atone by this visit. 
 Perhaps they came as ambassadors from the body of the Jews that were in 
 Babylon, who lived there in ease and fulness; and, hearing that the 
 building of the temple went on slowly for want of money, they sent them 
 with an offering of gold and silver for the service of the house of 
 God. Note, Those that by reason of distance, or otherwise, cannot
 forward a good work by their persons, must, as they are able, forward 
 it by their purses; if some find hands, let others fill them. 

 2. Time and place are appointed for the prophet to meet them. They
 thought to bring their present to the priest, God's ordinary minister; 
 but God has a prophet, an extraordinary one, ready to receive them and 
 it, which would be an encouragement to them, who, in their captivity, 
 had so often complained, <I>We see not our signs, there is no more any 
 prophet,</I> and would invite them and others to re-settle in their own 
 land, which then began to look like itself, like a holy land, when the 
 Spirit of prophecy was revived in it. Zechariah was ordered to give 
 them the meeting <I>the same day</I> they came (for when they had 
 arrived they would <I>lose no time,</I> but present their offering 
 immediately), and to bid them welcome, assuring them that God now 
 accepted their gifts. He was to meet them in the house of Josiah, the
 son of Zephaniah, who probably was receiver-general for the temple, and 
 kept the treasures of it. They brought their gold and silver, to be 
 employed about the temple, but God ordered it to be used in honour of 
 One <I>greater than the temple,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:6">Matt. xii. 6</A>.

 3. Crowns are to be <I>made,</I> and <I>put upon the head of
 Joshua,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 It is supposed that there were two crowns provided, one of silver and 
 the other of gold; the former (as some think) denoting his priestly 
 dignity, the latter his kingly dignity. Or, rather, he being a priest 
 already, and having a crown of gold, of pure gold, already, to signify 
 his honour and power as a priest, these crowns of silver and gold both 
 signify the <I>royal dignity,</I> the crown of silver being perhaps 
 designed to typify the kingdom of the Messiah when he was here on 
 earth, for then he was the <I>King of Israel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:49">John i. 49</A>),

 but the crown of gold his kingdom in his exalted state, the glory of
 which as far exceeded that of the former as gold does silver. The sun 
 shines as gold, when he <I>goes forth in his strength;</I> and the 
 beams of the moon, when she <I>walks in brightness,</I> we call 
 <I>silver beams.</I> Those that had worshipped the sun and moon shall 
 now fall down before the golden and silver crowns of the exalted 
 Redeemer, before whom the sun shall be ashamed and the moon confounded, 
 being both out-shone.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The signification which God gave of this ceremony. Every one would 
 be ready to ask, "What is the meaning of Joshua's being crowned thus?" 
 And the prophet is as ready to tell them the meaning of it. Upon this 
 speaking sign is grafted a prediction, and the sign was used to make it 
 the more taken notice of and the better remembered. Now the promise 
 is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That God will, in the fulness of time, raise up a great high priest, 
 like Joshua. Tell Joshua that he is but the figure of one that is to 
 come, a faint shadow of him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>Speak unto him</I> in the name of <I>the Lord of hosts,</I> that 
 <I>the man whose name is The BRANCH</I> shall <I>grow up out of his 
 place,</I> out of Bethlehem the city of David, the place appointed for 
 his birth; though the family be a root in a dry ground, yet this branch 
 shall spring out of it, as in the spring, when the sun returns, the 
 flowers spring out of the roots, in which they lay buried out of sight 
 and out of mind. He shall <I>grow up for himself</I> (so some read it) 
 <I>propria virtute--by his own vital energy,</I> shall be exalted <I>in 
 his own strength.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That, as Joshua was an active useful instrument in building the 
 temple, so <I>the man, the branch,</I> shall be the master-builder, the 
 sole builder of the spiritual temple, the gospel-church. He <I>shall 
 build the temple of the Lord;</I> and it is repeated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 <I>Even he shall build the temple of the Lord.</I> He shall grow up to 
 do good, to be an instrument of God's glory and a great blessing to 
 mankind. Note, The gospel-church is the <I>temple of the Lord,</I> a
 <I>spiritual house</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:5">1 Pet. ii. 5</A>),
 
 a <I>holy temple,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:21">Eph. ii. 21</A>.

 In the temple God made discoveries of himself to his people, and there
 he received the service and homage of his people; so, in the 
 gospel-church, the light of divine revelation shines by the word, and 
 the spiritual sacrifices of prayer and praise are offered. Now Christ 
 is not only the foundation, but the founder, of this temple, by his 
 Spirit and grace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That Christ shall bear the glory. Glory is a burden, but not too 
 heavy for him to bear who upholds all things. The cross was his glory, 
 and he bore that; so was the crown <I>an exceeding weight of glory,</I> 
 and he bears that. The <I>government</I> is <I>upon his shoulders,</I> 
 and in it <I>he bears the glory,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:6">Isa. ix. 6</A>.

 <I>They shall hang upon him all the glory of his Father's house,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:24">Isa. xxii. 24</A>.

 It becomes him, and he is <I>par negotio--well able to bear it.</I> The
 glory of the priesthood and royalty had been divided between the house 
 of Aaron and that of David; but now he alone shall bear all the glory 
 of both. That which he shall bear, which he shall undertake, shall be
 indeed the <I>glory of Israel;</I> and they must wait for that, and, in 
 prospect of it, must be content in the want of that external glory 
 which they formerly had. He shall bear such a glory as shall make the 
 glory of this latter house greater than that of the former. He shall 
 <I>lift up the glory</I> (so it may be read); the glory of Israel had 
 been thrown down and depressed, but he shall raise it out of the 
 dust.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That he shall have a throne, and be both priest and king upon his 
 throne. A throne denotes both dignity and dominion, an exalted honour 
 with an extensive power. 

 (1.) This priest shall be a king, and his office as a priest shall be
 no diminution to his dignity as a king: <I>He shall sit and rule upon
 his throne.</I> Christ, as a priest, ever lives to make intercession
 for us; but he does it sitting at his Father's right hand, as one
 having authority, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:1">Heb. viii. 1</A>.

 We have <I>such a high priest</I> as Israel never had, for he is <I>set
 on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,</I> 
 which puts a prevailing virtue into his mediation; he that appears for 
 us within the veil is one that sits and rules there. Christ, who is 
 ordained to offer sacrifices for us, is authorized to give law to us. 
 He will not save us unless we be willing that he should govern us. God 
 has prepared him a throne <I>in the heavens;</I> and, if we would have 
 any benefit by that, we must prepare him a throne in our hearts, and be 
 willing and glad that he should <I>sit and rule upon that throne;</I> 
 and to him every thought within us must be brought into obedience. 

 (2.) This king shall be a priest, a <I>priest upon his throne.</I> With 
 the majesty and power of a king, he shall have the tenderness and 
 simplicity of a priest, who, being <I>taken from among men,</I> is 
 <I>ordained for men,</I> and <I>can have compassion on the 
 ignorant,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:1,2">Heb. v. 1, 2</A>.

 In all the acts of his government as a king he prosecutes the
 intentions of his grace as a priest. Let not therefore those that are 
 his look upon his throne, though a throne of glory and a throne of 
 judgment, with terror and amazement; for, as there is a <I>rainbow 
 about the throne,</I> so he is a <I>priest upon the throne.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. That <I>the counsel of peace shall be between them both.</I> That 
 is, 

 (1.) Between <I>Jehovah</I> and the <I>man the branch,</I> between the
 Father and the Son; the counsels concerning the peace to be made 
 between God and man, by the mediation of Christ, shall be concerted 
 (that is, shall <I>appear to have been</I> concerted) by Infinite 
 Wisdom in the covenant of redemption; the Father and the Son understood 
 one another perfectly well in that matter. Or, rather, 

 (2.) Between the priest and the throne, between the priestly and kingly 
 office of Jesus Christ. <I>The man the branch</I> must grow up to carry 
 on a <I>counsel of peace,</I> peace on earth, and, in order to that, 
 peace with heaven. God's thoughts towards us were <I>thoughts of
 peace,</I> and, in prosecution of them, he exalted his Son Christ Jesus 
 to be <I>both a prince</I> and a <I>Saviour;</I> he gave him a throne, 
 but with this proviso, that he should be a priest upon his throne, and 
 by executing the two offices of a priest and king should bring about 
 that great undertaking of man's reconciliation to God and happiness in 
 God. Some think it alludes to the former government of the Jews' state, 
 wherein the king and priest, separate officers, did take counsel one 
 with another, for the maintenance of peace and prosperity in church and 
 state, as did Zerubbabel and Joshua now. I may add, the <I>prophets of 
 God helping them.</I> So shall the peace and welfare of the 
 gospel-church, and of all believers, be wrought, though not by two 
 separate persons, yet by virtue of two separate offices meeting in 
 one--Christ purchasing all peace by his priesthood and maintaining and 
 defending it by his kingdom; so Mr. Pemble. And his prophetic office is 
 serviceable to both in this great design.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. That there shall be a happy coalition between Jews and Gentiles in 
 the gospel-church, and they shall both meet in Christ, the priest upon 
 his throne, as the centre of their unity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>Those that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the 
 Lord.</I> Some understand it of the Jews that were now afar off in 
 Babylon, that staid behind in captivity, to the great discouragement of 
 their brethren that had returned, who wanted their help in building the 
 temple. Now God promises that many of them, and some of other nations 
 too, proselyted to the Jewish religion, should come in, and lend a 
 helping hand to the building of the temple, and many hands would make 
 light work. The kings of Persia contributed to the building of the 
 temple 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:8">Ezra vi. 8</A>)

 and the furnishing of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:19,20">Ezra vii. 19, 20</A>.

 And, in after-times, Herod the Great, and others that were strangers, 
 helped to beautify and enrich the temple. But it has a further
 reference to that <I>temple of the Lord</I> which <I>the man the 
 branch</I> was to build. The Gentiles, <I>strangers afar off,</I>
 shall help to build it, for from among them God will raise up ministers 
 that shall be workers together with Christ about that building; and all 
 the Gentile converts shall be stones added to this building, so that it 
 shall <I>grow up to a holy temple,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:20-22">Eph. ii. 20-22</A>.

 When God's temple is to be built he can fetch in those that are afar
 off and employ them in the building of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. That the accomplishment of this will be a strong confirmation of the 
 truth of God's word: <I>You shall know that the Lord of hosts has sent 
 me unto you.</I> That promise, that those that were afar off should 
 come and assist them in <I>building the temple of the Lord,</I> was as 
 it were the <I>giving of them a sign;</I> by this they might be assured 
 that the other promises should be fulfilled in due time. This should be 
 fulfilled now very speedily; it was so, for those that had been their 
 enemies and accusers, in obedience to the king's edict, became their 
 helpers and did speedily what they were ordered to do for the 
 furtherance of the work, and by that means the work went on and was 
 finished; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:13,14">Ezra vi. 13, 14</A>.

 Now, by this surprising assistance which they had from afar off in
 building the temple, they might know that Zechariah, who told them of 
 it before, was sent of God, and that therefore his word concerning the 
 man the branch should be fulfilled.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 8. That these promises were strong obligations to obedience: "<I>For 
 this shall come to pass</I> (you shall have help in building the 
 temple) <I>if you will diligently obey the voice of the Lord your 
 God.</I> You shall have the help of foreigners in building the temple, 
 if you will but set about it in good earnest yourselves." The 
 assistance of others, instead of being an excuse for our slothfulness, 
 should be a spur to our industry. "You shall have the benefit and 
 comfort of all those promises if you make conscience of your duty." 
 They must know that they are upon their good behaviour; and, though 
 their God is coming towards them in a way of mercy, they cannot expect 
 him to proceed in it unless they conform to his laws. Note, That which 
 God requires of us, to qualify us for his favour, is obedience to his 
 revealed will; and it must be a diligent obedience. We cannot <I>obey 
 the voice of God</I> without a great deal of care and pains, nor will 
 our obedience be accepted of God unless it be laboured by us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The provision that was made to preserve the remembrance of this. 
 <I>The crowns</I> that were used in this solemnity were not given to 
 Joshua, but must be <I>kept for a memorial in the temple of the 
 Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Either they were laid up in the temple treasury or (as the Jews' 
 tradition is) they were hung up in the windows of the temple, in the 
 view of all, <I>in perpetuam rei memoriam--for a perpetual 
 memorial,</I> for a traditional evidence of the promise of the Messiah 
 and this typical transaction used for the confirmation of that promise.
 The crowns were delivered to those who found the materials (and some 
 think their names were engraven on the crowns), to be preserved as a 
 public testimony of their pious liberality and an encouragement to 
 others in like manner to bring presents to the house of God. Note, 
 Various means were used for the support of the faith of the 
 Old-Testament saints, who waited for the consolation of Israel, till 
 the time, the set time, for it came.</P>
