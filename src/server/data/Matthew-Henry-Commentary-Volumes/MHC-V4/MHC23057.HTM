 The prophet, in this chapter, makes his observations, 

 I. Upon the deaths of good men, comforting those that were taken away
 in their integrity and reproving those that did not make a due 
 improvement of such providences, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. Upon the gross idolatries and spiritual whoredoms which the Jews
 were guilty of, and the destroying judgments they were thereby bringing
 upon themselves,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:3-12">ver. 3-12</A>.

 III. Upon the gracious returns of God to his people to put an end to
 their captivity and re-establish their prosperity,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth <I>it</I> to heart: and
 merciful men <I>are</I> taken away, none considering that the
 righteous is taken away from the evil <I>to come.</I>
 &nbsp; 2  He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds,
 <I>each one</I> walking <I>in</I> his uprightness.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet, in the close of the foregoing chapter, had condemned the 
 watchmen for their ignorance and sottishness; here he shows the general 
 stupidity and senselessness of the people likewise. No wonder they were 
 inconsiderate when their watchmen were so, who should have awakened 
 them to consideration. We may observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The providence of God removing good men apace out of this world. 
 <I>The righteous,</I> as to this world, <I>perish;</I> they are gone 
 and their place knows them no more. Piety exempts none from the arrests 
 of death, nay, in persecuting times, the most righteous are most 
 exposed to the violences of bloody men. The first that died died a 
 martyr. Righteousness delivers from the sting of death, but not from 
 the stroke of it. They are said to <I>perish</I> because they are 
 utterly removed from us, and to express the great loss which this world 
 sustains by the removal of them, not that their death is their undoing, 
 but it often proves an undoing to the places where they lived and were 
 useful. Nay, even <I>merciful men are taken away,</I> those good men 
 that are distinguished from the righteous, for whom <I>some would even 
 dare to die,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:7">Rom. v. 7</A>.

 Those are often removed that could be worst spared; the fruitful trees
 are cut down by death and the barren left still to cumber the ground. 
 Merciful men are often taken away by the hands of men's malice. Many 
 good works they have done, and for some of them they are stoned. Before 
 the captivity in Babylon perhaps there was a more than ordinary 
 mortality of good men, so that there were scarcely any left,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:1">Jer. v. 1</A>.
 
 The godly ceased, and the faithful failed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:1">Ps. xii. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The careless world slighting these providences, and disregarding 
 them: <I>No man lays it to heart, none considers it.</I> There are very 
 few that lament it as a public loss, very few that take notice of it as 
 a public warning. The death of good men is a thing to be laid to heart 
 and considered more than common deaths. Serious enquiries ought to be 
 made, wherefore God contends with us, what good lessons are to be 
 learned by such providences, what we may do to help to make up the 
 breach and to fill up the room of those that are removed. God is justly 
 displeased when such events are not laid to heart, when the voice of 
 the rod is not heard nor the intentions of it answered, much more when 
 it is rejoiced in, as the slaying of the witnesses is, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:10">Rev. xi. 10</A>.
 
 Some of God's choicest blessings to mankind, being thus easily parted
 with, are really undervalued; and it is an evidence of very great 
 incogitancy. Little children, when they are little, least lament the 
 death of their parents, because they know not what a loss it is to 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The happiness of the righteous in their removal.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They <I>are taken away from the evil to come,</I> then when it is 
 just coming, 

 (1.) In compassion to them, that they may not <I>see the evil</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+22:20">2 Kings xxii. 20</A>),

 nor share in it, nor be in temptation by it. When the deluge is coming
 they are called into the ark, and have a hiding-place and rest in 
 heaven when there was none for them under heaven.

 (2.) In wrath to the world, to punish them for all the injuries they 
 have done to the righteous and merciful ones; those are taken away that 
 stood in the gap to turn away the judgments of God, and then what can 
 be expected but a deluge of them? It is a sign that God intends war 
 when he calls home his ambassadors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They go to be easy out of the reach of that evil. The righteous man, 
 who while he lived walked in his uprightness, when he dies <I>enters 
 into peace</I> and <I>rests in his bed.</I> Note, 

 (1.) Death is gain, and rest, and bliss, to those only who walked in 
 their uprightness, and who, when they die, can appeal to God concerning 
 it, as Hezekiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+20:3">2 Kings xx. 3</A>).

 <I>Now, Lord, remember it.</I> 

 (2.) Those that practised uprightness, and persevered in it to the end, 
 shall find it well with them when they die. Their souls then enter into 
 peace, into the world of peace, where peace is in perfection and where 
 there is no trouble. <I>Enter thou into the joy of the Lord.</I> Their
 bodies rest in their beds. Note, The grave is a bed of rest to all the 
 Lord's people; there they rest from all their labours, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:13">Rev. xiv. 13</A>.

 And the more weary they were the more welcome will that rest be to
 them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:17">Job iii. 17</A>.

 This bed is made in the darkness, but that makes it the more quiet; it
 is a bed out of which they shall rise refreshed in the morning of the 
 resurrection.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of
 the adulterer and the whore.
 &nbsp; 4  Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a
 wide mouth, <I>and</I> draw out the tongue? <I>are</I> ye not children of
 transgression, a seed of falsehood,
 &nbsp; 5  Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree,
 slaying the children in the valleys under the clifts of the
 rocks?
 &nbsp; 6  Among the smooth <I>stones</I> of the stream <I>is</I> thy portion;
 they, they <I>are</I> thy lot: even to them hast thou poured a drink
 offering, thou hast offered a meat offering. Should I receive
 comfort in these?
 &nbsp; 7  Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even
 thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.
 &nbsp; 8  Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy
 remembrance: for thou hast discovered <I>thyself to another</I> than
 me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee <I>a
 covenant</I> with them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest
 <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 9  And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst
 increase thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and
 didst debase <I>thyself even</I> unto hell.
 &nbsp; 10  Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; <I>yet</I> saidst
 thou not, There is no hope: thou hast found the life of thine
 hand; therefore thou wast not grieved.
 &nbsp; 11  And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast
 lied, and hast not remembered me, nor laid <I>it</I> to thy heart?
 have not I held my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not?
 &nbsp; 12  I will declare thy righteousness, and thy works; for they
 shall not profit thee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a high charge, but a just one no doubt, drawn up against 
 that wicked generation out of which God's righteous ones were removed, 
 because the world was not worthy of them. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The general character here given of them, or the name and title by 
 which they stand indicted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 They are told to draw near and hear the charge, are set to the bar, and
 arraigned there as <I>sons of the sorceress,</I> or of a witch, <I>the 
 seed of an adulterer and a whore,</I> that is, they were such 
 themselves, they were strongly inclined to be such, and their ancestors 
 were such before them. Sin is sorcery and adultery, for it is departing 
 from God and dealing with the devil. They were <I>children of 
 disobedience.</I> "Come," says the prophet, "draw near hither, and I 
 will read you your doom; to the righteous death will bring peace and 
 rest, but not to you; you are <I>children of transgression</I> and <I>a 
 seed of falsehood</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 that have it by kind, and have it woven into your very nature, to 
 backslide from God and to deal treacherously with him,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:8"><I>ch.</I> xlviii. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The particular crimes laid to their charge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Scoffing at God and his word. They were a generation of scorners 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>Against whom do you sport yourselves?</I> You think it is only 
 against the poor prophets whom you trample upon as contemptible men, 
 but really it is against God himself, who sends them, and whose message 
 they deliver." Mocking the messengers of the Lord was Jerusalem's 
 measure-filling sin, for what was done to them God took as done to 
 himself. When they were reproved for their sins, and threatened with 
 the judgments of God, they ridiculed the word of God with the rudest 
 and most indecent gestures and expressions of disdain. They sported 
 themselves, and made themselves merry, with that which should have made 
 them serious, and under which they should have humbled themselves.
 They made wry mouths at the prophets, and drew out the tongue, contrary 
 to all the laws of good breeding; nor did they treat God's prophets 
 with the common civility with which they would have treated a 
 gentleman's servant that had been sent to them on an errand. Note,
 Those who mock at God, and bid defiance to his judgments, had best 
 consider who it is towards whom they conduct themselves so 
 insolently.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Idolatry. This was that sin which the people of the Jews were most 
 notoriously guilty of before the captivity; but that affliction cured 
 them of it. In Isaiah's time it abounded, witness the abominable 
 idolatries of Ahaz (which some think are particularly referred to here) 
 and of Manasseh. 

 (1.) They were dotingly fond of their idols, were inflamed with them, 
 as those that burn in unlawful unnatural lusts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:27">Rom. i. 27</A>.

 They were <I>mad upon their idols,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:38">Jer. l. 38</A>.

 They inflamed themselves with them by their violent passions in the
 worship of them, as those of Baal's prophets that <I>leaped upon the 
 altar, and cut themselves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:26,28">1 Kings xviii. 26, 28</A>.

 Note, Vile corruptions, the more they are gratified the more they are
 inflamed. They worshipped their idols <I>under every green tree,</I> in 
 the open air, and in the shade; yet that did not cool the heat of their 
 impetuous lusts, but rather the charming beauty of the green trees made 
 them the more fond of their idols which they worshipped there. Thus 
 that in nature which is pleasing, instead of drawing them to the God of 
 nature, drew them from him. The flame of their zeal in the worship of 
 false gods may shame us for our coldness and indifference in the 
 worship of the true God. They strove to inflame themselves, but we 
 distract and deaden ourselves.

 (2.) They were barbarous and unnaturally cruel in the worship of their 
 idols. They slew their children, and offered them in sacrifice to their 
 idols, not only in the valley of the son of Hinnom, the headquarters of 
 that monstrous idolatry, but in other valleys, in imitation of that, 
 and <I>under the cliffs of the rock,</I> in dark and solitary places, 
 the fittest for such works of darkness. 

 (3.) They were abundant and insatiable in their idolatries. They never 
 thought they could have idols enough, nor could spend enough upon them 
 and do enough in their service. The Syrians had once a notion of the 
 God of Israel that he was a God of the hills, but not a <I>God of the 
 valleys</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:28">1 Kings xx. 28</A>);

 but these idolaters, to make sure work, had both.

 [1.] They had gods of the valleys, which they worshipped in the low 
 places by the water side

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Among the smooth stones of the valley,</I> or brook, <I>is thy 
 portion.</I> If they saw a smooth carved stone, though set up but for a 
 way-mark or a mere-stone, they were ready to worship it, as the papists 
 do crosses. Or in stony valleys they set up their gods, which they 
 called their <I>portion,</I> and took for their lot, as God's people 
 take him for their lot and portion. But these gods of stone would 
 really be no better a portion for them, no better a lot, than the 
 smooth stones of the stream near which they were set up, for sometimes 
 they worshipped their rivers. "<I>They, they, are the lot</I> which 
 thou trustest to and art pleased with, but thou shalt be put off with 
 it for thy lot, and miserable will thy case be." See the folly of 
 sinners, who take the smooth stones of the stream for their portion, 
 when they might have the precious stones of God's Jerusalem, and the 
 high priest's ephod, to portion themselves with. Having taken these 
 idols for their lot and portion, they stick at no charge in doing 
 honour to them: "<I>To them hast thou poured a drink-offering, and 
 offered a meat-offering,</I> as if they had given thee thy meat and 
 drink." They loved their idols better than their children, for their 
 own tables must be robbed to replenish the altars of their idols. Have 
 we taken the true God for our portion? Is he, even he, our lot? Let us 
 then serve him with our meat and drink, not, as they did, by depriving 
 ourselves of the use of them, but by eating and drinking to his glory.
 Here, in a parenthesis, comes in an expression of God's just resentment 
 of this wickedness of theirs: <I>Should I receive comfort in 
 these</I>--in such a people as this? Can those expect that God will 
 take any pleasure in them, or accept their devotions at his altar, who 
 thus serve Baal with the gifts of his providence? God takes comfort in 
 his people, while they are faithful to him; but what comfort can he 
 take in them when those that should be his witnesses against the 
 idolatries of the world do themselves fall in with them? <I>Should I 
 have compassion on these?</I> (so some), or <I>should I repent me 
 concerning these?</I> so others. "How can they expect that I should
 spare them, and either adjourn or abate their punishment, when they are 
 so very provoking? <I>Shall I not visit for these things?</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:7,9">Jer. v. 7, 9</A>.

 [2.] They had gods of the hills too 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "<I>Upon a lofty and high mountain</I> (as if thou wouldst vie with the 
 high and lofty One himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 <I>hast thou set thy bed,</I> thy idol, thy idol's temple and altar, 
 the bed of thy uncleanness, where thou committest spiritual whoredom, 
 with all the wantonness of an idolatrous fancy, and in direct violation 
 of the covenant of thy God. <I>Thither wentest thou up</I> readily
 enough, though it was up-hill, <I>to offer sacrifice.</I>" Some think 
 this bespeaks the impudence they arrived at in their idolatries; at 
 first they had some sense of shame, when they worshipped their idols in 
 the valleys, in obscure places; but they soon conquered that, and came 
 to do it upon the lofty high mountains. They were not ashamed, neither 
 could they blush.

 [3.] As if these were not enough, they had household-gods too, their 
 <I>lares</I> and <I>penates. Behind the doors and the posts</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 where the law of God should be written for a memorandum to them of 
 their duty, they set up the remembrance of their idols, not so much to 
 keep up their own remembrance of them (they were so fond of them that 
 they could not forget them), but to show to others how mindful they 
 were of them, and to put their children in mind of them, and possess 
 them betimes with a veneration for these dunghill deities.

 [4.] As they were insatiable in their idolatries, so they were 
 inseparable from them. They were hardened in their wickedness; they 
 worshipped their idols openly and in public view, as being neither 
 ashamed of the sin nor afraid of the punishment; they went as publicly, 
 and in as great crowds, to the idol-temples, as ever they had gone to 
 God's house. This was like an impudent harlot, <I>discovering 
 themselves to another than God,</I> making profession of another than 
 the true religion. They took a pride in making proselytes to their 
 idolatries, and not only went up themselves to their high places, but 
 <I>enlarged their bed,</I> that is, their idol-temples, and (as the 
 margin reads the following words) <I>thou hewedst it for thyself larger 
 than theirs,</I> than theirs from whom thou copiedst it, and tookest 
 the platform of it, as Ahaz of his altar from that which he saw at 
 Damascus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:10">2 Kings xvi. 10</A>.

 And being thus involved over head and ears, as it were, in their
 idolatries, there is no parting them from them. Ephraim is now joined
 to idols both in love and league. <I>First,</I> In league: "<I>Thou 
 hast made a covenant with them,</I> with the idols, with the 
 idol-worshippers, to live and die together." This was a complete 
 renunciation of their covenant with God and an avowed resolution to 
 persist in their apostasy from him. <I>Secondly,</I> In love: "<I>Thou
 lovedst their bed,</I> that is, the temple of an idol, wherever thou 
 sawest it." Justly therefore were they given up to their own hearts' 
 lusts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Another sin charged upon them is their trusting in and seeking to 
 foreign aids and succours, and contracting a communion with the Gentile 
 powers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Thou wentest to the king,</I> which some understand of the idol they 
 worshipped, particularly <I>Moloch,</I> which signifies <I>a king.</I> 
 "Thou didst every thing to ingratiate thyself with those idols, didst 
 offer incense and sweet ointments at their altars." Or it may be meant 
 of the king of Assyria, whom Ahaz made his court to, or of the king of 
 Babylon, whose ambassadors Hezekiah caressed, or of other kings of the 
 nations whose idolatrous usages they admired and were desirous to learn 
 and imitate, and for that end went and sent to cultivate an 
 acquaintance and correspondence with them, that they might be like them 
 and strengthen themselves by an alliance with them. See here, 

 (1.) What an expense they were at in forming and procuring this grand 
 alliance. They went <I>with ointments and perfumes,</I> either
 bestowed upon themselves, to beautify their own faces and so make 
 themselves considerable and worthy the friendship of the greatest king, 
 or to be presented to those whose favour they were ambitious of, 
 because a man's gift makes room for him and brings him before great 
 men. "When the first present of rich perfumes was thought too little, 
 thou didst increase them;" and thus many seek the ruler's favour, 
 forgetting that, after all, every man's judgment proceeds from the 
 Lord. So fond were they of those heathen princes that they not only 
 went themselves, in all their airs, to those that were near them, but 
 sent messengers to those that were afar off,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+18:2"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 2</A>.

 (2.) How much they hereby disparaged themselves and laid the honour of 
 their crown and nation in the dust: <I>Thou didst debase thyself even 
 unto hell.</I> They did so by their idolatries. It is a dishonour to 
 the children of men, who are endued with the powers of reason, to 
 worship that as their god which is the creature of their own fancy and 
 the work of their own hands, to bow down to the stock of a tree. It is 
 much more a dishonour to the children of God, who are blessed with the 
 privilege of divine revelation, to forsake such a God as they know 
 theirs to be for a thing of nought, their own mercies for lying 
 vanities. They likewise debased themselves by truckling to their 
 heathen neighbours, and depending upon them, when they had a God to go 
 to who is all-sufficient and in covenant with them. How did those shame 
 themselves to the highest degree, and sink themselves to the lowest, 
 that forsook the fountain of life for broken cisterns and the rock of 
 ages for broken reeds! Note, Sinners disparage and debase themselves; 
 the service of sin is an ignominious slavery; and those who thus debase 
 themselves to hell will justly have their portion there.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The aggravations of their sin. 

 1. They had been tired with disappointments in their wicked courses,
 and yet they would not be convinced of the folly of them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "<I>Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way;</I> thou hast 
 undertaken a mighty task, to find out true satisfaction and happiness 
 in that which is vanity and a lie." Those that set up idols, instead of 
 God, for the object of their worship, and princes, instead of God, for 
 the object of their hope and confidence, and think thus to better 
 themselves and make themselves easy, go a great way about, and will 
 never come to their journey's end: <I>Thou art wearied in the 
 multitude,</I> or <I>multiplicity, of thy ways</I> (so some read it): 
 those that forsake the only right way wander endlessly in a thousand 
 by-paths, and lose themselves in the many inventions which they have 
 sought out. They weary themselves with fresh chases and fierce ones, 
 but never gain their point, like the Sodomites, that <I>wearied 
 themselves to find the door</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:11">Gen. xix. 11</A>)

 and could not find it at last. The pleasures of sin will soon surfeit,
 but never satisfy; a man may quickly tire himself in the pursuit of 
 them, but can never repose himself in the enjoyment of them. They found 
 this by experience. The idols they had often worshipped never did them 
 any kindness; the kings they courted distressed them, and helped them 
 not; and yet they were so wretchedly besotted that they could not say, 
 "<I>There is no hope;</I> it is in vain any longer to expect that 
 satisfaction in creature-confidences, and in the worship of idols, 
 which we have so often looked for, and never met with." Note, Despair 
 of happiness in the creature, and of satisfaction in the service of 
 sin, is the first step towards a well-grounded hope of happiness in God 
 and a well-fixed resolution to keep to his service; and those are 
 inexcusable who have had sensible convictions of the vanity of the 
 creature, and yet will not be brought to say, "There is no hope to be 
 happy short of the Creator."

 2. Though they were convinced that the way they were in was a sinful
 way, yet, because they had found some present sensual pleasure and 
 worldly profit by it, they could not persuade themselves to be sorry 
 for it: "<I>Thou hast found the life of thy hand</I>" (or <I>the living 
 of it</I>); thou boastest how fortune smiles upon thee, and therefore 
 thou art not grieved, any more than Ephraim when he said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:8">Hos. xii. 8</A>),

 "<I>I have become rich; I have found out substance.</I>" Note,
 Prosperity in sin is a great bar to conversion from sin. Those that 
 live at ease in their sinful projects, are tempted to think God favours 
 them, and therefore they have nothing to repent of. Some read it 
 ironically, or by way of question: "Thou hast found the life of thy 
 hand, hast found true satisfaction and happiness, no doubt thou hast; 
 hast thou not? And therefore thou art so far from being grieved that 
 thou blessest thyself in thy own evil way; but review thy gains once 
 more, and come to a balance of profit and loss, and then say, What 
 fruit hast thou of those things whereof thou art ashamed and for which 
 <I>God shall bring thee into judgment?</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:21">Rom. vi. 21</A>.

 3. They had dealt very unworthily with God by their sin; for,

 (1.) It should seem they pretended that the reason why they left God 
 was because he was too terrible a majesty for them to deal with; they 
 must have gods that they could be more free and familiar with. "But,"
 says God, "<I>of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast 
 lied,</I> that thou hast dealt falsely and treacherously with me, and 
 dissembled in thy covenants with me and prayers to me? What did I ever 
 do to frighten thee from me? What occasion have I given thee to think 
 hardly of me, that thou hast gone to seek a kinder master?" 

 (2.) However, it is certain that they had no true reverence of God nor 
 any serious regard to him. So that question is commonly understood, 
 "<I>Of whom hast thou been afraid, or feared?</I> Of none; for thou 
 hast not feared me whom thou shouldst fear; for thou hast lied to me." 
 Those that dissemble with God make it to appear they stand in no awe of 
 him. "Thou <I>hast not remembered me,</I> neither what I have said nor
 what I have done, neither the promises nor the threatenings, nor the 
 performances of either; thou hast <I>not laid them to thy heart,</I> as 
 thou wouldst have done if thou hadst feared me." Note, Those who lay 
 not the word of God and his providences to their hearts do thereby show 
 that they have not the fear of God before their eyes. And multitudes 
 are ruined by fearlessness, forgetfulness, and mere carelessness; they 
 do not aright nor to good purpose fear any thing, remember any thing, 
 nor lay any thing to heart. Nay, 

 (3.) They were hardened in their sin by the patience and forbearance of 
 God. "<I>Have not I held my peace of old,</I> and for a long time? 
 These things thou hast done and I kept silence. And therefore, as it 
 follows here, thou fearest me not;" as if because God had spared long 
 he would never punish, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:11">Eccl. viii. 11</A>.

 Because he kept silence the sinner thought him altogether such a one as
 himself, and stood in no awe of him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Here is God's resolution to call them to an account, though he had 
 long borne with them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 "<I>I will declare</I> (like that, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:21">Ps. l. 21</A>,

 <I>But I will reprove thee), I will declare thy righteousness,</I> 
 which thou makest thy boast of, and let the world see, and thyself too, 
 to thy confusion, that it is all a sham, all a cheat, it is not what it 
 pretends to be. When thy righteousness comes to be examined it will be
 found that it was unrighteousness, and that there was no sincerity in 
 all thy pretensions. I will declare <I>thy works,</I> what they have 
 been and what the gain thou pretendest to have gotten by them, and it 
 will appear that at long-run <I>they shall not profit thee,</I> nor 
 turn to any account." Note, Sinful works, as they are works of 
 darkness, and there is no reason nor righteousness in them, so they are 
 unfruitful works and there is nothing got by them; and, however they 
 look now, it will be made to appear so another day. Sin profits not,
 nay, it ruins and destroys.</P>

 Here, 

 I. God shows how insufficient idols and creatures were to relieve and 
 succour those that worshipped them and confided in them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):
 
 "<I>When thou criest</I> in thy distress and anguish, lamentest thy 
 misery and callest for help, <I>let thy companies deliver thee,</I> thy 
 idol-gods which thou hast heaped to thyself companies of, the troops of 
 the confederate forces which thou hast relied so much upon, let them 
 deliver thee if they can; expect no other relief than what they can 
 give." Thus God said to Israel, when in their trouble they called upon 
 him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:14">Judg. x. 14</A>),

 <I>Go, and cry to the gods which you have chosen, let them deliver
 you.</I> But in vain is salvation hoped for from them: <I>The wind 
 shall carry them all away,</I> the wind of God's wrath, that breath of 
 his mouth which shall slay the wicked; they have made themselves as 
 chaff, and therefore the wind will of course hurry them away. Vanity 
 they are, and <I>vanity shall take them</I> away, to vanity they shall 
 be reduced, and vanity shall be their recompence. Both the idols and
 their worshippers shall come to nothing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He shows that there was a sufficiency, an all-sufficiency, in him
 for the comfort and deliverance of all those that put their confidence 
 in him and made their application to him. Their safety and satisfaction 
 appear the more comfortable because their hopes are crowned with 
 fruition, when those that seek to other helpers have their hopes 
 frustrated: "<I>He that puts his trust in me,</I> and in me only, he 
 shall be happy, both for soul and body, for this world and the 
 other."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Observe, in general, 

 (1.) Those that trust in God's providence take the best course to 
 secure their secular interests. They <I>shall possess the land,</I> as 
 much of it as is good for them, and what they have they shall have it 
 from a good hand and hold it by a good title.
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:3">Ps. xxxvii. 3</A>,

 <I>They shall dwell in the land, and verily they shall be fed.</I>

 (2.) Those that trust in God's grace take the best course to secure 
 their sacred interests. They <I>shall inherit my holy mountain.</I> 
 They shall enjoy the privileges of the church on earth, and be brought 
 at length to the joys of heaven; and no wind shall carry them away.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. More particularly,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The captives, that trust in God, shall be released 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):
 
 <I>They shall say</I> (that is, the messengers of his providence, in 
 that great event shall say), <I>Cast you up, cast you up, prepare the 
 way.</I> When God's time shall have come for their deliverance the way 
 of bringing it about shall be made plain and easy, obstacles shall be 
 removed, difficulties that seemed insuperable shall be speedily got 
 over, and all things shall concur both to accelerate and facilitate 
 their return. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:3,4"><I>ch.</I> xl. 3, 4</A>.

 This refers to the provision which the gospel, and the grace of it,
 have made for our ready passage through this world to a better. The way 
 of religion is now cast up; it is a highway; ministers' business is to 
 direct people in it, and to help them over the discouragements they 
 meet with, that nothing may offend them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The contrite, that trust in God, shall be <I>revived,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 Those that trusted to idols and creatures for help went with their 
 <I>ointments and perfumes</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 but here God shows that those who may expect help from him are such as 
 are destitute of, and set themselves at a distance from, the gaieties 
 of the world and the delights of sense. God's glory appears here very 
 bright, 

 [1.] In his greatness and majesty: He is <I>the high and lofty One that 
 inhabits eternity.</I> Let this inspire us with very high and 
 honourable thoughts of the God with whom we have to do, <I>First,</I> 
 That his being and perfections are exalted infinitely above every 
 creature, not only above what they have themselves, but above what they 
 can conceive concerning him, <I>far above all their blessing and 
 praise,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:5">Neh. ix. 5</A>.

 <I>He is the high and lofty One,</I> and there is no creature like him,
 nor any to be compared with him. The language likewise intimates his 
 sovereign dominion over all and the incontestable right he has to give 
 both law and judgment to all. He is <I>higher than the highest</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:8">Eccl. v. 8</A>),

 than the <I>highest heavens,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+113:4">Ps. cxiii. 4</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> That with him there is neither beginning of days nor
 end of life, nor change of time; he is both immortal and immutable. He
 only <I>has immortality,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:16">1 Tim. vi. 16</A>.

 He has it of himself, and he has it constantly; he inhabits it, and
 cannot be dispossessed of it. We must shortly remove into eternity, but 
 God always inhabits it. <I>Thirdly,</I> That there is an infinite
 rectitude in his nature, and an exact conformity with himself and a 
 steady design of his own glory in all that he does; and this appears in 
 every thing by which he has made himself known, for his name is 
 <I>holy,</I> and all that desire to be acquainted with him must know 
 him as a holy God. <I>Fourthly,</I> That the peculiar residence and 
 manifestation of his glory are in the mansions of light and bliss 
 above: "<I>I dwell in the high and holy place,</I> and will have all 
 the world to know it." Whoever have any business with God must direct 
 to him as their Father in heaven, for there he dwells. These great 
 things are here said of God to inspire us with a holy reverence of him, 
 to encourage our confidence in him, and to magnify his compassion and 
 condescension to us, that though he is thus high yet he has respect 
 unto the lowly; he that rides on the heavens by his name JAH stoops to 
 concern himself for poor <I>widows</I> and <I>fatherless,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:4,5">Ps. lxviii. 4, 5</A>.

 [2.] In his grace and mercy. He has a tender pity for the humble and
 contrite, for those that are so in respect of their state. If they be 
 his people, he will not overlook them though they are poor and low in 
 the world, and despised and trampled upon by men; but he here refers to 
 the temper of their mind; he will have a tender regard to those who, 
 being in affliction, accommodate themselves to their affliction, and 
 bring their mind to their condition, be it ever so low and ever so sad 
 and sorely broken--those that are truly penitent for sin, who mourn in 
 secret for it, and have a dread of the wrath of God, which they have 
 made themselves obnoxious to, and are submissive under all his rebukes.
 Now, <I>First,</I> With these God will dwell. He will visit them 
 graciously, will converse familiarly with them by his word and Spirit, 
 as a man does with those of his own family; he will be always nigh to 
 them and present with them. He that dwells in the highest heavens 
 dwells in the lowest hearts and inhabits sincerity as surely as he 
 inhabits eternity. In these he delights. <I>Secondly,</I> He will
 revive their heart and spirit, will speak that to them, and work that 
 in them by the word and Spirit of his grace, which will be reviving to 
 them, as a cordial to one that is ready to faint. He will give them 
 reviving joys and hopes sufficient to counterbalance all the griefs and 
 fears that break their spirits. He dwells with them, and his presence 
 is reviving.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Those with whom he contends, if they trust in him, shall be 
 relieved, and received into favour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 He will <I>revive the heart of the contrite ones,</I> for he will not 
 contend for ever. Nothing makes a soul contrite so much as God's 
 contending, and therefore nothing revives it so much as his ceasing his 
 controversy. Here is,

 [1.] A gracious promise. It is not promised that he will never be angry 
 with his people, for their sins are displeasing to him, or that he will 
 never contend with them, for they must expect the rod; but he <I>will 
 not contend for ever,</I> nor be always wroth. As he is not soon angry, 
 so he is not long angry. He will not always chide. Though he contend 
 with them by convictions of sin, he will not contend for ever; but, 
 instead of the spirit of bondage, they shall receive the Spirit of 
 adoption. He has torn, but he will heal. Though eh contend with them by 
 the rebukes of providence, yet the correction shall not last always, 
 shall not last long, shall last no longer than there is need 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:6">1 Pet. i. 6</A>),

 no longer than they can bear, no longer than till it has done its work.
 Though their whole life be calamitous, yet their end will be peace, and 
 so will their eternity be.

 [2.] A very compassionate consideration, upon which this promise is 
 grounded: "If I should contend for ever, <I>the spirit would fail 
 before me, ever the souls which I have made.</I>" Note, <I>First,</I> 
 God is the Father of spirits, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:9">Heb. xii. 9</A>.

 Those with whom he will not always contend are the souls that he has
 made, that he gave being to by creation and a new being to by 
 regeneration. <I>Secondly,</I> Though the Lord is for the body, yet he 
 concerns himself chiefly for the souls of his people, that the spirit 
 do not fail, and its graces and comforts. <I>Thirdly,</I> When
 troubles last long, the spirit even of good men is apt to fail. They
 are tempted to entertain hard thoughts of God, to think it in vain to 
 serve him; they are ready to put comfort away from them, and to despair 
 of relief, and then the spirit fails. <I>Fourthly,</I> It is in
 consideration of this that God will not contend for ever; for he will 
 not forsake the work of his own hands nor defeat the purchase of his 
 Son's blood. The reason is taken not from our merit, but from our 
 weakness and infirmity; for <I>he remembers that we are flesh</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:39">Ps. lxxviii. 39</A>)
 
 and that flesh is weak.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The body of the people of Israel, in this account of God's dealings 
 with them, is spoken of as a particular person 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>),

 but divided into two sorts, differently dealt with--some who were sons 
 of peace, to whom peace is spoken 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 and others who were not, who have nothing to do with peace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.
 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The just rebukes which that people were brought under for their sin: 
 <I>For the iniquity of his covetousness I was wroth, and smote him.</I> 
 Covetousness was a sin that abounded very much among that people. 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:13">Jer. vi. 13</A>,

 <I>From the least to the greatest of them, every one is given to 
 covetousness.</I> Those that did not worship images were yet carried 
 away by this spiritual idolatry: for such is covetousness; it is making 
 money the god,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:5">Col. iii. 5</A>.

 No marvel that the people were covetous when their watchmen themselves
 were notoriously so,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:11"><I>ch.</I> lvi. 11</A>,

 Yet, covetous as they were, in the service of their idols they were
 prodigal, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 And it is hard to say whether their profuseness in that or their 
 covetousness in every thing else was more provoking. But for this 
 iniquity, among others, God was angry with them, and brought one 
 judgment after another upon them, and their destruction at last by the 
 Chaldeans.

 1. God was wroth. He resented it, took it very ill that a people who
 were devoted to himself, and portioned in himself, should be so 
 entirely given up to the world and choose that for their portion.
 Note, Covetousness is an iniquity that is very displeasing to the God 
 of heaven. It is a heart-sin, but he sees it, and <I>therefore</I> 
 hates it, and looks upon it with jealousy, because it sets up a rival 
 with him in the soul. It is a sin which men <I>bless themselves in</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:18">Ps. xlix. 18</A>)
 
 and in which their neighbours <I>bless them</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:3">Ps. x. 3</A>);
 
 but God abhors it.

 2. He motes him, reproved him for it by his prophets, corrected him by 
 his providence, punished him in those very things he so doted upon and 
 was covetous of. Note, Sinners shall be made to feel from the anger of 
 God. Those whom he is wroth with he smites; and covetousness 
 particularly lays men under the tokens of God's displeasure. Those that 
 set their hearts upon the wealth of this world are disappointed of it 
 or it is embittered to them; it is either clogged with a cross or 
 turned into a curse. 

 3. God hid himself from him when he was under these rebukes, and
 continued wroth with him. When we are under the rod, if God manifest 
 himself to us, we may bear it the better; but if he both smite us and 
 hide himself from us, send us no prophets, speak to us no comfortable 
 word, show us no token for good, if he <I>tear and go away</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:14">Hos. v. 14</A>),
 
 we are very miserable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Their obstinacy and incorrigibleness under these rebukes: <I>He 
 went on frowardly in the way of his heart,</I> in his evil way. He was 
 not sensible of the displeasure of God that he was under. He felt the 
 smart of the rod, but had no regard at all to the hand; the more he was 
 crossed in his worldly pursuits the more eager he was in them. He 
 either would not see his error or if he saw it would not amend it. 
 Covetousness was the way of his heart; it was what he was inclined to 
 and intent upon, and he would not be reclaimed, but <I>in his distress 
 he trespassed yet more,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:22">2 Chron. xxviii. 22</A>.

 See the strength of the corruption of men's hearts, and the sinfulness
 of sin, which will take its course in despite of God himself and all 
 the flames of his wrath. See also how insufficient afflictions of
 themselves are to reform men, unless God's grace work with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. God's wonderful return in mercy to them, notwithstanding the 
 obstinacy of the generality of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The greater part of them went on frowardly, but there were some 
 among them that were mourners for the obstinacy of the rest; and with 
 an eye to them, or rather for his own name's sake, God determines not 
 to contend for ever with them. <I>With the froward</I> God may justly 
 <I>show himself froward</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:26">Ps. xviii. 26</A>),

 and <I>walk contrary</I> to those that <I>walk contrary</I> to him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:24">Lev. xxvi. 24</A>.

 When this sinner here went on frowardly in the way of his heart, one
 would think it should have followed, "I have seen his ways and will 
 destroy him, will abandon him, will never have any thing more to do 
 with him." But such are the riches of divine mercy and grace, and so do 
 they rejoice against judgment, that it follows, <I>I have seen his ways 
 and will heal him.</I> See how God's goodness takes occasion from man's 
 badness to appear so much the more illustrious; and where sin has 
 abounded grace much more abounds. God's reasons of mercy are fetched 
 from within himself, for in us there appears nothing but what is 
 provoking: "I have seen his ways, and yet I will heal him for my own 
 name's sake." God knew how bad the people were, and yet would not cast 
 them off. But observe the method. God will first give him grace, and 
 then, and not till then, give him peace: "I have seen his way, that he 
 will never turn to me of himself, and therefore I will turn him." Those 
 whom God has mercy in store for he has grace in readiness for, to 
 prepare and qualify them for that mercy which they were running from as 
 fast as they could.

 (1.) God will heal him of his corrupt and vicious disposition, will 
 cure him of his covetousness, though it be ever so deeply rooted in him 
 and his heart have been long exercised to covetous practices. There is 
 no spiritual disease so inveterate, but almighty grace can conquer it. 
 
 (2.) God <I>will lead him also;</I> not only amend what was amiss in 
 him, that he may cease to do evil, but direct him into the way of duty, 
 that he may learn to do well. He goes on frowardly, as Saul, yet 
 breathing out threatenings and slaughter, but God will lead him into a 
 better mind, a better path. And them, 

 (3.) He will restore those comforts to him which he had forfeited and 
 lost, and for the return of which he had thus prepared him. There was a 
 wonderful reformation wrought upon captives in Babylon, and then a 
 wonderful redemption wrought for them, which brought comfort to them, 
 to their mourners, to those among them that mourned for their own sins, 
 the sins of their people, and the desolations of the sanctuary. To 
 those mourners the mercy would be most comfortable, and to them God had 
 an eye in working it out. Blessed are those that mourn, for to them 
 comfort belongs, and they shall have it.</P>

 2. Now, as when that people went into captivity some of them were good 
 figs, very good, others of them bad figs, very bad, and accordingly 
 their captivity was to them for their good or for <I>their hurt</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+24:8,9">Jer. xxiv. 8, 9</A>),

 so, when they came out of captivity, still some of them were good,
 others bad, and the deliverance was to them accordingly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) To those among them that were good their return out of captivity 
 was peace, such peace as was a type and earnest of the peace which 
 should be preached by Jesus Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>I create the fruit of the lips, peace.</I> 

 [1.] God designed to give them matter for praise and thanksgiving, for 
 that is the <I>fruit of the lips</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:15">Heb. xiii. 15</A>),

 the <I>calves of the lips,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:2">Hos. xiv. 2</A>.

 <I>I create this.</I> Creation is out of nothing, and this is surely
 out of worse than nothing, when God creates matter of praise for those 
 that went on frowardly in the way of their heart.

 [2.] In order to this, peace shall be published: <I>Peace, peace</I> 
 (perfect peace, all kinds of peace) <I>to him that is afar off</I> from 
 the general rendezvous, or from the head-quarters, as well as <I>to him 
 that is near.</I> Peace with God; though he has contended with them, he 
 will be reconciled and will let fall his controversy. Peace of
 conscience, a holy security and serenity of mind, after the many 
 reproaches of conscience and agitations of spirit they had been under 
 their captivity. Thus God creates the fruit of the lips, fresh matter 
 for thanksgiving; for, when he speaks peace to us, we must speak 
 praises to him. This peace is itself of God's creating. He, and he 
 only, can work it; it is the fruit of the lips, of his lips--he 
 commands it, of the minister's lips--he speaks it by them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:1"><I>ch.</I> xl. 1</A>.

 It is the fruit of preaching lips and praying lips; it is the fruit of
 Christ's lips, whose lips drop as a honeycomb; for to him this is 
 applied, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:17">Eph. ii. 17</A>:

 <I>He came and preached peace to you who were afar off,</I> you
 Gentiles as well as to the Jews, who were nigh-to after-ages, who were 
 afar off in time, as well as to those of the present age.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) To those among them that were wicked, though they might return 
 with the rest, their return was no peace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 The wicked, wherever he is, in Babylon or in Jerusalem, carries about 
 with him the principle of his own uneasiness, and is like the troubled 
 sea. God healed those to whom he spoke peace

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>I will heal them;</I> all shall be well again and set to rights; but 
 the wicked would not be healed by the grace of God and therefore shall 
 not be healed by his comforts. They are always like the sea in a storm, 
 for they carry about with them, 

 [1.] Unmortified corruptions. They are not cured and conquered, and 
 their ungoverned lusts and passions make them like the troubled sea 
 when it cannot rest, vexatious to all about them and therefore uneasy 
 to themselves, noisy and dangerous. When the intemperate heats of the 
 spirit break out in scurrilous and abusive language, then the troubled 
 sea casts forth mire and dirt. 

 [2.] Unpacified consciences. They are under a frightful apprehension of 
 guilt and wrath, that they cannot enjoy themselves; when they seem 
 settled they are in disquietude, when they seem merry they are in 
 heaviness; like Cain, who always dwelt in the land of shaking. The 
 terrors of conscience disturb all their enjoyments, and cast forth such 
 mire and dirt as make them a burden to themselves. Though this does not 
 appear (it may be) at present, yet it is a certain truth, what this 
 prophet had said before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:22"><I>ch.</I> xlviii. 22</A>),

 and here repeats 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 <I>There is no peace to the wicked,</I> no reconciliation to God (nor
 can they be upon good terms with him, while they go on still in their 
 trespasses), no quietness or satisfaction in their own mind, no real 
 good, no peace in death, because no hope. <I>My God hath said it,</I> 
 and all the world cannot unsay it, That there is no peace to those that 
 allow themselves in any sin. What have they to do with peace?</P>
