 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The scope of this chapter is much the same with that of the foregoing 
 chapter--to confirm the promise of the restoration of the Jews,
 notwithstanding the present desolations of their country and 
 dispersions of their people. And these promises have, both in type and 
 tendency, a reference as far forward as to the gospel church, to which 
 this second edition of the Jewish church was at length to resign its 
 dignities and privileges. It is here promised, 

 I. That the city shall be rebuilt and re-established "in statu quo--in
 its former state," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. That the captives, having their sins pardoned, shall be restored, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:7,8">ver. 7, 8</A>.

 III. That this shall redound very much to the glory of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:9">ver. 9</A>.

 IV. That the country shall have both joy and plenty,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:10-14">ver. 10-14</A>.

 V. That way shall be made for the coming of the Messiah,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:15,16">ver. 15, 16</A>.
 
 VI. That the house of David, the house of Levi, and the house of
 Israel, shall flourish again, and be established, and all three in the 
 kingdom of Christ; a gospel ministry and the gospel church shall 
 continue while the world stands, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:17-26">ver. 17-26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Moreover the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto Jeremiah the second
 time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison,
 saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> the maker thereof, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> that formed
 it, to establish it; the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> his name;
 &nbsp; 3  Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and
 mighty things, which thou knowest not.
 &nbsp; 4  For thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the God of Israel, concerning the
 houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of
 Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword;
 &nbsp; 5  They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but <I>it is</I> to fill
 them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine anger
 and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face
 from this city.
 &nbsp; 6  Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure
 them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.
 &nbsp; 7  And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of
 Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.
 &nbsp; 8  And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they
 have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities,
 whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed
 against me.
 &nbsp; 9  And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and a honour
 before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the
 good that I do unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for all
 the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe here, 

 I. The date of this comfortable prophecy which God entrusted Jeremiah 
 with. It is not exact in the time, only that it was after that in the 
 foregoing chapter, when things were still growing worse and worse; it 
 was <I>the second time. God speaketh once, yea, twice,</I> for the 
 encouragement of his people. We are not only so disobedient that we 
 have need of <I>precept upon precept</I> to bring us to our duty, but 
 so distrustful that we have need of promise upon promise to bring us to 
 our comfort. This word, as the former, <I>came to Jeremiah</I> when 
 <I>he was in prison.</I> Note, No confinement can deprive God's people 
 of his presence; no locks nor bars can shut out his gracious visits; 
 nay, oftentimes <I>as their afflictions abound their consolations much 
 more abound,</I> and they have the most reviving communications of his 
 favour when the world frowns upon them. Paul's sweetest epistles were 
 those that bore date out of a prison.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The prophecy itself. A great deal of comfort is wrapped up in it 
 for the relief of the captives, to keep them from sinking into despair.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Who it is that secures this comfort to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 It is <I>the Lord, the maker thereof, the Lord that framed it,</I> He 
 is the maker and former of heaven and earth, and therefore has all 
 power in his hands; so it refers to Jeremiah's prayer,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:17"><I>ch.</I> xxxii. 17</A>.

 He is the maker and former of Jerusalem, of Zion, built them at first,
 and therefore can rebuild them--built them for his own praise, and 
 therefore <I>will.</I> He <I>formed it, to establish it,</I> and 
 therefore it shall be established till those things be introduced which 
 cannot be shaken, but shall remain for ever. He is the maker and former 
 of this promise; he has laid the scheme for Jerusalem's restoration, 
 and he that has formed it will establish it, he that has made the 
 promise will make it good; for Jehovah <I>is his name,</I> a God giving 
 being to his promises by the performance of them, and when he does this 
 he is known by that name 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:3">Exod. vi. 3</A>),

 a perfecting God. When the heavens and the earth were finished, then,
 and not till then, the creator is called <I>Jehovah,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:4">Gen. ii. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How this comfort must be obtained and fetched in--by prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):
 
 <I>Call upon me, and I will answer them.</I> The prophet, having 
 received some intimations of this kind, must be humbly earnest with God 
 for further discoveries of his kind intentions. He had prayed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:16"><I>ch.</I> xxxii. 16</A>),

 but he must pray again. Note, Those that expect to receive comforts
 from God must continue instant in prayer. We must call upon him, and 
 then he will answer us. Christ himself must <I>ask, and it shall be 
 given him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:8">Ps. ii. 8</A>.

 <I>I will show thee great and mighty things</I> (give thee a clear and
 full prospect of them), <I>hidden things, which,</I> though in part 
 discovered already, yet <I>thou knowest not,</I> thou canst not 
 understand or give credit to. Or this may refer not only to the 
 prediction of these things which Jeremiah, if he desire it, shall be 
 favoured with, but to the performance of the things themselves which 
 the people of God, encouraged by this prediction, must pray for. Note, 
 Promises are given, not to supersede, but to quicken and encourage 
 prayer. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:37">Ezek. xxxvi. 37</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. How deplorable the condition of Jerusalem was which made it 
 necessary that such comforts as these should be provided for it, and 
 notwithstanding which its restoration should be brought about in due 
 time 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>):

 <I>The houses of this city,</I> not excepting those <I>of the kings of 
 Judah, are thrown down by the mounts,</I> or engines of battery, <I>and 
 by the sword,</I> or axes, or hammers. It is the same word that is used 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:9">Ezek. xxvi. 9</A>,

 <I>With his axes he shall break down thy towers.</I> The strongest
 stateliest houses, and those that were best furnished, were levelled 
 with the ground. The

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:5">fifth verse</A>

 comes in in a parenthesis, giving a further instance of the present
 calamitous state of Jerusalem. Those that <I>came to fight with the 
 Chaldeans,</I> to beat them off from the siege, did more hurt than 
 good, provoked the enemy to be more fierce and furious in their 
 assaults, so that the houses in Jerusalem were filled <I>with the dead 
 bodies of men,</I> who died of the wounds they received in sallying out 
 upon the besiegers. God says that they were such as he had <I>slain in
 his anger,</I> for the enemies' sword was his sword and their anger his 
 anger. But, it seems, the men that were slain were generally such as 
 had distinguished themselves by their wickedness, for they were the 
 very men <I>for whose wickedness</I> God did now <I>hide himself from 
 this city,</I> so that he was just in all he brought upon them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. What the blessings are which God has in store for Judah and 
 Jerusalem, such as will redress all their grievances.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Is their state diseased? Is it wounded? God will provide 
 effectually for the healing of it, though the disease was thought 
 mortal and incurable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:22"><I>ch.</I> vii. 22</A>.

 "<I>The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:5">Isa. i. 5</A>);
 
 but
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 <I>I will bring it health and cure;</I> I will prevent the death, 
 remove the sickness, and set all to rights again,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:17"><I>ch.</I> xxx. 17</A>.

 Note, Be the case ever so desperate, if God undertake the cure, he will
 effect it. The sin of Jerusalem was the sickness of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:6">Isa. i. 6</A>);

 its reformation therefore will be its recovery. And the following words
 tell us how that is wrought: "<I>I will reveal unto them the abundance 
 of peace and truth;</I> I will give it to them in due time, and give 
 them an encouraging prospect of it in the mean time." <I>Peace</I> 
 stands here for all good; <I>peace and truth</I> are peace according to 
 the promise and in pursuance of that: or <I>peace and truth</I> are 
 peace and the true religion, peace and the true worship of God, in 
 opposition to the many falsehoods and deceits by which they had been 
 led away from God. We may apply it more generally, and observe,

 [1.] That peace and truth are the great subject-matter of divine 
 revelation. These promises here lead us to the gospel of Christ, and
 in that God has revealed to us <I>peace and truth,</I> the method of 
 true peace--truth to direct us, peace to make us easy. <I>Grace and 
 truth,</I> and abundance of both, <I>come by Jesus Christ.</I> Peace 
 and truth are the life of the soul, and Christ <I>came that we might 
 have</I> that <I>life, and might have it more abundantly.</I> Christ 
 rules by the power of truth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:37">John xviii. 37</A>)

 and by it he gives <I>abundance of peace,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:7,85:10">Ps. lxxii. 7; lxxxv. 10</A>.

 [2.] That the divine revelation of peace and truth brings health and 
 cure to all those that by faith receive it: it heals the soul of the 
 diseases it has contracted, as it is a means of sanctification, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:17">John xvii. 17</A>.
 
 <I>He sent his word and healed them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:20">Ps. cvii. 20</A>.
 
 And it puts the soul into good order, and keeps it in a good frame and
 fit for the employments and enjoyments of the spiritual and divine 
 life.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Are they scattered and enslaved, and is their nation laid in 
 ruins? "<I>I will cause their captivity to return</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 both that of Israel and that of Judah" (for though those who returned 
 under Zerubbabel were chiefly of Judah, and Benjamin, and Levi, yet 
 afterwards many of all the other tribes returned), "<I>and I will 
 rebuild them, as</I> I built them <I>at first.</I>" When they by 
 repentance do their first works God will by their restoration do his 
 first works.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Is sin the procuring cause of all their troubles? That shall be 
 pardoned and subdued, and so the root of the judgments shall be killed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 [1.] By sin they have become filthy, and odious to God's holiness, but 
 God will cleanse them, and purify <I>them from their iniquity.</I> As 
 those that were ceremonially unclean, and were therefore shut out from 
 the tabernacle, when they were sprinkled with the <I>water of 
 purification</I> had liberty of access to it again, so had they to 
 their own land, and the privileges of it, when God had <I>cleansed them 
 from their iniquities.</I> In allusion to that sprinkling, David prays, 
 <I>Purge me with hyssop.</I> 

 [2.] By sin they have become guilty, and obnoxious to his justice; but 
 he will <I>pardon all their iniquities,</I> will remove the punishment 
 to which for sin they were bound over. All who by sanctifying grace are 
 cleansed from the filth of sin, by pardoning mercy are freed from the 
 guilt of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) Have both their sins and their sufferings turned to the dishonour 
 of God? Their reformation and restoration shall redound as much to his 
 praise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Jerusalem thus rebuilt, Judah thus repeopled, <I>shall be to me a name 
 of joy,</I> as pleasing to God as ever they have been provoking, <I>and 
 a praise and an honour before all the nations.</I> They, being thus 
 restored, shall glorify God by their obedience to him, and he shall 
 glorify himself by his favours to them. This renewed nation shall be as 
 much a reputation to religion as formerly it has been a reproach to it. 
 The nations <I>shall hear of all the good that</I> God has wrought in 
 them by his grace and <I>of all the good</I> he has wrought for them by 
 his providence. The wonders of their return out of Babylon shall make 
 as great a noise in the world as ever the wonders of their deliverance 
 out of Egypt did. And <I>they shall fear and tremble for all this
 goodness.</I> 

 [1.] The people of God themselves shall fear and tremble; they shall be 
 much surprised at it, shall be afraid of offending so good a God and of 
 forfeiting his favour. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+3:5">Hos. iii. 5</A>,

 <I>They shall fear the Lord and his goodness.</I>

 [2.] The neighbouring nations shall fear because of the prosperity of 
 Jerusalem, shall look upon the growing greatness of the Jewish nation 
 as really formidable, and shall be afraid of making them their enemies.
 When the church is <I>fair as the moon,</I> and <I>clear as the 
 sun,</I> she is <I>terrible as an army with banners.</I></P>

 &nbsp; 11  The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of

 that shall say, Praise the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> good;

 &nbsp; 13  In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale,
 and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and
 in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall
 the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth <I>them,</I>
 saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 14  Behold, the days come, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that I will perform
 that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel

 righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute
 judgment and righteousness in the land.
 &nbsp; 16  In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall
 dwell safely: and this <I>is the name</I> wherewith she shall be
 called, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our righteousness.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is a further prediction of the happy state of Judah and Jerusalem 
 after their glorious return out of captivity, issuing gloriously at 
 length in the kingdom of the Messiah.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It is promised that the people who were long in sorrow shall again 
 be filled with joy. Every one concluded now that the country would lie 
 for ever desolate, that <I>no beasts</I> would be found in the land of 
 Judah, no inhabitant <I>in the streets of Jerusalem,</I> and 
 consequently there would be nothing but universal and perpetual 
 melancholy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);

 but, though weeping may endure for a time, joy will return. It was 
 threatened

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:34,16:9"><I>ch.</I> vii. 34 and xvi. 9</A>)

 that <I>the voice of joy and gladness should cease</I> there; but here
 it is promised that they shall revive again, that <I>the voice of joy 
 and gladness shall be heard</I> there, because <I>the captivity shall 
 be returned;</I> for then was <I>their mouth filled with laughter,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+126:1,2">Ps. cxxvi. 1, 2</A>.

 1. There shall be common joy there, <I>the voice of the bridegroom and
 the voice of the bride;</I> marriages shall again be celebrated, as 
 formerly, with songs, which in Babylon they had laid aside, for their 
 harps were hung on the willow-trees. 

 2. There shall be religious joy there; temple-songs shall be revived, 
 <I>the Lord's songs,</I> which they could not <I>sing in a strange 
 land.</I> There shall be heard in their private houses, and in the 
 cities of Judah, as well as in the temple, <I>the voice of those that 
 shall say, Praise the Lord of hosts.</I> Note, Nothing is more the 
 praise and honour of a people than to have God the glory of it, the 
 glory both of the power and of the goodness by which it is effected; 
 they shall praise him both as <I>the Lord of hosts</I> and as the God 
 who <I>is good</I> and whose <I>mercy endures for ever.</I> This, 
 though a song of old, yet, being sung upon this fresh occasion, will be 
 a new song. We find this literally fulfilled at their return out of 
 Babylon,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:11">Ezra iii. 11</A>.

 They sang together in praising the Lord, <I>because he is good, for his
 mercy endures for ever.</I> The public worship of God shall be 
 diligently and constantly attended upon: <I>They shall bring the 
 sacrifice of praise to the house of the Lord.</I> All the sacrifices 
 were intended for the praise of God, but this seems to be meant of the 
 spiritual sacrifices of humble adorations and joyful thanksgivings, 
 <I>the calves of our lips</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:2">Hos. xiv. 2</A>),

 which <I>shall please the Lord better than an ox of bullock.</I> The
 Jews say that in the days of the Messiah all sacrifices shall cease but 
 <I>the sacrifice of praise,</I> and to those days this promise has a 
 further reference.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It is promised that the country, which had lain long depopulated, 
 shall be replenished and stocked again. It was now desolate, <I>without 
 man and without beast;</I> but, after their return, the pastures shall 
 again be <I>clothed with flocks,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:13">Ps. lxv. 13</A>.

 <I>In all the cities of Judah and Benjamin there shall be a habitation
 of shepherds,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.
 
 This intimates, 

 1. The wealth of the country, after their return. It shall not be a
 habitation of beggars, who have nothing, but of shepherds and 
 husbandmen, men of substance, with good stocks upon the ground they 
 have returned to. 

 2. The peace of the country. It shall not be a habitation of soldiers, 
 not shall there be tents and barracks set up to lodge them, but there 
 shall be shepherds; tents; for they shall hear no more the alarms of 
 war, nor shall there be any to make even the shepherds afraid. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+144:13,14">Ps. cxliv. 13, 14</A>.

 3. The industry of the country, and their return to their original
 plainness and simplicity, from which, in the corrupt ages, they had 
 sadly degenerated. The seed of Jacob, in their beginning, gloried in 
 this, that they were shepherds 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+47:3">Gen. xlvii. 3</A>),

 and so they shall now be again, giving themselves wholly to that
 innocent employment, <I>causing their flocks to lie down</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>)

 and to <I>pass under the hands of him that telleth them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);
 
 for, though their flocks are numerous, they are not numberless, nor 
 shall they omit to number them, that they may know if any be missing 
 and may seek after it. Note, It is the prudence of those who have ever 
 so much of the world to keep an account of what they have. Some think
 that they <I>pass under the hand of him that telleth them</I> that they 
 may be tithed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+27:32">Lev. xxvii. 32</A>.

 <I>Then</I> we may take the comfort of what we have when God has had 
 his dues out of it. Now because it seemed incredible that a people, 
 reduced as now they were, should ever recover such a degree of peace 
 and plenty as this, here is subjoined a general ratification of these 
 promises 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>I will perform that good thing which I have promised.</I> Though the 
 promise may sometimes work slowly towards an accomplishment, it works 
 surely. <I>The days will come,</I> though they are long in coming.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. To crown all these blessings which God has in store for them, here 
 is a promise of the Messiah, and of that everlasting righteousness 
 which he should bring in 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>),

 and probably this is <I>that good thing,</I> that great good thing, 
 which in the latter days, days that were yet to come, God would 
 perform, as he had promised to Judah and Israel, and to which their 
 return out of captivity and their settlement again in their own land 
 was preparatory. <I>From the captivity to Christ</I> is one of the 
 famous periods, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:17">Matt. i. 17</A>.
 
 This promise of the Messiah we had before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:5"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 5, 6</A>),

 and there it came in as a confirmation of the promise of the shepherds
 whom God would set over them, which would make one think that the 
 promise here concerning the shepherds and their flocks, which 
 introduces it, is to be understood figuratively. Christ is here 
 prophesied of, 

 1. As a rightful King. He is a <I>branch of righteousness,</I> not a 
 usurper, for he <I>grows up unto David,</I> descends from his loins, 
 with whom the covenant of royalty was made, and is that seed with whom 
 that covenant should be established, so that his title is 
 unexceptionable. 

 2. As a righteous king, righteous in enacting laws, waging wars, and 
 giving judgment, righteous in vindicating those that suffer wrong and 
 punishing those that do wrong: <I>He shall execute judgment and 
 righteousness in the land.</I> This may point at Zerubbabel, in the 
 type, who governed with equity, not as Jehoiakim had done

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:17"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 17</A>);

 but it has a further reference to him to whom all judgment is committed
 and who shall <I>judge the world in righteousness.</I> 

 3. As a king that shall protect his subjects from all injury. By him 
 <I>Judah shall be saved</I> from wrath and the curse, and, being so 
 saved, <I>Jerusalem shall dwell safely,</I> quiet from the fear of 
 evil, and enjoying a holy security and serenity of mind, in a 
 dependence upon the conduct of this prince of peace, this prince of 
 their peace. 

 4. As a king that shall be praised by his subjects: "<I>This is the 
 name whereby they shall call him</I>" (so the Chaldee reads it, the 
 Syriac, and vulgar Latin); "this name of his they shall celebrate and 
 triumph in, and by this name they shall call upon him." It may be read, 
 more agreeably to the original, <I>This is he who shall call her, The 
 Lord our righteousness.</I> As Moses's altar is called 
 <I>Jehovah-nissi</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:15">Exod. xvii. 15</A>),

 and Jerusalem <I>Jehovah-shammah</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+48:35">Ezek. xlviii. 35</A>),

 intimating that they glory in Jehovah as present with them and <I>their
 banner,</I> so here the city is called <I>The Lord our 
 righteousness,</I> because they glory in Jehovah as their 
 righteousness. That which was before said to be the name of Christ 
 (says Mr. Gataker) is here made the name of Jerusalem, the city of the 
 Messiah, the church of Christ. He it is that imparts righteousness to 
 her, for he is <I>made of God to us righteousness,</I> and she, by 
 bearing that name, professes to have her whole righteousness, not from 
 herself, but from him. <I>In the Lord have I righteousness and 
 strength,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:24">Isa. xlv. 24</A>.

 And <I>we are made the righteousness of God in him.</I> The inhabitants
 of Jerusalem shall have this name of the Messiah so much in their 
 mouths that they shall themselves be called by it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  For thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; David shall never want a man to sit
 upon the throne of the house of Israel;
 &nbsp; 18  Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me
 to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do
 sacrifice continually.
 &nbsp; 19  And the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto Jeremiah, saying,
 &nbsp; 20  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; If ye can break my covenant of the day,
 and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day
 and night in their season;
 &nbsp; 21  <I>Then</I> may also my covenant be broken with David my servant,
 that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with
 the Levites the priests, my ministers.
 &nbsp; 22  As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand
 of the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my
 servant, and the Levites that minister unto me.
 &nbsp; 23  Moreover the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came to Jeremiah, saying,
 &nbsp; 24  Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying,
 The two families which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath chosen, he hath even cast
 them off? thus they have despised my people, that they should be
 no more a nation before them.
 &nbsp; 25  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; If my covenant <I>be</I> not with day and
 night, <I>and if</I> I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and
 earth;
 &nbsp; 26  Then will I cast away the seed of Jacob, and David my
 servant, <I>so</I> that I will not take <I>any</I> of his seed <I>to be</I>
 rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will
 cause their captivity to return, and have mercy on them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Three of God's covenants, that of royalty with David and his seed, that 
 of the priesthood with Aaron and his seed, and that of Peculiarity with 
 Abraham and his seed, seemed to be all broken and lost while the 
 captivity lasted; but it is here promised that, notwithstanding that 
 interruption and discontinuance for a time, they shall all three take 
 place again, and the true intents and meaning of them all shall be 
 abundantly answered in the New Testament blessings, typified by those 
 conferred on the Jews after their return out of captivity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The covenant of royalty shall be secured and the promises of it 
 shall have their full accomplishment in the kingdom of Christ, the Son 
 of David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 The throne of Israel was overturned in the captivity; the crown had 
 fallen from their head; there was not <I>a man to sit on the throne of 
 Israel;</I> Jeconiah was written childless. After their return the 
 house of David made a figure again; but it in the Messiah that this 
 promise is performed that <I>David shall never want a man to sit on the 
 throne of Israel,</I> and that David shall have <I>always a son to 
 reign upon his throne.</I> For as long as the man Christ Jesus sits on 
 the right hand of the throne of God, rules the world, and rules it for 
 the good of the church, to which he is a quickening head, and glorified 
 head over all things, as long as he is <I>King upon the holy hill of 
 Zion,</I> David does not want a successor, nor is the covenant with him 
 broken. When the first-begotten was brought into the world it was 
 declared concerning him, <I>The Lord God shall give him the throne of 
 his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for 
 ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:32,33">Luke i. 32, 33</A>.
 
 For the confirmation of this it is promised,

 1. That the covenant with David shall be as firm as the ordinances of
 heaven, to the stability of which that of God's promise is compared,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:35"><I>ch.</I> xxxi. 35, 36</A>.

 There is a covenant of nature, by which the common course of providence
 is settled and on which it is founded, here called <I>a covenant of the 
 day and the night</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:20,25"><I>v.</I> 20, 25</A>),

 because this is one of the articles of it, That there shall be <I>day 
 and night in their season,</I> according to the distinction put between 
 them in the creation, when God divided between the light and the 
 darkness, and established their mutual succession, and a government to 
 each, that <I>the sun</I> should <I>rule by day</I> and <I>the moon and 
 stars by night</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:4,5,16">Gen. i. 4, 5, 16</A>),

 which establishment was renewed after the flood

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:22">Gen. viii. 22</A>),

 and has continued ever since, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:2">Ps. xix. 2</A>.

 The <I>morning and</I> the <I>evening</I> have both of them their
 regular <I>outgoings</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:8">Ps. lxv. 8</A>);

 the <I>day-spring knows its place, knows its time,</I> and keeps both,
 so do <I>the shadows of the evening;</I> and, while the world stands, 
 this course shall not be altered, this covenant shall not be broken. 
 <I>The ordinances of heaven and earth</I> (of this communication 
 between heaven and earth, the dominion of these ordinances of heaven 
 upon the earth), <I>which</I> God has <I>appointed</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:25,Job+38:33"><I>v.</I> 25;
 compare Job xxxviii. 33</A>),

 shall never be disappointed. Thus firm shall the covenant of redemption
 be with the Redeemer--God's servant, but David our King, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 This intimates that Christ shall have a church on earth to the world's 
 end; he shall see a seed in which he shall prolong his days till time 
 and day shall be no more. Christ's <I>kingdom is an everlasting 
 kingdom;</I> and when <I>the end cometh,</I> and not till then, it 
 <I>shall be delivered up to God,</I> even <I>the Father.</I> But it 
 intimates that the condition of it in this world shall be intermixed 
 and counterchanged, prosperity and adversity succeeding each other, as 
 light and darkness, day and night. But this is plainly taught us, that, 
 as sure as we may be that, though the sun will set tonight, it will 
 rise again tomorrow morning, whether we live to see it or no, so sure 
 we may be that, though the kingdom of the Redeemer in the world may for 
 a time be clouded and eclipsed by corruptions and persecutions, yet it 
 will shine forth again, and recover its lustre, in the time appointed.

 2. That <I>the seed of David</I> shall be as numerous <I>as the host of 
 heaven,</I> that is, the spiritual seed of the Messiah, that shall be 
 born to him by the efficacy of his gospel and his Spirit working with 
 it. <I>From the womb of the morning he shall have the dew of their 
 youth,</I> to be his <I>willing people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:3">Ps. cx. 3</A>.

 Christ's seed are not, as David's were, his successors, but his
 subjects; yet the day is coming when they also shall reign with him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, so will I multiply the 
 seed of David,</I> so that there shall be no danger of the kingdom's 
 being extinct, or extirpated, for want of heirs. The children are 
 numerous; <I>and, if children, then heirs.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The covenant of priesthood shall be secured, and the promises of 
 that also shall have their full accomplishment. This seemed likewise to 
 be forgotten during the captivity, when there was no altar, no temple 
 service, for the priests to attend upon; but this also shall revive. It 
 did so; immediately upon their coming back to Jerusalem there were 
 priests and Levites ready <I>to offer burnt-offerings</I> and to <I>do 
 sacrifice continually</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:2,3">Ezra iii. 2, 3</A>),
 
 as is here promised,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.
 
 But that priesthood soon grew corrupt; <I>the covenant of Levi</I> was 
 <I>profaned</I> (as appears 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:8">Mal. ii. 8</A>),

 and in the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans it came to a final
 period. We must therefore look elsewhere for the performance of this 
 word, that the covenant with the Levites, the priests, God's ministers, 
 shall be as firm, and last as long, as the covenant <I>with the day and 
 the night.</I> And we find it abundantly performed,

 1. In the priesthood of Christ, which supersedes that of Aaron, and is 
 the substance of that shadow. While that great <I>high priest of our 
 profession</I> is always appearing <I>in the presence of God for 
 us,</I> presenting the virtue of his blood by which he made atonement 
 in the incense of his intercession, it may truly be said that <I>the 
 Levites do not want a man before God to offer continually,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:3,17">Heb. vii. 3, 17</A>.

 He is a priest for ever. The covenant of the priesthood is called <I>a
 covenant of peace</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:12">Num. xxv. 12</A>),

 of <I>life and peace,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:5">Mal. ii. 5</A>.

 Now we are sure that this covenant is not broken, nor in the least
 weakened, while Jesus Christ is himself our life and our peace. This 
 covenant of priesthood is here again and again joined with that of 
 royalty, for Christ is a <I>priest upon his throne,</I> as Melchizedek.

 2. In a settled gospel ministry. While there are faithful ministers to
 preside in religious assemblies, and to offer up the spiritual 
 sacrifices of prayer and praise, <I>the priests, the Levites,</I> do 
 not want successors, and such as <I>have obtained a more excellent 
 ministry.</I> The apostle makes those that preach the gospel to come in 
 the room of those that served at the altar, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:13,14">1 Cor. ix. 13, 14</A>.

 3. In all true believers, who are <I>a holy priesthood, a royal
 priesthood</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:5,9">1 Peter ii. 5, 9</A>),

 who are <I>made to our God kings and priests</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:6">Rev. i. 6</A>);

 they <I>offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God,</I> and 
 themselves, in the first place, <I>living sacrifices.</I> Of these 
 Levites this promise must be understood 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 that they shall be as numerous <I>as the sand of the sea,</I> the same 
 that is promised concerning Israel in general 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:17">Gen. xxii. 17</A>);

 for all God's spiritual Israel are spiritual priests,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:9,10,7:9,15">Rev. v. 9, 10; vii. 9, 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The covenant of peculiarity likewise shall be secured and the 
 promises of that covenant shall have their full accomplishment in the 
 gospel Israel. Observe, 

 1. How this covenant was looked upon as broken during the captivity,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 God asks the prophet, "Hast though not heard, and dost <I>thou not 
 consider, what this people have spoken?</I>" either the enemies of 
 Israel, who triumphed in the extirpation of a people that had made such 
 a noise in the world, or the unbelieving Israelites themselves, 
 "<I>this people</I> among whom thou dwellest;" they have broken 
 covenant with God, and then quarrel with him as if he had not dealt 
 faithfully with them. <I>The two families which the Lord hath 
 chosen,</I> Israel and Judah, whereas they were but one when he chose 
 them, <I>he hath even cast them off. "Thus have they despised my 
 people,</I> that is, despised the privilege of being my people as if it 
 were a privilege of no value at all." The neighbouring nations despised 
 them as now <I>no more a nation,</I> but the ruins of a nation, and 
 looked upon all their honour as laid in the dust; but, 

 2. See how firm the covenant stands notwithstanding, as firm as that
 with day and night; sooner will God suffer day and night to cease then 
 he will <I>cast away the seed of Jacob.</I> This cannot refer to the 
 seed of Jacob according to the flesh, for they are cast away, but to 
 the Christian church, in which all these promises were to be lodged, as 
 appears by the apostle's discourse,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:1">Rom. xi. 1</A>,

 &c. Christ is that seed of David that is to be perpetual dictator to
 the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and, as this people shall never 
 want such a king, so this king shall never want such a people. 
 Christianity shall continue in the dominion of Christ, and the 
 subjection of Christians to him, till day and night come to an end. 
 And, as a pledge of this, that promise is again repeated, <I>I will 
 cause their captivity to return;</I> and, having brought them back, 
 <I>I will have mercy on them.</I> To whom this promise refers appears 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:16">Gal. vi. 16</A>,

 where all that <I>walk according to the gospel rule</I> are made to be
 the <I>Israel of God,</I> on whom <I>peace and mercy</I> shall be.</P>
