 This book is wholly concerning Edom, a nation nearly allied and near
 adjoining to Israel, and yet an enemy to the seed of Jacob, inheriting
 the enmity of their father Esau to Jacob. Now here we have, after the
 preface, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:1">ver. 1</A>.

 I. Threatenings against Edom, 

 1. That their pride should be humbled, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:2-4">ver. 2-4</A>.

 2. That their wealth should be plundered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:5-7">ver. 5-7</A>.

 3. That their wisdom should be infatuated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:8,9">ver. 8, 9</A>.

 4. That their spiteful behaviour towards God's Israel should be avenged, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:10-16">ver. 10-16</A>.

 II. Gracious promises to Israel; that they shall be restored and
 reformed, and shall be victorious over the Edomites, and become masters 
 of their land and the lands of others of their neighbours 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:17-20">ver. 17-20</A>),

 and that the kingdom of the Messiah shall be set up by the bringing in
 of the great salvation,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> concerning
 Edom; We have heard a rumour from the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and an ambassador is
 sent among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her
 in battle.
 &nbsp; 2 Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art
 greatly despised.
 &nbsp; 3 The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that
 dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation <I>is</I> high;
 that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?
 &nbsp; 4 Though thou exalt <I>thyself</I> as the eagle, and though thou set
 thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 5 If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou
 cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the
 grape-gatherers came to thee, would they not leave <I>some</I> grapes?
 &nbsp; 6 How are <I>the things</I> of Esau searched out! <I>how</I> are his
 hidden things sought up!
 &nbsp; 7 All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee <I>even</I> to
 the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived
 thee, <I>and</I> prevailed against thee; <I>they that eat</I> thy bread
 have laid a wound under thee: <I>there is</I> none understanding in
 him.
 &nbsp; 8 Shall I not in that day, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, even destroy the
 wise <I>men</I> out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of
 Esau?
 &nbsp; 9 And thy mighty <I>men,</I> O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end
 that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Edom is the nation against which this prophecy is levelled, and which,
 some think, is put for all the enemies of Israel, that shall be brought
 down first or last. The rabbin by Edom understand Rome. Rome Christians
 they understand it of, and have an implacable enmity to it a such; but,
 if we understand it of Rome antichristian, we shall find the passages 
 of it applicable enough. And though Edom was mortified in the times of 
 the Maccabees, as it had been before by Jehoshaphat, yet its 
 destruction seems to have been typical, as their father Esau's 
 rejection, and to have had further reference to the destruction of the 
 enemies of the gospel-church; for so shall all God's enemies perish; 
 and we find 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:5">Isa. xxxiv. 5</A>)

 the <I>sword of the Lord</I> coming down <I>upon Idumea,</I> to signify
 the general day of God's recompences for the controversy of Zion,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Some have well observed that it could not but be a great temptation to 
 the people of Israel, when they saw themselves, who were the children 
 of beloved Jacob, in trouble, and the Edomites, not only prospering, 
 but triumphing over them in their troubles; and therefore God gives 
 them a prospect of the destruction of Edom, which should be total and 
 final, and of a happy issue of their own correction. Now we may observe 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A declaration of war against Edom, 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 "<I>We have heard a rumour,</I> or rather <I>an order, from the 
 Lord,</I> the God of hosts; he has given the word of command; it is his 
 counsel and decree, which can neither be reversed nor resisted, that 
 all who do mischief to his people shall certainly bring mischief upon 
 themselves. We have heard a report that God is raised up out of his 
 holy habitation, and is preparing his throne for judgment; and <I>an 
 ambassador is sent among the heathen,</I>" a <I>herald</I> rather, some 
 minister or messenger of Providence, to alarm the nations, or the 
 Lord's prophets, who gave each nation its burden. Those whom God 
 employs cry to each other, <I>Arise ye,</I> stir up yourselves and one 
 another, and let <I>us rise up against Edom in battle.</I> The 
 confederate forces under Nebuchadnezzar thus animate themselves and one 
 another to make a descent upon that country: <I>Gather yourselves 
 together, and come against her;</I> so it is in the parallel place, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:14">Jer. xlix. 14</A>.

 Note, When God has bloody work to do among the enemies of his church he
 will find out and fit up both hands and hearts to do it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A prediction of the success of that war. Edom shall certainly be 
 subdued, and spoiled, and brought down; for all her confidences shall 
 fail her and stand her in no stead, and in like manner shall all the 
 enemies of God's church be disappointed in those things which they 
 stayed themselves upon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Do they depend upon their grandeur, the figure they make among the 
 nations, their influence upon them, and interest in them? That shall 
 dwindle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen,</I> so that none 
 of thy neighbours will court thy friendship, or court an alliance with 
 thee; <I>thou art greatly despised</I> among them, and looked upon with 
 contempt, as an infatuated and unfaithful nation." And thus 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)
 
 <I>the pride of thy heart has deceived thee.</I> Note, 

 (1.) Those that think well of themselves are apt to fancy that others 
 think well of them too; but, when they come to make trial of them, they 
 will find themselves mistaken, and thus their pride deceives them and 
 by it slays them. 

 (2.) God can easily lay those low that have magnified and exalted 
 themselves, and will find out a way to do it, for he <I>resists the 
 proud;</I> and we often see those small and greatly despised who once 
 looked very big and were greatly caressed and admired.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Do they depend upon the fortifications of their country, both by 
 nature and art, and glory in the advantages they have thereby? Those 
 also shall deceive them. They <I>dwelt in the clefts of the rock,</I> 
 as an eagle in her nest, and their <I>habitation</I> was <I>high,</I> 
 not only exalted above their neighbours, which was the matter of their 
 pride, but fortified against their enemies, which was the matter of 
 their security, so high as to be out of the reach of danger. Now 
 observe, 

 (1.) What Edom says in the pride of his heart: <I>Who shall bring me 
 down to the ground?</I> He speaks with a confidence of his own 
 strength, and a contempt of God's judgments, as if almighty power 
 itself could not overpower him. As for <I>all his enemies,</I> even God 
 himself, he <I>puffs at them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:5">Ps. x. 5</A>),

 sets them all at defiance. Their father Esau had <I>sold his
 birthright,</I> and yet they lifted up themselves, as if to them had 
 still pertained the <I>excellency of dignity and power.</I> Many 
 forfeit their privileges, and yet boast of them. Because Edom is high 
 and lifted up, he imagines none can bring him down. Note, Carnal 
 security is a sin that most easily besets men in the day of their pomp, 
 power, and prosperity, and does, as much as any thing, both ripen men 
 for ruin and aggravate it when it comes.

 (2.) What God says to this,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 If men will dare to challenge Omnipotence, their challenge shall be
 taken up: <I>Who shall bring me down?</I> says Edom. "<I>I will,</I>" 
 says God. "<I>Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle</I> that soars 
 high and builds high, nay, <I>though thou set thy nest among stars,</I> 
 higher than ever any eagle flew, it is but in thy own imagination, and 
 <I>thence will I bring thee down.</I>" This we had 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:15,16">Jer. xlix. 15, 16</A>.
 
 Note, Sinners will certainly be made ashamed of their pride and
 security of their pride when it has a fall and of their security when 
 their confidences fail their expectation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Do they depend upon their wealth and treasure, the abundance of 
 which is looked upon as the sinews of war? Is their money their 
 defence? Is that their strong city? It is so only in their own conceit, 
 for it shall rather expose them than protect them; it shall be made a 
 prey to the enemy, and they for the sake of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 Much to this purport we had
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:9,10">Jer. xlix. 9, 10</A>.

 Only here comes in, in a parenthesis, <I>How art thou cut off!</I> thou 
 and all thy stores. The prophet foretels it, but laments it, that the 
 thread of their prosperity was cut off. How art thou fallen, and how 
 great is thy fall! <I>How art thou stupefied!</I> so the Chaldee words
 it. How senseless art thou under these desolating judgments, as if they 
 were but common strokes! But he shows that it should be an utter ruin,
 not a usual calamity; for, 

 (1.) It is indeed a usual calamity for those that have wealth to have 
 it stolen, and to lose a little out of their great deal. <I>Thieves
 come to them</I> (for where the carcase is, there will the birds of 
 prey be gathered together), <I>robbers come by night,</I> and they 
 <I>steal till they have enough,</I> what they have occasion for, what 
 they have a mind for; they steal no more than they think they can carry 
 away, and out of a great stock it is scarcely missed. Those that rob 
 orchards, or vineyards, carry off what they think fit; but they 
 <I>leave some grapes,</I> some fruit for the owner, who easily bears 
 his loss perhaps and soon recruits it. But, 

 (2.) It shall not be so with Edom; his wealth shall all be taken away, 
 and nothing shall escape the hands of the destroying army, not that 
 which is most precious and valuable,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 <I>How are the things of Esau,</I> the things he sets his heart upon 
 and places his happiness in, his good things, his best things, how are 
 these things, which were so carefully treasured up and concealed, now 
 <I>searched out</I> by the enemy and seized! <I>How are the hidden 
 things,</I> his hidden treasures, plundered, rifled, and <I>sought 
 up!</I> His hoards, that had not see the light for many years, are now 
 a spoil to the enemy. Note, Treasures on earth, though ever so fast 
 locked up and ever so artfully hidden, cannot be so safely laid up but 
 that thieves may break through and steal; it is therefore our wisdom to 
 <I>lay up for ourselves treasures in heaven.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Do they depend upon their alliances with neighbouring states and 
 potentates? Those also shall fail them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "The <I>men of thy confederacy,</I> all of them, the Ammonites and 
 Moabites, and other thy high allies that were at <I>peace with 
 thee,</I> that entered into a league offensive and defensive with thee, 
 that solemnly engaged not only to do thee no hurt, but to do thee all 
 the service the could, <I>did eat thy bread,</I> were magnificently 
 treated and entertained by thee, lived upon thee; their soldiers had 
 free quarter in thy country, and took pay as thy auxiliaries; they 
 <I>brought thee even to the border</I> of thy land, were very 
 respectful to thy ambassadors, and brought them on their way home, even 
 to the utmost limits of their country; they seemed forward to serve 
 thee with their forces when thou hadst occasion for them, and came 
 along with thee <I>to the border,</I> till thou wast just ready to 
 engage the invading enemy; but then," 

 (1.) "They had <I>deceived thee;</I> they flew back and retreated when 
 thou wast in extremity, and proved as a broken reed to the traveller 
 that is weary, and as the brooks in summer to the traveller that is 
 thirsty; they bear no weight, yield no relief." Nay, 

 (2.) "They have <I>prevailed against thee;</I> they were too hard for 
 thee in the treaty imposed upon thee, and by cheating thee ruined thee, 
 brought thee into danger, and there left thee an easy prey to thy 
 enemy." Note, Those that make flesh their arm arm it against them. Yet 
 this was not the worst. 

 (3.) "They have <I>laid a wound under thee;</I> that is, they have laid 
 that under thee for a stay and support, for a foundation to rely on, 
 for a pillow to repose on, which will prove a wound to thee; not as 
 thorns only, but as swords." If God lay under us the arms of his power 
 and love, these will be firm and easy under us; the God of our covenant 
 will never deceive us. But if we trust to <I>the men of our 
 confederacy,</I> and what they will lay under us, it may prove to us a 
 <I>wound</I> and <I>dishonour.</I> And observe the just censure here 
 passed upon Edom for trusting to those who thus played tricks with him: 
 "<I>There is no understanding in him,</I> or else he would never have 
 put it into their power to betray him by putting such a confidence in 
 them." Note, Those show they have no understanding in them who, when 
 they are encouraged to trust in the Creator, put a cheat upon
 themselves by reposing a confidence in the creature.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Do they depend upon the politics of their counsellors? These shall
 fail them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Edom had been famous for great statesmen, men of learning and 
 experience, that sat at the help of government, and were masters of all 
 the arts of management, that in all treaties used to outwit their 
 neighbours; but now the <I>counsellors</I> have become <I>fools,</I> 
 and the wise God makes them so: <I>Shall I not in that day destroy the 
 wise men out of Edom?</I> As men they shall fall by the sword in common 
 with others 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:10">Ps. xlix. 10</A>),

 and their wisdom shall not secure them; as wise men they shall be
 infatuated in all their counsels; their best-laid designs shall be 
 baffled, their measures broken, and those very projects by which they 
 thought to establish themselves and the public interests shall be the 
 ruin of both. Thus <I>wisdom perishes from Teman,</I> as it is in the 
 parallel place, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:7">Jer. xlix. 7</A>.
 
 This was,

 (1.) The just punishment of their folly in trusting to an arm of flesh: 
 <I>There is no understanding in them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 They have not sense to trust in a living God, and a God of truth, but 
 put confidence in men that are frail, fickle, and false; and therefore 
 God will <I>destroy their understanding.</I> Note, God will justly deny 
 those understanding to keep out of the way of danger that will not use 
 their understanding to keep out of the way of sin. He that will be 
 foolish, let him be foolish still. 

 (2.) It was the forerunner of their destruction. A nation is certainly 
 marked for ruin when God hides the things that belong to its peace from 
 the eyes of those that are entrusted with its counsels. <I>Quos Deus 
 vult perdere, eos dementat--God infatuates those whom he designs to 
 destroy.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:17">Job xii. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. Do they depend upon the strength and courage of their soldiers? They
 are not only able-bodied, but men of spirit and courage, that can face 
 an enemy and stand their ground; but now 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 <I>Thy mighty men, O Teman! shall be dismayed;</I> their courage shall 
 fail them, <I>to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut 
 off by slaughter,</I> and none escape. The weak, and feeble, and 
 unarmed must fall of course into the hand of the destroyer when the 
 <I>mighty men are dismayed,</I> and not only lose the day, but lose 
 their lives, because they have lost their spirit. <I>Howl, fir-trees, 
 if the cedars be shaken.</I> Note, The death or disuniting of the 
 mighty often proves the death and destruction of the many; and it is in 
 vain to depend upon mighty men for our protection if we have not an 
 almighty God for us, much less if we have an almighty God against 
 us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When we have read Edom's doom, no less than utter ruin, it is natural 
 to ask, <I>Why, what evil has he done?</I> What is the ground of God's 
 controversy with him? Many things, no doubt, were amiss in Edom; they 
 were a sinful people, and <I>a people laden with iniquity.</I> But that 
 one single crime which is laid to their charge, as filling their 
 measure and bringing this ruin upon them, that for which they here 
 stand indicted, of which they are convicted, and for which they are 
 condemned, is the injury they had done to the people of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):
 
 "It is <I>for thy violence against thy brother Jacob,</I> that ancient 
 and hereditary grudge which thou hast borne to the people of Israel, 
 that all this <I>shame shall cover thee</I> and <I>thou shalt be cut 
 off for ever.</I>" Note, Injuries to men are affronts to God, the 
 righteous God, that loveth righteousness and hateth wickedness; and, as 
 the Judge of all the earth, he will give redress to those that suffer 
 wrong and take vengeance on those that do wrong. All violence, all 
 <I>unrighteousness, is sin;</I> but it is a great aggravation of the 
 violence if it be done either, 

 1. Against any of our own people; it is violence <I>against thy
 brother,</I> thy near relation, to whom thou shouldst be a <I>go&euml;l--a
 redeemer,</I> whom it is thy duty to right if others wronged him; how 
 wicked is it then for thee thyself to wrong him! Thou <I>slanderest</I> 
 and abusest <I>thy own mother's son;</I> this makes the sin 
 <I>exceedingly sinful,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:20">Ps. l. 20</A>.
 
 Or,

 2. Much more if it be done against any of God's people; "it is thy
 brother Jacob that is in covenant with God, and dear to him. Thou 
 hatest him whom God has loved, and because God espouses and will plead 
 with jealousy, and in whose interests God is pleased so far to interest 
 himself that he takes the violence done to him as done to himself.
 <I>Whoso touches Jacob touches the apple of the eye of Jacob's 
 God.</I>" So that it is <I>crimen l&aelig;s&aelig; majestatis--high 
 treason,</I> for which, as for high treason, let Edom expect an 
 ignominious punishment: <I>Shame shall cover thee,</I> and a ruining 
 one; <I>thou shalt be cut off for ever.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:12-16">following verses</A>

 we are told more particularly,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What the violence was which Edom did against his brother Jacob, and 
 what are the proofs of this charge. It does not appear that the 
 Edomites did themselves invade Israel, but that was more for want of 
 power than will; they had malice enough to do it, but were not a match 
 for them. But that which is laid to their charge is their barbarous 
 conduct towards Judah and Jerusalem when they were in distress, and 
 ready to be destroyed, probably by the Chaldeans, or upon occasion of 
 some other of the calamities of the Jews; for this seems to have been 
 always their temper towards them. See this charged upon the Edomites 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:7">Ps. cxxxvii. 7</A>),

 that <I>in the day of Jerusalem they said, Rase it, rase it,</I> and
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:12">Ezek. xxv. 12</A>.

 They are here told particularly what they did, by being told what they
 should not have done

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:12-14"><I>v.</I> 12-14</A>):

 "Thou <I>shouldst not have looked,</I> thou <I>shouldst not have 
 entered;</I> but thou didst so." Note, In reflecting upon ourselves it 
 is good to compare what we have done with what we should have done, our 
 practice with the rule, that we may discover wherein we have done 
 amiss, have <I>done those things which we ought not to have done.</I> 
 We should not have been where we were at such a time, should not have 
 been in such and such company, should not have said what we said, nor 
 have taken the liberty that we took. Sin thus looked upon, in the glass 
 of the commandment, will appear exceedingly sinful. Let us see,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What was the case of Judah and Jerusalem when the Edomites behaved 
 themselves thus basely and insulted over them. 

 (1.) It was a day of distress with them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 It was the <I>day of their calamity,</I> so it is called three times, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 With the Edomites it was a day of prosperity and peace when with the 
 Israelites it was a day of distress and calamity, for judgment commonly 
 <I>begins at the house of God.</I> Children are corrected when 
 strangers are let alone. 

 (2.) It was the day of <I>their destruction</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 when both city and country were laid waste, were laid <I>in ruins.</I>
 
 (3.) It was a day when <I>foreigners entered into the gates of
 Jerusalem,</I> when the city, after a long siege, was broken up, and
 the great officers of the king of Babylon's army came, and sat in the
 gates, as judges of the land; when they cast lots upon the spoils of
 Jerusalem, as the soldiers on Christ's garments, what shares each of
 the conquerors shall have, what shares of the lands, what shares of the
 goods; or they cast lots to determine when and where they should attack
 it.

 (4.) It was a day when the <I>strangers carried away captive his
 forces</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 took the men of war prisoners of war, and carried them off, in poverty
 and shame, to their own country, or such a multitude of captives that 
 they were as an army. 

 (5.) "It was a day when thy brother himself, that had long been at 
 home, at rest in his own land, <I>became a stranger,</I> an exile in a 
 strange land." Now, when this was the woeful case of the Jews, the 
 Edomites, their neighbours and brethren, should have pitied them and 
 helped them, condoled with them and comforted them, and should have 
 trembled to think that their own turn would come next; for, <I>if this 
 was done in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</I> But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. See what was the conduct of the Edomites towards them when they were 
 in this distress, for which they are here condemned. 

 (1.) They looked with pleasure upon the affliction of God's people; 
 they <I>stood on the other side</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 afar off, when they should have come in to the relief of their 
 distressed neighbours, and <I>looked upon them,</I> and <I>their day, 
 looked on their affliction</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>),

 with a careless unconcerned eye, as the priest and Levite looked upon 
 the wounded man, and <I>passed by on the other side.</I> Those have a 
 great deal to answer for that are idle spectators of the troubles and 
 afflictions of their neighbours, when they are capable of being their 
 active helpers. But this was not all; they looked upon it with a 
 scornful eye, with an eye of complacency and satisfaction; they looked 
 and laughed to see Israel in distress, saying, <I>Aha! so we would have 
 it.</I> They fed their eyes with the rueful spectacle of Jerusalem's 
 ruin, and looked at it as those that had long looked for it and often 
 wished to see it. Note, We must take heed with what eye we look upon 
 the afflictions of our brethren; and, if we cannot look upon them with 
 a gracious eye of sympathy and tenderness, it is better not to look 
 upon them at all: <I>Thou shouldst not have looked</I> as thou didst 
 <I>upon the day of thy brother.</I> 

 (2.) They triumphed and insulted over them, upbraided their brethren 
 with their sorrows, and made themselves and their companions merry with 
 them. They <I>rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their 
 destruction.</I> They had not the good manners to conceal the pleasure 
 they took in Judah's destruction and to dissemble it, but openly 
 declared it, and rudely and insolently declared it <I>to them; they 
 rejoiced over them,</I> crowed, and hectored, and trampled upon them. 
 Those have the spirit of Edomites that can rejoice over any, especially 
 over Israelites, in the day of their calamity. 

 (3.) They <I>spoke proudly-magnified the mouth</I> (so the word is),
 against Israel, talked with a great disdain of the suffering 
 Israelites, and with an air of haughtiness of the present safety and 
 prosperity of Edom, as it if might be inferred from their present 
 different state that the tables were turned, and now Esau was beloved, 
 and the favourite of heaven, and Jacob hated and rejected. Note, Those
 must expect to be in some way or other effectually humbled and 
 mortified themselves that are puffed up and made proud by the 
 humiliations and mortifications of others. 

 (4.) They went further yet, for they <I>entered into the gate</I> of 
 God's people in the day of their calamity, and <I>laid hands on their 
 substance.</I> Though they did not help to conquer them, they helped to 
 plunder them, and put in for a share in the prey,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Jerusalem was thrown open, and then they entered in; its wealth was 
 thrown about, and they seized it for themselves, excusing it with this, 
 that they might as well take it as let it be lost; whereas it was 
 taking what was not their own. Babylon lays Jerusalem waste, but Edom, 
 by meddling with the spoil, becomes <I>particeps 
 criminis</I>--<I>partaker of the crime,</I> and shall be reckoned with 
 as an accessary <I>ex post facto</I>--<I>after the fact.</I> Note, 
 Those do but impoverish themselves that think to enrich themselves by 
 the ruins of the people of God; and those deceive themselves who think 
 they may call all that substance their own which they can lay their 
 hands on in a day of calamity. 

 (5.) They did yet worse things; they not only robbed their brethren, 
 but murdered them, in the day of their calamity; laid hands not only on 
 their substance, but on their persons,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 When the victorious sword of the Chaldeans was making bloody work among 
 the Jews many made their escape, and were in a fair way to save 
 themselves by flight; but the Edomites basely intercepted them, 
 <I>stood in the cross-way</I> where several roads met, by each of which 
 the trembling Israelites were making the best of their way from the 
 fury of the pursuers, and there they stopped them: some they 
 barbarously and cowardlike cut off themselves; others they took 
 prisoners, and delivered up to the pursuers, only to ingratiate 
 themselves with them, because they were now the conquerors. They 
 <I>should not have been</I> thus <I>cruel</I> to those that lay at 
 their mercy, and never had done, nor were every likely to do, them any 
 hurt; they should not have betrayed those whom they had such a fair 
 opportunity to protect; but such are the <I>tender mercies of the 
 wicked.</I> One cannot read this without a high degree of compassion 
 towards those who were thus basely abused, who when they fled from the 
 sword of an open enemy, and thought they had got out of the reach of 
 it, fell upon and fell by the sword of a treacherous neighbour, whom 
 they were not apprehensive of any danger from. Nor can one read this 
 without a high degree of indignation towards those who were so 
 perfectly lost to all humanity as to exercise such cruelty upon such 
 proper objects of compassion. 

 (6.) In all this they joined with the open enemies and persecutors of 
 Israel: <I>Even thou wast as one of them,</I> an accessary equally 
 guilty with the principals. He that joins in with the evil doers, and 
 is aiding and abetting in their evil deeds, shall be reckoned, and 
 shall be reckoned with, as one of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What the shame is that shall cover them for this violence of 
 theirs. 

 1. They shall soon find that the cup is going round, even the cup of
 trembling; and, when they come to be in the same calamitous condition 
 that the Israel of God is now in, they will be ashamed to remember how 
 they triumphed over them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>The day of the Lord is near upon all the heathen,</I> when God will 
 recompense tribulation to the troublers of his church. Though judgment 
 begin at the house of God, it shall not end there. This should 
 effectually restrain us from triumphing over others in their misery, 
 that we know not how soon it may be our own case. 

 2. Their enmity to the people of God, and the injuries they had done
 them, shall be recompensed into their own bosoms: <I>As thou hast done, 
 it shall be done unto thee.</I> The righteous God will render both to 
 nations and to particular persons <I>according to their works;</I> and 
 the punishment is often made exactly to answer to the sin, and those 
 that have abused others come to be themselves abused in like manner. 
 The just and jealous God will find out a time and way to avenge the 
 wrongs done to his people on those that have been injurious to them. 
 <I>As you have drunk upon my holy mountain</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 that is, as God's professing people, who inhabit his holy mountain, 
 have drunk deeply of the cup of affliction (and their being of the holy 
 mountain would not excuse them), <I>so shall all the heathen drink,</I> 
 in their turn, of the same bitter cup; for, if God <I>bring evil on the 
 city that is called by his name, shall those be unpunished</I> that 
 never knew his name? See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:29">Jer. xxv. 29</A>.

 And it is part of the burden of Edom

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:12">Jer. xlix. 12</A>),

 <I>Those whose judgment was not to drink of the cup</I> (who had reason
 to promise themselves an exemption from it) have assuredly drunken, and 
 <I>shall Edom</I> that is the generation of God's wrath <I>go 
 unpunished?</I> No, <I>thou shalt surely drink of it;</I> the <I>cup of 
 trembling shall be taken out of the hand</I> of God's people, and put 
 <I>into the hand of those that afflict them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:22,23">Isa. li. 22, 23</A>.

 Nay, they may expect their case to be worse in the day of their
 distress than that of Israel was in their day; for,

 (1.) The afflictions of God's people were but for a moment, and soon 
 had an end, but their enemies shall <I>drink continually</I> the 
 <I>wine of God's wrath,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:10">Rev. xiv. 10</A>.

 (2.) The dregs of the cup are reserved for the <I>wicked of the
 earth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+75:8">Ps. lxxv. 8</A>);

 they shall <I>drink and swallow down,</I> or <I>sup up</I> (as the 
 margin reads it), shall drink it to the bottom.

 (3.) The people of God, though they may be made to drink of the wine of 
 astonishment for a while 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+60:3">Ps. lx. 3</A>),

 shall yet recover, and come to themselves again; but the heathen shall
 drink and be <I>as though they had not been;</I> there shall be neither 
 any remains nor any remembrance of them, but they shall be wholly 
 extirpated and rooted out. <I>So let all thy enemies perish, O 
 Lord!</I> so they shall perish, if the turn not.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 After the destruction of the church's enemies is threatened, which will 
 be completely accomplished in the great day of recompence, and that 
 judgment for which Christ came once, and will come again, into this 
 world, here follow precious promises of the salvation of the church, 
 with which this prophecy concludes, and those of Joel and Amos did, 
 which, however they might be in part fulfilled in the return of the 
 Jews out of Babylon notwithstanding the triumphs of Edom in their 
 captivity, as if it were perpetual, are yet, doubtless, to have their 
 full accomplishment in that great salvation wrought out by Jesus 
 Christ, to which all the prophets bore witness. It is promised 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That there shall be salvation upon Mount Zion, that holy hill where 
 God sets his anointed King 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:6">Ps. ii. 6</A>):

 <I>Upon Mount Zion shall be deliverance,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 There shall be <I>those that escape;</I> so the margin. A remnant of 
 Israel, <I>upon the holy mountain</I> shall be saved, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Christ said, <I>Salvation is of the Jews,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:22">John iv. 22</A>.

 God wrought deliverances for the Jews, typical of our redemption by
 Christ. But Mount Zion is the gospel-church, from which the 
 New-Testament law <I>went forth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:3">Isa. ii. 3</A>.

 There salvation shall be preached and prayed for; to the gospel-church
 those are added who <I>shall be saved;</I> and for those who come in 
 faith and hope to this Mount Zion deliverance shall be wrought from 
 wrath and the curse, from sin, and death, and hell, while those who 
 continue afar off shall be left to perish.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That, where there is salvation, there shall be sanctification in 
 order to it: <I>And there shall be holiness,</I> to prepare and qualify 
 the children of Zion for this deliverance; for wherever God designs 
 glory he gives grace. Temporal deliverances are indeed wrought for us 
 in mercy when with them there is holiness, when there is wrought in us 
 a disposition to receive them with love and gratitude to God; when we 
 are sanctified, they are sanctified to us. Holiness is itself a great 
 deliverance, and an earnest of that eternal salvation which we look 
 for. <I>There,</I> upon Mount Zion, in the gospel-church, <I>shall be 
 holiness;</I> for that is it which <I>becomes God's house for ever,</I> 
 and the great design of the gospel, and its grace, is to plant and 
 promote holiness. There shall be the Holy Spirit, the holy ordinances, 
 the holy Jesus, and a select remnant of holy souls, in whom, and among 
 whom, the holy God will delight to dwell. Note, Where there is holiness 
 there shall be deliverance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That this salvation and sanctification shall spread, and prevail, 
 and get ground in the world: The <I>house of Jacob,</I> even this 
 <I>Mount Zion,</I> with the deliverance and their holiness there 
 wrought, shall <I>possess their possessions;</I> that is, the 
 gospel-church shall be set up among the heathen, and shall replenish 
 the earth; the apostles of Christ by their preaching shall gain 
 possession of the hearts of men for him whose messengers and ministers 
 they are, and when they possess their hearts they shall <I>possess 
 their possessions,</I> for those who have given up themselves to the 
 Lord give up all they have to him. When Lydia's heart was opened to 
 Christ her house was opened to his ministers. When the Gentile nations 
 became <I>nations of those that were saved,</I> were disciplined, 
 <I>walked in the light</I> of the Lord, and <I>brought their glory and 
 honour into the new Jerusalem</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:24">Rev. xxi. 24</A>),

 then the <I>house of Jacob possessed their possessions.</I> This is the 
 part fulfilled by the planting of the Christian religion in the world, 
 and shall be fulfilled yet more and more by the setting up of Christ's 
 throne where Satan's seat is, and the erecting of trophies of his 
 victory upon the ruins of the devil's kingdom. Now here is 
 foretold,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How this possession shall be <I>gained,</I> and the opposition given 
 to it got over 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>The house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a 
 flame,</I> for their God is, and will be, a <I>consuming fire;</I> and 
 the house of Esau shall be for <I>stubble,</I> easily devoured and 
 consumed by this fire. This is fulfilled, 

 (1.) In the conversion of multitudes by the grace of Christ; the 
 gospel, preached in the house of Jacob and Joseph, and there owned and 
 professed, shall be as a fire and a flame to melt and to soften hard 
 hearts, to burn up the dross of sin and corruption, that they may be 
 purified and refined with the <I>spirit of judgment and</I> the 
 <I>spirit of burning.</I> Christ, when he comes, shall be <I>as a 
 refiner's fire,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:1,2">Mal. iii. 1, 2</A>.

 (2.) In the confusion of all the impenitent implacable enemies of the
 gospel of Christ, that oppose it and do all they can to hinder the 
 setting up of the kingdom of the Messiah by it. The gospel day is a day 
 that <I>burns like an oven,</I> in which <I>all the proud, and all that 
 do wickedly, shall be a stubble,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:1">Mal. iv. 1</A>.

 Jacob and Joseph shall be as a fire and a flame; for those that meddle
 with them, to do them hurt, will find that they do so at their peril; 
 they shall be to them as <I>a torch of fire in a sheaf,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:6">Zech. xii. 6</A>.
 
 The word of God in the mouth of his ministers is said to be like fire,
 and the people as wood to be devoured by it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:14">Jer. v. 14</A>.

 And the <I>man of sin</I> is to be <I>consumed by the breath of
 Christ's mouth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:8">2 Thess. ii. 8</A>.

 Those that are not refined as gold by fire of the gospel shall be
 consumed as dross by it; for it will be a savour either of life or of 
 death. When idols and idolatry were abolished, and the wealth and power 
 of nations were brought into the service of Christ and his gospel, and 
 the spoils of the <I>strong man armed</I> were divided by him that was 
 <I>stronger than he,</I> then the house of Jacob and Joseph devoured 
 <I>the house of Esau,</I> so that there was none of them left 
 remaining. This the Lord <I>spoke</I> by his prophets, and this he did 
 by his apostles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How far this possession shall extend, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 This is described in Jewish language, which speaks the accession made 
 to the land of Israel, after the return out of captivity into Babylon. 
 The <I>captivity of this host of Israel,</I> that is, this host of 
 Israel that have been so long in captivity and now they have come back 
 are still called the <I>children of the captivity,</I> these shall not 
 only recover their own land, but shall gain ground upon their 
 neighbours adjoining to them, some of whom shall become proselytes and 
 shall incorporate with the Jews, who, by possessing them in a holy 
 communion, possess their land. We must reckon ourselves truly enriched 
 by the conversion of our neighbours to the fear of God and the faith of 
 Christ, and their coming to join with us in the worship of God. Such an 
 accession to our Christian communion we must reckon to be more our 
 wealth and strength than an accession to our estates. Or, The ancient 
 inhabitants of those lands that were carried away into captivity being 
 lost, and never returning to their estates, the children of Israel 
 shall take possession of that which lies next them; for their numbers 
 shall so increase that their own land shall be too strait for them, and 
 their neighbours' estates shall escheat to them <I>ob defectum 
 sanguinis--through default of heirs.</I> They shall enter upon that 
 which is adjoining to them. The country of Esau shall be possessed by 
 those <I>of the south</I> parts of Canaan, for to them it lies 
 contiguous. Those <I>of the plain,</I> on the <I>west</I> of Canaan, 
 which was a champaign country, shall enter upon <I>the land of the 
 Philistines,</I> their neighbours. Those of Judah, which was the chief 
 of the two returning tribes, shall possess <I>the field of Ephraim and 
 Samaria,</I> which before belonged to the ten tribes; and Benjamin, the 
 other tribe, shall possess Gilead on the other side of Jordan, which 
 had belonged to the two tribes and a half. The kingdom of Israel shall 
 join with that of Judah both in civil and sacred interests, and, as 
 friends and brethren, shall mutually possess and enjoy one another; and 
 both together shall <I>possess the Canaanites,</I> even to Zarephath, 
 which <I>belongeth to Zidon;</I> and Jerusalem shall possess the 
 <I>cities of the south,</I> even to Sepharad. Thus did the Jews enlarge 
 their borders on all sides. The modern rabbin teach their scholars by 
 Zarephath and Sepharad to understand France and Spain, grounding upon 
 this a foolish groundless expectation that some time or other the Jews 
 shall be masters of those countries; and they call and count the 
 Christians <I>Edomites,</I> over whom they are to have dominion. But 
 the promise here, no doubt, has a spiritual signification, and had its 
 accomplishment in the setting up of the Christian church, the 
 gospel-Israel, in the world, and shall have its accomplishment more and 
 more in the enlargement of it and the additions made to it, till the 
 mystical body is completed. When ministers and Christians prevail with 
 their neighbours to come to Christ, to yield themselves to the Lord, 
 they possess them. The converts that Abraham had are said to be the 
 <I>souls that he had gotten,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:5">Gen. xii. 5</A>.

 The possession is gained, not <I>vi et armis--by force and arms;</I>
 for the <I>weapons of our warfare are not carnal,</I> but 
 <I>spiritual;</I> it is by the preaching of the gospel, and the power 
 of divine grace going along with it, that this possession is got and 
 kept.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That the kingdom of the Redeemer shall be erected and maintained, 
 to the comfort of his loyal subjects and the terror and shame of all 
 his enemies 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>The kingdom shall be the Lord's,</I> the Lord Christ's. God shall 
 give it to him, by putting all things into his hand, all power both in 
 heaven and in earth; men shall give it to him, by resigning themselves 
 to him as his willing people, and appointing him their head. Now the 
 work of kings is to protect their subjects and suppress their enemies; 
 and this Christ will do; he will both reward and punish. 

 1. The mountain of Zion shall be saved; on it <I>saviours</I> shall 
 <I>come,</I> the preachers of the gospel, who are called saviours, 
 because their business is to save themselves and those that hear them; 
 and in this they are <I>workers together with Christ,</I> but to little 
 purpose if he by his grace did not <I>work together with them.</I> 

 2. The mountain of Esau shall be judged; and the same that come as
 saviours on Mount Zion shall <I>judge</I> the <I>mountain of Esau;</I> 
 for the word of the gospel in their mouth, that saves believers, judges 
 unbelievers, convinces and condemns them. Christ's ministers are
 <I>saviours on Mount Zion</I> when they preach that he <I>that believes 
 shall be saved;</I> but they judge the mount of Esau when they preach 
 <I>that he that believeth not shall be damned,</I> which they are not 
 only commissioned, but commanded to do,

 And in the course of God's providence his scripture is fulfilled; when
 God raises up friends to the church in her distress (as he <I>raised up 
 judges</I> to deliver Israel of old,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:16">Judg. ii. 16</A>),

 then <I>saviours come on Mount Zion,</I> to save it from being sunk and
 ruined; and when the enemies of the church are brought down, and their 
 power broken, then is the <I>mount of Esau judged;</I> and this shall 
 be done in every age in such a way as God thinks best; we may depend 
 upon it that the gates of hell shall not prevail against the church, 
 but the church shall prevail against them; <I>for the kingdom shall be 
 the Lord's;</I> the kingdoms of the world shall become his, and he has 
 taken, and will take, to himself his great power and reign.</P>
