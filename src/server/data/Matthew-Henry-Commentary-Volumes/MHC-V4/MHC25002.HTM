 The second alphabetical elegy is set to the same mournful tune with the 
 former, and the substance of it is much the same; it begins with Ecah, 
 as that did, "How sad is our case! Alas for us!" 

 I. Here is the anger of Zion's God taken notice of as the cause of her
 calamities, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:1-9">ver. 1-9</A>.

 II. Here is the sorrow of Zion's children taken notice of as the effect
 of her calamities, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:10-19">ver. 10-19</A>.

 III. The complaint is made to God, and the matter referred to his
 compassionate consideration, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:20-22">ver. 20-22</A>.

 The hand that wounded must make whole.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud
 in his anger, <I>and</I> cast down from heaven unto the earth the
 beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of
 his anger!
 &nbsp; 2  The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and
 hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong
 holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought <I>them</I> down to
 the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.
 &nbsp; 3  He hath cut off in <I>his</I> fierce anger all the horn of Israel:
 he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he
 burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, <I>which</I> devoureth round
 about.
 &nbsp; 4  He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right
 hand as an adversary, and slew all <I>that were</I> pleasant to the
 eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his
 fury like fire.
 &nbsp; 5  The Lord was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he
 hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong
 holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and
 lamentation.
 &nbsp; 6  And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as <I>if it
 were of</I> a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly:
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be
 forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his
 anger the king and the priest.
 &nbsp; 7  The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his
 sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls
 of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 as in the day of a solemn feast.
 &nbsp; 8  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of
 Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his
 hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall
 to lament; they languished together.
 &nbsp; 9  Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and
 broken her bars: her king and her princes <I>are</I> among the
 Gentiles: the law <I>is</I> no <I>more;</I> her prophets also find no
 vision from the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is a very sad representation which is here made of the state of 
 God's church, of Jacob and Israel, of Zion and Jerusalem; but the 
 emphasis in these verses seems to be laid all along upon the hand of 
 God in the calamities which they were groaning under. The grief is not 
 so much that such and such things are done as that God has done them, 
 that he appears angry with them; it is he that chastens them, and 
 chastens them <I>in wrath</I> and <I>in his hot displeasure;</I> he has 
 become their enemy, and fights against them; and this, this is the 
 wormwood and the gall in the affliction and the misery.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Time was when God's delight was in his church, and he appeared to 
 her, and appeared for her, as a friend. But now his displeasure is 
 against her; he is angry with her, and appears and acts against her as 
 an enemy. This is frequently repeated here, and sadly lamented. What he 
 has done he has done <I>in his anger;</I> this makes the present day a 
 melancholy day indeed with us, that it is <I>the day of his anger</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),
 
 and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)

 it is <I>in his wrath,</I> and 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 it is <I>in his fierce anger,</I> that he has <I>thrown down</I> and 
 <I>cut off,</I> and 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 <I>in the indignation of his anger.</I> Note, To those who know how to 
 value God's favour nothing appears more dreadful than his anger; 
 corrections in love are easily borne, but rebukes in love wound deeply. 
 It is God's wrath that <I>burns against Jacob like a flaming fire</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and it is a consuming fire; it <I>devours round about,</I> devours all 
 her honours, all her comforts. This is the <I>fury that is poured out
 like fire</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 like the fire and brimstone which were rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah; 
 but it was their sin that kindled this fire. God is such a tender
 Father to his children that we may be sure he is never angry with them 
 but when they provoke him, and give him cause to be angry; nor is he 
 ever angry more than there is cause for. God's covenant with them was
 that if they would <I>obey his voice</I> he would be <I>an enemy to 
 their enemies</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:22">Exod. xxiii. 22</A>),

 and he had been so as long as they kept close to him; but now he is an
 enemy to them; at least he is <I>as an enemy,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 He has <I>bent his bow like an enemy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 He stood <I>with his right hand</I> stretched out against them, and a 
 sword drawn in it <I>as an adversary.</I> God is not really an enemy to 
 his people, no, not when he is angry with them and corrects them in 
 anger. We may be sorely displeased against our dearest friends and 
 relations, whom yet we are far from having an enmity to. But sometimes 
 he is <I>as an enemy</I> to them, when all his providences concerning 
 them seem in outward appearance to have a tendency to their ruin, when 
 every thing made against them and nothing for them. But, blessed be 
 God, Christ is <I>our peace,</I> our peacemaker, who has slain the 
 enmity, and in him we may <I>agree with our adversary,</I> which it is 
 our wisdom to do, since it is in vain to contend with him, and he 
 offers us advantageous conditions of peace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Time was when God's church appeared very bright, and illustrations, 
 and considerable among the nations; but now <I>the Lord has covered the 
 daughter of Zion with a cloud</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 a dark cloud, which is very terrible to himself, and through which she 
 cannot see his face; <I>a thick cloud</I> (so that word signifies), a 
 <I>black cloud,</I> which eclipses all her glory and conceals her 
 excellency; not such a cloud as that under which God conducted them 
 through the wilderness, or that in which God took possession of the 
 temple and filled it with his glory: no, that side of the cloud is now 
 turned towards them which was turned towards the Egyptians in the Red 
 Sea. The <I>beauty of Israel is now cast down from heaven to the 
 earth;</I> their princes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:19">2 Sam. i. 19</A>),

 their religious worship, their beauty of holiness, all that which
 recommended them to the affection and esteem of their neighbours and 
 rendered them amiable, which had <I>lifted them up to heaven,</I> was 
 now withered and gone, because God had covered it with a cloud. He has 
 <I>cut off all the horn of Israel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 all her beauty and majesty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:17">Ps. cxxxii. 17</A>),

 all her plenty and fulness, and all her power and authority. They had,
 in their pride, lifted up their horn against God, and therefore justly 
 will God <I>cut off their horn.</I> He disabled them to resist and 
 oppose their enemies; he <I>turned back their right hand,</I> so that 
 they were not able to follow the blow which they gave nor to ward off 
 the blow which was given them. What can their right hand do against the 
 enemy when God draws it back, and withers it, as he did Jeroboam's? 
 Thus was the <I>beauty of Israel cast down,</I> when a people famed for 
 courage were not able to stand their ground nor make good their 
 post.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Time was when Jerusalem and the cities of Judah were strong and 
 well fortified, were trusted to by the inhabitants and let alone by the 
 enemy as impregnable. But now the lord has in anger <I>swallowed them 
 up;</I> they are quite gone; the forts and barriers are taken away, and 
 the invaders meet with no opposition: the stately structures, which 
 were their strength and beauty, are pulled down and laid waste. 

 1. The Lord has in anger <I>swallowed up all the habitations of
 Jacob</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 both the cities and the country houses; they are burnt, or otherwise 
 destroyed, so totally ruined that they seem to have been <I>swallowed 
 up,</I> and no remains left of them. He has <I>swallowed up, and has 
 not pitied.</I> One would have thought it a pity that such sumptuous 
 houses, so well built, so well furnished, should be quite destroyed, ad 
 that some pity should have been had for the poor inhabitants that were 
 thus dislodged and driven to wander; but God's wonted compassion seemed 
 to fail: <I>He has swallowed up Israel,</I> as a lion swallows up his 
 prey, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 2. He has <I>swallowed up</I> not only her common habitations, but her 
 palaces, <I>all her palaces,</I> the habitations of their princes and 
 great men 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 though those were most stately, and strong, and rich, and well guarded. 
 God's judgments, when they come with commission, level palaces with 
 cottages, and as easily swallow them up. If palaces be polluted with 
 sin, as theirs were, let them expect to be visited with a curse, which 
 shall <I>consume them, with the timber thereof and the stones 
 thereof,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+5:4">Zech. v. 4</A>.

 3. He had destroyed not only their dwelling-places, but their
 <I>strong-holds,</I> their castles, citadels, and places of defence.
 These he has <I>thrown down in his wrath,</I> and <I>brought them to 
 the ground;</I> for shall they stand in the way of his judgments, and 
 give check to the progress of them? No; let them drop like leaves in
 autumn; let them be rased to the foundations, and made to touch the 
 <I>ground,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 And again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 <I>He has destroyed his strong-holds;</I> for what strength could they 
 have against God? And thus he <I>increased in the daughter of Judah 
 mourning and lamentation,</I> for they could not but be in a dreadful 
 consternation when they saw all their defence departed from them. This 
 is again insisted on, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:7-9"><I>v.</I> 7-9</A>.

 In order to the <I>swallowing up of her palaces,</I> he has <I>given up 
 into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces,</I> which were 
 their security, and, when they are <I>broken down,</I> the palaces 
 themselves are soon broken into. The walls of palaces cannot protect
 them, unless God himself be a wall of fire round about them. This God 
 did <I>in his anger,</I> and yet he has done it deliberately. It is the 
 result of a previous purpose, and is done by a wise and steady 
 providence; for the Lord has <I>purposed to destroy the wall of the 
 daughter of Zion;</I> he brought the Chaldean army in on purpose to do 
 this execution. Note, Whatever desolations God makes in his church, 
 they are all according to his counsels; he <I>performs the thing that 
 is appointed for us,</I> even that which makes most against us. But, 
 when it is done, he has <I>stretched out a line,</I> a measuring line, 
 to do it exactly and by measure: hitherto the destruction shall go, and 
 no further; no more shall be cut off than what is marked to be so. Or 
 it is meant of <I>the line of confusion</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:11">Isa. xxxiv. 11</A>),

 a levelling line; for he will go on with his work; he <I>has not
 withdrawn his hand from destroying,</I> that right hand which he 
 stretched out against his people as <I>an adversary,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 As far as the purpose went the performance shall go, and his hand shall 
 accomplish his counsel to the utmost, and not be withdrawn. Therefore 
 he made the <I>rampart and the wall,</I> which the people had rejoiced 
 in and upon which perhaps they had <I>made merry,</I> to <I>lament,</I> 
 and they <I>languished together;</I> the <I>walls and the ramparts,</I> 
 or bulwarks, upon them, fell together, and were left to condole with 
 one another on their fall. <I>Her gates</I> are gone in an instant, so 
 that one would think they were sunk into the ground with their own 
 weight, and <I>he has destroyed and broken her bars,</I> those bars of 
 Jerusalem's gates which formerly <I>he had strengthened,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:13">Ps. cxlvii. 13</A>.

 Gates and bars will stand us in no stead when God has withdrawn his
 protection.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Time was when their government flourished, their princes made a 
 figure, their kingdom was great among the nations, and the balance of 
 power was on their side; but now it is quite otherwise: <I>He has 
 polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 They had first polluted themselves with their idolatries, and then God 
 dealt with them as with polluted things; he threw them to the dunghill, 
 the fittest place for them. He has given up their glory, which was
 looked upon as sacred (that is a character we give to majesty), to be 
 trampled upon and profaned; and no marvel that the king and the priest, 
 whose characters were always deemed venerable and inviolable, are 
 despised by every body, when God has, <I>in the indignation of his 
 anger, despised the king and the priest,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 He has abandoned them; he looks upon them as no longer worthy of the 
 honours conveyed to them by the covenants of royalty and priesthood, 
 but as having forfeited both; and then Zedekiah the king was used 
 despitefully, and Seraiah the chief priest put to death as a 
 malefactor. The crown has fallen from their heads, for <I>her king and 
 her princes are among the Gentiles,</I> prisoners among them, insulted 
 over by them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 and treated not only as common persons, but as the basest, without any 
 regard to their character. Note, It is just with God to debase those by 
 his judgments who have by sin debased themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Time was when the ordinances of God were administered among them in 
 their power and purity, and they had those tokens of God's presence 
 with them; but now those were taken from them, that part of the 
 <I>beauty of Israel</I> was gone which was indeed their greatest 
 beauty. 

 1. The ark was God's footstool, under the mercy-seat, between the
 cherubim; this was of all others the most sacred symbol of God's 
 presence (it is called his <I>footstool,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+28:2,Ps+99:5,132:7">1 Chron. xxviii. 2; 
 Ps. xcix. 5; cxxxii. 7</A>);

 there the Shechinah rested, and with an eye to this Israel was often
 protected and saved; but now he <I>remembered not his footstool.</I> 
 The ark itself was suffered, as it should seem, to fall into the hands 
 of the Chaldeans. God, being angry, threw that away; for it shall be no 
 longer his footstool; the earth shall be so, as it had been before the 
 ark was, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:1">Isa. lxvi. 1</A>.

 Of what little value are the tokens of his presence when his presence
 is gone! Nor was this the first time that God gave his ark into
 captivity,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:61">Ps. lxxviii. 61</A>.

 God and his kingdom can stand without that footstool. 

 2. Those that ministered in holy things had been <I>pleasant to the eye
 in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 they had been <I>purer than snow, whiter than mile</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:7"><I>ch.</I> iv. 7</A>);

 none more pleasant in the eyes of all good people than those that did
 the service of the tabernacle. But now these are slain, and their 
 <I>blood is mingled with their sacrifices.</I> Thus is the priest 
 despised as well as the king. Note, When those that were pleasant to 
 the eye in Zion's tabernacle are slain God must be acknowledged in it; 
 he has done it, and the <I>burning which the Lord has kindled must be 
 bewailed</I> but the whole house of Israel, as in the case of Nadab and 
 Abihu, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+10:6">Lev. x. 6</A>.

 3. The temple was God's tabernacle (as the tabernacle, while that was 
 in being, was called <I>his temple,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:4">Ps. xxvii. 4</A>)

 and this <I>he has violently taken away</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 he has plucked up the stakes of it and cut the cords; it shall be no 
 more a tabernacle, much less his; he has <I>taken it away,</I> as the 
 keeper <I>of a garden</I> takes away his hovel or shade, when he has 
 done with it and has no more occasion for it; he takes it down as 
 easily, as speedily, and with a little regret and reluctance as if it 
 were but a <I>cottage in a vineyard or a lodge in a garden of 
 cucumbers</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:8">Isa. i. 8</A>),
 
 but a <I>booth which the keeper makes,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+27:18">Job xxvii. 18</A>.

 When men profane God's tabernacle it is just with him to take it from
 them. God has justly refused to <I>smell their solemn assemblies</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:21">Amos v. 21</A>);

 they had provoked him to withdraw from them, and then no marvel that he
 has <I>destroyed his places of the assembly;</I> what should they do 
 with the places when the services had become an abomination? He has now 
 <I>abhorred his sanctuary</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 it has been defiled with sin, that only thing which he hates, and for 
 the sake of that he abhors even his sanctuary, which he had delighted 
 in and called <I>his rest for ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:14">Ps. cxxxii. 14</A>.

 Thus he had <I>done to Shiloh.</I> Now the enemies have made as great
 <I>a noise</I> of revelling and blaspheming <I>in the house of the 
 Lord</I> as ever had been made with the temple-songs and music <I>in 
 the day of a solemn feast,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:4">Ps. lxxiv. 4</A>.

 Some, by the <I>places of the assembly</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 understand not only the temple, but the synagogues, and the schools of 
 the prophets, which the enemy had <I>burnt up,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:8">Ps. lxxiv. 8</A>.

 4. The solemn feasts and the sabbaths had been carefully remembered,
 and the people constantly put in mind of them; but now the Lord has 
 <I>caused those to be forgotten,</I> not only in the country, among 
 those that lived at a distance, but even in Zion itself; for there were 
 none left to remember them, nor were there the places left where they 
 used to be observed. Now that Zion was in ruins no difference was made
 between sabbath time and other times; every day was a day of mourning, 
 so that all the <I>solemn feasts were forgotten.</I> Note, It is just 
 with God to deprive those of the benefit and comfort of sabbaths and 
 solemn feasts who have not duly valued them, nor conscientiously 
 observed them, but have profaned them, which was one of the sins that 
 the Jews were often charged with. Those that have <I>seen the days of 
 the Son of man,</I> and slighted them, may <I>desire to see one of 
 those days</I> and not be permitted,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:22">Luke xvii. 22</A>.

 5. The altar that had sanctified their gifts is now cast off, for God
 will no more accept their gifts, nor be honoured by their sacrifices,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The altar was <I>the table of the Lord,</I> but God will no longer keep 
 house among them; he will neither feast them nor feast with them. 

 6. They had been blest with prophets and teachers of the law; but now
 <I>the law is no more</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 it is no more read by the people, no more expounded by the scribes; the 
 tables of the law are gone with the ark; the book of the law is taken 
 from them, and the people are forbidden to have it. What should those 
 do with Bibles who had made no better improvement of them when they had 
 them? <I>Her prophets also find no vision from the Lord;</I> God 
 <I>answers them no more by prophets and dreams,</I> which was the 
 melancholy case of Saul, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:15">1 Sam. xxviii. 15</A>.

 They had persecuted God's prophets, and despised the visions they had
 from the Lord, and therefore it is just with God to say that they shall 
 have no more prophets, no more visions. Let them go to the prophets 
 that had flattered and deceived them with visions of their own hearts, 
 for they shall have none from God to comfort them, or tell them <I>how 
 long.</I> Those that misuse God's prophets justly lose them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground,
 <I>and</I> keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they
 have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem
 hang down their heads to the ground.
 &nbsp; 11  Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my
 liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the
 daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings
 swoon in the streets of the city.
 &nbsp; 12  They say to their mothers, Where <I>is</I> corn and wine? when
 they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when
 their soul was poured out into their mothers' bosom.
 &nbsp; 13  What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing
 shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I
 equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of
 Zion? for thy breach <I>is</I> great like the sea: who can heal thee?
 &nbsp; 14  Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and
 they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy
 captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of
 banishment.
 &nbsp; 15  All that pass by clap <I>their</I> hands at thee; they hiss and
 wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, <I>saying, Is</I> this
 the city that <I>men</I> call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the
 whole earth?
 &nbsp; 16  All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they
 hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed <I>her</I> up:
 certainly this <I>is</I> the day that we looked for; we have found, we
 have seen <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 17  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath done <I>that</I> which he had devised; he hath
 fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he
 hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused <I>thine</I>
 enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of thine
 adversaries.
 &nbsp; 18  Their heart cried unto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of
 Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself
 no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease.
 &nbsp; 19  Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches
 pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift
 up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that
 faint for hunger in the top of every street.
 &nbsp; 20  Behold, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and consider to whom thou hast done this.
 Shall the women eat their fruit, <I>and</I> children of a span long?
 shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the
 Lord?
 &nbsp; 21  The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my
 virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain
 <I>them</I> in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, <I>and</I> not
 pitied.
 &nbsp; 22  Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about,
 so that in the day of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s anger none escaped nor remained:
 those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy
 consumed.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Justly are these called <I>Lamentations,</I> and they are very pathetic 
 ones, the expressions of grief in perfection, mourning and woe, and 
 nothing else, like the contents of Ezekiel's roll, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+2:10">Ezek. ii. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Copies of lamentations are here presented and they are painted to 
 the life. 

 1. The judges and magistrates, who used to appear in robes of state,
 have laid them aside, or rather are stripped of them, and put on the 
 habit of mourners

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);

 the elders now sit no longer in the judgment-seats, the <I>thrones of 
 the house of David,</I> but they <I>sit upon the ground,</I> having no 
 seat to repose themselves in, or in token of great grief, as Job's 
 friends <I>sat with him upon the ground,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+2:13">Job ii. 13</A>.

 They open not their mouth in the gate, as usual, to give their opinion,
 but they <I>keep silence,</I> overwhelmed with grief, and not knowing 
 what to say. They have <I>cast dust upon their heads, and girded 
 themselves with sackcloth,</I> as deep mourners used to do; they had 
 lost their power and wealth, and that made the grieve thus. <I>Ploratur 
 lachrymis amissa pecunia veris--Genuine are the tears which we shed 
 over lost property.</I>

 2. The young ladies, who used to dress themselves so richly, and
 <I>walk with stretched-forth necks</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:16">Isa. iii. 16</A>),

 now are humbled; <I>The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to
 the ground;</I> those are made to know sorrow who seemed to bid 
 defiance to it and were always disposed to be merry. 

 3. The prophet himself is a pattern to the mourners,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 His <I>eyes do fail with tears;</I> he has wept till he can weep no 
 more, has almost wept his eyes out, wept himself blind. Nor are the 
 inward impressions of grief short of the outward expressions. <I>His 
 bowels are troubled,</I> as they were when he saw these calamities 
 coming 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:19,20">Jer. iv. 19, 20</A>),

 which, one would think, might have excused him now; but even he, to
 whom they were no surprise, felt them an insupportable grief, to such a 
 degree that his <I>liver is poured out on the earth;</I> he felt 
 himself a perfect colliquation; all his entrails were melted and 
 dissolved, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:14">Ps. xxii. 14</A>.

 Jeremiah himself had better treatment than his neighbours, better than
 he had had before from his own countrymen, nay, their destruction was 
 his deliverance, their captivity his enlargement; the same that made 
 them prisoners made him a favourite; and yet his private interests are 
 swallowed up in a concern for the public, and he bewails the 
 <I>destruction of the daughter of his people</I> as sensibly as if he 
 himself had been the greatest sufferer in that common calamity. Note, 
 The judgments of God upon the land and nation are to be lamented by us, 
 though we, for our parts, may escape pretty well.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Calls to lamentation are here given: <I>The heart of the people 
 cried unto the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Some fear it was a cry, not of true repentance, but of bitter 
 complaint; their heart was as full of grief as it could hold, and they 
 gave vent to it in doleful shrieks and outcries, in which they made use 
 of God's name; yet we will charitably suppose that many of them did in 
 sincerity cry unto God for mercy in their distress; and the prophet 
 bids them go on to do so: "<I>O wall of the daughter of Zion!</I> 
 either you that stand upon the wall, you <I>watchmen on the walls</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:6">Isa. lxii. 6</A>),

 when you see the enemies encamped about the walls and making their
 approaches towards them, or <I>because of the wall</I> (that is the
 subject of the lamentation), because of the <I>breaking down of the
 wall</I> (which was not done till about a month after the city was
 taken), because of this further calamity, let <I>the daughter of Zion
 lament</I> still." This was a thing which Nehemiah lamented long after,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:3,4">Neh. i. 3, 4</A>.

 "<I>Let tears run down like a river day and night,</I> weep without
 intermission, give thyself no rest from weeping, <I>let not the apple 
 of thy eye cease.</I>" This intimates, 

 1. That the calamities would be continuing, and the causes of grief
 would frequently recur, and fresh occasion would be given them every 
 day and every night to bemoan themselves. 

 2. That they would be apt, by degrees, to grow insensible and stupid
 under the hand of God, and would need to be still called upon to 
 afflict their souls yet more and more, till their proud and hard hearts 
 were thoroughly humbled and softened.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Causes for lamentation are here assigned, and the calamities that 
 are to be bewailed are very particularly and pathetically 
 described.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Multitudes perish by famine, a very sore judgment, and piteous is 
 the case of those that fall under it. God had corrected them by 
 scarcity of provisions through want of rain some time before 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:1">Jer. xiv. 1</A>),

 and they were not brought to repentance by that lower degree of this
 judgment, and therefore now by the straitness of the siege God brought 
 it upon them in extremity; for,

 (1.) The children died for hunger in their mothers' arms: <I>The
 children and sucklings,</I> whose innocent and helpless state entitles 
 them to relief as soon as any, <I>swoon in the streets</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)
 
 <I>as the wounded</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 there being no food to be had for them; those that are starved die as 
 surely as those that are stabbed. They lie a great while crying to 
 their poor mothers for corn to feed them and wine to refresh them, for 
 they are such as had been bred up to the use of wine and wanted it now; 
 but there is none for them, so that at length <I>their soul is poured 
 into their mothers' bosom,</I> and there they breathe their last. This 
 is mentioned again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>They faint for hunger in the top of every street.</I> Yet this is 
 not the worst, 

 (2.) There were some little children that were slain by their mothers'
 hands and eaten,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Such was the scarcity of provision that the <I>women ate the fruit</I> 
 of their own bodies, even their children when they were but of <I>a 
 span long,</I> according to the threatening, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:53">Deut. xxviii. 53</A>.

 The like was done in the siege of Samaria, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+6:29">2 Kings vi. 29</A>.

 Such extremities, nay, such barbarities, were they brought to by the
 famine. Let us, in our abundance, thank God that we have food
 convenient, not only for ourselves, but for our children.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Multitudes fall by the sword, which devours one as well as another, 
 especially when it is in the hand of such cruel enemies as the 
 Chaldeans were. 

 (1.) They spared no character, no, not the most distinguished; even the
 <I>priest and the prophet,</I> who of all men, one would think, might 
 expect protection from heaven and veneration on earth, <I>are 
 slain,</I> not abroad in the field of battle, where they are out of 
 their place, as Hophni and Phinehas, but in <I>the sanctuary of the 
 Lord,</I> the place of their business and which they hoped would be a 
 refuge to them.

 (2.) They spared no age, no, not those who, by reason of their tender
 or their decrepit age, were exempted from taking up the sword; for even 
 they <I>perished by the sword.</I> "The young, who have not yet come to 
 bear arms, and the old, who have had their <I>discharge, lie on the 
 ground, slain in the streets,</I> till some kind hand is found that 
 will bury them."

 (3.) They spared no sex: <I>My virgins and my young men have fallen by
 the sword.</I> In the most barbarous military executions that ever we 
 read of the virgins were spared, and made part of the spoil

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+31:18,Jdg+5:30">Num. xxxi. 18, Judges v. 30</A>),

 but here the virgins were put to the sword, as well as the young men.

 (4.) This was the <I>Lord's doing;</I> he suffered the sword of the
 Chaldeans to devour thus without distinction: <I>Thou has slain them in 
 the day of thy anger,</I> for it is God that <I>kills and makes 
 alive,</I> and saves alive, as he pleases. But that which follows is 
 very harsh: <I>Thou has killed, and not pitied;</I> for his soul is 
 <I>grieved for the misery of Israel.</I> The enemies that used them 
 thus cruelly were such as he had both mustered and summoned

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 "<I>Thou hast called in, as in a solemn day, my terrors round 
 about,</I> that is, the Chaldeans, who are such a terror to me;" 
 enemies crowded into Jerusalem now as thickly as ever worshippers used 
 to do on a solemn festival, so that they were quite overpowered with 
 numbers, and none escaped nor remained; Jerusalem was made a perfect 
 slaughter-house. Mothers are cut to the heart to see those whom they 
 have taken such care of, and pains with, and whom they have been so 
 tender of, thus inhumanly used, suddenly cut off, though not soon 
 reared: <I>Those that I have swaddled, and brought up, has my enemy
 consumed,</I> as if they were brought forth for the murderer, like 
 lambs for the butcher, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:13">Hosea ix. 13</A>.

 Zion, who was a mother to them all, lamented to see those who were
 brought up in her courts, and under the tuition of her oracles, thus 
 made a prey.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Their false prophets cheated them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 This was a thing which Jeremiah had lamented long before, and had 
 observed with a great concern 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:13">Jer. xiv. 13</A>):

 <I>Ah! Lord God, the prophets say unto them, You shall not see the
 sword;</I> and here he inserts it among his lamentations: <I>Thy 
 prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee;</I> they pretended 
 to discover for thee, and then to discover to thee, the mind and will 
 of God, to see <I>the visions of the Almighty</I> and then to speak his 
 words; but they were all vain and foolish things; their visions were 
 all their own fancies, and, if they thought they had any, it was only 
 the product of a crazed head or a heated imagination, as appeared by 
 what they delivered, which was all idle and impertinent: nay, it is 
 most likely that they themselves knew that the visions they pretended 
 were counterfeit, and all a sham, and made use of only to colour that 
 which they designedly imposed upon the people with, that they might 
 make an interest in them for themselves. They are thy prophets, not
 God's prophets; he never sent them, nor were they pastors after his 
 heart, but the people set them up, told them what they should say, so 
 that they were <I>prophets after their hearts.</I>

 (1.) Prophets should tell people of their faults, should show them 
 their sins, that they may bring them to repentance, and so prevent 
 their ruin; but these prophets knew that would lose them the people's 
 affections and contributions, and knew they could not reprove their 
 hearers without reproaching themselves at the same time, and therefore 
 <I>they have not discovered thy iniquity;</I> they saw it not 
 themselves, or, if they did, saw so little evil in it, or danger from 
 it, that they would not tell them of it, though that might have been a 
 means, by taking away their iniquity, to turn away their captivity.

 (2.) Prophets should warn people of the judgments of God coming upon 
 them, but these <I>saw for them false burdens;</I> the messages they 
 pretended to deliver to them from God they knew to be false, and 
 falsely ascribed to God; so that, by soothing them up in carnal 
 security, they caused that banishment which, by plain dealing, they 
 might have prevented.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Their neighbours laughed at them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>All that pass by thee clap their hands at thee.</I> Jerusalem had 
 made a great figure, got a great name, and borne a great sway, among 
 the nations; it was the envy and terror of all about; and, when the 
 city was thus reduced; they all (as men are apt to do in such a case) 
 triumphed in its fall; <I>they hissed, and wagged the head,</I> 
 pleasing themselves to see how much it had fallen from its former 
 pretensions. <I>Is this the city</I> (said they) <I>that men called the 
 perfection of beauty?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:2">Ps. l. 2</A>.

 How is it now the perfection of deformity! Where is all its beauty now?
 <I>Is this the city which was called the joy of the whole earth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:2">Ps. xlviii. 2</A>),

 which rejoiced in the gifts of God's bounty and grace more than any
 other place, and which all the earth rejoiced in? Where is all its joy 
 now and all its glorying? It is a great sin thus to make a jest of 
 others' miseries, and adds very much affliction to the afflicted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Their enemies triumphed over them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Those that wished ill to Jerusalem and her peace now vent their spite 
 and malice, which before they concealed; they now <I>open their 
 mouths,</I> nay, they widen them; they <I>hiss and gnash their 
 teeth</I> in scorn and indignation; they triumph in their own success 
 against her, and the rich prey they have got in making themselves 
 masters of Jerusalem: "<I>We have swallowed her up;</I> it is our 
 doing, and it is our gain; it is all our own now. Jerusalem shall never 
 be either courted or feared as she has been. <I>Certainly this is the 
 day that we have long looked for; we have found it; we have seen it; 
 aha! so would we have it.</I>" Note, The enemies of the church are apt 
 to take its shocks for its ruins, and to triumph in them accordingly; 
 but they will find themselves deceived; <I>for the gates of hell shall 
 not prevail against the church.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. Their God, in all this, appeared against them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>The Lord has done that which he had devised.</I> The destroyers of 
 Jerusalem could have <I>no power against her unless it were given them 
 from above.</I> They are but the sword in God's hand; it is he that has 
 <I>thrown down, and has not pitied.</I> "In this controversy of his 
 with us we have not had the usual instances of his compassion towards 
 us." <I>He has caused they enemy to rejoice over thee</I> (see 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:11">Job xxx. 11</A>);

 <I>he has set up the horn of thy adversaries,</I> has given them power
 and matter for pride. This is indeed the highest aggravation of the 
 trouble, that God has become their enemy, and yet it is the strongest 
 argument for patience under it; we are bound to submit to what God 
 does, for,

 (1.) It is the performance of his purpose: <I>The Lord has done that
 which he had devised;</I> it is done with counsel and deliberation, not 
 rashly, or upon a sudden resolve; it is the <I>evil that he has 
 framed</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:11">Jer. xviii. 11</A>),

 and we may be sure it is framed so as exactly to answer the intention.
 What God devises against his people is designed for them, and so it 
 will be found in the issue.

 (2.) It is the accomplishment of his predictions; it is the fulfilling
 of the scripture; he has now <I>put in execution his word that he had 
 commanded in the days of old.</I> When he gave them his law by Moses he 
 told them what judgments he would certainly inflict upon them if they 
 transgressed that law; and now that they have been guilty of the 
 transgression of this law he had executed the sentence of it, according 
 to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:16,De+28:15">Lev. xxvi. 16, &c., Deut. xxviii. 15</A>.

 Note, In all the providences of God concerning his church it is good to
 take notice of the fulfilling of his word; for there is an exact 
 agreement between the judgments of God's hand and the judgments of his 
 mouth, and when they are compared they will mutually explain and 
 illustrate each other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Comforts for the cure of these lamentations are here sought for and 
 prescribed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They are sought for and enquired after, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 The prophet seeks to find out some suitable acceptable words to say to 
 her in this case: <I>Wherewith shall I comfort thee, O virgin! daughter 
 of Zion?</I> Note, We should endeavour to comfort those whose 
 calamities we lament, and, when our passions have made the worst of 
 them, our wisdom should correct them and labour to make the best of 
 them; we should study to make our sympathies with or afflicted friends 
 turn to their consolation. Now the two most common topics of comfort, 
 in case of affliction, are here tried, but are laid by because they 
 would not hold. We commonly endeavour to comfort our friends by telling 
 them, 

 (1.) That their case is not singular, nor without precedent; there are
 many whose trouble is greater, and lies heavier upon them, than theirs 
 does; but Jerusalem's case will not admit this argument: "<I>What thing 
 shall I liken to thee,</I> or <I>what shall I equal to thee, that I may 
 comfort thee?</I> What city, what country, is there, whose case is 
 parallel to thine? What witness shall I produce to prove an example 
 that will reach thy present calamitous state? Alas! there is none, no 
 sorrow like thine, because there is none whose honour was like thine."

 (2.) We tell them that their case is not desperate, but that it may
 easily be remedied; but neither will that be admitted here, upon a view 
 of human probabilities; for <I>thy breach is great, like the sea,</I> 
 like the breach which the sea sometimes makes upon the land, which 
 cannot be repaired, but still grows wider and wider. Thou art wounded, 
 and <I>who shall heal thee?</I> No wisdom nor power of man can repair 
 the desolations of such a broken shattered state. It is to no purpose 
 therefore to administer any of these common cordials; therefore,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The method of cure prescribed is to address themselves to God, and 
 by a penitent prayer to commit their case to him, and to be instant and 
 constant in such prayers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 "<I>Arise</I> out of thy dust, out of thy despondency, <I>cry out in 
 the night,</I> watch unto prayer; when others are asleep, be thou upon 
 thy knees, importunate with God for mercy; <I>in the beginning of the 
 watches,</I> of each of the four watches, of the night (let thy <I>eyes 
 prevent</I> them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:148">Ps. cxix. 148</A>),

 then <I>pour out thy heart like water before the Lord,</I> be free and
 full in prayer, be sincere and serious in prayer, open thy mind, spread 
 thy case before the Lord; <I>lift up thy hands towards him</I> in holy 
 desire and expectation; beg for <I>the life of thy young children.</I> 
 These poor lambs, what have they done? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:17">2 Sam. xxiv. 17</A>.

 Take with you words, take with you these words

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 <I>Behold, O Lord! and consider to whom thou hast done this,</I> with 
 whom thou hast dealt thus. Are they not thy own, the seed of Abraham 
 thy friend and of Jacob thy chosen? Lord, take their case into thy 
 compassionate consideration!" Note, Prayer is a salve for every sore, 
 even the sorest, a remedy for every malady, even the most grievous. And 
 our business in prayer is not to prescribe, but to subscribe to the 
 wisdom and will of God; to refer our case to him, and then to leave it 
 with him. <I>Lord, behold and consider,</I> and <I>thy will be 
 done.</I></P>
