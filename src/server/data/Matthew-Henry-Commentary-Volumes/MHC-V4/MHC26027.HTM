 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Still we are attending the funeral of Tyre and the lamentations made 
 for the fall of that renowned city. In this chapter we have, 

 I. A large account of the dignity, wealth, and splendour of Tyre, while
 it was in its strength, the vast trade it drove, and the interest it 
 had among the nations 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:1-25">ver. 1-25</A>),

 which is designed to make its ruin the more lamentable.

 II. A prediction of its fall and ruin, and the confusion and
 consternation which all its neighbours shall thereby be put into,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:26-36">ver. 26-36</A>.

 And this is intended to stain the pride of all worldly glory, and, by 
 setting the one over-against the other, to let us see the vanity and 
 uncertainty of the riches, honours, and pleasures of the world, and 
 what little reason we have to place our happiness in them or to be 
 confident of the continuance of them; so that all this is written for 
 our learning.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came again unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Now, thou son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus;
 &nbsp; 3  And say unto Tyrus, O thou that art situate at the entry of
 the sea, <I>which art</I> a merchant of the people for many isles,
 Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; O Tyrus, thou hast said, I <I>am</I> of
 perfect beauty.
 &nbsp; 4  Thy borders <I>are</I> in the midst of the seas, thy builders have
 perfected thy beauty.
 &nbsp; 5  They have made all thy <I>ship</I> boards of fir trees of Senir:
 they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee.
 &nbsp; 6  <I>Of</I> the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the
 company of the Ashurites have made thy benches <I>of</I> ivory,
 <I>brought</I> out of the isles of Chittim.
 &nbsp; 7  Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou
 spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the isles of
 Elishah was that which covered thee.
 &nbsp; 8  The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy
 wise <I>men,</I> O Tyrus, <I>that</I> were in thee, were thy pilots.
 &nbsp; 9  The ancients of Gebal and the wise <I>men</I> thereof were in thee
 thy calkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in
 thee to occupy thy merchandise.
 &nbsp; 10  They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army,
 thy men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they
 set forth thy comeliness.
 &nbsp; 11  The men of Arvad with thine army <I>were</I> upon thy walls round
 about, and the Gammadims were in thy towers: they hanged their
 shields upon thy walls round about; they have made thy beauty
 perfect.
 &nbsp; 12  Tarshish <I>was</I> thy merchant by reason of the multitude of
 all <I>kind of</I> riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they
 traded in thy fairs.
 &nbsp; 13  Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they <I>were</I> thy merchants: they
 traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market.
 &nbsp; 14  They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with
 horses and horsemen and mules.
 &nbsp; 15  The men of Dedan <I>were</I> thy merchants; many isles <I>were</I> the
 merchandise of thine hand: they brought thee <I>for</I> a present
 horns of ivory and ebony.
 &nbsp; 16  Syria <I>was</I> thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the
 wares of thy making: they occupied in thy fairs with emeralds,
 purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate.
 &nbsp; 17  Judah, and the land of Israel, they <I>were</I> thy merchants:
 they traded in thy market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and
 honey, and oil, and balm.
 &nbsp; 18  Damascus <I>was</I> thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of
 thy making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of
 Helbon, and white wool.
 &nbsp; 19  Dan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs:
 bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were in thy market.
 &nbsp; 20  Dedan <I>was</I> thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots.
 &nbsp; 21  Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with
 thee in lambs, and rams, and goats: in these <I>were they</I> thy
 merchants.
 &nbsp; 22  The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they <I>were</I> thy
 merchants: they occupied in thy fairs with chief of all spices,
 and with all precious stones, and gold.
 &nbsp; 23  Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur,
 <I>and</I> Chilmad, <I>were</I> thy merchants.
 &nbsp; 24  These <I>were</I> thy merchants in all sorts <I>of things,</I> in blue
 clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound
 with cords, and made of cedar, among thy merchandise.
 &nbsp; 25  The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market: and
 thou wast replenished, and made very glorious in the midst of the
 seas.

 Here, 

 I. The prophet is ordered to take up a lamentation for Tyrus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 It was yet in the height of its prosperity, and there appeared not the 
 least symptom of its decay; yet the prophet must lament it, because its 
 prosperity is its snare, is the cause of its pride and security, which 
 will make its fall the more grievous. Even those that live at ease are 
 to be lamented if they be not preparing for trouble. He must lament it 
 because its ruin is hastening on apace; it is sure, it is near; and 
 though the prophet foretel it, and justify God in it, yet he must 
 lament it. Note, We ought to mourn for the miseries of other nations, 
 as well as for our own, out of an affection for mankind in general; it 
 is a part of the honour we owe to all men to bewail their calamities, 
 even those which they have brought upon themselves by their own 
 folly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He is directed what to say, and to say it in the name of <I>the 
 Lord Jehovah,</I> a name not unknown in Tyre, and which shall be better 
 known, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:6"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He must upbraid Tyre with her pride: <I>O Tyrus! thou hast said, I 
 am of perfect beauty</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 of <I>universal beauty</I> (so the word is), every way accomplished, 
 and therefore every where admired. Zion, that had the <I>beauty of
 holiness,</I> is called indeed the <I>perfection of beauty</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:2">Ps. l. 2</A>);

 that is the <I>beauty of the Lord.</I> But Tyre, because well-built and
 well-filled with money and trade, will set up for a perfect beauty.
 Note, It is the folly of the children of this world to value themselves 
 on the pomp and pleasure they live in, to call themselves beauties for 
 the sake of them, and, if in these they excel others, to think 
 themselves perfect. But God takes notice of the vain conceits men have 
 of themselves in their prosperity when the mind is lifted up with the 
 condition, and often, for the humbling of the spirit, finds a way to 
 bring down the estate. Let none reckon themselves beautified any 
 further than they are sanctified, nor say that they are of perfect 
 beauty till they come to heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He must upbraid Tyre with her prosperity, which was the matter of 
 her pride. In elegies it is usual to insert encomiums of those whose 
 fall we lament; the prophet, accordingly, praises Tyre for all that she 
 had that was praiseworthy. He has nothing to say of her religion, her 
 piety, her charity, her being a refuge to the distressed or using her 
 interest to do good offices among her neighbours; but she lived great, 
 and had a great trade, and all the trading part of mankind made court 
 to her. The prophet must describe her height and magnificence, that God 
 may be the more glorified in her fall, as the God who <I>looks upon 
 every one that is proud and abases him, hides the proud in the dust 
 together, and binds their faces in secret,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:12">Job xl. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The city of Tyre was advantageously situated, <I>at the entry of 
 the sea</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 having many commodious harbours each way, not as cities seated on 
 rivers, which the shipping can come but one way to. It stood at the 
 east end of the Mediterranean, very convenient for trade by land into 
 all the Levant parts; so that she became a <I>merchant of the people 
 for many isles.</I> Lying between Greece and Asia, it became the great 
 emporium, or mart-town, the rendezvous of merchants from all parts: 
 <I>They borders are in the heart of the seas,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 It was surrounded with water, which was a great advantage to its trade; 
 it was the darling of the sea, laid in its bosom, in its heart. Note, 
 It is a great convenience, upon many accounts, to live in an island: 
 seas are the most <I>ancient land-mark,</I> not <I>which our fathers 
 have set,</I> but the God of our fathers, and which cannot be removed 
 as other land-marks may, nor so easily got over. The people so situated 
 may the more easily <I>dwell alone,</I> if they please, as <I>not 
 reckoned among the nations,</I> and yet, if they please, may the more 
 easily traffic abroad and keep a correspondence with the nations. We 
 therefore of this island must own that he who determines the bounds of 
 men's habitations has determined well for us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It was curiously built, according as the fashion then was; and,
 being a city on a hill, it made a glorious show and tempted the ships 
 that sailed by into her ports 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>They builders have perfected thy beauty;</I> they have so improved 
 in architecture that nothing appears in the buildings of Tyre that can 
 be found fault with; and yet it wants that perfection of beauty into 
 which the Lord does and will build up his Jerusalem.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) It had its haven replenished with abundance of <I>gallant 
 ships,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:21">Isa. xxxiii. 21</A>.

 The ship-carpenters did their part, as well as the house-carpenters
 theirs. The Tyrians are thought to be the first that invented the art 
 of navigation; at least they improved it, and brought it to as great a 
 perfection perhaps as it could be without the loadstone.

 [1.] They made the <I>boards,</I> or planks, for the hulk of the ship, 
 of <I>fir-trees</I> fetched from <I>Senir,</I> a mount in the land of 
 Israel, joined with Hermon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:8">Cant. iv. 8</A>.

 Planks of fir were smooth and light, but not so lasting as our English
 oak.

 [2.] They had cedars from Lebanon, another mountain of Israel, for 
 their masts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 [3.] They had oaks from Bashan 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:13">Isa. ii. 13</A>),

 to make oars of; for it is probable that their ships were mostly
 galleys, that go with oars. The people of Israel built few ships for 
 themselves, but they furnished the Tyrians with timber for shipping. 
 Thus one country uses what another produced, and so they are 
 serviceable one to another, and cannot say to each other, <I>I have no 
 need of thee.</I>

 [4.] Such magnificence did they affect in building their ships that 
 they made the very <I>benches</I> of <I>ivory,</I> which they fetched 
 from <I>the isles of Chittim,</I> from Italy or Greece, and had workmen 
 from the Ashurites or Assyrians to make them, so rich would they have 
 their state-rooms in their ships to be. 

 [5.] So very prodigal were they that they made their <I>sails</I> of 
 <I>fine linen</I> fetched from Egypt, and that <I>embroidered</I> too, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Or it may be meant of their <I>flags</I> (which they hoisted to notify 
 what city they belonged to), which were very costly. The word signifies 
 a <I>banner</I> as well as a <I>sail.</I>

 [6.] They hung those rooms on ship-board with <I>blue and purple,</I> 
 the richest cloths and richest colours they could get from the isles 
 they traded with. For though Tyre was itself famous for purple, which 
 is therefore called the <I>Tyrian dye,</I> yet they must have that 
 which was far-fetched.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) These gallant ships were well-manned, by men of great ingenuity 
 and industry. The pilots and masters of the ships, that had command in 
 their fleets, were of their own city, such as they could put a 
 confidence in 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Thy wise men, O Tyrus! that were in thee, were thy pilots.</I> But,
 for common sailors, they had men from other countries; <I>The 
 inhabitants of Arvad and Zidon were thy mariners.</I> These came from 
 cities hear them; Zidon was sister to Tyre, not two leagues off, to the 
 northward; there they bred able seamen, which it is the interest of the 
 maritime powers to support and give all the countenance they can to. 
 They sent to Gebal in Syria for <I>calkers,</I> or <I>strengtheners of 
 the clefts</I> or <I>chinks,</I> to stop them when the ships come home, 
 after long voyages, to be repaired. To do this they had the 
 <I>ancients</I> and <I>wise men</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 for there is more need of wisdom and prudence to repair what has gone 
 to decay than to build anew. In public matters there is occasion for 
 the <I>ancients</I> and <I>wise men</I> to be the <I>repairers of the 
 breaches and the restorers of paths to dwell in.</I> Nay, all the 
 countries they traded with were at their service, and were willing to 
 send men into their pay, to put their youths apprentice in Tyre, or to 
 put them on board their fleets; so that <I>all the ships in the sea 
 with their mariners were</I> ready <I>to occupy thy merchandise.</I> 
 Those that give good wages shall have hands at command.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) Their city was guarded by a military force that was very 
 considerable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 The Tyrians were themselves wholly given to trade; but it was necessary 
 that they should have a good army on foot, and therefore they took 
 those of other states into their pay, such as were fittest for service, 
 though they had them from afar (which perhaps was their policy), from 
 Persia, Lud, and Phut. These bore their arms when there was occasion, 
 and in time of peace <I>hung up the shield and buckler</I> in the 
 armoury, as it were to proclaim peace, and let the world know that they 
 had at present no need of them, but they were ready to be taken down 
 whenever there was occasion for them. Their <I>walls</I> were 
 <I>guarded</I> by the <I>man of Arvad;</I> their <I>towers</I> were 
 garrisoned by <I>the Gammadim,</I> robust men, that had a great deal of 
 strength in <I>their arms;</I> yet the vulgar Latin renders it 
 <I>pygmies,</I> men no longer than one's arm. They <I>hung their 
 shields upon the walls</I> in their magazines or places of arms; or 
 hung them out upon the walls of the city, that none might dare to 
 approach them, seeing how well provided they were with all things 
 necessary for their own defence. "Thus <I>they set forth thy 
 comeliness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 and <I>made they beauty perfect,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 It contributed as much as any thing to the glory of Tyre that it had 
 those of all the surrounding nations in its service, except the land of 
 Israel (though it lay next them), which furnished them with timber, but 
 we do not find that it furnished them with men; that would have 
 trenched upon the liberty and dignity of the Jewish nation, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+2:17,18">2 Chron. ii. 17, 18</A>.

 It was also the glory of Tyre that it had such a militia, so fit for
 service, and in constant pay, and such an armoury, like that in the 
 tower of David, where hung the <I>shields of mighty men,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:4">Cant. iv. 4</A>.

 It is observable that there and here the armouries are said to be
 furnished with <I>shields</I> and <I>helmets,</I> defensive arms, not 
 with swords and spears, offensive, though it is probable that there 
 were such, to intimate that the military force of a people must be 
 intended only for their own protection and not to invade and annoy 
 their neighbours, to secure their own right, not to encroach upon the 
 rights of others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) They had a vast trade and a correspondence with all parts of the 
 known world. Some nations they dealt with in one commodity and some in 
 another, according as either its products or its manufactures were, and 
 the fruits of nature or art were, with which it was blessed. This is 
 very much enlarged upon here, as that which was the principal glory of 
 Tyre, and which supported all the rest. We do not find any where in 
 scripture so many nations named together as are here; so that this 
 chapter, some think, gives much light to the first account we have of 
 the settlement of the nations after the flood, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:1-32">Gen. x</A>.

 The critics have abundance of work here to find out the several places
 and nations spoken of. Concerning many of them their conjectures are 
 different and they leave us in the dark and at much uncertainty; it is 
 well that it is not material. Modern surveys come short of explaining 
 the ancient geography. And therefore we will not amuse ourselves here 
 with a particular enquiry either concerning the traders or the goods 
 they traded in. We leave it to the critical expositors, and observe 
 that only which is improvable.

 [1.] We have reason to think that Ezekiel knew little, of his own 
 knowledge, concerning the trade of Tyre. He was a priest, carried away 
 captive far enough from the neighbourhood of Tyre, we may suppose when 
 he was young, and there he had been eleven years. And yet he speaks of 
 the particular merchandises of Tyre as nicely as if he had been 
 comptroller of the custom-house there, by which it appears that he was 
 divinely inspired in what he spoke and wrote. It is God that <I>saith 
 this,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 [2.] This account of the trade of Tyre intimates to us that God's eye 
 is upon men, and that he takes cognizance of what they do when they are 
 employed in their worldly business, not only when they are at church, 
 praying and hearing, but when they are in their markets and fairs, and 
 upon the exchange, buying and selling, which is a good reason why we 
 should in all our dealings <I>keep a conscience void of offence,</I> 
 and have our eye always upon him whose eye is always upon us. 

 [3.] We may here observe the wisdom of God, and his goodness, as the 
 common Father of mankind, in making one country to abound in one 
 commodity and another in another, and all more or less serviceable 
 either to the necessity or to the comfort or ornament of human life.
 <I>Non omis fert omnia tellus--One land does not supply all the 
 varieties of produce.</I> Providence dispenses its gifts variously, 
 some to each, and all to none, that there may be a mutual commerce 
 among those whom God has <I>made of one blood,</I> though they are made 
 <I>to dwell on all the face of the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:27">Acts xvii. 26</A>.

 Let every nations therefore thank God for the productions of its
 country; though they be not so rich as those of others, yet there is 
 use for them in the public service of the world.

 [4.] See what a blessing trade and merchandise are to mankind, 
 especially when followed in the fear of God, and with a regard not only 
 to private advantage, but to a common benefit. <I>The earth is full of 
 God's riches,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:24">Ps. civ. 24</A>.

 There is a <I>multitude of all kinds of riches</I> in it (as it is
 here,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 gathered off its surface and dug out of its bowels. The earth is also 
 full of the fruits of men's ingenuity and industry, according as their 
 genius leads them. Now by exchange and barter these are made more 
 extensively useful; thus what can be spared is helped off, and what is 
 wanted is fetched in, in lieu of it, from the most distant countries.
 Those that are not tradesmen themselves have reason to thank God for 
 tradesmen and merchants, by whom the productions of other countries are 
 brought to our hands, as those of our own are by our husbandmen.

 [5.] Besides the necessaries that are here traded in, see what 
 abundance of things are here mentioned that only serve to please fancy, 
 and are made valuable only by men's humour and custom; and yet God 
 allows us to use them, and trade in them, and part with those things 
 for them which we can spare that are of an intrinsic worth much beyond 
 them. Here are <I>horns of ivory and ebony</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 that are <I>brought for a present,</I> exposed to sale, and offered in 
 exchange, or (as some think) presented to the city, or the great men of 
 it, to obtain their favour. Here are <I>emeralds, coral,</I> and 
 <I>agate</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 all <I>precious stones, and gold</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 which the world could better be without than iron and common stones.
 Here are, to please the taste and smell, the <I>chief of all spices</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),
 
 <I>cassia and calamus</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 and, for ornament, <I>purple, broidered work, and fine linen</I>

 Upon the review of this invoice, or bill of parcels, we may justly say, 
 What a great many things are here that we have no need of, and can live 
 very comfortably without!

 [6.] It is observable that Judah and the <I>land of Israel</I> were 
 merchants in Tyre too; in a way of trade they were allowed to converse 
 with the heathen. But they traded mostly <I>in wheat,</I> a substantial 
 commodity, and necessary, <I>wheat of Minnith and Pannag,</I> two 
 countries in Canaan famous for the best wheat, as some think. The whole 
 land indeed was a <I>land of wheat</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:8">Deut. viii. 8</A>);

 it had <I>the fat of kidneys of wheat,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:14">Deut. xxxii. 14</A>.

 Tyre was maintained by corn fetched from the land of Israel. They
 traded likewise in <I>honey, and oil,</I> and <I>balm,</I> or 
 <I>rosin;</I> all useful things, and not serving to pride or luxury.
 And the land which these were the staple commodities of was that which 
 was the <I>glory of all lands,</I> which God reserved for his peculiar 
 people, not those that traded in spices and <I>precious stones;</I> and 
 the Israel of God must reckon themselves well provided for if they have 
 <I>food convenient;</I> for those that are acquainted with the delights 
 of the children of God will not set their hearts on the <I>delights of 
 the sons and daughters of men,</I> or the <I>treasures of kings and 
 provinces.</I> We find indeed that the New-Testament Babylon trades in 
 such things as Tyre traded in,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:12,13">Rev. xviii. 12, 13</A>.

 For, notwithstanding its pretensions to sanctity, it is a mere worldly 
 interest.

 [7.] Though Tyre was a city of great merchandise, and they got
 abundance by buying and selling, importing commodities from one place 
 and exporting them to another, yet manufacture-trades were not 
 neglected. The <I>wares of their own making,</I> and a <I>multitude of 
 such wares,</I> are here spoken of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:16,18"><I>v.</I> 16, 18</A>.

 It is the wisdom of a nation to encourage art and industry, and not to 
 bear hard upon the handicraft-tradesmen; for it contributes much to the 
 wealth and honour of a nation to send abroad <I>wares of their own 
 making,</I> which may bring them in the <I>multitude of all riches.</I>

 [8.] All this made Tyrus very great and very proud: <I>The ships of 
 Tarshish did sing of thee in they market</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>);

 thou wast admired and cried up by all the nations that had dealings 
 with thee; for <I>thou wast replenished</I> in wealth and number of 
 people, wast beautified, and <I>made very glorious, in the midst of the 
 seas.</I> Those that grow very rich are cried up as very glorious; for 
 riches are glorious things in the eyes of carnal people,

 We have seen Tyre flourishing; here we have Tyre falling, and great is 
 the fall of it, so much the greater for its having made such a figure 
 in the world. Note, The most mighty and magnificent kingdoms and 
 states, sooner or later, have their day to come down. They have their 
 period; and, when they are in their zenith, they will begin to decline. 
 But the destruction of Tyre was sudden. Her <I>sun went down at 
 noon.</I> And all her wealth and grandeur, pomp and power, did but 
 aggravate her ruin, and make it the more grievous to herself and 
 astonishing to all about her. Now observe here, 

 1. How the ruin of Tyrus will be brought about,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 She is as a great ship richly laden, that is split or sunk by the 
 indiscretion of her steersmen: <I>Thy rowers have</I> themselves 
 <I>brought thee into great</I> and dangerous <I>waters;</I> the 
 governors of the city, and those that had the management of their 
 public affairs, by some mismanagement or other involved them in that 
 war with the Chaldeans which was the ruin of their state. By their 
 insolence, by some affront given to the Chaldeans or some attempt made 
 upon them, in confidence of their own ability to contend with them, 
 they provoked Nebuchadnezzar to make a descent upon them, and, by their 
 obstinacy in standing it out to the last, enraged him to such a degree 
 that he determined on the ruin of their state, and, <I>like an east 
 wind, broke them in the midst of the seas.</I> Note, It is ill with a 
 people when those that sit at the stern, instead of putting them into 
 the harbour, run them aground. 

 2. How great and general the ruin will be. All her wealth shall be 
 buried with her, <I>her riches, her fairs, and her merchandise</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>);

 all that had any dependence upon her, and dealings with her, in trade, 
 in war, in conversation, shall <I>ball with her into the midst of the 
 seas, in the day of her ruin.</I> Note, Those who make creatures their 
 confidence, place their happiness in their interest in them and rest 
 their hopes upon them, will of course fall with them; <I>happy</I> 
 therefore <I>are those that have the God of Jacob for their help,</I> 
 and <I>whose hope is in the Lord their God,</I> who lives for ever. 

 3. What sad lamentation would be made for the destruction of Tyre. The
 pilots, her princes and governors, when they see how wretchedly they 
 have mismanaged and how much they have contributed to their own ruin, 
 shall <I>cry out</I> so loud as to make even the <I>suburbs shake</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 such a vexation shall it be to them to reflect upon their own bad 
 conduct. The inferior officers, that were as the mariners of the state, 
 shall be forced to come down from their respective posts 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 and they shall <I>cry out against thee,</I> as having deceived them, in 
 not proving so well able to hold out as they thought thou hadst been; 
 they shall <I>cry bitterly</I> for the common ruin, and their own share 
 in it. They shall use all the most solemn expressions of grief; they 
 shall <I>cast dust on their heads,</I> in indignation against 
 themselves, shall <I>wallow themselves in ashes,</I> as having bid a 
 final farewell to all ease and pleasure; they shall <I>make themselves 
 bald</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),

 with <I>tearing their hair;</I> and, according to the custom of great 
 mourners, those shall <I>gird themselves with sackcloth</I> who used to 
 wear find linen, and, instead of merry songs, they shall <I>weep with 
 bitterness of heart.</I> Note, Losses and crosses are very grievous, 
 and hard to be borne, to those that have long been wallowing in 
 pleasure and sleeping in carnal security. 

 4. How Tyre should be upbraided with her former honour and prosperity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:32,33"><I>v.</I> 32, 33</A>);

 she that was Tyrus the <I>renowned</I> shall now be called <I>Tyrus the 
 destroyed</I> in the <I>midst of the sea. "What city is like Tyre?</I>
 Did ever any city come down from such a height of prosperity to such a 
 depth of adversity? Time was when <I>thy wares,</I> those of thy own 
 making and those that passed through thy hands, <I>went forth out of 
 the seas,</I> and were exported to all parts of the world; then <I>thou 
 filledst many people,</I> and didst <I>enrich the kings of the 
 earth</I> and their kingdoms." The Tyrians, though they bore such a 
 sway in trade, were yet, it seems, fair merchants, and let their 
 neighbours not only live, but thrive by them. All that dealt with them
 were gainers; they did not cheat or oppress the people, but did enrich 
 them with <I>the multitude of their merchandise.</I> "But now those 
 that used to be enriched by thee shall be ruined with thee" (as is 
 usual in trade); "<I>when thou shalt be broken,</I> and all thou hast 
 is seized on, <I>all thy company shall fall too,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 There is an end of Tyre, that made such a noise and bustle in the 
 world. This great blaze goes out in a snuff. 

 5. How the fall of Tyre should be matter of terror to some and laughter
 to others, according as they were differently interested and affected.
 Some shall be <I>sorely afraid,</I> and shall <I>be troubled</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>),

 concluding it will be their own turn to fall next. Others shall <I>hiss 
 at her</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>),

 shall ridicule her pride, and vanity, and bad management, and think her 
 ruin just. She triumphed in Jerusalem's fall, and there are those that 
 will triumph in hers. When God casts his judgments on the sinner 
 <I>men</I> also <I>shall clap their hands at him</I> and <I>shall hiss 
 him out of his place,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+27:22,23">Job xxvii. 22, 23</A>.

 <I>Is this the city which men called the perfection of beauty?</I></P>
