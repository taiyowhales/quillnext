 An account was given of the porch of the house in the close of the 
 foregoing chapter; this brings us to the temple itself, the description 
 of which here given creates much difficulty to the critical expositors 
 and occasions differences among them. Those must consult them who are
 nice in their enquiries into the meaning of the particulars of this 
 delineation; it shall suffice us to observe, 

 I. The dimensions of the house, the posts of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+41:1">ver. 1</A>),

 the door 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+41:2">ver. 2</A>),

 the wall and the side-chambers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+41:5,6">ver. 5, 6</A>),

 the foundations and wall of the chambers, their doors 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+41:8-11">ver. 8-11</A>),

 and the house itself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+41:13">ver. 13</A>.

 II. The dimensions of the oracle, or most holy place, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+41:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>.

 III. An account of another building over against the separate place, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+41:12-15">ver. 12-15</A>.

 IV. The manner of the building of the house, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+41:7,16,17">ver. 7, 16, 17</A>.

 V. The ornaments of the house,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+41:18-20">ver. 18-20</A>.

 VI. The altar of incense and the table, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+41:22">ver. 22</A>.

 VII. The doors between the temple and the oracle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+41:23-26">ver. 23-26</A>.

 There is so much difference both in the terms and in the rules of 
 architecture between one age and another, one place and another, that 
 it ought not to be any stumbling-block to us that there is so much in 
 these descriptions dark and hard to be understood, about the meaning of 
 which the learned are not agreed. To one not skilled in mathematics the 
 mathematical description of a modern structure would be scarcely 
 intelligible; and yet to a common carpenter or mason among the Jews at 
 that time we may suppose that all this, in the literal sense of it, was 
 easy enough.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the
 posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on
 the other side, <I>which was</I> the breadth of the tabernacle.
 &nbsp; 2  And the breadth of the door <I>was</I> ten cubits; and the sides
 of the door <I>were</I> five cubits on the one side, and five cubits
 on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty
 cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits.
 &nbsp; 3  Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two
 cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door,
 seven cubits.
 &nbsp; 4  So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the
 breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me,
 This <I>is</I> the most holy <I>place.</I>
 &nbsp; 5  After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the
 breadth of <I>every</I> side chamber, four cubits, round about the
 house on every side.
 &nbsp; 6  And the side chambers <I>were</I> three, one over another, and
 thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which <I>was</I> of
 the house for the side chambers round about, that they might have
 hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house.
 &nbsp; 7  And <I>there was</I> an enlarging, and a winding about still
 upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house
 went still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of
 the house <I>was still</I> upward, and so increased <I>from</I> the lowest
 <I>chamber</I> to the highest by the midst.
 &nbsp; 8  I saw also the height of the house round about: the
 foundations of the side chambers <I>were</I> a full reed of six great
 cubits.
 &nbsp; 9  The thickness of the wall, which <I>was</I> for the side chamber
 without, <I>was</I> five cubits: and <I>that</I> which <I>was</I> left <I>was</I> the
 place of the side chambers that <I>were</I> within.
 &nbsp; 10  And between the chambers <I>was</I> the wideness of twenty cubits
 round about the house on every side.
 &nbsp; 11  And the doors of the side chambers <I>were</I> toward <I>the place
 that was</I> left, one door toward the north, and another door
 toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left
 <I>was</I> five cubits round about.

 We are still attending a prophet that is under the guidance of an 
 angel, and therefore attend with reverence, though we are often at a 
 loss to know both what this is and what it is to us. Observe here, 

 1. After the prophet had observed the courts he was at length
 <I>brought to the temple,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+41:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 If we diligently attend to the instructions given us in the plainer 
 parts of religion, and profit by them, we shall be led further into an 
 acquaintance with the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven. Those that 
 are willing to dwell in God's courts shall at length be brought into 
 his temple. Ezekiel was himself a priest, but by the iniquity and 
 calamity of the times was cut short of his birthright privilege of 
 ministering in the temple; but God makes up the loss to him by 
 introducing him into this prophetical, evangelical, celestial temple, 
 and employing him to transmit a description of it to the church, in 
 which he was dignified above all the rest of his order. 

 2. When our Lord Jesus spoke of the destroying of <I>this temple,</I>
 which his hearers understood of this second temple of Jerusalem, he 
 spoke of the temple of his body 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:19,21">John ii. 19, 21</A>);

 and with good reason might he speak so ambiguously when Ezekiel's
 vision had a joint respect to them both together, including also his 
 mystical body the church, which is called the <I>house of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:15">1 Tim. iii. 15</A>),

 and all the members of that body, which are <I>living temples,</I> in
 which the Spirit dwells.

 3. The very posts of this temple, the door-posts, were as far one from
 the other, and consequently the door was as wide, as <I>the</I> whole 
 <I>breadth of the tabernacle</I> of Moses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+41:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),
 
 namely, twelve cubits, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+26:16,22,25">Exod. xxvi. 16, 22, 25</A>.

 In comparison with what had been under the law we may say, <I>Wide is 
 the gate</I> which leads into the church, the ceremonial law, that wall 
 of partition which had so much straitened the gate, being taken down. 
 
 4. The most holy place was an exact square, twenty cubits each way,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+41:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 For the new Jerusalem is exactly square 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:16">Rev. xxi. 16</A>),

 denoting its stability; for we look for a city that cannot be moved. 

 5. The upper stories were larger than the lower,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+41:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The walls of the temple were six cubits thick at the bottom, five in 
 the middle story, and four in the highest, which gave room to enlarge 
 the chambers the higher they went; but care was taken that the timber 
 might have <I>fast hold</I> (though God builds high, he builds firmly), 
 yet so as not to weaken one part for the strengthening of another; they 
 had hold, but not <I>in the wall of the house.</I> By this spreading 
 gradually, the <I>side-chambers</I> that were on <I>the height of the 
 house</I> (in the uppermost story of all) were six cubits, whereas the 
 lowest were but four; they gained a cubit every story. The higher we 
 build up ourselves in our most holy faith the more should our hearts, 
 those living temples, be enlarged.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  Now the building that <I>was</I> before the separate place at the
 end toward the west <I>was</I> seventy cubits broad; and the wall of
 the building <I>was</I> five cubits thick round about, and the length
 thereof ninety cubits.
 &nbsp; 13  So he measured the house, a hundred cubits long; and the
 separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an
 hundred cubits long;
 &nbsp; 14  Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the
 separate place toward the east, a hundred cubits.
 &nbsp; 15  And he measured the length of the building over against the
 separate place which <I>was</I> behind it, and the galleries thereof
 on the one side and on the other side, a hundred cubits, with
 the inner temple, and the porches of the court;
 &nbsp; 16  The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries
 round about on their three stories, over against the door, cieled
 with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and
 the windows <I>were</I> covered;
 &nbsp; 17  To that above the door, even unto the inner house, and
 without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by
 measure.
 &nbsp; 18  And <I>it was</I> made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a
 palm tree <I>was</I> between a cherub and a cherub; and <I>every</I> cherub
 had two faces;
 &nbsp; 19  So that the face of a man <I>was</I> toward the palm tree on the
 one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on
 the other side: <I>it was</I> made through all the house round about.
 &nbsp; 20  From the ground unto above the door <I>were</I> cherubims and
 palm trees made, and <I>on</I> the wall of the temple.
 &nbsp; 21  The posts of the temple <I>were</I> squared, <I>and</I> the face of
 the sanctuary; the appearance <I>of the one</I> as the appearance <I>of
 the other.</I>
 &nbsp; 22  The altar of wood <I>was</I> three cubits high, and the length
 thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length
 thereof, and the walls thereof, <I>were</I> of wood: and he said unto
 me, This <I>is</I> the table that <I>is</I> before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 23  And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.
 &nbsp; 24  And the doors had two leaves <I>apiece,</I> two turning leaves;
 two <I>leaves</I> for the one door, and two leaves for the other
 <I>door.</I>
 &nbsp; 25  And <I>there were</I> made on them, on the doors of the temple,
 cherubims and palm trees, like as <I>were</I> made upon the walls; and
 <I>there were</I> thick planks upon the face of the porch without.
 &nbsp; 26  And <I>there were</I> narrow windows and palm trees on the one
 side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and <I>upon</I>
 the side chambers of the house, and thick planks.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. An account of a building that was <I>before the separate place</I>
 (that is, before the temple), <I>at the end towards the west</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+41:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 which is here measured, and compared 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+41:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)

 with the measure of the house, and appears to be of equal dimensions 
 with it. This stood in a court by itself, which is measured
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+41:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)
 
 and its galleries, or chambers belonging to it, its posts and windows, 
 and the ornaments of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+41:15-17"><I>v.</I> 15-17</A>.

 But what use was to be made of this other building we are not told; 
 perhaps, in this vision, it signified the setting up of a church among 
 the Gentiles not inferior to the Jewish temple, but of quite another 
 nature, and which should soon supersede it. 

 2. A description of the ornaments of the temple, and the other 
 building. The walls on the inside from top to bottom were adorned with 
 <I>cherubim and palm-trees,</I> placed alternately, as in Solomon's 
 temple, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:29">1 Kings vi. 29</A>.

 Each cherub is here said to have two <I>faces,</I> the <I>face of a
 man</I> towards the palm tree on one side and the <I>face of a young 
 lion towards the palm-tree</I> on the other side,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+41:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 These seem to represent the angels, who have more than the wisdom of a 
 man and the courage of a lion; and in both they have an eye to the 
 palms of victory and triumph which are set before them, and which they 
 are sure of in all their conflicts with the powers of darkness. And in 
 the assemblies of the saints angels are in a special manner present, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:10">1 Cor. xi. 10</A>.

 3. A description of the posts of the doors both of the temple and of
 the sanctuary; they were <I>squared</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+41:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 not round like pillars; and <I>the appearance of the one was as the 
 appearance of the other.</I> In the tabernacle, and in Solomon's 
 temple, the door of the sanctuary, or most holy, was narrower than that 
 of the temple, but here it was fully as broad; for in gospel-times 
 <I>the way into the holiest of all is made</I> more <I>manifest</I> 
 than it was under the Old Testament 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:8">Heb. ix. 8</A>)

 and therefore the door is wider. These doors are described,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+41:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.

 The temple and the sanctuary had each of them its door, and they were
 <I>two-leaved,</I> folding doors. 

 4. We have here the description of the altar of incense, here said to 
 be an <I>altar of wood,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+41:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 No mention is made of its being <I>over-laid with gold;</I> but surely 
 it was intended to be so, else it would not bear the fire with which 
 the incense was to be burned, unless we will suppose that it served 
 only to put the censers upon. Or else it intimates that the incense to 
 be offered in the gospel-temple shall be purely spiritual, and the fire 
 spiritual, which will not consume an altar of wood. Therefore this 
 altar is called a table. <I>This is the table that is before the 
 Lord.</I> Here, as before, we find the altar turned into a table; for, 
 the great sacrifice being now offered, that which we have to do is to 
 feast upon the sacrifice at the Lord's table.

 5. Here is the adorning of the doors and windows with palm-trees, that
 they might be of a piece with the walls of the house,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+41:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>.

 Thus the living temples are adorned, not with gold, or silver, or 
 costly array, but with <I>the hidden man of the heart, in that which is 
 not corruptible.</I></P>
