 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God's prophet, who, in the chapters before, was an ambassador sent to 
 promise peace, is here a herald sent to declare war. The Jewish nation 
 shall recover its prosperity, and shall flourish for some time and 
 become considerable; it shall be very happy, at length, in the coming 
 of the long-expected Messiah, in the preaching of his gospel, and in 
 the setting up of his standard there. But, when thereby the chosen 
 remnant among them are effectually called in and united to Christ, the 
 body of the nation, persisting in unbelief, shall be utterly abandoned 
 and given up to ruin, for rejecting Christ; and it is this that is 
 foretold here in this chapter--the Jews rejecting Christ, which was
 their measure-filling sin, and the wrath which for that sin came upon 
 them to the uttermost. Here is, 

 I. A prediction of the destruction itself that should come upon the
 Jewish nation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. The putting of it into the hands of the Messiah. 

 1. He is charged with the custody of that flock, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:4-6">ver. 4-6</A>.

 2. He undertakes it, and bears rule in it,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:7,8">ver. 7, 8</A>.

 3. Finding it perverse, he gives it up 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:9">ver. 9</A>),

 breaks his shepherd's staff 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:10,11">ver. 10, 11</A>),

 resents the indignities done him and the contempt put upon him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:12,13">ver. 12, 13</A>),

 and then breaks his other staff, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:14">ver. 14</A>.

 4. He turns them over into the hands of foolish shepherds, who,
 instead of preventing, shall complete their ruin, and both the blind 
 leaders and the blind followers shall fall together into the ditch, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:15-17">ver. 15-17</A>.

 This is foretold to the poor of the flock before it comes to pass, 
 that, when it does come to pass, they may not be offended.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy
 cedars.
 &nbsp; 2 Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty
 are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the
 vintage is come down.
 &nbsp; 3 <I>There is</I> a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their
 glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the
 pride of Jordan is spoiled.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In dark and figurative expressions, as is usual in the scripture 
 predictions of things at a great distance, that destruction of 
 Jerusalem and of the Jewish church and nation is here foretold which 
 our Lord Jesus, when the time was at hand, prophesied of very plainly 
 and expressly. We have here, 
 
 1. Preparation made for that destruction
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 "<I>Open thy doors, O Lebanon!</I> Thou wouldst not open them to let 
 thy king in--he <I>came to his own and his own received him not;</I> 
 now thou must open them to let thy ruin in. Let the gates of the 
 forest, and all the avenues to it, be thrown open, and let the fire 
 come in and devour its glory." Some by Lebanon here understand the 
 temple, which was built of cedars from Lebanon, and the stones of it 
 white as the snow of Lebanon. It was burnt with fire by the Romans, and 
 its gates were forced open by the fury of the soldiers. To confirm 
 this, they tell a story, that forty years before the destruction of the 
 second temple the gates of it opened of their own accord, upon which 
 prodigy Rabbi Johanan made this remark (as it is found in one of the 
 Jewish authors), "Now I know," said he, "that the destruction of the 
 temple is at hand, according to the prophecy of Zechariah, <I>Open thy 
 doors, O Lebanon! that the fire may devour thy cedars.</I>" Others 
 understand it of Jerusalem, or rather of the whole land of Canaan, to 
 which Lebanon was an inlet on the north. All shall lie open to the 
 invader, and the cedars, the mighty and eminent men, shall be devoured, 
 which cannot but alarm those of an inferior rank, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 If <I>the cedars</I> have <I>fallen</I> (if <I>all the mighty are 
 spoiled,</I> and brought to ruin), let the <I>fir-tree howl.</I> How 
 can the slender fir-trees stand if stately cedars fall? If cedars are 
 devoured by fire, it is time for the fir-trees to howl; for no wood is 
 so combustible as that of the fir. And let the <I>oaks of Bashan,</I> 
 that lie exposed to every injury, <I>howl, for the forest of the 
 vintage</I> (or the <I>flourishing vineyard,</I> that used to be 
 guarded with a particular care) has come down, or (as some read it)
 when the <I>defenced forests,</I> such as Lebanon was, have come down. 
 Note, The falls of the wise and good into sin, and the falls of the 
 rich and great into trouble, are loud alarms to those that are every 
 way their inferiors not to be secure. 

 2. Lamentation made for the destruction

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>There is a voice of howling.</I> Those who have fallen howl for 
 grief and shame, and those who see their own turn coming howl for fear.
 But the great men especially receive the alarm with the utmost 
 confusion. Those who were roaring in the day of their revels and 
 triumphs are howling in the day of their terrors; <I>for now they are 
 tormented</I> more than others. Those great men were by office 
 shepherds, and such should have protected God's flock committed to 
 their charge; it is the duty both of princes and priests. But they were 
 as <I>young lions,</I> that made themselves a terror to the flock with 
 their roaring and the flock a prey to themselves with their tearing.
 Note, It is sad with a people when those who should be as shepherds to 
 them are as young lions to them. But what is the issue? The shepherds 
 <I>howl,</I> for <I>their glory is spoiled.</I> Their pastures, and the 
 flocks which covered them, which were the glory of the swains, are laid 
 waste. The <I>young lions howl,</I> for <I>the pride of Jordan is 
 spoiled.</I> The pride of Jordan was the thickets on the banks, in 
 which the lions reposed themselves; and therefore, when the river 
 overflowed and spoiled them, the lions came up from them (as we read 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:19">Jer. xlix. 19</A>),

 and they came up roaring. Note, When those who have power proudly abuse
 their power, and, instead of being shepherds, are as young lions, they 
 may expect that the righteous God will humble their pride and break 
 their power.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4 Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter;
 &nbsp; 5 Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty:
 and they that sell them say, Blessed <I>be</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; for I am
 rich: and their own shepherds pity them not.
 &nbsp; 6 For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his
 neighbour's hand, and into the hand of his king: and they shall
 smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver <I>them.</I>
 &nbsp; 7 And I will feed the flock of slaughter, <I>even</I> you, O poor of
 the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called
 Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.
 &nbsp; 8 Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul
 loathed them, and their soul also abhorred me.
 &nbsp; 9 Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it
 die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let
 the rest eat every one the flesh of another.
 &nbsp; 10 And I took my staff, <I>even</I> Beauty, and cut it asunder, that
 I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people.
 &nbsp; 11 And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock
 that waited upon me knew that it <I>was</I> the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 12 And I said unto them, If ye think good, give <I>me</I> my price;
 and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty <I>pieces</I>
 of silver.
 &nbsp; 13 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly
 price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty
 <I>pieces</I> of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 14 Then I cut asunder mine other staff, <I>even</I> Bands, that I
 might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet here is made a type of Christ, as the prophet Isaiah 
 sometimes was; and the scope of these verses is to show that <I>for 
 judgment Christ came into this world</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:39">John ix. 39</A>),

 for judgment to the Jewish church and nation, which were, about the
 time of his coming, wretchedly corrupted and degenerated by the 
 worldliness and hypocrisy of their rulers. Christ would have healed 
 them, but they would not be healed; they are therefore left desolate, 
 and abandoned to ruin. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The desperate case of the Jewish church, under the tyranny of their 
 own governors. Their slavery in their own country made them as 
 miserable as their captivity in strange countries had done: <I>Their 
 possessors slay them and sell them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 In Zechariah's time we find the rulers and the nobles justly rebuked 
 for <I>exacting usury of their brethren;</I> and the governors, even by 
 their servants, oppressive to the people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:7,15">Neh. v. 7, 15</A>.

 In Christ's time the <I>chief priests</I> and the <I>elders,</I> who
 were the possessors of the flock, by their traditions, the commandments
 of men, and their impositions on the consciences of the people, became
 perfect tyrants, devoured their houses, engrossed their wealth, and
 fleeced the flock instead of feeding it. The Sadducees, who were
 deists, corrupted their judgments. The Pharisees, who were bigots for
 superstition, corrupted their morals, by making void the commandments
 of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:16">Matt. xv. 16</A>.

 Thus they slew the sheep of the flock, thus they sold them. They cared
 not what became of them so they could but gain their own ends and serve 
 their own interests. And,

 1. In this they justified themselves: They <I>slay them</I> and <I>hold
 themselves not guilty.</I> They think that there is no harm in it, and 
 that they shall never be called to an account for it by the chief 
 Shepherd; as if their power were given them for destruction, which was 
 designed only for edification, and as if, because they sat in Moses's 
 seat, they were not under the obligation of Moses's law, but might 
 dispense with it, and with themselves in the breach of it, at their 
 pleasure. Note, Those have their minds woefully blinded indeed who do 
 ill and justify themselves in doing it; but God will not hold those 
 guiltless who hold themselves so. 

 2. In this they affronted God, by giving him thanks for the gain of 
 their oppression: They said, <I>Blessed be the Lord, for I am rich,</I> 
 as if, because they prospered in their wickedness, got money by it, and 
 raised estates, God had made himself patron of their unjust practices, 
 and Providence had become <I>particeps criminis--the associate of their 
 guilt.</I> What is got honestly we ought to give God thanks for, and to 
 bless him whose blessing <I>makes rich and adds no sorrow with it.</I> 
 But with what face can we go to God either to beg a blessing upon the 
 unlawful methods of getting wealth or to return him thanks for success 
 in them? They should rather have gone to God to confess the sin, to
 take shame to themselves for it, and to vow restitution, than thus to 
 mock him by making the gains of sin the gift of God, who <I>hates 
 robbery for burnt-offerings,</I> and reckons not himself praised by the 
 thanksgiving if he be dishonoured either in the getting or the using of 
 that which we give him thanks for. 

 3. In this they put contempt upon the people of God, as unworthy their
 regard or compassionate consideration: <I>Their own shepherds pity them 
 not;</I> they make them miserable, and then do not commiserate them. 
 Christ had <I>compassion on the multitude because they fainted and were 
 scattered abroad, as if they had no shepherd</I> (as really they had 
 worse than none); but <I>their own shepherds pitied them not,</I> nor 
 showed any concern for them. Note, It is ill for a church when its 
 pastors have no tenderness, no compassion for precious souls, when they 
 can look upon the ignorant, the foolish, the wicked, the weak, without 
 pity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The sentence of God's wrath passed upon them for their 
 senselessness and stupidity in this condition. There was a general 
 decay, nay, a destruction, of religion among them, and it was all one 
 to them; they regarded it not. <I>My people love to have it so,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:31">Jer. v. 31</A>.

 Though they were <I>oppressed and broken in judgment,</I> yet they
 <I>willingly walked after the commandment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:11">Hos. v. 11</A>.

 And, as their shepherds pitied them not, so they did not bemoan 
 themselves; therefore God says

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 "<I>I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land.</I> They have
 courted their own destruction, and so let their doom be." But those are 
 truly miserable whom the God of mercy himself will no more have 
 compassion upon. Those who are willing to have their consciences 
 oppressed by those who <I>teach for doctrines the commandments of 
 men</I> (as the Jews were, who called those <I>Rabbi, Rabbi,</I> that 
 did so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:9,23:7">Matt. xv. 9; xxiii. 7</A>),

 are often punished by oppression in their civil interests, and justly,
 for those forfeit their own rights who tamely give up God's rights. The 
 Jews did so; the Papists do so; and who can pity them if they be ruled 
 with rigour? God here threatens them,

 1. That he will deliver them into the hand of oppressors, <I>every one
 into his neighbour's hand,</I> so that they shall use one another 
 barbarously. The several parties in Jerusalem did so; the 
 <I>zealots,</I> the <I>seditious,</I> as they were called, committed 
 greater outrages than the common enemy did, as Josephus relates in his 
 history of the wars of the Jews. They shall be delivered every one 
 <I>into the hand of his king,</I> that is, the Roman emperor, whom they 
 chose to submit to rather than to Christ, saying, <I>We have no king 
 but C&aelig;sar.</I> Thus they thought to ingratiate themselves with 
 their lords and masters. But for this God brought the Romans upon them, 
 who <I>took away their place and nation.</I> 

 2. That he will not deliver them out of their hands: <I>They shall 
 smite the land,</I> the whole land, and <I>out of their hand I will not 
 deliver them;</I> and, if the Lord do not help them, none else can, nor 
 can they help themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A trial yet made whether their ruin might be prevented by sending 
 Christ among them as a shepherd; God had sent his servants to them in 
 vain, <I>but last of all he sent unto them his Son, saying, They will 
 reverence my Son,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:37">Matt. xxi. 37</A>.

 Divers of the prophets had spoken of him as the <I>Shepherd of
 Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:11,Eze+34:23">Isa. xl. 11; Ezek. xxxiv. 23</A>.

 He himself told the Pharisees that he was the <I>Shepherd of the
 sheep,</I> and that those who pretended to be shepherds were <I>thieves 
 and robbers</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:1,2,11">John x. 1, 2, 11</A>),

 apparently referring to this passage, where we have,

 1. The charge he received from his Father to try what might be done
 with this flock

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Thus saith the Lord my God</I> (Christ called his Father <I>his
 God</I> because he acted in compliance with his will and with an eye to 
 his glory in his whole undertaking), <I>Feed the flock of the 
 slaughter.</I> The Jews were God's flock, but they were <I>the flock of 
 slaughter,</I> for their enemies had killed them all the day long and 
 <I>accounted them as sheep for the slaughter;</I> their own 
 <I>possessors slew them,</I> and God himself had doomed them to the 
 slaughter. Yet "<I>feed them</I> by reproof instruction, and comfort; 
 provide wholesome food for those who have so long been soured with the 
 leaven of the scribes and Pharisees." <I>Other sheep he had, which were 
 not of this fold,</I> and which afterwards must be <I>brought;</I> but 
 he is first <I>sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:24">Matt. xv. 24</A>.

 2. His acceptance of this charge, and his undertaking pursuant to it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 He does as it were say, <I>Lo, I come to do thy will, O my God!</I>
 and, since this is thy will, it is mine: <I>I will feed the flock of 
 slaughter.</I> Christ will care for these lost sheep; he will go about 
 among them, <I>teaching</I> and <I>healing even you, O poor of the 
 flock!</I> Christ did not neglect the meanest, nor overlook them for 
 their meanness. The shepherds that made a prey of them regarded not the 
 poor; they were conversant with those only that they could get by; but 
 Christ preached his gospel <I>to the poor,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:5">Matt. xi. 5</A>.

 It was an instance of his humiliation that his converse was mostly with
 the inferior sort of people; his disciples, who were his constant 
 attendants, were of the poor of the flock.

 3. His furnishing himself with tools proper for the charge he had
 undertaken: I <I>took unto me two staves,</I> pastoral staves; other
 shepherds have but one crook, but Christ had two, denoting the double
 care he took of his flock, and what he did both for the souls and for
 the bodies of men. David speaks of God's <I>rod</I> and his
 <I>staff</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+23:4">Ps. xxiii. 4</A>),

 a correcting rod and a supporting staff. One of these staves was called 
 <I>Beauty,</I> denoting the temple, which is called <I>the beauty of 
 holiness</I> and one of its gates <I>beautiful,</I> which Christ called 
 his Father's house, and for which he showed a great zeal when he 
 cleared it of the <I>buyers and sellers;</I> the other he called 
 <I>Bands,</I> denoting their civil state, and the incorporate society 
 of that nation, which Christ also took care of by preaching love and 
 peace among them. Christ, in his gospel, and in all he did among them,
 consulted the advancement both of their civil and of their sacred 
 interests. 

 4. His execution of his office, as the chief Shepherd. <I>He fed the 
 flock</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 and he displaced those under-shepherds that were false to their trust

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Three shepherds I cut off in one month.</I> Through the deficiency 
 and uncertainty of the history of the Jewish church, in its latter 
 ages, we know not what particular event this had its accomplishment in;
 in general, it seems to be an act of power and justice for the
 punishment of the sinful shepherds and the redress of the grievances of
 the abused flock. Some understand it of the three orders of princes,
 priests, and scribes or prophets, who, when Christ had finished his
 work, were laid aside for their unfaithfulness. Others understand it of
 the three sects among the Jews, of Pharisees, Sadducees, and Herodians,
 all whom Christ silenced in dispute

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:1-46">Matt. xxii.</A>)

 and soon after <I>cut off,</I> all in a little time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Their enmity to Christ, and making themselves odious to him. He 
 came to his own, the sheep of his own pasture; it might have been 
 expected that between them and him there would be an entire affection, 
 as between the shepherd and his sheep; but they conducted themselves so 
 ill that <I>his soul loathed them,</I> was <I>straitened</I> towards 
 them (so it may be read); he intended them kindness, but could not do 
 them the kindness he intended them, <I>because of their unbelief,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:58">Matt. xiii. 58</A>.

 He was disappointed in them, discouraged concerning them,
 <I>grieved</I> for them, not only for the shepherds, whom he cut off, 
 but for the people, whom Christ often looked upon with grief in his 
 heart and tears in his eyes. Their provocations even wore out his 
 patience, and he was weary of that <I>faithless and perverse 
 generation. Their soul also it abhorred me;</I> and therefore it was 
 that his soul loathed them; for, whatever estrangement there is between 
 God and man, it begins on man's side. The Jewish shepherds rejected 
 this chief Shepherd, as the Jewish builders rejected this chief corner 
 stone. They <I>had indignation</I> at Christ's doctrine and miracles, 
 and his interest in the people, to whom they did all they could to 
 render him odious, as they had made themselves odious to him. Note, 
 There is a mutual enmity between God and wicked people; they are 
 hateful to God and haters of God. Nothing speaks more the sinfulness 
 and misery of an unregenerate state than this does. The carnal mind, 
 the friendship of the world, are enmity to God, and God hates all the 
 workers of iniquity; and it is easy to foresee what this will end in, 
 if the quarrel be not taken up in time,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:4,5">Isa. xxvii. 4, 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Christ's rejecting them as incurable, and leaving them their house 
 desolate, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:38">Matt. xxiii. 38</A>.

 The things of their peace are now hidden from their eyes, because they
 knew not the day of their visitation. Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The sentence of their rejection passed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>Then said I, I will not feed you.</I> I will take no further care 
 of you; <I>you shall not see me again;</I> take your own course. As I 
 will not feed you, so I will not cure you; <I>that that dieth, let it 
 die</I> (the Shepherd will do nothing to save its forfeited life); 
 <I>that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off;</I> that which will 
 make itself a prey to the wolf, let it be a prey, and let the rest so 
 far forget their own mild and gentle nature as to <I>eat the flesh of 
 one another;</I> let these sheep fight like dogs." Those that reject 
 Christ will be certainly and justly rejected by him, and then are 
 miserable of course.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. A sign of it given 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder,</I> in token of 
 this, that he would be no longer a shepherd to them, as the lord high 
 steward determines his commission by breaking his white staff, and as 
 Moses's breaking the tables of the law put a stop, for the present, to 
 the treaty between God and Israel. The breaking of this staff signified 
 the breaking of God's covenant which he had <I>made with all the 
 people,</I> the covenant of peculiarity made with all the tribes of 
 <I>Israel,</I> and all other people who, by being proselyted to their 
 religion, were incorporated into their nation. The Jewish church was 
 now stripped of all its glory; its crown was profaned and cast to the 
 ground, and all its honour laid in the dust; for God departed from it, 
 and would no more own it for his. When Christ told them plainly that 
 the <I>kingdom of God</I> should be <I>taken from them,</I> and 
 <I>given to another people,</I> then be broke the <I>staff of 
 Beauty,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:43">Matt. xxi. 43</A>.

 And <I>it was broken in that day,</I> though Jerusalem and the Jewish 
 nation held up forty years longer, yet from that day we may reckon the 
 staff of Beauty broken,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 And though the great men did not, or would not, understand it as a
 divine sentence, but thought to put it by with a cold <I>God forbid</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:16">Luke xx. 16</A>),

 yet the <I>poor of the flock,</I> the disciples of Christ, that
 <I>waited on him,</I> and understood with what authority he spoke, and 
 could distinguish the voice of their Shepherd from that of a stranger, 
 <I>knew that it was the word of the Lord,</I> and trembled at it, and 
 were confident that it should not fall to the ground. Note, Christ is 
 waited on by the poor of the flock; he chose them to be with him, to be 
 his pupils, to be his witnesses; the poor received him and his gospel, 
 when those that had great possessions turned their backs upon him. And 
 those that wait upon Christ, that sit at his feet, to hear and receive 
 his words, shall <I>know of the doctrine whether it be of God,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:17">John vii. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. A further reason given for their rejection. It was said before, 
 <I>Their souls abhorred him;</I> and here we have an instance of it, 
 their buying and selling him for thirty pieces of silver, either thirty 
 Roman pence, or rather thirty Jewish shekels; this is here foretold in 
 somewhat obscure expressions, as it is fit that such particular 
 prophecies should be delivered, lest otherwise the plainness of the
 prophecy might prevent the accomplishment of it. Here, 

 (1.) The Shepherd comes to them for his wages

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 "<I>If you think good, give me my price;</I> you are weary of me, pay
 me off and discharge me; <I>and, if not, forbear;</I> if you be willing 
 to continue me longer in your service, I will continue, or, if to turn 
 me off without wages, I am content." Christ was no hireling, and yet 
 the labourer is worthy of his hire. Compare with this what Christ said 
 to Judas when he was going to sell him, "<I>What thou doest do 
 quickly;</I> be at a word with the chief priests; let them either take 
 the bargain or leave it," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:27">John xiii. 27</A>.

 Those that betray Christ are not forced to it; they might have chosen.
 
 (2.) They value him at <I>thirty pieces of silver.</I> Many years' 
 service he had done them as a Shepherd, yet this is all they will now 
 turn him off with--"<I>A goodly price that I</I> with all my care and 
 pains <I>was valued at by them.</I>" If Judas fixed this sum in his 
 demand, it is observable that his name was <I>Judah,</I> the same name 
 with that of the body of the people, for it was a national act; or, if 
 (as it rather seems) the chief priests pitched upon this sum in their 
 proffers, they were the representatives of the people; it was part of 
 the priest's office to <I>put a value</I> upon the <I>devoted 
 things</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+27:8">Lev. xxvii. 8</A>),

 and thus they valued the Lord Jesus. It was the ordinary price of a
 slave, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+21:32">Exod. xxi. 32</A>.

 Making light of Christ, and undervaluing the love of that great and
 good Shepherd, are the ruin of multitudes, and justly so.

 (3.) The silver being no way proportionable to his worth, it is 
 <I>thrown to the potter</I> with disdain: "Let him take it to buy clay 
 with, or for any use that a little money will serve to, for it is not 
 worth hoarding; it may be enough for a potter's stock, but not for the 
 pay of such a shepherd, much less for his purchase." So the prophet 
 <I>cast the thirty pieces of silver to the potter in the house of the 
 Lord:</I> "Let him take them, and do what he will with them." Now we 
 find a particular accomplishment of this in the history of Christ's 
 sufferings, and reference is had to this prophecy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:9,10">Matt. xxvii. 9, 10</A>.
 
 <I>Thirty pieces of silver</I> was the very sum for which Christ was
 sold to the chief priests; the money, when Judas would not keep it, and 
 the chief priests would not take it back was laid out in the purchase 
 of <I>the potter's field.</I> Even that sudden resolve of the chief 
 priests was according to an ancient prophecy and the more ancient 
 counsel and foreknowledge of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The completing of their rejection in the cutting asunder of the 
 other staff, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 The former denoted the ruin of their church, by breaking the covenant 
 between God and them--that defaced their <I>beauty;</I> this denotes 
 the ruin of their state, by breaking the brotherhood between Judah and 
 Israel, by reviving animosities and contention among them, such as were 
 of old between Judah and Israel, the writing of whom as <I>one stick in 
 the hand of the Lord</I> was one of the blessings promised after their 
 return out of captivity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:19">Ezek. xxxvii. 19</A>.

 But that union shall now be dissolved; they shall be crumbled into
 parties and factions, exasperated one against another; and their 
 kingdom, being thus divided, shall be <I>brought to desolation.</I>

 (1.) Nothing ruins a people so certainly, so inevitably, as the 
 breaking of <I>the staff of Bands,</I> and the weakening of the 
 brotherhood among them; for hereby they become an easy prey to the 
 common enemy. 

 (2.) This follows upon the dissolving of the covenant between God and 
 them, and the decay of religion among them. When iniquity abounds love 
 waxes cold. No wonder if those fall out among themselves that have 
 provoked God to fall out with them. When the staff of Beauty is broken 
 the staff of Bands will not hold long. An unchurched people will soon 
 be an undone people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>15 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto me, Take unto thee yet the
 instruments of a foolish shepherd.
 &nbsp; 16 For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, <I>which</I>
 shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the
 young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that
 standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear
 their claws in pieces.
 &nbsp; 17 Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword
 <I>shall be</I> upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be
 clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God, having shown the misery of this people in their being justly 
 abandoned by the good Shepherd, here shows their further misery in 
 being shamefully abused by a foolish shepherd. The prophet is himself 
 to personate and represent this pretended shepherd 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>Take unto thee the instruments</I> or accoutrements <I>of a foolish 
 shepherd,</I> that are no way fit for the business, such a shepherd's 
 coat, and bag, and staff, as a foolish shepherd would appear in; for 
 such a shepherd shall be set over them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 who, instead of protecting them, shall oppress them and do them
 mischief. 

 1. They shall be under the inspection of unfaithful ministers. Their
 scribes, and priests, and doctors of their law, shall bind heavy
 burdens upon them, and grievous to be borne, and, with their traditions
 imposed, shall make the ceremonial law much more a yoke than God had
 made it. The description here given of the foolish shepherd suits very
 well with the character Christ gives of the scribes and Pharisees, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:2">Matt. xxiii. 2</A>.

 They shall be under the tyranny of unmerciful princes, that shall rule
 them with rigour, and make their own land as much a house of bondage to
 them as ever Egypt or Babylon was. When they had rejected him <I>by
 whom princes decree justice</I> it was just that they should be turned
 over to those who <I>decree unrighteous decrees.</I> 

 3. They shall be imposed upon and deluded by false Christs and false
 prophets, as our Saviour foretold,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:5">Matt. xxiv. 5</A>.

 Many such there were, who by their seditious practices provoked the 
 Romans, and hastened the ruin of the Jewish nation; but it is 
 observable that they were never cheated by a counterfeit Messiah till 
 they had refused and rejected the true Messiah. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What a curse this foolish shepherd should be to the people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 God will, for their punishment, <I>raise up a</I> foolish 
 <I>shepherd,</I> who will not do the duty of a shepherd; he will not 
 <I>visit those that are cut off,</I> nor go after those that go astray, 
 nor seek those that are missing, to find them out and bring them home, 
 as the good shepherd does, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:12,13">Matt. xviii. 12, 13</A>.

 Their shepherds take no care of the <I>young ones,</I> that need their
 care and are well worthy of it, as Christ does,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:11">Isa. xl. 11</A>.

 They do not <I>heal that</I> which was <I>broken,</I> which was worried
 and torn, but let it die of its bruises, when a little thing, in time, 
 would have saved it. They do not <I>feed</I> those who, through 
 weakness, <I>stand still,</I> and are ready to faint, and cannot get 
 forward, but leave them behind, let who will take them up; they do not 
 <I>carry</I> that which <I>stands still</I> (so some read it); they 
 never do any thing to <I>support the weak</I> and comfort the 
 <I>feeble-minded;</I> but, on the contrary,

 1. They are luxurious themselves: They <I>eat of the flesh of the
 fat;</I> they will have of the best for themselves; and, like that 
 <I>wicked servant</I> that said, <I>My lord delays his coming,</I> they 
 <I>eat and drink with the drunken,</I> and <I>serve their own 
 bellies.</I> 

 2. They are barbarous to the flock. Their passions are as ill-governed
 as their appetites, for, when they are in a rage against any of the 
 flock, they <I>tear their</I> very <I>claws in pieces</I> by 
 over-driving them; they beat their hoofs; they <I>smite their fellow 
 servants. Woe unto thee, O land! when thy king is</I> such <I>a 
 child!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What a curse this foolish shepherd should bring upon himself 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>Woe to the idol-shepherd,</I> who, like an idol, has eyes and sees 
 not, who, like an idol, receives abundance of respect and homage from 
 the people and the chief of their offerings, but neither can nor will 
 do them any kindness. He <I>leaves the flock</I> when they most need 
 his care, leaves them destitute, and flees, <I>because he is a 
 hireling;</I> his doom is that <I>the sword</I> of God's justice shall 
 be <I>upon his arm</I> and <I>his right eye,</I> so that he shall quite 
 lose the use of both. <I>His arm shall</I> wither and <I>be dried 
 up,</I> so that he who would not help his friends when it was required 
 shall not know how to help himself; <I>his right eye shall be utterly 
 darkened,</I> that he shall not discern the danger that his flock is 
 in, nor know which way to look for relief. This was fulfilled when 
 Christ said to the Pharisees, <I>I have come that those who see may be 
 made blind,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:39">John ix. 39</A>.

 Those that have gifts which qualify them to do good, if they do not do
 good with them, shall be deprived of them; those that should have been 
 workmen, but were slothful and would do nothing, will justly have their 
 arm dried up; and those that should have been watchmen, but were sleepy 
 and would never look about them, will justly have their eye 
 blinded.</P>
