 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The scope of this chapter is the same with that of the two foregoing 
 chapters, but the composition is somewhat different; that was in long 
 verse, this is in short, another kind of metre; that was in single 
 alphabets, this is in a treble one. Here is, 

 I. A sad complaint of God's displeasure and the fruits of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:1-20">ver. 1-20</A>.

 II. Words of comfort to God's people when they are in trouble and
 distress, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:21-36">ver. 21-36</A>.

 III. Duty prescribed in this afflicted state,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:37-41">ver. 37-41</A>.

 IV. The complaint renewed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:42-54">ver. 42-54</A>.

 V. Encouragement taken to hope in God, and continue waiting for his
 salvation, with an appeal to his justice against the persecutors of the
 church, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:55-66">ver. 55-66</A>.

 Some make all this to be spoken by the prophet himself when he was 
 imprisoned and persecuted; but it seems rather to be spoken in the 
 person of the church now in captivity and in a manner desolate, and in 
 the desolations of which the prophet did in a particular manner 
 interest himself. But the complaints here are somewhat more general 
 than those in the foregoing chapter, being accommodated to the case as 
 well of particular persons as of the public, and intended for the use 
 of the closet rather than of the solemn assembly. Some think Jeremiah 
 makes these complaints, not only as an intercessor for Israel, but as a 
 type of Christ, who was thought by some to be Jeremiah the weeping 
 prophet, because he was much in tears 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:14">Matt. xvi. 14</A>)

 and to him many of the passages here may be applied.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  I <I>am</I> the man <I>that</I> hath seen affliction by the rod of his
 wrath.
 &nbsp; 2  He hath led me, and brought <I>me into</I> darkness, but not
 <I>into</I> light.
 &nbsp; 3  Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand <I>against
 me</I> all the day.
 &nbsp; 4  My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my
 bones.
 &nbsp; 5  He hath builded against me, and compassed <I>me</I> with gall and
 travail.
 &nbsp; 6  He hath set me in dark places, as <I>they that be</I> dead of old.
 &nbsp; 7  He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made
 my chain heavy.
 &nbsp; 8  Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.
 &nbsp; 9  He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my
 paths crooked.
 &nbsp; 10  He <I>was</I> unto me <I>as</I> a bear lying in wait, <I>and as</I> a lion
 in secret places.
 &nbsp; 11  He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he
 hath made me desolate.
 &nbsp; 12  He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.
 &nbsp; 13  He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my
 reins.
 &nbsp; 14  I was a derision to all my people; <I>and</I> their song all the
 day.
 &nbsp; 15  He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken
 with wormwood.
 &nbsp; 16  He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath
 covered me with ashes.
 &nbsp; 17  And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat
 prosperity.
 &nbsp; 18  And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 &nbsp; 19  Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and
 the gall.
 &nbsp; 20  My soul hath <I>them</I> still in remembrance, and is humbled in
 me.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The title of the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:1-28">102nd Psalm</A>

 might very fitly be prefixed to this chapter--<I>The prayer of the
 afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and pours out his complaint before 
 the Lord;</I> for it is very feelingly and fluently that the complaint 
 is here poured out. Let us observe the particulars of it. The prophet 
 complains,

 1. That God is angry. This gives both birth and bitterness to the
 affliction

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>I am the man,</I> the remarkable man, <I>that has seen 
 affliction,</I> and has felt it sensibly, <I>by the rod of his 
 wrath.</I> Note, God is sometimes angry with his own people; yet it is 
 to be complained of, not as a sword to cut off, by only as a rod to 
 correct; it is to them <I>the rod of his wrath,</I> a chastening which, 
 though grievous for the present, will in the issue be advantageous. By 
 this rod we must expect to <I>see affliction,</I> and, if we be made to 
 see more than ordinary affliction by that rod, we must not quarrel, for 
 we are sure that the anger is just and affliction mild and mixed with 
 mercy. 

 2. That he is at a loss and altogether in the dark. Darkness is put
 for great trouble and perplexity, the want both of comfort and of 
 direction; this was the case of the complainant

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>He has led me</I> by his providence, and an unaccountable chain of 
 events, <I>into darkness and not into light,</I> the darkness I feared 
 and not into the light I hoped for." And 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 <I>He has set me in dark places,</I> dark as the grave, <I>like those 
 that are dead of old,</I> that are quite forgotten, nobody knows who or 
 what they were. Note, The Israel of God, though children of light,
 sometimes <I>walk in darkness.</I> 

 3. That God appears against him as an enemy, as a professed enemy. God
 had been for him, but no "<I>Surely against me is he turned</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 as far as I can discern; for <I>his hand is turned against me all the
 day. I am chastened every morning,</I>"
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:14">Ps. lxxiii. 14</A>.

 And, when God's hand is continually turned against us, we are tempted
 to think that his heart is turned against us too. God had said once

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:14">Hos. v. 14</A>),

 <I>I will be as a lion to the house of Judah,</I> and now he has made
 his word good

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "<I>He was unto me as a bear lying in wait,</I> surprising me with his 
 judgments, <I>and as a lion in secret places;</I> so that which way 
 soever I went I was in continual fear of being set upon and could never 
 think myself safe." Do men shoot at those thy are enemies to? <I>He has 
 bent his bow,</I> the bow that was ordained against the church's 
 prosecutors, that is bent against her sons, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 <I>He has set me as a mark for his arrow,</I> which he aims at, and 
 will be sure to hit, and then <I>the arrows of his quiver enter into my 
 reins,</I> give me a mortal wound, an inward wound, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Note, God has many arrows in his quiver, and they fly swiftly and 
 pierce deeply.

 4. That he is as one sorely afflicted both in body and mind. The Jewish 
 state may now be fitly compared to a man wrinkled with age, for which 
 there is no remedy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>My flesh and my skin has he made old;</I> they are wasted and 
 withered, and I look like one that is ready to drop into the grave; 
 nay, <I>he has broken my bones,</I> and so disabled me to help myself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 <I>He has filled me with bitterness,</I> a bitter sense of his 
 calamities." God has access to the spirit, and can so embitter that as 
 thereby to embitter all the enjoyments; as, when the stomach is foul, 
 whatever is eaten sours in it: "<I>He has made me drunk with 
 wormwood,</I> so intoxicated me with the sense of my afflictions that I 
 know not what to say or do. <I>He has</I> mingled <I>gravel</I> with my 
 bread, so that <I>my teeth</I> are <I>broken</I> with it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 and what I eat is neither pleasant nor nourishing. <I>He has covered
 me with ashes,</I> as mourners used to be, or (as some read it) <I>he 
 has fed me with ashes. I have eaten ashes like bread,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:9">Ps. cii. 9</A>.

 5. That he is not able to discern any way of escape or deliverance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>He has built against me,</I> as forts and batteries are built 
 against a besieged city. Where there was a way open it is now quite
 made up: <I>He has compassed me</I> on ever side <I>with gall and 
 travel;</I> I vex, and fret, and tire myself, to find a way of escape, 
 but can find none, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 <I>He has hedged me about, that I cannot get out.</I>" When Jerusalem 
 was besieged it was said to be <I>compassed in on every side,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:43">Luke xix. 43</A>.

 "I am chained; and as some notorious malefactors are double-fettered,
 and loaded with irons, so he <I>has made my chain heavy. He has</I> 
 also

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 <I>enclosed my ways with hewn stone,</I> not only hedged up my way 
 <I>with thorns</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:6">Hos. ii. 6</A>),

 but stopped it up with a stone wall, which cannot be broken through, so
 that <I>my paths are made crooked;</I> I traverse to and fro, to the 
 right hand, to the left, to try to get forward, but am still turned 
 back." It is just with God to make those who walk in the crooked paths 
 of sin, crossing God's laws, walk in the crooked paths of affliction, 
 crossing their designs and breaking their measures. So

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 "<I>He has turned aside my ways;</I> he has blasted all my counsels, 
 ruined my projects, so that I am necessitated to yield to my own ruin. 
 He has <I>pulled me in pieces;</I> he has torn and is gone away 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:14">Hos. v. 14</A>),

 and has <I>made me desolate,</I> has deprived me of all society and all
 comfort in my own soul."

 6. That God turns a deaf ear to his prayers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>When I cry and shout,</I> as one in earnest, as one that would make 
 him hear, yet he <I>shuts out my prayer</I> and will not suffer it to 
 have access to him." God's ear is wont to be open to the prayers of his 
 people, and his door of mercy to those that knock at it; but now both 
 are shut, even to one that <I>cries and shouts.</I> Thus sometimes God 
 seems to be angry even against <I>the prayers of his people</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:4">Ps. lxxx. 4</A>),

 and their case is deplorable indeed when they are denied not only the 
 benefit of an answer, but the comfort of acceptance.

 7. That his neighbours make a laughing matter of his troubles

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>I was a derision to all my people,</I> to all the wicked among them, 
 who made themselves an one another merry with the public judgments, and 
 particularly the prophet Jeremiah's griefs. I am their song, their 
 <I>neginath,</I> or hand-instrument of music, their <I>tabret</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+17:6">Job xvii. 6</A>),

 that they play upon, as Nero on his harp when Rome was on fire.

 8. That he was ready to despair of relief and deliverance: "Thou hast
 not only taken peace from me, but hast <I>removed my soul far off from 
 peace</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 so that it is not only not within reach, but no within view. <I>I 
 forget prosperity;</I> it is so long since I had it, and so unlikely 
 that I should ever recover it, that I have lost the idea of it. I have 
 been so inured to sorrow and servitude that I know not what joy and 
 liberty mean. I have even given up all for gone, concluding, <I>My
 strength and my hope have perished from the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>);

 I can no longer stay myself upon God as my support, for I do not find 
 that he gives me encouragement to do so; nor can I look for his 
 appearing in my behalf, so as to put an end to my troubles, for the 
 case seems remediless, and even my God inexorable." Without doubt it 
 was his infirmity to say this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+77:10">Ps. lxxvii. 10</A>),

 for with God there is <I>everlasting strength,</I> and he is his
 people's never-failing hope, whatever they may think.

 9. That grief returned upon every remembrance of his troubles, and his
 reflections were as melancholy as his prospects,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 Did he endeavour as Job did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:27">Job ix. 27</A>),

 to <I>forget his complaint?</I> Alas! it was to no purpose; he
 remembers, upon all occasions, <I>the affliction and the misery, the 
 wormwood and the gall.</I> Thus emphatically does he speak of his 
 affliction, for thus did he think of it, thus heavily did it lie when 
 he reviewed it! It was an affliction that was misery itself. <I>My
 affliction and my transgression</I> (so some read it), my trouble and 
 my sin that brought it upon me; this was <I>the wormwood and the 
 gall</I> in <I>the affliction and the misery.</I> It is sin that makes 
 the cup of affliction a bitter cup. <I>My soul has them still in
 remembrance.</I> The captives in Babylon had all the miseries of the 
 siege in their mind continually and the flames and ruins of Jerusalem 
 still before their eyes, and <I>wept when</I> they <I>remembered 
 Zion;</I> nay, they could <I>never forget Jerusalem,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:1,5">Ps. cxxxvii. 1, 5</A>.

 <I>My soul,</I> having <I>them in remembrance, is humbled in me,</I>
 not only oppressed with a sense of the trouble, but in bitterness for 
 sin. Note, It becomes us to have humble hearts under humbling 
 providences, and to renew our penitent humiliations for sin upon every 
 remembrance of our afflictions and miseries. Thus we may get good by 
 former corrections and prevent further.</P>

 hope.

 full with reproach.

 according to the multitude of his mercies.
 &nbsp; 33  For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of
 men.

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the clouds begin to disperse and the sky to clear up; the 
 complaint was very melancholy in the former part of the chapter, and 
 yet here the tune is altered and the mourners in Zion begin to look a 
 little pleasant. But for hope, the heart would break. To save the heart 
 from being quite broken, here is something <I>called to mind,</I> which 
 gives ground for <I>hope</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 which refers to what comes after, not to what goes before. <I>I make to 
 return to my heart</I> (so the margin words it); what we have had in 
 our hearts, and have laid to our hearts, is sometimes as if it were 
 quite lost and forgotten, till God by his grace make it return to our 
 hearts, that it may be ready to us when we have occasion to use it. 
 "<I>I recall</I> it <I>to mind; therefore have I hope,</I> and am kept 
 from downright despair." Let us see what these things are which he 
 calls to mind.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That, bad as things are, it is owing to the mercy of God that they 
 are not worse. We are <I>afflicted by the rod of his wrath,</I> but 
 <I>it is of the lord's mercies that we are not consumed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 When we are in distress we should, for the encouragement of our faith 
 and hope, observe what makes for us as well as what makes against us. 
 Things are bad but they might have been worse, and therefore there is 
 hope that they may be better. Observe here, 

 1. The streams of mercy acknowledged: <I>We are not consumed.</I> Note,
 The church of God is like Moses's bush, burning, yet <I>not 
 consumed;</I> whatever hardships it has met with, or may meet with, it 
 shall have a being in the world to the end of time. It is 
 <I>persecuted</I> of men, <I>but not forsaken</I> of God, and 
 therefore, though it is <I>cast down,</I> it is <I>not destroyed</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:9">2 Cor. iv. 9</A>),

 corrected, yet <I>not consumed,</I> refined in the furnace as silver,
 but <I>not consumed</I> as dross.

 2. These streams followed up to the fountain: <I>It is of the Lord's 
 mercies.</I> here are mercies in the plural number, denoting the 
 abundance and variety of those mercies. God is an inexhaustible 
 <I>fountain of mercy, the Father of mercies.</I> Note, We all owe it to 
 the sparing mercy of God <I>that we are not consumed.</I> Others have 
 been consumed round about us, and we ourselves have been in the 
 consuming, and yet <I>we are not consumed;</I> we are out of the grave; 
 we are out of hell. Had we been dealt with <I>according to our 
 sins,</I> we should have been consumed long ago; but we have been dealt 
 with <I>according to God's mercies,</I> and we are bound to acknowledge 
 it to his praise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That even in the depth of their affliction they still have 
 experience of the tenderness of the divine pity and the truth of the 
 divine promise. They had several times complained that God had not 
 pitied 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:17,21"><I>ch.</I> ii. 17, 21</A>),

 but here they correct themselves, and own, 

 1. That <I>God's compassions fail not;</I> they do not really fail,
 no, not even when in anger he seems to have <I>shut up his tender 
 mercies.</I> These rivers of mercy run fully and constantly, but never 
 run dry. No; <I>they are new every morning;</I> every morning we have 
 fresh instances of God's compassion towards us; he visits us with them 
 <I>every morning</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:18">Job vii. 18</A>);

 <I>every morning does he bring his judgment to light,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:5">Zeph. iii. 5</A>.

 When our comforts fail, yet God's compassions do not.

 2. That <I>great is his faithfulness.</I> Though the covenant seemed to 
 be broken, they owned that it still continued in full force; and, 
 though Jerusalem be in ruins, <I>the truth of the Lord endures for 
 ever.</I> Note, Whatever hard things we suffer, we must never entertain 
 any hard thoughts of God, but must still be ready to own that he is 
 both kind and faithful.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That God is, and ever will be, the all-sufficient happiness of his 
 people, and they have chosen him and depend upon him to be such 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>The Lord is my portion, saith my soul;</I> that is, 

 1. "When I have lost all I have in the world, liberty, and livelihood,
 and almost life itself, yet I have not lost my interest in God." 
 Portions on earth are perishing things, but God is <I>portion for 
 ever.</I> 

 2. "While I have an interest in God, therein I have enough; I have
 that which is sufficient to counterbalance all my troubles and make up 
 all my losses." Whatever we are robbed of our portion is safe.

 3. "This is that which I depend upon and rest satisfied with:
 <I>Therefore will I hope in him.</I> I will stay myself upon him, and 
 encourage myself in him, when all other supports and encouragements 
 fail me." Note, It is our duty to make God the portion of our souls, 
 and then to make use of him as our portion and to take the comfort of 
 it in the midst of our lamentations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That those who deal with God will find it is not in vain to trust 
 in him; for, 
 
 1. He is good to those who do so,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 He is good to all; <I>his tender mercies are over all his works;</I> 
 all his creatures taste of his goodness. But he is in a particular 
 manner <I>good to those that wait for him, to the soul that seeks 
 him.</I> Note, While trouble is prolonged, and deliverance is deferred, 
 we must patiently wait for God and his gracious returns to us. While we 
 <I>wait for him</I> by faith, we must <I>seek him</I> by prayer: our 
 <I>souls</I> must <I>seek him,</I> else we do not seek so as to find.
 Our seeking will help to keep up our waiting. And to those who thus 
 wait and seek God will be gracious; he will show them his <I>marvellous 
 lovingkindness.</I> 
 
 2. Those that do so will find it good for them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>It is good</I> (it is our duty, and will be our unspeakable comfort 
 and satisfaction) <I>to hope and quietly to wait for the salvation of 
 the Lord,</I> to hope that it will come, thought the difficulties that 
 lie in the way of it seem insupportable, to wait till it does come, 
 though it be long delayed, and while we wait to be quiet and silent, 
 not quarrelling with God nor making ourselves uneasy, but acquiescing 
 in the divine disposals. <I>Father, thy will be done.</I> If we call
 this to mind, we may have hope that all will end well at last.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. That afflictions are really good for us, and, if we bear them 
 aright, will work very much for our good. It is not only good to hope
 and wait for the salvation, but it is good to be under the trouble in 
 the mean time 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.</I> Many of 
 the young men were carried into captivity. To make them easy in it, he 
 tells them that it was good for them to <I>bear the yoke</I> of that 
 captivity, and they would find it so if they would but accommodate 
 themselves to their condition, and labour to answer God's ends in 
 laying that heavy yoke upon them. It is very applicable to the yoke of 
 God's commands. It is good for young people to take that yoke upon them
 in their youth; we cannot begin too soon to be religious. It will make
 our duty the more acceptable to God, and easy to ourselves, if we 
 engage in it when we are young. But here it seems to be meant of the 
 yoke of affliction. Many have found it good to bear this in youth; it 
 has made those humble and serious, and has weaned them from the world, 
 who otherwise would have been proud and unruly, and <I>as a bullock 
 unaccustomed to the yoke.</I> But when do we <I>bear the yoke</I> so 
 that it is really <I>good for us to bear it in our youth?</I> He 
 answers in the following verses,

 1. When we are sedate and quiet under our afflictions, when we <I>sit 
 alone and keep silence,</I> do not run to and fro into all companies 
 with our complaints, aggravating our calamities, and quarrelling with 
 the disposals of Providence concerning us, but retire into privacy, 
 that we may <I>in a day of adversity consider, sit alone,</I> that we 
 may converse with God and <I>commune with our own hearts,</I> silencing 
 all discontented distrustful thoughts, and laying our hand upon our 
 mouth, as Aaron, who, under a very severe trial, held his peace. We 
 must keep silence under the yoke as those that have borne it upon us, 
 not wilfully pulled it upon our own necks, but patiently submitted to 
 it when God laid it upon us. When those who are afflicted in their 
 youth accommodate themselves to their afflictions, fit their necks to 
 the yoke and study to answer God's end in afflicting them, then they 
 will find it good for them to bear it, for it yields <I>the peaceable 
 fruit of righteousness to those who are</I> thus <I>exercised 
 thereby.</I> 

 2. When we are humble and patient under our affliction. <I>He</I>
 gets good by the yoke who <I>puts his mouth in the dust,</I> not only 
 <I>lays his hand upon his mouth,</I> in token of submission to the will 
 of God in the affliction, but <I>puts it in the dust,</I> in token of 
 sorrow, and shame, and self-loathing, at the remembrance of sin, and as 
 one perfectly reduced and reclaimed, and brought as those that are 
 vanquished to <I>lick the dust,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:9">Ps. lxxii. 9</A>.

 And we must thus humble ourselves, <I>if so be there may be hope,</I>
 or (as it is in the original) <I>peradventure there is hope.</I> If 
 there be any way to acquire and secure a good hope under our 
 afflictions, it is this way, and yet we must be very modest in our 
 expectations of it, must look for it with an <I>it may be,</I> as those 
 who own ourselves utterly unworthy of it. Note, Those who are truly 
 humbled for sin will be glad to obtain a good hope, through grace, upon 
 any terms, though they <I>put their mouth in the dust</I> for it; and 
 those who would have hope must do so, and ascribe it to free grace if 
 they have any encouragements, which may keep their hearts from sinking 
 into the dust when they put their mouth there.

 3. When we are meek and mild towards those who are the instruments of
 our trouble, and are of a forgiving spirit,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 <I>He</I> gets good by the yoke who <I>gives his cheek to him that 
 smites him,</I> and rather <I>turns the other cheek</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:39">Matt. v. 39</A>)

 than returns the second blow. Our Lord Jesus has left us an example of
 this, for he <I>gave his back to the smiter,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:6">Isa. l. 6</A>.

 He who can bear contempt and reproach, and not <I>render railing for
 railing,</I> and bitterness for bitterness, who, when he is <I>filled 
 full with reproach,</I> keeps it to himself, and does not retort it and 
 empty it again upon those who filled him with it, but <I>pours it out 
 before the Lord</I> (as those did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+123:4">Ps. cxxiii. 4</A>,

 whose <I>souls were exceedingly filled with the contempt of the
 proud</I>), he shall find that <I>it is good to bear the yoke,</I> that 
 it shall turn to his spiritual advantage. The sum is, <I>If tribulation 
 work patience,</I> that <I>patience</I> will work <I>experience,</I> 
 and that <I>experience a hope that makes not ashamed.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. That God will graciously return to his people with seasonable 
 comforts <I>according to the time that he has afflicted them,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:31,32"><I>v.</I> 31, 32</A>.

 <I>Therefore</I> the sufferer is thus penitent, thus patient, because 
 he believes that God is gracious and merciful, which is the great 
 inducement both to evangelical repentance and to Christian patience. We 
 may bear ourselves up with this, 

 1. That, when we are cast down, yet we are not cast off; the father's
 correcting his son is not a disinheriting of him. 

 2. That though we may seem to be cast off for a time, while sensible
 comforts are suspended and desired salvations deferred, yet we are not 
 really cast off, because not <I>cast off for ever;</I> the controversy 
 with us shall not be perpetual. 

 3. That, whatever sorrow we are in, it is what God has allotted us, and
 his hand is in it. It is he that causes grief, and therefore we may be 
 assured it is ordered wisely and graciously; and it is but <I>for a 
 season,</I> and when need is, that we <I>are in heaviness,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:6">1 Pet. i. 6</A>.

 4. That God has compassions and comforts in store even for those whom
 he has himself grieved. We must be far from thinking that, though God 
 cause grief, the world will relieve and help us. No; the very same that 
 caused the grief must bring in the favour, or we are undone. <I>Una
 eademque manus vulnus opemque tulit--The same hand inflicted the wound 
 and healed it.</I> He has torn, and he will heal us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:1">Hos. vi. 1</A>.

 5. That, when God returns to deal graciously with us, it will not be
 according to our merits, but according to his mercies, <I>according to 
 the multitude,</I> the abundance, <I>of his mercies.</I> So unworthy we 
 are that nothing but an abundant mercy will relieve us; and from that 
 what may we not expect? And God's causing our grief ought to be no 
 discouragement at all to those expectations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. That, when God does cause grief, it is for wise and holy ends, and 
 he takes not delight in our calamities, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 He does indeed <I>afflict, and grieve the children of men;</I> all 
 their grievances and afflictions are from him. But he does not do it 
 <I>willingly,</I> not <I>from the heart;</I> so the word is. 

 1. He never afflicts us but when we give him cause to do it. He does
 not dispense his frowns as he does his favours, <I>ex mero 
 motu</I>--<I>from his mere good pleasure.</I> If he show us kindness, 
 it is because <I>so it seems good</I> unto him; but, if he write bitter 
 things against us, it is because we both deserve them and need them. 

 2. He does not afflict with pleasure. He delights not in the death of
 sinners, or the disquiet of saints, but punishes with a kind of 
 reluctance. He comes out of his place to punish, for his place is the 
 mercy-seat. He delights not in the misery of any of his creatures, but, 
 as it respects his own people, he is so far from it that in all their 
 afflictions he is afflicted and his soul is grieved for the misery of 
 Israel. 

 3. He retains his kindness for his people even when he afflicts them. 
 If he does not <I>willingly grieve the children of men,</I> much less 
 his own children. However it be, yet <I>God is good</I> to them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:1">Ps. lxxiii. 1</A>),

 and they may by faith see love in his heart even when they see frowns
 in his face and a rod in his hand.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. That though he makes use of men as his hand, or rather 
 instruments in his hand, for the correcting of his people, yet he is 
 far from being pleased with the injustice of their proceedings and the 
 wrong they do them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:34-36"><I>v.</I> 34-36</A>.

 Though God serves his own purposes by the violence of wicked and 
 unreasonable men, yet it does no therefore follow that he countenances 
 that violence, as his oppressed people are sometimes tempted to think. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:3">Hab. i. 13</A>,

 <I>Wherefore lookest thou upon those that deal treacherously?</I> Two 
 ways the people of God are injured and oppressed by their enemies, and 
 the prophet here assures us that God does not approve of either of 
 them:--

 1. If men injure them by force of arms, God does not approve of that.
 he does not himself <I>crush under his feet the prisoners of the 
 earth,</I> but he regards the cry of the prisoners; nor does he approve 
 of men's doing it; nay, he is much displeased with it. It is barbarous 
 to trample on those that are down, and to crush those that are bound 
 and cannot help themselves.

 2. If men injure them under colour of law, and in the pretended 
 administration of justice,--if they <I>turn aside the right of a 
 man,</I> so that he cannot discover what his rights are or cannot come 
 at them, they are out of his reach,--if they <I>subvert a man in his 
 cause,</I> and bring in a wrong verdict, or give a false judgment, let 
 them know,

 (1.) That God sees them. It is <I>before the face of the Most High</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>);

 it is in his sight, under his eye, and is very displeasing to him. They 
 cannot but know it is so, and therefore it is in defiance of him that 
 they do it. He is <I>the Most High,</I> whose authority over them they
 contemn by abusing their authority over their subjects, not considering 
 that <I>he that is higher than the highest regardeth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:8">Eccl. v. 8</A>.
 
 (2.) That God does not approve of them. More is implied than is
 expressed. The perverting of justice, and the subverting of the just, 
 are a great affront to God; and, though he may make use of them for the 
 correction of his people, yet he will sooner or later severely reckon 
 with those that do thus. Note, However God may for a time suffer 
 evil-doers to prosper, and serve his own purposes by them, yet he does 
 not therefore approve of their evil doings. <I>Far be it from God that 
 he should do iniquity,</I> or countenance those that do it.</P>

 That we may be entitled to the comforts administered to the afflicted 
 in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:21-36">foregoing verses</A>,

 and may taste the sweetness of them, we have here the duties of an
 afflicted state prescribed to us, in the performance of which we may 
 expect those comforts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We must see and acknowledge the hand of God in all the calamities 
 that befal us at any time, whether personal or public, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:37,38"><I>v.</I> 37, 38</A>.

 This is here laid down as a great truth, which will help to quiet our 
 spirits under our afflictions and to sanctify them to us. 

 1. That, whatever men's actions are, it is God that overrules them:
 <I>Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass</I> (that designs a 
 thing and bring his designs to effect), if <I>the Lord commandeth it 
 not?</I> Men can do nothing but according to the counsel of God, nor 
 have any power or success but what is given them from above. <I>A man's 
 heart devises his way;</I> he projects and purposes; he says that he 
 will do so and so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:13">Jam. iv. 13</A>);

 <I>but the Lord directs his steps</I> far otherwise than he designed
 them, and what he contrived and expected does not <I>come to pass,</I> 
 unless it be what God's hand and his counsel had determined before to 
 be done,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+16:9,Jer+10:23">Prov. xvi. 9; Jer. x. 23</A>.

 The Chaldeans said that they would destroy Jerusalem, and it came to 
 pass, not because they said it, but because God commanded it and 
 commissioned them to do it. Note, Men are but tools which the great God 
 makes use of, and manages as he pleases, in the government of this 
 lower world; and they cannot accomplish any of their designs without 
 him. 

 2. That, whatever men's lot is, it is God that orders it: <I>Out of the 
 mouth of the Most High do not evil and good proceed?</I> Yes, certainly 
 they do; and it is more emphatically expressed in the original: <I>Do 
 not</I> this <I>evil, and</I> this <I>good, proceed out of the mouth of 
 the Most High?</I> Is it not what he has ordained and appointed for us?
 Yes, certainly it is; and for the reconciling of us to our own 
 afflictions, whatever they be, this general truth must thus be 
 particularly applied. This comfort I receive <I>from the hand of God, 
 and shall I not receive</I> that <I>evil</I> also? so Job argues,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+2:10"><I>ch.</I> ii. 10</A>.

 Are we healthful or sickly, rich or poor? Do we succeed in our designs,
 or are we crossed in them? It is all what God orders; <I>every man's 
 judgment proceeds from him. The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken 
 away;</I> he forms the light and creates the darkness, as he did at 
 first. Note, All the events of divine Providence are the products of a 
 divine counsel; whatever is done God has the directing of it, and the 
 works of his hands agree with the words of his mouth; <I>he speaks, and 
 it is done,</I> so easily, so effectually are all his purposes 
 fulfilled.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We must not quarrel with God for any affliction that he lays upon 
 us at any time 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>):

 <I>Wherefore does a living man complain?</I> The prophet here seems to 
 check himself for the complaint he had made in the former part of the 
 chapter, wherein he seemed to reflect upon God as unkind and severe. 
 "Do I well to be angry? Why do I fret thus?" Those who in their haste 
 have chidden with God must, in the reflection, chide themselves for it. 
 From the doctrine of God's sovereign and universal providence, which he 
 had asserted in the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:21-36">verses before</A>,

 he draws this inference, <I>Wherefore does a living man complain?</I>
 What God does we must not open our mouths against, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:9">Ps. xxxix. 9</A>.

 Those that blame their lot reproach him that allotted it to them. The
 sufferers in the captivity must submit to the will of God in all their 
 sufferings. Note, Though we may pour out our complaints before God, we
 must never exhibit any complaints against God. What! Shall <I>a living 
 man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?</I> The reasons 
 here urged are very cogent.

 1. We are men; let us herein show ourselves men. Shall <I>a man
 complain?</I> And again, <I>a man!</I> We are men, and not brutes, 
 reasonable creatures, who should act with reason, who should look 
 upward and look forward, and both ways may fetch considerations enough 
 to silence our complaints. We are men, and not children that cry for 
 every thing that hurts them. We are men, and not gods, subjects, not 
 lords; we are not our own masters, not our own carvers; we are bound 
 and must obey, must submit. We are men, and not angels, and therefore 
 cannot expect to be free from troubles as they are; we are not 
 inhabitants of that world where there is no sorrow, but this where 
 there is nothing but sorrow. We are men, and not devils, are not in 
 that deplorable, helpless, hopeless, state that they are in, but have 
 something to comfort ourselves with which they have not. 

 2. We are living men. Through the good hand of our God upon us we are 
 alive yet, though dying daily; and shall <I>a living man complain?</I> 
 No; he has more reason to be thankful for life than to complain of any 
 of the burdens and calamities of life. Our lives are frail and 
 forfeited, and yet we are alive; now <I>the living, the living, 
 they</I> should <I>praise,</I> and not complain 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+38:19">Isa. xxxviii. 19</A>);

 while there is life there is hope, and therefore, instead of
 complaining that things are bad, we should encourage ourselves with the 
 hope that they will be better.

 3. We are sinful men, and that which we complain of is the just
 <I>punishment of our sins;</I> nay, it is far less than our iniquities 
 have deserved. WE have little reason to complain of our trouble, for it 
 is our own doing; we may thank ourselves. Our own wickedness corrects 
 us,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+19:3">Prov. xix. 3</A>.

 We have no reason to quarrel with God, for he is righteous in it; he is 
 the governor of the world, and it is necessary that he should maintain 
 the honour of his government by chastising the disobedient. Are we 
 suffering for our sins? Then let us not complain; for we have other 
 work to do; instead of repining, we must be repenting; and, as an 
 evidence that God is reconciled to us, we must be endeavouring to 
 reconcile ourselves to his holy will. Are we <I>punished for our 
 sins?</I> It is our wisdom then to submit, and to kiss the rod; for, if 
 we still walk contrary to God, he will punish us yet seven times more; 
 for <I>when he judges he will overcome.</I> But, if we accommodate 
 ourselves to him, though we be <I>chastened of the Lord</I> we shall 
 not be <I>condemned with the world.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We must set ourselves to answer God's intention in afflicting us, 
 which is to bring sin to our remembrance, and to bring us home to 
 himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.

 These are the two things which our afflictions should put us upon. 

 1. A serious consideration of ourselves and a reflection upon our past 
 lives. <I>Let us search and try our ways,</I> search what they have 
 been, and then try whether they have been right and good or no; search 
 as for a malefactor in disguise, that flees and hides himself, and then 
 try whether guilty or not guilty. Let conscience be employed both to 
 search and to try, and let it have leave to deal faithfully, to 
 accomplish a diligent search and to make an impartial trial. <I>Let us 
 try our ways,</I> that by them we may try ourselves, for we are to 
 judge of our state not by our faint wishes, but by our steps, not by 
 one particular step, but by our ways, the ends we aim at, the rules we 
 go by, and the agreeableness of the temper of our minds and the tenour 
 of our lives to those ends and those rules. When we are in affliction 
 it is seasonable to <I>consider our ways</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:5">Hag. i. 5</A>),

 that what is amiss may be repented of and amended for the future, and
 so we may answer the intention of the affliction. We are apt, in times 
 of public calamity, to reflect upon other people's ways, and lay blame 
 upon them; whereas our business is to <I>search and try our</I> own 
 <I>ways.</I> We have work enough to do at home; we must each of us say, 
 "What have I done? What have I contributed to the public flames?" that 
 we may each of us mend one, and then we should all be mended.

 2. A sincere conversion to God: "Let us <I>turn again to the Lord,</I> 
 to him who is turned against us and whom we have turned from; to him 
 let us turn by repentance and reformation, as to our owner and ruler. 
 We have been with him, and it has never been well with us since we 
 forsook him; let us therefore now turn again to him." This must 
 accompany the former and be the fruit of it; <I>therefore</I> we must 
 <I>search and try our ways,</I> that we may turn from the evil of them 
 to God. This was the method David took. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:59">Ps. cxix. 59</A>,

 <I>I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy
 testimonies.</I></P>

 IV. We must offer up ourselves to God, and our best affections and 
 services, in the flames of devotion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>.
 
 When we are in affliction,
 
 1. We must look up to God as a <I>God in the heavens,</I> infinitely 
 above us, and who has an incontestable dominion over us; for <I>the 
 heavens do rule,</I> and are therefore not to be quarrelled with, but 
 submitted to. 

 2. We must pray to him, with a believing expectation to receive mercy 
 from him; for that is implied in our <I>lifting up our hands</I> to him 
 (a gesture commonly used in prayer and sometimes put for it, as 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:2">Ps. cxli. 2</A>,

 <I>Let the lifting up of my hands be as the evening sacrifice</I>); it 
 signifies our requesting mercy from him and our readiness to receive 
 that mercy.

 (3.) Our hearts must go along with our prayers. We must <I>lift up our 
 hearts with our hands,</I> as we must pour out our souls with our 
 words. It is the heart that God looks at in that and every other
 service; for what will a sacrifice without a heart avail? If inward 
 impressions be not in some measure answerable to outward expressions, 
 we do but mock God and deceive ourselves. Praying is lifting up the 
 soul to God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+25:1">Ps. xxv. 1</A>)

 as to <I>our Father in heaven;</I> and the soul that hopes to be with
 God in heaven for ever will thus, by frequent acts of devotion, be 
 still learning the way thither and pressing forward in that way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is easier to chide ourselves for complaining than to chide ourselves 
 out of it. The prophet had owned that a living man should not complain, 
 as if he checked himself for his complaints in the former part of the 
 chapter; and yet here the clouds return after the rain and the wound 
 bleeds afresh; for great pains must be taken with a troubled spirit to 
 bring it into temper.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They confess the righteousness of God in afflicting them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>):

 <I>We have transgressed and have rebelled.</I> Note, It becomes us, 
 when we are in trouble, to justify God, by owning our sins, and laying 
 the load upon ourselves for them. Call sin a transgression, call it a 
 rebellion, and you do not miscall it. This is the result of their 
 searching and trying their ways; the more they enquired into them the 
 worse they found them. Yet,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They complain of the afflictions they are under, not without some 
 reflections upon God, which we are not to imitate, but, under the 
 sharpest trials, must always think and speak highly and kindly of 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They complain of his frowns and the tokens of his displeasure 
 against them. Their sins were repented of, and yet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>),

 <I>Thou hast not pardoned.</I> They had not the assurance and comfort 
 of the pardon; the judgments brought upon them for their sins were not 
 removed, and therefore they thought they could not say the sin was 
 pardoned, which was a mistake, but a common mistake with the people of 
 God when their souls are cast down and disquieted within them. Their 
 case was really pitiable, yet they complain, <I>Thou hast not 
 pitied,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>.

 Their enemies persecuted and slew them, but that was not the worst of 
 it; they were but the instruments in God's hand: "<I>Thou hast 
 persecuted us, and thou hast slain us,</I> though we expected thou 
 wouldst protect and deliver us." They complain that there was a wall of 
 partition between them and God, and, 

 (1.) This hindered God's favours from coming down upon them. The 
 reflected beams of God's kindness to them used to be the beauty of 
 Israel; but now "<I>thou hast covered</I> us <I>with anger,</I> so that 
 our glory is concealed and gone; now God is angry with us, and we do 
 not appear that illustrious people that we have formerly been thought 
 to be." Or, "<I>Thou hast covered us</I> up as men that are buried are 
 covered up and forgotten." 

 (2.) It hindered their prayers from coming up unto God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>):

 "<I>Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud,</I>" not like that bright 
 cloud in which he took possession of the temple, which enabled the 
 worshippers to draw near to him, but like that in which he came down 
 upon Mount Sinai, which obliged the people to stand at a distance.
 "This cloud is so thick <I>that our prayers</I> seem as if they were 
 lost in it; they cannot <I>pass through;</I> we cannot obtain an 
 audience." Note, The prolonging of troubles is sometimes a temptation, 
 even to praying people, to question whether God be what they have 
 always believed him to be, a prayer-hearing God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They complain of the contempt of their neighbours and the reproach 
 and ignominy they were under 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>):

 "<I>Thou hast made us as the off-scouring,</I> or scrapings, of the 
 first floor, which are thrown to the dunghill." This St. Paul refers to 
 in his account of the sufferings of the apostles. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:13">1 Cor. iv. 13</A>,

 <I>We are made as the filth of the world and are the off-scouring of 
 all things.</I> "We are the <I>refuse,</I> or dross, <I>in the midst of 
 the people,</I> trodden upon by every body, and looked upon as the 
 vilest of the nations, and good for nothing but to be cast out as 
 <I>salt</I> which <I>has lost its savour. Our enemies have opened
 their mouths against us</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>),

 have <I>gaped upon us as roaring lions,</I> to swallow us up, or made 
 mouths at us, or have taken liberty to say what they please of us." 
 These complaints we had before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:15,16"><I>ch.</I> ii. 15, 16</A>.

 Note, It is common for base and ill-natured men to run upon, and run
 down, those that have fallen into the depths of distress from the 
 height of honour. But this they brought upon themselves by sin. If they 
 had not made themselves vile, their enemies could not have made them 
 so: but <I>therefore men call them reprobate silver, because the Lord 
 has rejected them</I> for rejecting him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They complain of the lamentable destruction that their enemies made 
 of them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>):

 <I>Fear and a snare have come upon us;</I> the enemies have not only 
 terrified us with those alarms, but prevailed against us by their 
 stratagems, and surprised us with the ambushes they laid for us; and 
 then follows nothing but <I>desolation and destruction,</I> the 
 <I>destruction of the daughter of my people</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>),

 <I>of all the daughters of my city,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>.

 The enemies, having taken some of them <I>like a bird</I> in a snare, 
 <I>chased</I> others as a harmless bird is chased by a bird of prey 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:52"><I>v.</I> 52</A>):

 <I>My enemies chased me sorely like a bird</I> which is beaten from 
 bush to bush, as Saul hunted David <I>like a partridge.</I> Thus 
 restless was the enmity of their persecutors, and yet causeless. They
 have done it <I>without cause,</I> without any provocation given them.
 Though God was righteous, they were unrighteous. David often complains 
 of those that <I>hated him without cause;</I> and such are the enemies 
 of Christ and his church, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:25">John xv. 25</A>.

 Their enemies chased them till they had quite prevailed over them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:53"><I>v.</I> 53</A>):

 <I>They have cut off my life in the dungeon.</I> They have shut up 
 their captives in close and dark prisons, where they are as it were cut 
 off <I>from the land of the living</I> (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 or the state and kingdom are sunk and ruined, the life and being of 
 them are gone, and they are as it were thrown into the dungeon or grave 
 and a <I>stone cast upon them,</I> such as used to be <I>rolled to the 
 door of the sepulchres.</I> They look upon the Jewish nation as dead 
 and buried, and imagine that there is not possibility of its 
 resurrection. Thus Ezekiel saw it, in vision, <I>a valley full of dead
 and dry bones.</I> Their destruction is compared not only to the 
 burying of a dead man, but to the sinking of a living man into the 
 water, who cannot long be a living man there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>.

 <I>Waters</I> of affliction <I>flowed over my head.</I> The deluge 
 prevailed and quite overwhelmed them. The Chaldean forces broke in upon 
 them <I>as the breaking forth of waters,</I> which rose so high as to 
 <I>flow over their heads;</I> they could not wade, they could not swim, 
 and therefore must unavoidably sink. Note, The distresses of God's 
 people sometimes prevail to such a degree that they cannot find any 
 footing for their faith, nor keep their head above water, with any 
 comfortable expectation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They complain of their own excessive grief and fear upon this 
 account. 

 (1.) The afflicted church is drowned in tears, and the prophet for her

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:48,49"><I>v.</I> 48, 49</A>):

 <I>My eye runs down with rivers of water,</I> so abundant was their 
 weeping; <I>it trickles down and ceases not,</I> so constant was their 
 weeping, <I>without</I> any <I>intermission,</I> there being no 
 relaxation of their miseries. The distemper was in continual extremity, 
 and they had no better day. It is added 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>),

 "<I>My eye affects my heart.</I> My seeing eye affects my heart. The 
 more I look upon the desolation of the city and country the more I am 
 grieved. Which way soever I cast my eye, I see that which renews my 
 sorrow, even <I>because of all the daughters of my city,</I>" all the 
 neighbouring towns, which were as daughters to Jerusalem the 
 mother-city. Or, <I>My weeping eye affects my heart;</I> the venting of 
 the grief, instead of easing it, did but increase and exasperate it.
 Or, <I>My eye melts my soul;</I> I have quite wept away my spirits; not 
 only <I>my eye is consumed with grief, but my soul and my life are 
 spent with it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:9,10">Ps. xxxi. 9, 10</A>.

 Great and long grief exhausts the spirits, and brings not only many a
 <I>gray head,</I> but many a green head too, <I>to the grave.</I> I 
 weep, ways the prophet, <I>more than all the daughters of my city</I> 
 (so the margin reads it); he outdid even those of the tender sex in the 
 expressions of grief. And it is no diminution to any to be much in 
 tears for the sins of sinners and the sufferings of saints; our Lord 
 Jesus was so; for, <I>when he came near, he beheld</I> this same 
 <I>city and wept over it,</I> which the daughters of Jerusalem did not.

 (2.) She is overwhelmed with fears, not only grieves for what is, but 
 fears worse, and gives up all for gone

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>):

 "<I>Then I said, I am cut off,</I> ruined, and see no hope of recovery; 
 I am as one dead." Note, Those that are cast down are commonly tempted 
 to think themselves cast off, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:22,Jon+2:4">Ps. xxxi. 22; Jon. ii. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. In the midst of these sad complaints here is one word of comfort, by 
 which it appears that their case was not altogether so bad as they made 
 it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>.

 We continue thus weeping <I>till the Lord look down and behold from 
 heaven.</I> This intimates, 

 (1.) That they were satisfied that God's gracious regard to them in 
 their miseries would be an effectual redress of all their grievances. 
 "If God, who now <I>covers himself with a cloud,</I> as if he took no 
 notice of our troubles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:13">Job xxii. 13</A>),

 would but shine forth, all would be well; if he look upon us, <I>we
 shall be saved,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:19,Da+9:17">Ps. lxxx. 19; Dan. ix. 17</A>.

 Bad as the case is, one favourable look from heaven will set all to
 rights.

 (2.) That they had hopes that he would at length look graciously upon 
 them and relieve them; nay, they take it for granted that he will: 
 "Though he contend long, he will not contend for ever, thou we deserve 
 that he should." 

 (3.) That while they continued weeping they continued waiting, and 
 neither did nor would expect relief and succour from any hand but his; 
 nothing shall comfort them but his gracious returns, nor shall any 
 thing wipe tears from their eyes <I>till he look down.</I> Their eyes, 
 which now <I>run down with water,</I> shall still <I>wait upon the Lord 
 their God until he have mercy upon them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+123:2">Ps. cxxiii. 2</A>.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may observe throughout this chapter a struggle in the prophet's 
 breast between sense and faith, fear and hope; he complains and then 
 comforts himself, yet drops his comforts and returns again to his 
 complaints, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:1-11">Ps. xlii</A>.

 But, as there, so here, faith gets the last word and comes off a
 conqueror; for in these verses he concludes with some comfort. And here 
 are two things with which he comforts himself:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His experience of God's goodness even in his affliction. This may 
 refer to the prophet's personal experience, with which he encourages 
 himself in reference to the public troubles. He that has seasonably 
 succoured particular saints will not fail the church in general. Or it 
 may include the remnant of good people that were among the Jews, who 
 had found that it was not in vain to wait upon God. In three things the 
 prophet and his pious friends had found God good to them:--

 1. He had <I>heard their prayers;</I> though they had been ready to
 fear that the cloud of wrath was such as their <I>prayers could not 
 pass through</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>),

 yet upon second thoughts, or at least upon further trial, they find it 
 otherwise, and that God had not said unto them, <I>Seek you me in 
 vain.</I> When they were <I>in the low dungeon,</I> as <I>free among 
 the dead,</I> they <I>called upon God's name</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:55"><I>v.</I> 55</A>);

 their weeping did not hinder praying. Note, Though we are cast into 
 ever so low a dungeon, we may thence find a way of access to God in the 
 highest heavens. <I>Out of the depths have I cried unto thee</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+130:1">Ps. cxxx. 1</A>),

 as Jonah out of the whale's belly. And could God hear them out of the
 low dungeon, and would he? Yes, he did: <I>Thou hast heard my 
 voice;</I> and some read the following words as carrying on the same 
 thankful acknowledgment: <I>Thou didst not hide thy ear at my 
 breathing, at my cry;</I> and the original will bear that reading. We 
 read it as a petition for further audience: <I>Hide not thy ear.</I> 
 God's having heard our voice when we <I>cried to him,</I> even out of 
 <I>the low dungeon,</I> is an encouragement for us to hope that he will 
 not at any time <I>hide his ear.</I> Observe how he calls prayer <I>his 
 breathing;</I> for in prayer we breathe towards God, we breathe after 
 him. Though we be but weak in prayer, cannot cry aloud, but only 
 <I>breathe</I> in <I>groanings that cannot be uttered,</I> yet we shall 
 not be neglected if we be sincere. Prayer is the breath of the new man, 
 sucking in the air of mercy in petitions and returning it in praises; 
 it is both the evidence and the maintenance of the spiritual life. Some 
 read it, <I>at my gasping.</I> "When I lay gasping for life, and ready 
 to expire, and thought i was breathing my last, then thou tookest 
 cognizance of my distressed case."

 2. He had silenced their fears and quieted their spirits

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:57"><I>v.</I> 57</A>):

 "<I>Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee;</I> thou 
 didst graciously assure me of thy presence with me, and give me to see 
 thee nigh unto me, whereas I had thought thee to be at a distance from 
 me." Note, When we draw nigh to God in a way of duty we may by faith 
 see him drawing nigh to us in a way of mercy. But this was not all: 
 <I>Thou saidst, Fear not.</I> This was the language of God's prophets 
 preaching to them not to fear 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:10,13,14">Isa. xli. 10, 13, 14</A>),

 of his providence preventing those things which they were afraid of,
 and of his grace quieting their minds, and making them easy, by the 
 witness of his Spirit with their spirits that they were his people 
 still, though in distress, and therefore ought not to fear.

 3. He had already begun to appear for them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:58"><I>v.</I> 58</A>):

 "<I>O Lord! thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul</I>" (that is, as 
 it follows), "<I>thou hast redeemed my life,</I> hast rescued that out 
 of the hands of those who would have taken it away, hast saved that 
 when it was ready to be swallowed up, hast given me that for a prey." 
 And this is an encouragement to them to hope that he would yet further 
 appear for them: "<I>Thou hast delivered my soul from death,</I> and 
 therefore wilt deliver <I>my feet from falling;</I> thou hast 
 <I>pleaded the causes of my life,</I> and therefore wilt plead my other 
 causes."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He comforts himself with an appeal to God's justice, and (in order 
 to the sentence of that) to his omniscience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He appeals to God's knowledge of the matter of fact, how very 
 spiteful and malicious his enemies were 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:59"><I>v.</I> 59</A>):

 "<I>O Lord! thou hast seen my wrong,</I> that I have done no wrong at 
 all, but suffer a great deal." He that knows all things knew, 

 (1.) The malice they had against him: "<I>Thou hast seen all their 
 vengeance,</I> how they desire to do me a mischief, as if it were by 
 way of reprisal for some great injury I had done them." Note, We should 
 consider, to our terror and caution, that God knows all the revengeful 
 thoughts we have in our minds against others, and therefore we should 
 not allow of those thoughts nor harbour them, and that he knows all the 
 revengeful thoughts others have causelessly in their minds against us, 
 and therefore we should not be afraid of them, but leave it to him to 
 protect us from them. 

 (2.) The designs and projects they had laid to do him a mischief: 
 <I>Thou hast seen all their imaginations against me</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:60"><I>v.</I> 60</A>),

 and again, "<I>Thou hast heard all their imaginations against me</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:61"><I>v.</I> 61</A>),

 both the desire and the device they have to ruin me; whether it show 
 itself in word or deed, it is known to thee; nay, though the products 
 of it are not to be seen nor heard, yet their device against me all the 
 day is perceived and understood by him to whom all things are naked and 
 open." Note, The most secret contrivances of the church's enemies are 
 perfectly known to the church's God, from whom they can hide nothing.
 
 (3.) The contempt and calumny wherewith they loaded him, all that they
 spoke slightly of him, and all that they spoke reproachfully: "<I>Thou
 hast heard their reproach</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:61"><I>v.</I> 61</A>),

 all the bad characters they give me, laying to my charge things that I 
 know not, all the methods they use to make me odious and contemptible, 
 even the <I>lips of those that rose up against me</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:62"><I>v.</I> 62</A>),

 the contumelious language they use whenever they speak of me, and that 
 at their sitting down and rising up, when they lie down at night and 
 get up in the morning, when they sit down to their meat and with their 
 company, and when they rise from both, still I am their music; they 
 make themselves and one another merry with my miseries, as the 
 Philistines made sport with Samson." Jerusalem was the tabret they 
 played upon. Perhaps they had some tune or play, some opera or 
 interlude, that was called <I>the destruction of Jerusalem,</I> which, 
 though in the nature of a tragedy, was very entertaining to those who 
 wished ill to the holy city. Note, God will one day call sinners to 
 account for all the hard speeches which they have spoken against him 
 and his people,

 2. He appeals to God's judgment upon this fact: "<I>Lord, thou hast 
 seen my wrong;</I> there is no need of any evidence to prove it, nor 
 any prosecutor to enforce and aggravate it; thou seest it in its true 
 colours; and now I leave it with thee. <I>Judge thou my cause,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:59"><I>v.</I> 59</A>.
 
 Let them be dealt with," 

 (1.) "As they deserve 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:64"><I>v.</I> 64</A>):

 <I>Render to them a recompence according to the work of their 
 hands.</I> Let them be dealt with as they have dealt with us; let thy 
 hand be against them as their hand has been against us. They have 
 created us a great deal of vexation; now, Lord, <I>give them sorrow of 
 heart</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:65"><I>v.</I> 65</A>),

 <I>perplexity of heart</I>" (so some read it); "let them be surrounded 
 with threatening mischiefs on all sides, and not be able to see their 
 way out. Give them <I>despondence of heart</I>" (so others read it); 
 "let them be driven to despair, and give themselves up for gone." God 
 can entangle the head that thinks itself clearest, and sink the heart 
 that thinks itself stoutest. 

 (2.) "Let them be dealt with according to the threatenings: <I>Thy 
 curse unto them;</I> that is, let thy curse come upon them, all the 
 evils that are pronounced in thy word against the enemies of thy 
 people,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:65"><I>v.</I> 65</A>.

 They have loaded us with curses; as they loved cursing, so let it come 
 unto them, thy curse which will make them truly miserable. Theirs is 
 causeless, and therefore fruitless, it shall not come; but thine is 
 just, and shall take effect. Those whom thou cursest are cursed indeed. 
 Let the curse be executed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:66"><I>v.</I> 66</A>.

 <I>Persecute and destroy them in anger,</I> as they persecute and 
 destroy us in their anger. <I>Destroy them from under the heavens of 
 the Lord;</I> let them have no benefit of the light and influence of 
 the heavens. Destroy them in such a manner that all who see it may say, 
 It is a destruction from the Almighty, who <I>sits in the heavens and 
 laughs at them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:4">Ps. ii. 4</A>),

 and may own <I>that the heavens do rule,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:26">Dan. iv. 26</A>.

 What is said of the idols is here said of their worshippers (who in
 this also shall be like unto them), <I>They shall perish from under 
 these heavens,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:11">Jer. x. 11</A>.

 They shall be not only excluded from the happiness of the invisible
 heavens, but cut off from the comfort even of these visible ones, which 
 are the <I>heavens of the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:16">Ps. cxv. 16</A>)

 and which those therefore are unworthy to be taken under the protection
 of who rebel against him.</P>
