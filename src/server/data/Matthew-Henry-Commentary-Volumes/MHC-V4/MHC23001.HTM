 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The first verse of this chapter is intended for a title to the whole
 book, and it is probable that this was the first sermon that this 
 prophet was appointed to publish and to affix in writing (as Calvin 
 thinks the custom of the prophets was) to the door of the temple, as 
 with us proclamations are fixed to public places, that all might read 
 them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:2">Hab. ii. 2</A>),

 and those that would might take out authentic copies of them, the
 original being, after some time, laid up by the priests among the 
 records of the temple. The sermon which is contained in this chapter 
 has in it, 

 I. A high charge exhibited, in God's name, against the Jewish church
 and nation,

 1. For their ingratitude, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:2,3">ver. 2, 3</A>.

 2. For their incorrigibleness,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:5">ver. 5</A>.

 3. For the universal corruption and degeneracy of the people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:4,6,21,22">ver. 4, 6, 21, 22</A>.

 4. For the perversion of justice by their rulers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:23">ver. 23</A>.

 II. A sad complaint of the judgments of God, which they had brought
 upon themselves by their sins, and by which they were brought almost to 
 utter ruin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:7-9">ver. 7-9</A>.

 III. A just rejection of those shows and shadows of religion which they 
 kept up among them, notwithstanding this general defection and apostasy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:10-15">ver. 10-15</A>.

 IV. An earnest call to repentance and reformation, setting before them 
 life and death, life if they compiled with the call and death if they
 did not, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:16-20">ver. 16-20</A>.

 V. A threatening of ruin to those that would not be reformed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:24,28-31">
 ver. 24, 28-31</A>.

 VI. A promise of a happy reformation at last, and a return to their
 primitive purity and prosperity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:25-27">ver. 25-27</A>.

 And all this is to be applied by us, not only to the communities we are 
 members of, in their public interests, but to the state of our own 
 souls.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning
 Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, <I>and</I>
 Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The name of the prophet, <I>Isaiah,</I> or <I>Jesahiahu</I> (for so 
 it is in the Hebrew), which, in the New Testament is read 
 <I>Esaias.</I> His name signifies <I>the salvation of the Lord</I>--a
 proper name for a prophet by whom God <I>gives knowledge of salvation 
 to his people,</I> especially for this prophet, who prophesies so much 
 of Jesus the Saviour and of the great salvation wrought out by him. He 
 is said to be <I>the son of Amoz,</I> not Amos the prophet (the two 
 names in the Hebrew differ more than in the English), but, as the Jews 
 think, of Amoz the brother, or son, of Amaziah king of Judah, a 
 tradition as uncertain as that rule which they give, that, where a 
 prophet's father is named, he also was himself a prophet. The prophets' 
 pupils and successors are indeed often called their <I>sons,</I> but we 
 have few instances, if any, of their own sons being their 
 successors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The nature of the prophecy. It is a vision, being revealed to him 
 in a vision, when he was <I>awake, and heard the words of God, and saw 
 the visions of the Almighty</I> (as Balaam speaks, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+24:4">Num. xxiv. 4</A>),

 though perhaps it was not so illustrious a vision at first as that
 afterwards,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:1"><I>ch.</I> vi. 1</A>.

 The prophets were called <I>seers,</I> or seeing men, and therefore
 their prophecies are fitly called <I>visions.</I> It was what he saw 
 with the eyes of his mind, and foresaw as clearly by divine revelation, 
 was as well assured of it, as fully apprised of it, and as much 
 affected with it, as if he had seen it with his bodily eyes. Note 

 1. God's prophets saw what they spoke of, knew what they said, and
 require our belief of nothing but what they themselves believed and 
 were sure of,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:69,1Jo+1:1">John vi. 69; 1 John i. 1</A>.

 2. They could not but speak what they saw, because they saw how much
 all about them were concerned in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:20,2Co+4:13">Acts iv. 20; 2 Cor. iv. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The subject of the prophecy. It was what <I>he saw concerning 
 Judah and Jerusalem,</I> the country of the two tribes, and that city 
 which was their metropolis; and there is little in it relating to 
 Ephraim, or the ten tribes, of whom there is so much said in the 
 prophecy of Hosea. Some chapters there are in this book which relate to 
 Babylon, Egypt, Tyre, and some other neighbouring nations; but it takes 
 its title from that which is the main substance of it, and is therefore 
 said to be <I>concerning Judah and Jerusalem,</I> the other nations 
 spoken of being such as the people of the Jews had concern with. Isaiah 
 brings to them in a special manner, 

 1. Instruction; for it is the privilege of Judah and Jerusalem that to
 them pertain the oracles of God. 

 2. Reproof and threatening; for if in Judah, where God is known, if in
 Salem, where his name is great, iniquity be found, they, sooner than 
 any other, shall be reckoned with for it. 

 3. Comfort and encouragement in evil times; for the children of Zion
 shall be joyful in their king.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The date of the prophecy. Isaiah prophesied <I>in the days of 
 Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah.</I> By this it appears, 

 1. That he prophesied long, especially if (as the Jews say) he was at
 last put to death by Manasseh, to a cruel death, being sawn asunder, to 
 which some suppose the apostle refers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:37">Heb. xi. 37</A>.

 From the year that king Uzziah died

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:1"><I>ch.</I> vi. 1</A>)

 to Hezekiah's sickness and recovery was forty-seven years; how much
 before, and after, he prophesied, is not certain; some reckon sixty, 
 others eighty years in all. It was an honour to him, and a happiness to 
 his country, that he was continued so long in his usefulness; and we 
 must suppose both that he began young and that he held out to old age; 
 for the prophets were not tied, as the priests were, to a certain age, 
 for the beginning or ending of their administration. 

 2. That he passed through variety of times. Jotham was a good king, and
 Hezekiah a better, and no doubt gave encouragement to and took advice 
 from this prophet, were patrons to him, and he a privy-counsellor to 
 them; but between them, and when Isaiah was in the prime of his time, 
 the reign of Ahaz was very profane and wicked; then, no doubt, he was 
 frowned upon at court, and, it is likely, forced to abscond. Good men 
 and good ministers must expect bad times in this world, and prepare for 
 them. Then religion was run down to such a degree that the <I>doors of
 the house of the Lord were shut up</I> and idolatrous <I>altars were 
 erected in every corner of Jerusalem;</I> and Isaiah, with all his 
 divine eloquence and messages immediately from God himself, could not 
 help it. The best men, the best ministers, cannot do the good they 
 would do in the world.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>2  Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath
 spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have
 rebelled against me.
 &nbsp; 3  The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib:
 <I>but</I> Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.
 &nbsp; 4  Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of
 evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the

 are gone away backward.

 more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.
 &nbsp; 6  From the sole of the foot even unto the head <I>there is</I> no

 they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified
 with ointment.
 &nbsp; 7  Your country <I>is</I> desolate, your cities <I>are</I> burned with
 fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and <I>it
 is</I> desolate, as overthrown by strangers.
 &nbsp; 8  And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard,
 as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.
 &nbsp; 9  Except the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts had left unto us a very small
 remnant, we should have been as Sodom, <I>and</I> we should have been
 like unto Gomorrah.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We will hope to meet with a brighter and more pleasant scene before we 
 come to the end of this book; but truly here, in the beginning of it, 
 every thing looks very bad, very black, with Judah and Jerusalem. What 
 is the wilderness of the world, if the church, the vineyard, has such a 
 dismal aspect as this?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The prophet, though he speaks in God's name, yet, despairing to gain 
 audience with the children of his people, addresses himself to the 
 heavens and the earth, and bespeaks their attention 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>Hear, O heavens! and give ear, O earth!</I> Sooner will the
 inanimate creatures hear, who observe the law and answer the end of 
 their creation, than this stupid senseless people. Let the lights of 
 the heaven shame their darkness, and the fruitfulness of the earth 
 their barrenness, and the strictness of each to its time their 
 irregularity. Moses begins thus in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:1">Deut. xxxii. 1</A>,

 to which the prophet here refers, intimating that now those times had
 come which Moses there foretold,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:29">Deut. xxxi. 29</A>.

 Or this is an appeal to heaven and earth, to angels and then to the
 inhabitants of the upper and lower world. Let them <I>judge between God 
 and his vineyard;</I> can either produce such an instance of 
 ingratitude? Note, God will be justified when he speaks, and both 
 heaven and earth shall declare his righteousness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:1,2,Ps+50:6">Mic. vi. 1, 2; Ps. l. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He charges them with base ingratitude, a crime of the highest 
 nature. Call a man ungrateful, and you can call him no worse. Let 
 heaven and earth hear and wonder at, 

 1. God's gracious dealings with such a peevish provoking people as they
 were: "I have nourished and brought them up as children; they have been 
 well fed and well taught"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:6">Deut. xxxii. 6</A>);

 "I have magnified and exalted them" (so some), "not only made them
 grow, but made them great--not only maintained them, but preferred 
 them--not only trained them up, but raised them high." Note, We owe the 
 continuance of our lives and comforts, and all our advancements, to 
 God's fatherly care of us and kindness to us. 

 2. Their ill-natured conduct towards him, who was so tender of them:
 "<I>They have rebelled against me,</I>" or (as some read it) "they have 
 revolted from me; they have been deserters, nay traitors, against my 
 crown and dignity." Note, All the instances of God's favour to us, as 
 the God both of our nature and of our nurture, aggravate our 
 treacherous departures from him and all our presumptuous oppositions to 
 him--children, and yet rebels!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He attributes this to their ignorance and inconsideration 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):
 
 <I>The ox knows, but Israel does not.</I> Observe, 

 1. The sagacity of the ox and the ass, which are not only brute
 creatures, but of the dullest sort; yet the ox has such a sense of duty 
 as to know his owner and to serve him, to submit to his yoke and to 
 draw in it; the ass has such a sense of interest as to know has 
 master's crib, or manger, where he is fed, and to abide by it; he will 
 go to that of himself if he be turned loose. A fine pass man has come
 to when he is shamed even in knowledge and understanding by these silly 
 animals, and is not only sent to school to them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:6,7">Prov. vi. 6, 7</A>),
 
 but set in a form below them
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:7">Jer. viii. 7</A>),
 
 <I>taught more than the beasts of the earth</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+35:11">Job xxxv. 11</A>)
 
 and yet knowing less. 

 2. The sottishness and stupidity of Israel. God is their owner and
 proprietor. He made us, and his we are more than our cattle are ours; 
 he has provided well for us; providence is our Master's crib; yet many 
 that are called the people of God do not know and will not consider 
 this, but ask, "<I>What is the Almighty that we should serve him?</I> 
 He is not our owner; and <I>what profit shall we have if we pray unto 
 him?</I> He has no crib for us to feed at." He had complained

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)

 of the obstinacy of their wills; <I>They have rebelled against me.</I>
 Here he runs it up to its cause: "<I>Therefore</I> they have rebelled 
 because they do not know, they do not consider." The understanding is 
 darkened, and therefore the whole soul is alienated from the life of 
 God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:18">Eph. iv. 18</A>.

 "<I>Israel does not know,</I> though their land is a land of light and
 knowledge; <I>in Judah is God known,</I> yet, because they do not live 
 up to what they know, it is in effect as if they did not know. They
 know; but their knowledge does them no good, because they do not 
 consider what they know; they do not apply it to their case, nor their 
 minds to it." Note,

 (1.) Even among those that profess themselves God's people, that have
 the advantages and lie under the engagements of his people, there are 
 many that are very careless in the affairs of their souls. 

 (2.) Inconsideration of what we do know is as great an enemy to us in 
 religion as ignorance of what we should know. 

 (3.) <I>Therefore</I> men revolt from God, and rebel against him, 
 because they do not know and consider their obligations to God in duty, 
 gratitude, and interest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He laments the universal pravity and corruption of their church and 
 kingdom. The disease of sin was epidemic, and all orders and degrees of 
 men were infected with it; <I>Ah sinful nation!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 The prophet bemoans those that would not bemoan themselves: Alas for
 them! Woe to them! He speaks with holy indignation at their degeneracy, 
 and a dread of the consequences of it. See here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How he aggravates their sin, and shows the malignity that there was 
 in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 (1.) The wickedness was universal. They were a sinful nation; the
 generality of the people were vicious and profane. They were so in 
 their national capacity. In the management of their public treaties 
 abroad, and in the administration of public justice at home, they were 
 corrupt. Note, It is ill with a people when sin becomes national. 

 (2.) It was very great and heinous in its nature. They were <I>laden
 with iniquity;</I> the guilt of it, and the curse incurred by that 
 guilt, lay very heavily upon them. It was a heavy charge that was 
 exhibited against them, and one which they could never clear themselves 
 from; their wickedness was upon them as <I>a talent of lead,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+5:7,8">Zec. v. 7, 8</A>.

 Their sin, as it did easily beset them and they were prone to it, was a
 weight upon them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:1">Heb. xii. 1</A>.

 (3.) They came of a bad stock, were a <I>seed of evil-doers.</I> 
 Treachery ran in their blood; they had it by kind, which made the 
 matter so much the worse, more provoking and less curable. They rose up 
 in their fathers' stead, and trod in their fathers' steps, to <I>fill 
 up the measure of their iniquity,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:14">Num. xxxii. 14</A>.

 They were a race and family of rebels.

 (4.) Those that were themselves debauched did what they could to 
 debauch others. They were not only corrupt children, born tainted, but 
 <I>children that were corrupters,</I> that propagated vice, and 
 infected others with it--not only sinners, but tempters--not only 
 actuated by Satan, but agents for him. If those that are called 
 <I>children, God's children,</I> that are looked upon as belonging to 
 his family, be wicked and vile, their example is of the most malignant 
 influence. 

 (5.) Their sin was a treacherous departure from God. They were
 deserters from their allegiance: "<I>They have forsaken the Lord,</I> 
 to whom they had joined themselves; <I>they have gone away 
 backward,</I> are alienated or separated from God, have turned their 
 back upon him, deserted their colours, and quitted their service." When 
 they were urged forward, they ran backward, <I>as a bullock 
 unaccustomed to the yoke, as a backsliding heifer,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:16">Hos. iv. 16</A>.

 (6.) It was an impudent and daring defiance of him: <I>They have
 provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger</I> wilfully and designedly; 
 they knew what would anger him, and that they did. Note, The 
 backslidings of those that have professed religion and relation to God 
 are in a special manner provoking to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How he illustrates it by a comparison taken from a sick and diseased 
 body, all overspread with leprosy, or, like Job's, with sore boils,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 (1.) The distemper has seized the vitals, and so threatens to be 
 mortal. Diseases in the head and heart are most dangerous; now the 
 head, the whole head, is sick--the heart, the whole heart, is faint.
 They had become corrupt in their judgment: the leprosy was in their 
 head. They were utterly unclean; their affection to God and religion 
 was cold and gone; the <I>things which remained were ready to die</I> 
 away, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:2">Rev. iii. 2</A>.

 (2.) It has overspread the whole body, and so becomes exceedingly 
 noisome; <I>From the sole of the foot even to the head,</I> from the 
 meanest peasant to the greatest peer, there is <I>no soundness,</I> no 
 good principles, no religion (for that is the health of the soul), 
 nothing but <I>wounds and bruises,</I> guilt and corruption, the sad 
 effects of Adam's fall, noisome to the holy God, painful to the 
 sensible soul; they were so to David when he complained 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+38:5">Ps. xxxviii. 5</A>),
 
 <I>My wounds stink, and are corrupt, because of my foolishness.</I> See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:3,4">Ps. xxxii. 3, 4</A>.

 No attempts were made for reformation, or, if they were, they proved
 ineffectual: The wounds <I>have not been closed, not bound up, nor 
 mollified with ointment.</I> While sin remains unrepented of the wounds 
 are unsearched, unwashed, the proud flesh in them not cut out, and 
 while, consequently, it remains unpardoned, the wounds are not 
 mollified or closed up, nor any thing done towards the healing of them 
 and the preventing of their fatal consequences.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He sadly bewails the judgments of God which they had brought upon 
 themselves by their sins, and their incorrigibleness under those 
 judgments. 

 1. Their kingdom was almost ruined, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 So miserable were they that both their towns and their lands were
 wasted, and yet so stupid that they needed to be told this, to have it 
 shown to them. "Look and see how it is; <I>your country is
 desolate;</I> the ground is not cultivated, for want of inhabitants, 
 the villages being deserted,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:7">Judg. v. 7</A>.

 And thus the fields and vineyards become like deserts, <I>all grown
 over with thorns,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+24:31">Prov. xxiv. 31</A>.

 <I>Your cities are burned with fire,</I> by the enemies that invade
 you" (fire and sword commonly go together); "as for the fruits of your 
 land, which should be food for your families, <I>strangers devour 
 them;</I> and, to your greater vexation, it is <I>before your eyes,</I> 
 and you cannot prevent it; you starve while your enemies surfeit on 
 that which should be your maintenance. The overthrow of your country is 
 as the overthrow of strangers; it is used by the invaders, as one might 
 expect it should be used by strangers." Jerusalem itself, which was as 
 the daughter of Zion (the temple built on Zion was a mother, a nursing 
 mother, to Jerusalem), or Zion itself, the holy mountain, which had 
 been dear to God as a daughter, was now lost, deserted, and exposed 
 <I>as a cottage in a vineyard,</I> which, when the vintage is over, 
 nobody dwells in or takes any care of, and looks as mean and despicable 
 as <I>a lodge</I> or hut, <I>in a garden of cucumbers;</I> and every 
 person is afraid of coming near it, and solicitous to remove his 
 effects out of it, as if it were <I>a besieged city,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 And some think, it is a calamitous state of the kingdom that is
 represented by a diseased body,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Probably this sermon was preached in the reign of Ahaz, when Judah was
 invaded by the kings of Syria and Israel, the Edomites and the 
 Philistines, who slew many, and carried many away into captivity, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:5,17,18">2 Chron. xxviii. 5, 17, 18</A>.

 Note, National impiety and immorality bring national desolation.
 Canaan, the glory of all lands, Mount Zion, the joy of the whole earth, 
 both became a reproach and a ruin; and sin made them so, that great 
 mischief-maker.

 2. Yet they were not all reformed, and therefore God threatens to take
 another course with them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):
 
 "<I>Why should you be stricken any more,</I> with any expectation of
 doing you good by it, when you increase revolts as your rebukes are 
 increased? <I>You will revolt more and more,</I> as you have done," as 
 Ahaz particularly did, who, <I>in his distress, trespassed yet more 
 against the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:22">2 Chron. xxviii. 22</A>.

 Thus the physician, when he sees the patient's case desperate, troubles
 him no more with physic; and the father resolves to correct his child 
 no more when, finding him hardened, he determines to disinherit him. 
 Note,

 (1.) There are those who are made worse by the methods God takes to 
 make them better; the more they are stricken the more they revolt; 
 their corruptions, instead of being mortified, are irritated and 
 exasperated by their afflictions, and their hearts more hardened. 

 (2.) God, sometimes, in a way of righteous judgment, ceases to correct 
 those who have been long incorrigible, and whom therefore he designs to 
 destroy. The reprobate silver shall be cast, not into the furnace, but 
 to the dunghill, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:29,30">Jer. vi. 29, 30</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezek+24:13,Ho+4:14">Ezek. xxiv. 13; Hos. iv. 14</A>.

 He that is <I>filthy, let him be filthy still.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. He comforts himself with the consideration of a remnant that should 
 be the monuments of divine grace and mercy, notwithstanding this 
 general corruption and desolation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 
 See here,

 1. How near they were to an utter extirpation. They were almost like
 Sodom and Gomorrah in respect both of sin and ruin, had grown almost so 
 bad that there could not have been found <I>ten righteous men among 
 them,</I> and almost as miserable as if none had been left alive, but 
 their country turned into a sulphureous lake. Divine Justice said, 
 <I>Make them as Admah; set them as Zeboim;</I> but Mercy said, <I>How 
 shall I do it?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:8,9">Hos. xi. 8, 9</A>.

 2. What it was that saved them from it: <I>The Lord of hosts left unto
 them a very small remnant,</I> that were kept pure from the common 
 apostasy and kept safe and alive from the common calamity. This is 
 quoted by the apostle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:27">Rom. ix. 27</A>),

 and applied to those few of the Jewish nation who in his time embraced
 Christianity, when the body of the people rejected it, and in whom the 
 promises made to the fathers were accomplished. Note,

 (1.) In the worst of times there is a remnant preserved from iniquity 
 and reserved for mercy, as Noah and his family in the deluge, Lot and 
 his in the destruction of Sodom. Divine grace triumphs in 
 distinguishing by an act of sovereignty. 

 (2.) This remnant is often a very small one in comparison with the vast 
 number of revolting ruined sinners. Multitude is no mark of the true 
 church. Christ's is a little flock. 

 (3.) It is God's work to sanctify and save some, when others are left 
 to perish in their impurity. It is the work of his power as the Lord of 
 hosts. Except he had left us that remnant, there would have been none 
 left; the corrupters 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)

 did what they could to debauch all, and the devourers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>)

 to destroy all, and they would have prevailed of God himself had not
 interposed to secure to himself a remnant, who are bound to give him 
 all the glory.

 (4.) It is good for a people that have been saved from utter ruin to 
 look back and see how near they were to it, just upon the brink of it, 
 to see how much they owed to a few good men that stood in the gap, and 
 that that was owing to a good God, who left them these good men. <I>It 
 is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Hear the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto
 the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.
 &nbsp; 11  To what purpose <I>is</I> the multitude of your sacrifices unto
 me? saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and
 the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of
 bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.
 &nbsp; 12  When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at
 your hand, to tread my courts?
 &nbsp; 13  Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto
 me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I
 cannot away with; <I>it is</I> iniquity, even the solemn meeting.
 &nbsp; 14  Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth:
 they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear <I>them.</I>
 &nbsp; 15  And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes
 from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your
 hands are full of blood.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, I. God calls to them (but calls in vain) to hear his word, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 1. The title he gives them is very strange; <I>You rulers of Sodom,</I>
 and <I>people of Gomorrah.</I> This intimates what a righteous thing it 
 would have been with God to make them like Sodom and Gomorrah in 
 respect of ruin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 because that had made themselves like Sodom and Gomorrah in respect of
 sin. The men of Sodom were <I>wicked, and sinners before the Lord 
 exceedingly</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:13">Gen. xiii. 13</A>),

 and so were the men of Judah. When the rulers were bad, no wonder the
 people were so. Vice overpowered virtue, for it had the rulers, the
 men of figure, on its side; and it out-polled it, for it had the 
 people, the men of number, on its side. The streams being thus strong, 
 no less a power than that of the Lord of hosts could secure a remnant, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 The rulers are boldly attacked here by the prophet as rulers of Sodom;
 for he knew not how to give flattering titles. The tradition of the 
 Jews is that for this he was impeached long after, and put to death, as 
 having cursed the gods and <I>spoken evil of the ruler of his 
 people.</I>

 2. His demand upon them is very reasonable: "<I>Hear the word of the
 Lord,</I> and <I>give ear to the law of our God;</I> attend to that 
 which God has to say to you, and let his word be a law to you." The 
 following declaration of dislike to their sacrifices would be a kind of 
 new law to them, though really it was but an explication of the old 
 law; but special regard is to be had to it, as is required to the like, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:7,8">Ps. l. 7, 8</A>.
 
 "Hear this, and tremble; hear it, and take warning."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He justly refuses to hear their prayers and accept their services, 
 their sacrifices and burnt-offerings, the fat and blood of them 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),
 
 their attendance in his courts

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 their oblations, their incense, and their solemn assemblies

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 their new moons and their appointed feasts

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),
 
 their devoutest addresses
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);

 they are all rejected, because their hands were full of blood. Now
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. There are many who are strangers, nay, enemies, to the power of 
 religion, and yet seem very zealous for the show and shadow and form of 
 it. This sinful nation, this seed of evil-doers, these rulers of Sodom 
 and people of Gomorrah, brought, not to the altars of false gods (they 
 are not here charged with that), but to the altar of the God of Israel, 
 sacrifices, a multitude of them, as many as the law required and rather 
 more--not only peace-offerings, which they themselves had their share
 of, but burnt-offerings, which were wholly consumed to the honour of 
 God; nor did they bring the torn, and lame, and sick, but fed beasts, 
 and the fat of them, the best of the kind. They did not send others to 
 offer their sacrifices for them, but came themselves to appear before 
 God. They observed the instituted <I>places</I> (not in high places or 
 groves, but in God's own courts), and the instituted <I>time,</I> the 
 new moons, and sabbaths, and appointed feasts, none of which they 
 omitted. Nay, it should seem, they called extraordinary assemblies, and 
 held solemn meetings for religious worship, besides those that God had 
 appointed. Yet this was not all: they applied to God, not only with 
 their ceremonial observances, but with the exercises of devotion. They 
 prayed, prayed often, made many prayers, thinking they should be heard 
 for their much speaking; nay, they were fervent and importunate in 
 prayer, they spread forth their hands as men in earnest. Now we should 
 have thought these, and, no doubt, they thought themselves, a pious 
 religious people; and yet they were far from being so, for 

 (1.) Their hearts were empty of true devotion. They came to 
 <I>appear</I> before God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 <I>to be seen</I> before him (so the margin reads it); they rested in
 the outside of the duties; they looked no further than to be seen of 
 men, and went no further than that which men see.

 (2.) Their hands were full of blood. They were guilty of murder, 
 rapine, and oppression, under colour of law and justice. The people 
 shed blood, and the rulers did not punish them for it; the rulers shed 
 blood, and the people were aiding and abetting, as the elders of 
 Jezreel were to Jezebel in shedding Naboth's blood. Malice is 
 heart-murder in the account of God; he that hates his brother in his 
 heart has, in effect, his hands full of blood.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. When sinners are under the judgments of God they will more easily be 
 brought to fly to their devotions than to forsake their sins and reform 
 their lives. Their country was now desolate, and their cities were 
 burnt 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 which awakened them to bring their sacrifices and offerings to God more
 constantly than they had done, as if they would bribe God Almighty to 
 remove the punishment and give them leave to go on in the sin. <I>When 
 he slew them, then they sought him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:34">Ps. lxxviii. 34</A>.

 <I>Lord, in trouble have they visited thee,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:16"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 16</A>.

 Many that will readily part with their sacrifices will not be persuaded
 to part with their sins.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The most pompous and costly devotions of wicked people, without a 
 thorough reformation of the heart and life, are so far from being 
 acceptable to God that really they are an abomination to him. It is 
 here shown in a great variety of expressions that <I>to obey is better 
 than sacrifice;</I> nay, that sacrifice, without obedience, is a jest, 
 an affront and provocation to God. The comparative neglect which God 
 here expresses of ceremonial observance was a tacit intimation of what 
 they would come to at last, when they would all be done away by the 
 death of Christ. What was now made little of would in due time be made 
 nothing of. "<I>Sacrifice and offering,</I> and prayer made in the 
 virtue of them, <I>thou wouldest not; then said I, Lo, I come.</I>" 
 Their sacrifices are here represented,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) As fruitless and insignificant; <I>To what purpose is the 
 multitude of your sacrifices?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 They are <I>vain oblations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 <I>In vain do they worship me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:9">Matt. xv. 9</A>.

 Their attention to God's institutions was all lost labour, and served
 not to answer any good intention; for,

 [1.] It was not looked upon as any act of duty or obedience to God: 
 <I>Who has required these things at your hands?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Not that God disowns his institutions, or refuses to stand by his own
 warrants; but in what they did they had not an eye to him that required 
 it, nor indeed did he require it of those whose hands were full of 
 blood and who continued impenitent.

 [2.] It did not recommend them to God's favour. He delighted not in the 
 blood of their sacrifices, for he did not look upon himself as honoured 
 by it.

 [3.] It would not obtain any relief for them. They pray, but God will 
 not hear, because they regard iniquity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:18">Ps. lxvi. 18</A>);

 he will not deliver them, for, though they make many prayers, none of
 them come from an upright heart. All their religious service turned to 
 no account to them. Nay,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) As odious and offensive. God did not only not accept them, but he 
 did detest and abhor them. "They are <I>your</I> sacrifices, they are 
 none of mine; I am full of them, even surfeited with them." He needed 
 them not 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:10">Ps. l. 10</A>),

 did not desire them, had had enough of them, and more than enough.
 Their coming into his courts he calls <I>treading them,</I> or 
 trampling upon them; their very attendance on his ordinances was 
 construed into a contempt of them. Their incense, though ever so 
 fragrant, was an abomination to him, for it was burnt in hypocrisy and 
 with an ill design. Their solemn assemblies he could not <I>away 
 with,</I> could not see them with any patience, nor bear the affront 
 they gave him. <I>The solemn meeting is iniquity;</I> though the thing 
 itself was not, yet, as they managed it, it became so. It is a 
 <I>vexation</I> (so some read it), a provocation, to God, to have 
 ordinances thus prostituted, not only by wicked people, but to wicked 
 purposes: "<I>My soul hates them; they are a trouble to me,</I> a 
 burden, an incumbrance; I am perfectly sick of them, and <I>weary of 
 bearing them.</I>" God is never weary of hearing the prayers of the 
 upright, but soon weary of the costly sacrifices of the wicked. He 
 hides his eyes from their prayers, as that which he has an aversion to 
 and is angry at. All this is to show,

 [1.] That sin is very hateful to God, so hateful that it makes even 
 men's prayers and their religious services hateful to him.

 [2.] That dissembled piety is double iniquity. Hypocrisy in religion
 is of all things most abominable to the God of heaven. Jerome applies 
 the passage to the Jews in Christ's time, who pretended a great zeal 
 for the law and the temple, but made themselves and all their services 
 abominable to God by filling their hands with the blood of Christ and 
 his apostles, and so filling up the measure of their iniquities.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Though God had rejected their services as insufficient to atone for 
 their sins while they persisted in them, yet he does not reject them as 
 in a hopeless condition, but here calls upon them to forsake their 
 sins, which hindered the acceptance of their services, and then all 
 would be well. Let them not say that God picked quarrels with them; no, 
 he proposes a method of reconciliation. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A call to repentance and reformation: "If you would have your 
 sacrifices accepted, and your prayers answered, you must begin your 
 work at the right end: <I>Be converted to my law</I>" (so the Chaldee 
 begins this exhortation), "make conscience of second-table duties, else 
 expect not to be accepted in the acts of your devotion." As justice and 
 charity will never atone for atheism and profaneness, so prayers and 
 sacrifices will never atone for fraud and oppression; for righteousness 
 towards men is as much a branch of pure religion as religion towards 
 God is a branch of universal righteousness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They must <I>cease to do evil,</I> must do no more wrong, shed no 
 more innocent blood. This is the meaning of washing themselves and 
 <I>making themselves clean,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 It is not only sorrowing for the sin they had committed, but breaking
 off the practice of it for the future, and mortifying all those vicious 
 affections and dispositions which inclined them to it. Sin is defiling 
 to the soul. Our business is to wash ourselves from it by repenting of 
 it and turning from it to God. We must put away not only that evil of 
 our doings which is before the eye of the world, by refraining from the 
 gross acts of sin, but that which is before God's eyes, the roots and 
 habits of sin, that are in our hearts; these must be crushed and 
 mortified.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They must <I>learn to do well.</I> This was necessary to the 
 completing of their repentance. Note, It is not enough that we cease to 
 do evil, but we must learn to do well. 

 (1.) We must be doing, not cease to do evil and then stand idle. 

 (2.) We must be doing good, the good which the Lord our God requires 
 and which will turn to a good account.

 (3.) We must do it well, in a right manner and for a right end; and, 
 
 (4.) We must learn to do well; we must take pains to get the knowledge 
 of our duty, be inquisitive concerning it, in care about it, and 
 accustom ourselves to it, that we may readily turn our hands to our 
 work and become masters of this holy art of doing well. He urges them 
 particularly to those instances of well-doing wherein they had been 
 defective, to second-table duties: "<I>Seek judgment;</I> enquire what 
 is right, that you may do it; be solicitous to be found in the way of 
 your duty, and do not walk carelessly. Seek opportunities of doing 
 good: <I>Relieve the oppressed,</I> those whom you yourselves have 
 oppressed; ease them of their burdens,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:6"><I>ch.</I> lviii. 6</A>.

 You, that have power in your hands, use it for the relief of those whom
 others do oppress, for that is your business. Avenge those that suffer 
 wrong, in a special manner concerning yourselves for the fatherless and 
 the widow, whom, because they are weak and helpless, proud men trample 
 upon and abuse; do you appear for them at the bar, on the bench, as 
 there is occasion. Speak for those that know not how to speak for
 themselves and that have not wherewithal to gratify you for your 
 kindness." Note, We are truly honouring God when we are doing good in 
 the world; and acts of justice and charity are more pleasing to him 
 than all burnt-offerings and sacrifices.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A demonstration, at the bar of right reason, of the equity of God's 
 proceedings with them: "<I>Come now, and let us reason together</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>);

 while your hands are full of blood I will have nothing to do with you,
 though you bring me a multitude of sacrifices; but if you wash, and 
 make yourselves clean, you are welcome to draw nigh to me; come now, 
 and let us talk the matter over." Note, Those, and those only, that 
 break off their league with sin, shall be welcome into covenant and 
 communion with God; he says, <I>Come now,</I> who before forbade them 
 his courts. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:8">Jam. iv. 8</A>.

 Or rather thus: There were those among them who looked upon themselves
 as affronted by the slights God put upon the multitude of their 
 sacrifices, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:3"><I>ch.</I> lviii. 3</A>,

 <I>Wherefore have we fasted</I> (say they) <I>and thou seest not?</I>
 They represented God as a hard Master, whom it was impossible to 
 please. "Come," says God, "let us debate the matter fairly, and I doubt 
 not but to make it out that <I>my ways are equal, but yours are 
 unequal,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:25">Ezek. xviii. 25</A>.

 Note, Religion has reason on its side; there is all the reason in the
 world why we should do as God would have us do. The God of heaven 
 condescends to reason the case with those that contradict him and find 
 fault with his proceedings; for <I>he will be justified when he 
 speaks,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:4">Ps. li. 4</A>.

 The case needs only to be stated (as it is here very fairly) and it
 will determine itself. God shows here upon what terms they stood (as he 
 does,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:21-24,33:18,19">Ezek. xviii. 21-24; xxxiii. 18, 19</A>)

 and then leaves it to them to judge whether these terms are not fair
 and reasonable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They could not in reason expect any more then, if they repented and 
 reformed, they should be restored to God's favour, notwithstanding
 their former provocations. "This you may expect," says God, and it is 
 very kind; who could have the face to desire it upon any other terms? 
 
 (1.) It is very little that is required, "only that you <I>be willing 
 and obedient,</I> that you <I>consent to obey</I>" (so some read it), 
 "that you subject your wills to the will of God, acquiesce in that, and 
 give up yourselves in all things to be ruled by him who is infinitely 
 wise and good" <I>Here is no penance imposed for their former 
 stubbornness, nor the yoke made heavier or bound harder on their necks; 
 only, "Whereas hitherto you have been perverse and refractory, and 
 would not comply with that which was for your own good, now be 
 tractable, be governable</I>" He does not say, "If you be 
 <I>perfectly</I> obedient," but, "If you be <I>willingly</I> so;" for, 
 if there be a willing mind, it is accepted. 

 (2.) That is very great which is promised hereupon.

 [1.] That all their sins should be pardoned to them, and should not be 
 mentioned against them. "Though they be as red as scarlet and crimson, 
 though you lie under the guilt of blood, yet, upon your repentance, 
 even that shall be forgiven you, and you shall appear in the sight of 
 God as white as snow." Note, The greatest sinners, if they truly 
 repent, shall have their sins forgiven them, and so have their 
 consciences pacified and purified. Though our sins have been as scarlet 
 and crimson, as deep dye, a double dye, first in the wool of original 
 corruption and afterwards in the many threads of actual 
 transgression--though we have been often dipped, by our many 
 backslidings, into sin, and though we have lain long soaking in it, as 
 the cloth does in the scarlet dye, yet pardoning mercy will thoroughly 
 discharge the stain, and, being by it purged as <I>with hyssop, we 
 shall be clean,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:7">Ps. li. 7</A>.

 If we make ourselves clean by repentance and reformation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),
 
 God will make us white by a full remission.

 [2.] That they should have all the happiness and comfort they could 
 desire. "Be but willing and obedient, and <I>you shall eat the good of 
 the land,</I> the land of promise; you shall have all the blessings of 
 the new covenant, of the heavenly Canaan, all the good of the land." 
 Those that go on in sin, though they may dwell in a good land, cannot 
 with any comfort eat the good of it; guilt embitters all; but, if sin 
 be pardoned, creature-comforts become comforts indeed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They could not in reason expect any other than that, if they 
 continued obstinate in their disobedience, they should be abandoned to 
 ruin, and the sentence of the law should be executed upon them; what 
 can be more just? 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>);

 "<I>If you refuse and rebel,</I> if you continue to rebel against the
 divine government and refuse the offers of the divine grace, <I>you 
 shall be devoured with the sword,</I> with the sword of your enemies, 
 which shall be commissioned to destroy you--with the sword of God's 
 justice, his wrath, and vengeance, which shall be drawn against you; 
 for this is that which <I>the mouth of the Lord has spoken,</I> and 
 which he will make good, for the maintaining of his own honour." Note, 
 Those that will not be governed by God's sceptre will certainly and 
 justly be devoured by his sword.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 "And now life and death, good and evil, are thus set before you. 
 <I>Come, and let us reason together.</I> What have you to object 
 against the equity of this, or against complying with God's terms?"</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  How is the faithful city become a harlot! it was full of
 judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.
 &nbsp; 22  Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:
 &nbsp; 23  Thy princes <I>are</I> rebellious, and companions of thieves:
 every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge
 not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto
 them.
 &nbsp; 24  Therefore saith the Lord, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, the mighty One
 of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me
 of mine enemies:
 &nbsp; 25  And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy
 dross, and take away all thy tin:
 &nbsp; 26  And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy
 counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called,
 The city of righteousness, the faithful city.
 &nbsp; 27  Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with
 righteousness.
 &nbsp; 28  And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners
 <I>shall be</I> together, and they that forsake the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall be
 consumed.
 &nbsp; 29  For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired,
 and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.
 &nbsp; 30  For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden
 that hath no water.
 &nbsp; 31  And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a

 <I>them.</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. The woeful degeneracy of Judah and Jerusalem is sadly lamented. See,

 1. What the royal city had been, a faithful city, faithful to God and
 the interests of his kingdom among men, faithful to the nation and its 
 public interests. <I>It was full of judgment;</I> justice was duly 
 administered upon the thrones of judgment which were set there, the 
 <I>thrones of the house of David,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+122:5">Ps. cxxii. 5</A>.

 Men were generally honest in their dealings, and abhorred to do an
 unjust thing. <I>Righteousness lodged in it,</I> was constantly
 resident in their palaces and in all their dwellings, not called in now 
 and then to serve a turn, but at home there. Note, Neither holy cities 
 nor royal ones, neither places where religion is professed nor places 
 where government is administered, are faithful to their trust if 
 religion do not dwell in them.

 2. What it had now become. That beauteous virtuous spouse was now
 debauched, and become an adulteress; righteousness no longer dwelt in 
 Jerusalem (<I>terras Astr&aelig;a reliquit--Astrea left the earth</I>); 
 even murderers were unpunished and lived undisturbed there; nay, the 
 princes themselves were so cruel and oppressive that they had become no 
 better than murderers; an innocent man might better guard himself 
 against a troop of banditti or assassins than against a bench of such 
 judges. Note, It is a great aggravation of the wickedness of any family 
 or people that their ancestors were famed for virtue and probity; and 
 commonly those that thus degenerate prove the most wicked of all men. 
 <I>Corruptio optimi est pessima--That which was originally the best 
 becomes when corrupted the worst,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:26,Ec+3:16">Luke xi. 26; Eccl. iii. 16</A>.

 See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:15-17">Jer. xxii. 15-17</A>.

 The degeneracy of Jerusalem is illustrated,

 (1.) By similitudes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>Thy silver has become dross.</I> This degeneracy of the magistrates,
 whose character is the reverse of that of their predecessors, is a 
 great a reproach and injury to the kingdom as the debasing of their 
 coin would be and the turning of their silver into dross. Righteous 
 princes and righteous cities are as silver for the treasury, but 
 unrighteous ones are as dross for the dunghill. <I>How has the gold
 become dim!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:1">Lam. iv. 1</A>.

 <I>Thy wine is mixed with water,</I> and so has become flat and sour.
 Some understand both these literally: the wine they sold was 
 adulterated, it was half water; the money they paid was counterfeit, 
 and so they cheated all they dealt with. But it is rather to be taken 
 figuratively: justice was perverted by their princes, and religion and 
 the word of God were sophisticated by their priests, and made to serve 
 what turn they pleased. Dross may shine like silver, and the wine that 
 is mixed with water may retain the colour of wine, but neither is worth 
 any thing. Thus they retained a show and pretence of virtue and 
 justice, but had no true sense of either.

 (2.) By some instances 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 "Thy princes, that should keep others in their allegiance to God and
 subjection to his law, are themselves rebellious, and set God and his 
 law at defiance." Those that should restrain thieves (proud and rich 
 oppressors, those worst of robbers, and those that designedly cheat 
 their creditors, who are no better), are themselves companions of 
 thieves, connive at them, do as they do, and with greater security and 
 success, because they are princes, and have power in their hands; they 
 share with the thieves they protect in their unlawful gain

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:18">
 Ps. l. 18</A>)

 and <I>cast in their lot among them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:13,14">Prov. i. 13, 14</A>.

 [1.] The profit of their places is all their aim, to make the best hand 
 they can of them, right or wrong. They love gifts, and follow after
 rewards; they set their hearts upon their salary, the fees and 
 perquisites of their offices, and are greedy of them, and never think 
 they can get enough; nay, they will do any thing, though ever so 
 contrary to law and justice, for a gift in secret. Presents and 
 gratuities will blind their eyes at any time, and make them pervert 
 judgment. These they love and are eager in the pursuit of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:18">Hos. ix. 18</A>.

 [2.] The duty of their places is none of their care. They ought to 
 protect those that are injured, and take cognizance of the appeals made 
 to them; why else were they preferred? But <I>they judge not the 
 fatherless,</I> take no care to guard the orphans, <I>nor does the 
 cause of the widow come unto them,</I> because the poor widow has no 
 bribe to give, with which to make way for her and to bring her cause 
 on. Those will have a great deal to answer for who, when they should be 
 the patrons of the oppressed, are their greatest oppressors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A resolution is taken up to redress these grievances 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):
 
 <I>Therefore saith the Lord, the Lord of hosts, the Mighty One of
 Israel</I>--who has power to make good what he says, who has hosts at
 command for the executing of his purposes, and whose power is engaged 
 for his Israel--<I>Ah! I will ease me of my adversaries.</I>
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Wicked people, especially wicked rulers that are cruel and 
 oppressive, are God's enemies, his adversaries, and shall so be 
 accounted and so dealt with. If the holy seed corrupt themselves, they 
 are the foes of his own house.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They are a burden to the God of heaven, which is implied in his 
 easing himself of them. The <I>Mighty One of Israel,</I> that can bear 
 any thing, nay, that upholds all things, complains of his being 
 <I>wearied with men's iniquities,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:24,Am+2:13"><I>ch.</I> xliii. 24. Amos ii. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. God will find out a time and a way to ease himself of this burden, 
 by avenging himself on those that thus bear hard upon his patience. He 
 here speaks as one triumphing in the foresight of it: <I>Ah. I will 
 ease me.</I> He will ease the earth of the burden under which it 
 <I>groans</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:21,22">Rom. viii. 21, 22</A>),

 will ease his own name of the reproaches with which it is loaded. He
 will be eased of his adversaries, by <I>taking vengeance on his 
 enemies;</I> he will <I>spue them out of his mouth,</I> and so be eased 
 of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:16">Rev. iii. 16</A>.

 He speaks with pleasure of the <I>day of vengeance</I> being <I>in his
 heart,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:4"><I>ch.</I> lxiii. 4</A>.

 If God's professing people conform not to his image, as the Holy One of
 Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 they shall feel the weight of his hand as the Mighty One of Israel: his
 power, which was wont to be engaged for them, shall be armed against 
 them. In two ways God will ease himself of this grievance:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) By reforming his church, and restoring good judges in the room of 
 those corrupt ones. Though the church has a great deal of dross in it, 
 yet it shall not be thrown away, but refined 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 "<I>I will purely purge away thy dross.</I> I will amend what is amiss.
 Vice and profaneness shall be suppressed and put out of countenance, 
 oppressors displaced, and deprived of their power to do mischief." When 
 things are ever so bad God can set them to rights, and bring about a 
 complete reformation; when he begins he will make an end, will take 
 away all the tin. Observe,

 [1.] The reformation of a people is God's own work, and, if ever it be 
 done, it is he that brings it about: "<I>I will turn my hand upon 
 thee;</I> I will do that for the reviving of religion which I did at 
 first for the planting of it." He can do it easily, with the turn of 
 his hand; but he does it effectually, for what opposition can stand 
 before the arm of the Lord revealed?

 [2.] He does it by blessing them with good magistrates and good 
 ministers of state 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 "<I>I will restore thy judges as at the first,</I> to put the laws in
 execution against evil-doers, <I>and thy counsellors,</I> to transact 
 public affairs, <I>as at the beginning,</I>" either the same persons 
 that had been turned out or others of the same character.

 [3.] He does it by restoring judgment and righteousness among them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 by planting in men's minds principles of justice and governing their
 lives by those principles. Men may do much by external restraints; but 
 God does it effectually by the influences of <I>his Spirit,</I> as a 
 <I>Spirit of judgment,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+4:4,28:6"><I>ch.</I> iv. 4; xxviii. 6</A>.
 
 See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+85:10,11">Ps. lxxxv. 10, 11</A>.

 [4.] The reformation of a people will be the redemption of them and
 their converts, for sin is the worst captivity, the worst slavery, and 
 the great and eternal redemption is that by which <I>Israel is redeemed 
 from all his iniquities</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+130:8">Ps. cxxx. 8</A>),

 and the <I>blessed Redeemer</I> is he that <I>turns away ungodliness
 from Jacob</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:26">Rom. xi. 26</A>),

 and <I>saves his people from their sins,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:21">Matt. i. 21</A>.

 All the redeemed of the Lord shall be converts, and their conversion is
 their redemption: "<I>Her converts,</I> or <I>those that return of 
 her</I> (so the margin), shall be redeemed with righteousness." God 
 works deliverance for us by preparing us for it with judgment and 
 righteousness.

 [5.] The reviving of a people's virtues is the restoring of their 
 honour: <I>Afterwards thou shalt be called the city of righteousness, 
 the faithful city;</I> that is, <I>First,</I> "Thou shalt <I>be</I> 
 so;" the reforming of the magistracy is a good step towards the 
 reforming of the city and the country too. <I>Secondly,</I> "Thou shalt 
 have the <I>praise</I> of being so;" and a greater praise there cannot 
 be to any city than to <I>be called the city of righteousness,</I> and 
 to retrieve the ancient honour which was lost when <I>the faithful city 
 became a harlot,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) By cutting off those that hate to be reformed, that they may not 
 remain either as snares or as scandals to the faithful city. 

 [1.] it is an utter ruin that is here threatened. They shall be 
 destroyed and consumed, and not chastened and corrected only. The 
 extirpation of them will be necessary to the redemption of Zion.

 [2.] It is a universal ruin, which will involve the transgressors and 
 the sinners together, that is, the openly profane that have quite cast 
 of all religion, and the hypocrites that live wicked lives under the 
 cloak of a religious profession--they shall both be destroyed together, 
 for they are both alike an abomination to God, both those that 
 contradict religion and those that contradict themselves in their 
 pretensions to it. <I>And those that forsake the Lord,</I> to whom they 
 had formerly joined themselves, <I>shall be consumed,</I> as the water 
 in the conduit-pipe is soon consumed when it is cut off from the 
 fountain.

 [3.] It is an inevitable ruin; there is no escaping it. <I>First,</I>
 Their idols shall not be able to help them, <I>the oaks which they have 
 desired, and the gardens which they have chosen;</I> that is, the 
 images, the dunghill-gods, which they had worshipped in their groves 
 and under the green trees, which they were fond of and wedded to, for 
 which they forsook the true God, and which they worshipped privately in 
 their own garden even when idolatry was publicly discountenanced. "This 
 was the practice of the transgressors and the sinners; but they shall 
 be ashamed of it, not with a show of repentance, but of despair, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.
 
 They shall have cause to be ashamed of their idols; for, after all the
 court they have made to them, they shall find no benefit by them; but 
 the idols themselves <I>shall go into captivity,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:1,2"><I>ch.</I> xlvi. 1, 2</A>.
 
 Note, Those that make creatures their confidence are but preparing
 confusion for themselves. You were fond of the oaks and the gardens, 
 but you yourselves shall be, 

 1. "<I>Like an oak without leaves,</I> withered and blasted, and
 stripped of all its ornaments." Justly do those wear no leaves that 
 bear no fruit; as the fig-tree that Christ cursed. 

 2. "<I>Like a garden without water,</I> that is neither rained upon nor
 <I>watered with the foot</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+11:10">Deut. xi. 10</A>),

 that had no <I>fountain</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:15">Cant. iv. 15</A>),

 and consequently is parched, and all the fruits of it gone to decay."
 Thus shall those be that trust in idols, or in an <I>arm of flesh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:5,6">Jer. xvii. 5, 6</A>.

 But those that trust in God never find him as a wilderness, or as
 waters that fail,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:31">Jer. ii. 31</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> They shall not be able to help themselves

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 "<I>Even the strong man shall be as tow</I> not only soon broken and
 pulled to pieces, but easily catching fire; and <I>his work</I> (so the 
 margin reads it), that by which he hopes to fortify and secure himself, 
 shall be as a spark to his own tow, shall set him on fire, and he and 
 his work shall burn together. His counsels shall be his ruin; his own 
 skin kindles the fire of God's wrath, which shall burn to the lowest 
 hell, and none shall quench it." When the sinner has made himself as 
 tow and stubble, and God makes himself to him as a consuming fore, what 
 can prevent the utter ruin of the sinner?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now all this is applicable, 

 1. To the blessed work of reformation which was wrought in Hezekiah's
 time after the abominable corruptions of the reign of Ahaz. Then good 
 men came to be preferred, and the faces of the wicked were filled with 
 shame. 

 2. To their return out of their captivity in Babylon, which had
 thoroughly cured them of idolatry. 

 3. To the gospel-kingdom and the pouring out of the Spirit, by which
 the New-Testament church should be made a new Jerusalem, a city of 
 righteousness. 

 4. To the second coming of Christ, when he shall thoroughly purge his
 floor, his field, shall gather the wheat into his barn, into his
 garner, and burn the chaff, the tares, with unquenchable fire.</P>
