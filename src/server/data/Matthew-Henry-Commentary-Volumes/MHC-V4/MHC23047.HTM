 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Infinite Wisdom could have ordered things so that Israel might have 
 been released and yet Babylon unhurt; but if they will harden their 
 hearts, and will not let the people go, they must thank themselves that 
 their ruin is made to pave the way to Israel's release. That ruin is 
 here, in this chapter, largely foretold, not to gratify a spirit of 
 revenge in the people of God, who had been used barbarously by them, 
 but to encourage their faith and hope concerning their own deliverance, 
 and to be a type of the downfall of that great enemy of the 
 New-Testament church which, in the Revelation, goes under the name of 
 "Babylon." In this chapter we have, 

 I. The greatness of the ruin threatened, that Babylon should be brought
 down to the dust, and made completely miserable, should fall from the 
 height of prosperity into the depth of adversity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. The sins that provoked God to bring this ruin upon them. 

 1. Their cruelty to the people of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:6">ver. 6</A>.

 2. Their pride and carnal security, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:7-9">ver. 7-9</A>.

 3. Their confidence in themselves and contempt of God,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:10">ver. 10</A>.

 4. Their use of magic arts and their dependence upon enchantments and
 sorceries, which should be so far from standing them in any stead that 
 they should but hasten their ruin,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon,
 sit on the ground: <I>there is</I> no throne, O daughter of the
 Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate.
 &nbsp; 2  Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make
 bare the leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers.
 &nbsp; 3  Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be
 seen: I will take vengeance, and I will not meet <I>thee as</I> a man.
 &nbsp; 4  <I>As for</I> our redeemer, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts <I>is</I> his name, the
 Holy One of Israel.
 &nbsp; 5  Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of
 the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of
 kingdoms.
 &nbsp; 6  I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance,
 and given them into thine hand: thou didst show them no mercy;
 upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses God by the prophet sends a messenger even to Babylon, 
 like that of Jonah to Nineveh: "The time is at hand when Babylon shall 
 be destroyed." Fair warning is thus given her, that she may by 
 repentance prevent the ruin and there may be a lengthening of her 
 tranquility. We may observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God's controversy with Babylon. We will begin with that, for there 
 all the calamity begins; she has made God her enemy, and then who can 
 befriend her: Let her know that the righteous Judge, to whom vengeance 
 belongs, has said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 <I>I will take vengeance.</I> She has provoked God, and shall be 
 reckoned with for it when the measure of her iniquities is full. Woe to 
 those on whom God comes to take vengeance; for who knows the power of 
 his anger and what a fearful thing it is to fall into his hands? Were 
 it a man like ourselves who would be revenged on us, we might hope to 
 be a match for him, either to make our escape from him or to make our 
 part good with him. But he says, "<I>I will not meet thee as a man,</I> 
 not with the compassions of a man, but I will be to the as a lion, and 
 a <I>young lion</I>" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:14">Hos. v. 14</A>);

 or, rather, not with the strength of a man, which is easily resisted,
 but with the power of a God, which cannot be resisted. Not with the
 justice of a man, which may be bribed, or biassed, or mollified by a
 foolish pity, but with the justice of a God, which is strict and
 severe, and can never be evaded. As in pardoning the penitent, so in
 punishing the impenitent, he is <I>God and not man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:9">Hos. xi. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The particular ground of this controversy. We are sure that there 
 is cause for it, and it is a just cause; it is the <I>vengeance of his 
 temple</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:28">Jer. l. 28</A>);

 it is for <I>violence done to Zion,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:35">Jer. li. 35</A>.

 God will plead his people's cause against them. It is acknowledged

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 that God had, in wrath, delivered his people into the hands of the 
 Babylonians, had made use of them for the correction of his children, 
 and had by their means <I>polluted his inheritance,</I> had left his 
 peculiar people exposed to suffer in common with the rest of the 
 nations, had suffered the heathen, who should have been kept at a 
 distance, to <I>come into his sanctuary</I> and <I>defile his 
 temple,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:1">Ps. lxxix. 1</A>.

 Herein God was righteous; but the Babylonians carried the matter too
 far, and, when they had them in their hands (triumphing to see a people 
 that had been so much in reputation for wisdom, holiness, and honour, 
 brought thus low), with a base and servile spirit they trampled upon 
 them, <I>and showed them no mercy,</I> no, not the common instances of 
 humanity which the miserable are entitled to purely by their misery. 
 They used them barbarously, and with an air of contempt, nay, and of 
 complacency in their calamities. They were brought under the yoke;
 but, as if that were not enough, they <I>laid the yoke on very 
 heavily,</I> adding affliction to the afflicted. Nay, they laid it 
 <I>on the ancient</I>--the elders in years, who were past their labour, 
 and must sink under a yoke which those in their youthful strength would 
 easily bear--the elders in office, those that had been judges and 
 magistrates, and persons of the first rank. They took a pride in
 putting these to the meanest hardest drudgery. Jeremiah laments this,
 that the <I>faces of elders were not honoured,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:12">Lam. v. 12</A>.

 Nothing brings a surer or a sorer ruin upon any people than cruelty,
 especially to God's Israel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The terror of this controversy. She has reason to tremble when she 
 is told who it is that has this quarrel with her 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>As for our Redeemer,</I> our <I>Go&euml;l,</I> that undertakes to 
 plead our cause as the avenger of our blood, he has two names which 
 speak not only comfort to us, but terror to our adversaries." 

 1. "He is <I>the Lord of hosts,</I> that has all the creatures at his
 command, and therefore has <I>all power both in heaven and in 
 earth.</I>" Woe to those against whom the Lord fights, for the whole 
 creation is at war with them. 

 2. "He is the <I>Holy One of Israel,</I> a God in covenant with us,
 who has his residence among us, and will faithfully perform all the 
 promises he has made to us." God's power and holiness are engaged 
 against Babylon and for Zion. This may fitly be applied to Christ, our 
 great Redeemer. He is both Lord of hosts and the Holy One of 
 Israel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The consequences of it to Babylon. She is called a <I>virgin,</I> 
 because so she thought herself, though she was the mother of harlots. 
 She was beautiful as a virgin, and courted by all about her; she had 
 been called <I>tender and delicate</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 and <I>the lady of kingdoms</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>);

 but now the case is altered. 

 1. Her honour is gone, and she must bid farewell to all her dignity.
 She that had sat at the upper end of the world, sat in state and sat at 
 ease, must now <I>come down and sit in the dust,</I> as very mean and a 
 deep mourner, must <I>sit on the ground,</I> for she shall be so 
 emptied and impoverished that she shall not have a seat left her to sit 
 upon. 

 2. Her power is gone, and she must bid farewell to all her dominion.
 She shall rule no more as she has done, nor give law as she has done to 
 her neighbours: <I>There is no throne,</I> none for thee, <I>O daughter 
 of the Chaldeans!</I> Note, Those that abuse their honour or power 
 provoke God to deprive them of it, and to make them <I>come down and 
 sit in the dust.</I> 

 3. Her ease and pleasure are gone: "She shall <I>no more be called
 tender and delicate</I> as she has been, for she shall not only be 
 deprived of all those things with which she pampered herself, but shall 
 be put to hard service and made to feel both want and pain, which will 
 be more than doubly grievous to her who formerly <I>would not venture 
 to set</I> so much as <I>the sole of her foot to the ground for 
 tenderness and for delicacy,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:56">Deut. xxviii. 56</A>.

 It is our wisdom not to use ourselves to be tender and delicate,
 because we know not how hardly others may use us before we die not what 
 straits we may be reduced to.

 4. Her liberty is gone, and she is brought into a state of servitude 
 and as sore a bondage as she in her prosperity had brought others to.
 Even the great men of Babylon must now receive the same law from the 
 conquerors that they used to give to the conquered: "<I>Take the 
 mill-stones and grind meal</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 set to work, to hard labour" (like beating hemp in Bridewell), "which 
 will make thee sweat so that thou must throw off all thy head-dresses, 
 and <I>uncover thy locks.</I>" When they were driven from one place to 
 another, at the capricious humours of their masters, they must be 
 forced to wade up to the middle through the waters, to <I>make bare the 
 leg</I> and <I>uncover the thigh,</I> that they might <I>pass over the 
 rivers,</I> which would be a great mortification to those that used to 
 ride in state. But let them not complain, for just thus they had 
 formerly used their captives; and <I>with what measure they</I> then 
 <I>meted</I> it is now <I>measured to them again.</I> Let those that 
 have power use it with temper and moderation, considering that the 
 spoke which is uppermost will be under. 

 5. All her glory, and all her glorying, are gone. Instead of glory, she
 has ignominy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Thy nakedness shall be uncovered and thy shame shall be seen,</I> 
 according to the base and barbarous usage they commonly gave their 
 captives, to whom, for covetousness of their clothes, they did not 
 leave rags sufficient to cover their nakedness, so void were they of 
 the modesty as well as of the pity due to the human nature. Instead of 
 glorying she <I>sits silently, and gets into darkness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),
 
 ashamed to show her face, for she has quite lost her credit and 
 <I>shall no more be called the lady of kingdoms.</I> Note, God can make 
 those sit silently that used to make the greatest noise in the world, 
 and send those into darkness that used to make the greatest figure.
 Let him that glories, therefore, glory in a God that changes not, and 
 not in any worldly wealth, pleasure, or honour, which are subject to 
 change.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: <I>so</I> that thou
 didst not lay these <I>things</I> to thy heart, neither didst remember
 the latter end of it.
 &nbsp; 8  Therefore hear now this, <I>thou that art</I> given to pleasures,
 that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I <I>am,</I> and
 none else beside me; I shall not sit <I>as</I> a widow, neither shall
 I know the loss of children:
 &nbsp; 9  But these two <I>things</I> shall come to thee in a moment in one
 day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon
 thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries,
 <I>and</I> for the great abundance of thine enchantments.
 &nbsp; 10  For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said,
 None seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted
 thee; and thou hast said in thine heart, I <I>am,</I> and none else
 beside me.
 &nbsp; 11  Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know
 from whence it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou
 shalt not be able to put it off: and desolation shall come upon
 thee suddenly, <I>which</I> thou shalt not know.
 &nbsp; 12  Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of
 thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so
 be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail.
 &nbsp; 13  Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now
 the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators,
 stand up, and save thee from <I>these things</I> that shall come upon
 thee.
 &nbsp; 14  Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them;
 they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame:
 <I>there shall</I> not <I>be</I> a coal to warm at, <I>nor</I> fire to sit
 before it.
 &nbsp; 15  Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured,
 <I>even</I> thy merchants, from thy youth: they shall wander every one
 to his quarter; none shall save thee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Babylon, now doomed to ruin, is here justly upbraided with her pride, 
 luxury, and security, in the day of her prosperity, and the confidence 
 she had in her own wisdom and forecast, and particularly in the 
 prognostications and counsels of the astrologers. These things are 
 mentioned both to justify God in bringing these judgments upon her and 
 to mortify her, and put her to so much the greater shame, under these 
 judgments; for, when God comes forth to take vengeance, glory belongs 
 to him, but confusion to the sinner.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The Babylonians are here upbraided with their pride and haughtiness, 
 and the great conceit they had of themselves, because of their wealth 
 and power, and the vast extent of their dominion; it was the language 
 both of the government and of the body of the people: <I>Thou sayest in 
 thy heart</I> (and God, who searches all hearts, can tell men what they 
 say there, though they never speak it out) <I>I am, and none else 
 besides me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:8,10"><I>v.</I> 8, 10</A>.

 The repetition of this part of the charge intimates that they said it 
 often, and that it was very offensive to God. It is the very word that 
 God has often said concerning himself, <I>I am, and none else besides 
 me,</I> denoting his self-existence, his infinite and incomparable 
 perfections, and his sole supremacy. All this Babylon pretends to; and
 no wonder if she that assumed a power to make what gods and goddesses 
 she pleased for the people to worship made herself one among the rest. 
 It is presumption to say of any creature, "It is, and there is not its 
 like, there is none besides it" (for creatures stand very nearly upon a 
 level with one another); but it is insufferable arrogance for any to 
 say so of themselves, and an evidence of their self-ignorance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They are upbraided with their luxury and love of ease 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):
 
 "<I>Thou that art given to pleasures,</I> art a slave to them, art in 
 them as in thy element, and, that thou mayest enjoy them without 
 disturbance or interruption, <I>dwellest carelessly</I> and layest 
 nothing to heart." Great wealth and plenty are great temptations to 
 sensuality, and, where there is fulness of bread, there is commonly 
 abundance of idleness. But if those that are given to pleasures, and 
 dwell carelessly, would but hear this, that <I>for all these things God 
 will bring them into judgment,</I> it would be a damp to their mirth, 
 an allay to their pleasure, and would find them something to be in care 
 about.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They are upbraided with their carnal security and their vain 
 confidence of the perpetuity of their pomps and pleasures. This is much 
 insisted on here. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The cause of their security. They thought themselves safe and out of 
 danger, not because they were ignorant of the uncertainty of all 
 earthly enjoyments and the inevitable fate that attends states and 
 kingdoms as well as particular persons, but <I>because they did not lay 
 this to heart,</I> did not apply it to themselves, nor give it a due 
 consideration. They lulled themselves asleep in ease and pleasure, and 
 dreamt of nothing else but that <I>to-morrow should be as this day, and 
 much more abundant.</I> They did not <I>remember the latter end of 
 it</I>--the latter end of their prosperity, that it is a fading flower,
 and will wither--the latter end of their iniquity, that it will be
 bitterness, that they day will come when their injustice and oppression 
 must be reckoned for and punished. <I>She did not remember her latter 
 end</I> (so some read it); she forgot that her day would come to fall 
 and what would be in the end hereof. It was the ruin of Jerusalem 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+1:9">Lam. i. 9</A>)

 that <I>she remembered not her last end, therefore she came down
 wonderfully;</I> and it was Babylon's ruin too. The children of men are 
 easy, and think themselves safe, in their sinful ways, only because 
 they never think of death, and judgment, and their future state.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The ground of their security. They trusted in their wickedness and 
 in their wisdom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 (1.) Their power and wealth, which they had gotten by fraud and 
 oppression, were their confidence: <I>Thou hast trusted in thy 
 wickedness,</I> As Doeg. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+52:7">Ps. lii. 7</A>.

 Many have so debauched their own consciences, and have got to such a
 pitch of daring wickedness, that they stick at nothing; and this they 
 trust to carry them through those difficulties which embarrass men who 
 make conscience of what they say and do. They doubt not but they shall
 be too hard for all their enemies, because they dare lie, and kill, and 
 forswear themselves, and do any thing for their interest. Thus they 
 trust in their wickedness to secure them, which is the only thing that 
 will ruin them.

 (2.) Their policy and craft, which they called their <I>wisdom,</I> 
 were their confidence. They thought they could outwit all mankind, and 
 therefore might set all their enemies at defiance. But their <I>wisdom 
 and knowledge perverted them,</I> and turned them out of the way, made 
 them forget themselves, and the preparation necessary to be made for 
 hereafter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The expressions of their security. Three things this proud and 
 haughty monarchy said, in her security:--

 (1.) "<I>I shall be a lady for ever,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 She looked upon the patent of her honour to be not merely during the 
 pleasure of the sovereign Lord, the fountain of honour, or during her 
 own good behaviour, but to be perpetual to the present generation and 
 their heirs and successors for ever. She was not only proud that she 
 was a lady, but confident that she should be a lady for ever. Thus the 
 New-Testament Babylon says, <I>I sit as a queen, and shall see no 
 sorrow,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:7">Rev. xviii. 7</A>.

 Those ladies mistake themselves, and consider not their latter end, who
 think they shall be ladies for ever; for death will shortly lay their 
 honour with them in the dust. Saints will be saints for ever, but
 lords and ladies will not be so for ever.

 (2.) "<I>I shall not sit as a widow,</I> in solitude and sorrow, shall 
 never lose the power and wealth I am thus wedded to; the monarchy shall 
 never want a monarch to espouse and protect it, and be a husband to the 
 state; <I>nor shall I know the loss of children,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 She was as confident of the continuance of the numbers of her people as 
 of the dignity of her prince, and had no fear of being either deposed 
 or depopulated. Those that are in the height of prosperity are apt to 
 fancy themselves out of the reach of adverse fate. 

 (3.) "<I>No one sees me</I> when I do amiss, and therefore there will 
 be none to call me to an account,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 It is common for sinners to promise themselves impunity, because they 
 promise themselves secrecy, in their wicked ways. They trust to their 
 wicked arts and designs to stand them in stead, because they think they 
 have carried them on so plausibly that none can discern the wickedness 
 and deceit of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The punishment of their security. It shall be their ruin; and it
 will be,

 (1.) A complete ruin, the ruin of all their comforts and confidences:
 "<I>These two things shall come upon thee</I> (the very two things that 
 thou didst set at defiance), <I>loss of children and widowhood,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Both thy princes and thy people shall be cut off, so that thou shalt be 
 no more a government, no more a nation." Note, God often brings upon 
 secure sinners those very mischiefs which they least feared and thought 
 themselves in least danger of. "<I>They shall come upon thee in their 
 perfection,</I> with all their aggravating circumstances and without 
 any thing to allay or mitigate them." Afflictions to God's children are 
 not afflictions in perfection. Widowhood is not to them a calamity in 
 perfection, for they have this to comfort themselves with, that their 
 Maker is their husband; loss of children is not, for he is better to 
 them than ten sons. But on his enemies they come in perfection.
 Widowhood and loss of children are either of them great griefs, but 
 both together great indeed. Naomi thinks she may well be called 
 <I>Marah</I> when she is <I>left both of her sons and of her 
 husband</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:5">Ruth i. 5</A>);

 and yet on her these evils did not come in perfection, for she had two
 daughters-in-law left, that were comforts to her. But on Babylon they 
 come in perfection; she has no comfort remaining.

 (2.) It will be a sudden and surprising ruin. The evil shall come <I>in 
 one day,</I> nay, <I>in a moment,</I> which will make it much the more 
 terrible, especially to those that were so very secure. "<I>Evil shall
 come upon thee</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)

 and thou shalt have neither time nor way to provide against it, or to 
 prepare for it; for <I>thou shalt not know whence it rises,</I> and 
 therefore shalt not know where to stand upon thy guard." <I>Thou shalt 
 not know the morning thereof;</I> so the Hebrew phrase is. We know just 
 when and where the day will break and the sun rise, but we know not 
 what the day, when it comes, will bring forth, nor when or where 
 trouble will arise; perhaps the storm may come from that point of the 
 compass which we little thought of. Babylon pretended to great wisdom 
 and knowledge 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 but with all her knowledge she cannot foresee, nor with all her wisdom 
 prevent, the ruin threatened: "<I>Desolation shall come upon thee 
 suddenly,</I> as a thief in the night, <I>which thou shalt not 
 know,</I> that is, which thou little thoughtest of." Fair warning was 
 indeed given them, by Isaiah and other prophets of the Lord, of this 
 desolation; but they slighted that notice, and would give no credit to 
 it, and therefore justly is it so ordered that they should have no 
 other notice of it, but that partly through their own security, and 
 partly through the swiftness and subtlety of the enemy, when it came it 
 should be a perfect surprise to them. Those that slight the warnings of 
 the written word, let them not expect any other premonitions. 

 (3.) It will be an irresistible ruin, and such as they will have no 
 fence against: "<I>Mischief shall come upon thee</I> so suddenly that 
 thou shalt have no time to turn thee in, so strongly that thou shalt 
 not be able to make head against it and to put it off and save 
 thyself." There is no opposing the judgments of God when they come with 
 commission. Babylon herself, with all her wealth, and power, and
 multitude, is not able to put off the mischief that comes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. They are upbraided with their divinations, their magical and 
 astrological arts and sciences, which the Chaldeans, above any other 
 nation, were notorious for, and from them other nations borrowed all 
 their learning of that kind.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. This is here spoken of as one of their provoking sins, which would 
 bring the judgments of God upon them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 "These evils shall come upon thee to punish thee <I>for the multitude 
 of thy sorceries, and the great abundance of thy enchantments.</I>" 
 Witchcraft is a sin in its own nature exceedingly heinous; it is giving 
 that honour to the devil which is due to God only, making God's enemy 
 our guide and the father of lies our oracle. In Babylon it was a 
 national sin, and had the protection and countenance of the government; 
 conjurors, for aught that appears, were their privy counsellors and 
 prime ministers of state. And shall not God visit for these things? 
 Observe what a multitude, what a great abundance, of sorceries and 
 enchantments there were among them. Such a bewitching sin this was
 that when it was once admitted it spread like wildfire, and they never 
 knew any end of it; the deceived and the deceivers both increased 
 strangely.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It is here spoken of as one of their vain confidences, which they 
 relied much upon, but should be deceived in, for it would not serve so 
 much as to give them notice of the judgments coming, much less to guard 
 against them. 

 (1.) They are here upbraided with the mighty pains they had taken about 
 their sorceries and enchantments: Thou hast <I>laboured in them from 
 thy youth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 They trained up their young men in these studies, and those that 
 applied themselves to them were indefatigable in their labours about 
 them--reading books, making observations, trying experiments. Well, let 
 them stand up now with their enchantments, and try their skill in the 
 critical moment. Let them make a stand, if they can, in opposition to 
 the invading enemy; let them stand to offer their service to their 
 country; but to what purpose? "<I>Thou art wearied in the multitude of 
 thy counsels</I> of this kind

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 thou hast advised with them all, but hast received no satisfaction from 
 them; the different schemes they have erected, and the different 
 judgments they have given, have but increased thy perplexity and tired 
 thee out." In the multitude of such counsellors there is no safety. 
 
 (2.) They are upbraided with the variety they had of such kinds of
 people among them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 They had their <I>astrologers,</I> or viewers of the heavens, that did 
 not consider them, as David, to behold the wisdom and power of God in 
 them; but, under pretence of foretelling future events by them, they 
 viewed the heavens and forgot him that made them and set <I>their 
 dominion on the earth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:33">Job xxxviii. 33</A>),

 and has himself dominion over them, for he rides on the heavens. They
 had their <I>star-gazers,</I> who by the motions of the stars, their 
 conjunctions and oppositions, read the doom of states and kingdoms. 
 They had their <I>monthly prognosticators,</I> their almanac-makers, 
 that told what weather it should be or what news they should have each 
 month. The great stock they had of these was what they valued 
 themselves much upon; but they were all cheats, and their art was a 
 sham. I confess I see not how the judicial astrology which some now 
 pretend to, by the rules of which they undertake to prophecy concerning 
 things to come, can be distinguished from that of the Chaldeans, nor 
 therefore how it can escape the censure and contempt which this text 
 lays that under; yet I fear there are some who study their almanacs, 
 and regard them and their prognostications, more than their Bibles and 
 the prophecies there.

 (3.) They are upbraided with the utter inability and insufficiency of 
 all these pretenders to do them any kindness in the day of their 
 distress. Let them see whether with the help of their enchantments
 they can prevail against their enemies, or profit themselves, inspirit 
 their own forces or dispirit those that come against them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Let them see what service those can do them who make a trade of 
 divination: "<I>Let them stand up,</I> and either by their power save 
 thee from these evils that are coming upon thee or by their foresight 
 make such a discovery of them beforehand that thou mayest by needful 
 precautions save thyself;" as Elisha, by notifying to the king of 
 Israel the motions of the Syrian army, enabled him to <I>save himself, 
 not once nor twice,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+6:10">2 Kings vi. 10</A>.

 This baffling of the diviners was literally fulfilled when, the night
 that Babylon was taken and Belshazzar slain, all his astrologers, 
 soothsayers, and wise men, were quite nonplussed with the handwriting 
 on the wall that pronounced the fatal sentence,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:8">Dan. v. 8</A>.

 (4.) They are upbraided with the fall of the wise men themselves in the 
 common ruin,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Those are unlikely to stand their friends in any stead who cannot 
 secure themselves; they are as stubble at the best, worthless and 
 useless, and <I>they shall be as stubble</I> before a consuming fire. 
 The Persians, to make room for their own wise men, will cut off those 
 of Babylon; that <I>fire shall burn them,</I> and <I>they shall not 
 deliver themselves from the power of the flame.</I> Those can expect no 
 other than to be devoured by their sins make themselves fuel to a 
 devouring fire. When God kindles a fire among them it <I>shall not be a 
 coal to warm at,</I> and <I>a fire to sit before,</I> but a coal to 
 burn them. Or, rather, it denotes that they shall be utterly consumed
 by the judgments of God, burnt quite to ashes, and there shall not 
 remain one live coal to do any body any service; for <I>when God judges 
 he will overcome.</I> 

 (5.) They are upbraided with their merchants, and those they dealt with

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 such as they dealt with from their youth, either,

 [1.] In a way of consultation. These astrologers, that dealt in the 
 black art, they always loved to be dealing with, and they were in 
 effect their merchants; fortune-telling was one of the best trades in 
 Babylon, and those that followed that trade probably lived as 
 splendidly and got as much money as the richest merchants; yet, when 
 some of them were devoured, others fled their country, <I>every one to 
 his quarter,</I> and there was none to save Babylon. Miserable
 comforters are they all. Or,

 [2.] In a way of commerce. As their astrologers, with whom they had 
 laboured, failed them, so did their merchants; they took care to secure 
 their own effects, and then valued not what became of Babylon. They 
 <I>wandered every one to his own quarter;</I> each man shifted for his 
 own safety, but none would offer to lend a helping hand, no, not to a 
 city by which they had got so much money. Every one was for himself, 
 but few for his friends. The New-Testament Babylon is lamented by the 
 merchants that were made rich by her, but they very prudently stand 
 afar off to lament her 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:15">Rev. xviii. 15</A>),

 not willing to attempt any thing for her succour. Happy are those who
 by faith and prayer deal with one that will be a <I>very present help 
 in time of trouble!</I></P>
