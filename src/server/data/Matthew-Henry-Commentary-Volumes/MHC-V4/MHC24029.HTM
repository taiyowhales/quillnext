 The contest between Jeremiah and the false prophets was carried on 
 before by preaching, here by writing; there we had sermon against 
 sermon, here we have letter against letter, for some of the false 
 prophets are now carried away into captivity in Babylon, while Jeremiah 
 remains in his own country. Now here is, 

 I. A letter which Jeremiah wrote to the captives in Babylon, against
 their prophets that they had there 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>),

 in which letter,

 1. He endeavours to reconcile them to their captivity, to be easy under
 it and to make the best of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:4-7">ver. 4-7</A>.

 2. He cautions them not to give any credit to their false prophets, who
 fed them with hopes of a speedy release, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:8,9">ver. 8, 9</A>.

 3. He assures them that God would restore them in mercy to their own
 land again, at the end of 70 years, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:10-14">ver. 10-14</A>.

 4. He foretels the destruction of those who yet continued, and that 
 they should be persecuted with one judgment after another, and sent at 
 last into captivity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:15-19">ver. 15-19</A>.

 5. He prophesies the destruction of two of their false prophets that
 they had in Babylon, that both soothed them up in their sins and set 
 them bad examples 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:20-23">ver. 20-23</A>),

 and this is the purport of Jeremiah's letter.

 II. Here is a letter which Shemaiah, a false prophet in Babylon, wrote
 to the priests at Jerusalem, to stir them up to persecute Jeremiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:24-29">ver. 24-29</A>),

 and a denunciation of God's wrath against him for writing such a letter,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:30-32">ver. 30-32</A>.

 Such struggles as these have there always been between the seed of the 
 woman and the seed of the serpent.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now these <I>are</I> the words of the letter that Jeremiah the
 prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which
 were carried away captives, and to the priests, and to the
 prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried
 away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon;
 &nbsp; 2  (After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the
 eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters,
 and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;)
 &nbsp; 3  By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the
 son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to
 Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying,
 &nbsp; 4  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all
 that are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried
 away from Jerusalem unto Babylon;
 &nbsp; 5  Build ye houses, and dwell <I>in them;</I> and plant gardens, and
 eat the fruit of them;
 &nbsp; 6  Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives
 for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may
 bear sons and daughters; that ye may be increased there, and not
 diminished.
 &nbsp; 7  And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to
 be carried away captives, and pray unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> for it: for in
 the peace thereof shall ye have peace.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That Jeremiah wrote to the captives in Babylon, in the name of the 
 Lord. Jeconiah had surrendered himself a prisoner, with the queen his 
 mother, the chamberlains of his household, called here the 
 <I>eunuchs,</I> and many of <I>the princes of Judah and Jerusalem,</I> 
 who were at that time the most active men; <I>the carpenters and 
 smiths</I> likewise, being demanded, were yielded up, that those who 
 remained might not have any proper hands to fortify their city or 
 furnish themselves with weapons of war. By this tame submission it was 
 hoped that Nebuchadnezzar would be pacified. <I>Satis est prostrasse 
 leoni--It suffices the lion to have laid his antagonist prostrate;</I>
 but the imperious conqueror grows upon their concessions, like Benhadad 
 upon Ahab's, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:5,6">1 Kings xx. 5, 6</A>.

 And, not content with this, when these had <I>departed from 
 Jerusalem</I> he comes again, and fetches away many more of <I>the 
 elders, the priests, the prophets, and the people</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 such as he thought fit, or such as his soldiers could lay hands on, and 
 carries them to Babylon. The case of these captives was very 
 melancholy, the rather because they, being thus distinguished from the 
 rest of their brethren who continued in their own land, looked as if 
 they were greater sinners than all men who dwelt at Jerusalem. Jeremiah 
 therefore writes a letter to them, to comfort them, assuring them that 
 they had no reason either to despair of succour themselves or to envy 
 their brethren that were left behind. Note, 

 1. The word of God written is as truly given by <I>inspiration of
 God</I> as his word spoken was; and this was the proper way of
 spreading the knowledge of God's will among his <I>children scattered
 abroad.</I> 

 2. We may serve God and do good by writing to our friends at a distance
 pious letters of seasonable comforts and wholesome counsels. Those whom 
 we cannot speak to we may write to; that which is written remains. This 
 letter of Jeremiah's was sent to the captives in Babylon by the hands 
 of the ambassadors whom king Zedekiah sent to Nebuchadnezzar, probably 
 to pay him his tribute and renew his submission to him, or to treat of 
 peace with him, in which treaty the captives might perhaps hope that 
 they should be included,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 By such messengers Jeremiah chose to send this message, to put an 
 honour upon it, because it was a message from God, or perhaps because 
 there was no settled way of sending letters to Babylon, but as such an 
 occasion as this offered, and then it made the condition of the 
 captives there the more melancholy, that they could rarely hear from 
 their friends and relations they had left behind, which is some 
 reviving and satisfaction to those that are separated from one 
 another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We are here told what he wrote. A copy of the letter at large 
 follows here to 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.
 
 In these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He assures them that he wrote in the name of the <I>Lord of hosts, 
 the God of Israel,</I> who indited the letter; Jeremiah was but the 
 scribe or amanuensis. It would be comfortable to them, in their 
 captivity, to hear that God is <I>the Lord of hosts,</I> of all hosts, 
 and is therefore able to help and deliver them; and that he is the 
 <I>God of Israel</I> still, a God in covenant with his people, though 
 he contend with them, and their enemies for the present are too hard 
 for them. This would likewise be an admonition to them to stand upon 
 their guard against all temptations to the idolatry of Babylon, because 
 the <I>God of Israel,</I> the God whom they served, is <I>Lord of 
 hosts.</I> God's sending to them in this letter might be an 
 encouragement to them in their captivity, as it was an evidence that he 
 had not cast them off, had not abandoned them and disinherited them, 
 though he was displeased with them and corrected them; for, if the Lord 
 had been pleased to kill them, he would not have written to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. God by him owns the hand he had in their captivity: <I>I have caused 
 you to be carried away,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:4"><I>v.</I> 4
 
 and again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 All the force of the king of Babylon could not have done it if God had 
 not ordered it; nor could he have any power against them but what was 
 given him from above. If God caused them to be carried captives, they
 might be sure that he neither did them any wrong nor meant them any 
 hurt. Note, It will help very much to reconcile us to our troubles, and 
 to make us patient under them, to consider that they are what God has 
 appointed us to. <I>I opened not my mouth, because thou didst 
 it.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He bids them think of nothing but settling there; and therefore let 
 them resolve to make the best of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>):

 <I>Build yourselves houses and dwell in them,</I> &c. By all this it is 
 intimated to them, 

 (1.) That they must not feed themselves with hopes of a speedy return 
 out of their captivity, for that would keep them still unsettled and 
 consequently uneasy; they would apply themselves to no business, take 
 no comfort, but be always tiring themselves and provoking their 
 conquerors with the expectations of relief; and their disappointment at 
 last would sink them into despair and make their condition much more 
 miserable than otherwise it would be. Let them therefore reckon upon a 
 continuance there, and accommodate themselves to it as well as they 
 can. Let them <I>build,</I> and <I>plant,</I> and <I>marry,</I> and 
 dispose of their children there as if they were at home in their own 
 land. Let them take a pleasure in seeing their families built up and 
 multiplied; for, though they must expect themselves to die in 
 captivity, yet their children may live to see better days. If they live 
 in the fear of God, what should hinder them but they may live 
 comfortably in Babylon? They cannot but <I>weep</I> sometimes <I>when 
 they remember Zion.</I> But let not weeping hinder sowing; let them not 
 <I>sorrow as those that have no hope,</I> no joy; for they have both.
 Note, In all conditions of life it is our wisdom and duty to make the 
 best of that which is, and not to throw away the comfort of what we may 
 have because we have not all we would have. We have a natural affection 
 for our native country; it strangely draws our minds; but it is with a 
 <I>nescio qua dulcedine--we can give no good account of the sweet 
 attraction;</I> and therefore, if providence remove us to some other 
 country, we must resolve to live easy there, to bring our mind to our 
 condition when our condition is not in every thing to our mind. If the 
 <I>earth be the Lord's,</I> then, wherever a child of God goes, he does 
 not go off his Father's ground. <I>Patria est ubicunque bene est--That 
 place is our country in which we are well off.</I> If things be not as 
 they have been, instead of fretting at that, we must live in hopes that 
 they will be better than they are. <I>Non si male nunc, et olim sic
 erit--Though we suffer now we shall not always.</I>

 (2.) That they must not disquiet themselves with fears of intolerable 
 hardships in their captivity. They might be ready to suggest (as 
 persons in trouble are always apt to make the worst of things) that it 
 would be in vain to build houses, for their lords and masters would not 
 suffer them to dwell in them when they had built them, nor to eat the 
 fruit of the vineyards they planted. "Never fear," says God; "if you 
 live peaceably with them, you shall find them civil to you." Meek and 
 quiet people, that work and mind their own business, have often found 
 much better treatment, even with strangers and enemies, than they 
 expected; and God has made his people to be <I>pitied of those that 
 carry them captives</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:46">Ps. cvi. 46</A>),

 and a pity it is but that those who have built houses should dwell in
 them. Nay,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He directs them to seek the good of the country where they were 
 captives 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 to pray for it, to endeavour to promote it. This forbids them to 
 attempt any thing against the public peace while they were subjects to 
 the king of Babylon. Though he was a heathen, an idolater, an 
 oppressor, and an enemy to God and his church, yet, while he gave them 
 protection, they must pay him allegiance, and live <I>quiet and 
 peaceable lives</I> under him, <I>in all godliness and honesty,</I> not 
 plotting to shake off his yoke, but patiently leaving it to God in due 
 time to work deliverance for them. Nay, they must pray to God for the 
 peace of the places where they were, that they might oblige them to 
 continue their kindness to them and disprove the character that had 
 been given their nation, that they were <I>hurtful to kings and 
 provinces,</I> and <I>moved sedition,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:15">Ezra iv. 15</A>.

 Both the wisdom of the serpent and the innocency of the dove required
 them to be true to the government they lived under: <I>For in the peace 
 thereof you shall have peace;</I> should the country be embroiled in 
 war, they would have the greatest share in the calamitous effects of 
 it. Thus the primitive Christians, according to the temper of their 
 holy religion, prayed for the powers that were, though they were 
 persecuting powers. And, if they were to pray for and seek the peace of 
 the land of their captivity, much more reason have we to pray for the 
 welfare of the land of our nativity, where we are a free people under a 
 good government, <I>that in the peace thereof</I> we and ours <I>may 
 have peace.</I> Every passenger is concerned in the safety of the 
 ship.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  For thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not
 your prophets and your diviners, that <I>be</I> in the midst of you,
 deceive you, neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be

 sent them, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 10  For thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, That after seventy years be
 accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good
 word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.
 &nbsp; 11  For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected
 end.
 &nbsp; 12  Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto
 me, and I will hearken unto you.
 &nbsp; 13  And ye shall seek me, and find <I>me,</I> when ye shall search

 &nbsp; 14  And I will be found of you, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and I will turn
 away your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations,
 and from all the places whither I have driven you, saith the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused
 you to be carried away captive.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 To make the people quiet and easy in their captivity,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God takes them off from building upon the false foundation which 
 their pretended prophets laid, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 They told them that their captivity should be short, and therefore that 
 they must not think of taking root in Babylon, but be upon the wing to 
 go back: "Now herein <I>they deceive you,</I>" says God; "they 
 <I>prophesy a lie to you,</I> though they prophesy <I>in my name.</I> 
 But <I>let them not deceive you,</I> suffer not yourselves to be 
 deluded by them." As long as we have the word of truth to try the 
 spirits by it is our own fault if we be deceived; for by it we may be 
 undeceived. <I>Hearken not to your dreams, which you cause to be 
 dreamed.</I> He means either the dreams or fancies which the people 
 pleased themselves with, and with which they filled their own heads (by 
 thinking and speaking of nothing else but a speedy enlargement when 
 they were awake they caused themselves to dream of it when they were 
 asleep, and then took that for a good omen, and with it strengthened 
 themselves in their vain expectations), or the dreams which the 
 prophets dreamed and grounded their prophecies upon. God tells the
 people, <I>They are your dreams,</I> because they pleased them, were 
 the dreams that they desired and wished for. They <I>caused them to be 
 dreamed;</I> for they hearkened to them, and encouraged the prophets to 
 put such deceits upon them, desiring them to prophesy nothing but 
 <I>smooth things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:10">Isa. xxx. 10</A>.

 They were dreams of their own bespeaking. False prophets would not
 flatter people in their sins, but that they love to be flattered, and 
 speak smoothly to their prophets that their prophets may speak smoothly 
 to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He gives them a good foundation to build their hopes upon. We would 
 not persuade people to pull down the house they have built upon the 
 sand, but that there is a rock ready for them to rebuild upon. God here 
 promises them that, though they should not return quickly, they should 
 return at length, <I>after seventy years be accomplished.</I> By this 
 it appears that the seventy years of the captivity are not to be 
 reckoned from the last captivity, but the first. Note, Though the 
 deliverance of the church do not come in our time, it is sufficient 
 that it will come in God's time, and we are sure that that is the best 
 time. The promise is that God will visit them in mercy; though he had 
 long seemed to be strange to them, he will come among them, and appear 
 for them, and put honour upon them, as great men do upon their 
 inferiors by coming to visit them. He will put an end to <I>their 
 captivity,</I> and <I>turn away</I> all the calamities of it. Though 
 they are dispersed, some in one country and some in another, he will 
 <I>gather them from all the places whither they are driven,</I> will 
 set up a standard for them all to resort to, and incorporate them again 
 in one body. And though they are at a great distance they shall be 
 brought again to their own land, <I>to the place whence</I> they were 
 <I>carried captive,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 
 Now, 

 1. This shall be the performance of God's promise to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>I will perform my good word towards you.</I> Let not the failing of 
 those predictions which are delivered as from God lessen the reputation 
 of those that really are from him. That which is indeed God's word is
 a <I>good word,</I> and therefore it will be made good, and not one 
 iota or tittle of it shall fall to the ground. <I>Hath he said, and 
 shall he not do it?</I> This will make their return out of captivity 
 very comfortable, that it will be the performance of God's good word to 
 them, the product of a gracious promise. 

 2. This shall be in pursuance of God's purposes concerning them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>I know the thoughts that I think towards you.</I> Known unto God are 
 all his works, for known unto him are all his thoughts 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:18">Acts xv. 18</A>)

 and his works agree exactly with his thoughts; he does all <I>according
 to the counsel of his will.</I> We often do not know our own thoughts, 
 nor know our own mind, but God is never at any uncertainty within 
 himself. We are sometimes ready to fear that God's designs concerning
 us are all against us; but he knows the contrary concerning his own 
 people, that they are <I>thoughts of good and not of evil;</I> even 
 that which seems evil is designed for good. His thoughts are all 
 working towards the expected end, which he will give in due time. The 
 end they expect will come, though perhaps not when they expect it. Let 
 them have patience till the fruit is ripe, and then they shall have it. 
 He will give them <I>an end, and expectation,</I> so it is in the 
 original.

 (1.) He will give them to see <I>the end</I> (the comfortable 
 termination) of their trouble; though it last long, it shall not last 
 always. The <I>time to favour Zion,</I> yea, the <I>set time, will 
 come.</I> When things are at the worst they will begin to mend; and he 
 will give them to see the glorious perfection of their deliverance; 
 for, as for God, his work is perfect. He that in the beginning finished 
 the <I>heavens and the earth,</I> and all the <I>hosts</I> of both, 
 will finish all the blessings of both to his people. When he begins in 
 ways of mercy he will <I>make an end.</I> God does nothing by halves.

 (2.) He will give them to see the <I>expectation,</I> that <I>end</I> 
 which they desire and hope for, and have been long waiting for. He will 
 give them, not the expectations of their fears, nor the expectations of 
 their fancies, but the expectations of their faith, the end which he 
 has promised and which will turn for the best to them. 

 3. This shall be in answer to their prayers and supplications to God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:12-15"><I>v.</I> 12-14</A>.

 (1.) God will stir them up to pray: <I>Then shall you call upon me,</I> 
 and <I>you shall go, and pray unto me.</I> Note, When God is about to 
 give his people the expected good he pours out a spirit of prayer, and 
 it is a good sign that he is coming towards them in mercy. Then, when 
 you see the <I>expected end</I> approaching, <I>then you shall call 
 upon me.</I> Note, Promises are given, not to supersede, but to quicken 
 and encourage prayer: and when deliverance is coming we must by prayer 
 go forth to meet it. When Daniel understood that the 70 years were near 
 expiring, then he <I>set his face</I> with more fervency than ever 
 <I>to seek the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:2,3">Dan. ix. 2, 3</A>.

 (2.) He will then stir up himself to come and save them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:2">Ps. lxxx. 2</A>):

 <I>I will hearken unto you,</I> and <I>I will be found of you.</I> God
 has said it, and we may depend upon it, <I>Seek and you shall find.</I> 
 We have a general rule laid down

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>You shall find me when you shall search for me with all your 
 heart.</I> In seeking God we must search for him, accomplish a diligent 
 search, search for directions in seeking him and encouragements to our 
 faith and hope. We must continue seeking, and take pains in seeking, as 
 those that search; and this we must do with our heart (that is, in 
 sincerity and uprightness), and with our whole heart (that is, with 
 vigour and fervency, putting forth <I>all that is within us</I> in 
 prayer), and those who thus <I>seek God</I> shall <I>find him,</I> and 
 shall find him their bountiful rewarder, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:6">Heb. xi. 6</A>.

 He never said to such, <I>Seek you me in vain.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  Because ye have said, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath raised us up prophets in
 Babylon;
 &nbsp; 16  <I>Know</I> that thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of the king that sitteth
 upon the throne of David, and of all the people that dwelleth in
 this city, <I>and</I> of your brethren that are not gone forth with
 you into captivity;
 &nbsp; 17  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them
 the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them
 like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.
 &nbsp; 18  And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine,
 and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to
 all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an
 astonishment, and a hissing, and a reproach, among all the
 nations whither I have driven them:
 &nbsp; 19  Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up
 early and sending <I>them;</I> but ye would not hear, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 20  Hear ye therefore the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, all ye of the
 captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon:
 &nbsp; 21  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the
 son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which
 prophesy a lie unto you in my name; Behold, I will deliver them
 into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall
 slay them before your eyes;
 &nbsp; 22  And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity
 of Judah which <I>are</I> in Babylon, saying, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> make thee like
 Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the
 fire;
 &nbsp; 23  Because they have committed villany in Israel, and have
 committed adultery with their neighbours' wives, and have spoken
 lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I
 know, and <I>am</I> a witness, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Jeremiah, having given great encouragement to those among the captives 
 whom he knew to be serious and well-affected, assuring them that God 
 had very kind and favourable intentions concerning them, here turns to 
 those among them who slighted the counsels and comforts that Jeremiah 
 ministered to them and depended upon what the false prophets flattered 
 them with. When this letter came from Jeremiah they would be ready to 
 say, "Why should he make himself so busy, and take upon him to advise 
 us? <I>The Lord has raised us up prophets in Babylon,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 We are satisfied with those prophets, and can depend upon them, and 
 have no occasion to hear from any prophets in Jerusalem." See the 
 impudent wickedness of this people; as the prophets, when they 
 prophesied lies, said that they had them from God, so the people, when 
 they invited those prophets thus to flatter them, fathered it upon God, 
 and said that it was the Lord that raised them up those prophets. 
 Whereas we may be sure that those who harden people in their sins, and 
 deceive them with false and groundless hopes of God's mercy, are no 
 prophets of God's raising up. These prophets of their own told them 
 that no more should be carried captive, but that those who were in 
 captivity should shortly return. Now, in answer to this,

 1. The prophet here foretells the utter destruction of those who
 remained still at Jerusalem, notwithstanding what those false prophets 
 said to the contrary: "As for the <I>king</I> and <I>people</I> that 
 <I>dwell in the city,</I> who, you think, will be ready to bid you 
 welcome when you return, you are deceived; they shall be followed with 
 one judgment after another, <I>sword, famine,</I> and 
 <I>pestilence,</I> which shall cut off multitudes; and the poor and 
 miserable remains shall be <I>removed into all kingdoms of the 
 earth,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:16,18"><I>v.</I> 16, 18</A>.

 And thus God <I>will make them,</I> or rather deal with them 
 accordingly, as the salt that has <I>lost its savour,</I> which, being 
 good for nothing, is cast to the dunghill, and so are rotten figs. This 
 refers to the vision and the prophecy upon it which we had

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+24:1-10"><I>ch.</I> xxiv.</A>

 And the reason given for these proceedings against them is the same
 that has often been given and will justify God in the eternal ruin of 
 impenitent sinners 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>Because they have not hearkened to my words. I called, but they 
 refused.</I> 

 2. He foretells the judgment of God upon the false prophets in Babylon, 
 who deceived the people of God there. He calls upon all the children of 
 the captivity, who boasted of them as prophets of God's raising up

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 "Stand still, and hear the doom of the prophets you are so fond of." 
 The two prophets are named here, <I>Ahab</I> and <I>Zedekiah,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 (1.) The crimes charged upon them--impiety and immorality: They 
 <I>prophesied lies in God's name</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),
 
 and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 They have <I>spoken lying words in my name.</I> Lying was bad, lying to 
 the people of God to delude them into a false hope was worse, but 
 fathering their lies upon the God of truth was worst of all. And no 
 marvel if those that had the face to do that could allow themselves in 
 the gratification of those vile affections to which God, in a way of 
 righteous judgment, <I>gave them up.</I> They have done <I>villainy in 
 Israel,</I> for <I>they have committed adultery with their neighbours' 
 wives.</I> Adultery is villainy in Israel, and in such as pretend to be 
 prophets, who by such wickednesses manifestly disprove their own 
 pretensions. God never sent such profligate wretches on his errands. He 
 is the <I>Lord God of the holy prophets,</I> not of such impure ones.
 Here it appears why they flattered others in their sins--because they 
 could not reprove them without condemning themselves. These lewd 
 practices of theirs they knew how to conceal from the eye of the world, 
 that they might preserve their credit; but <I>I know</I> it <I>and am a 
 witness, saith the Lord.</I> The most secret sins are known to God; he 
 can see the villainy that is covered with the thickest cloak of 
 hypocrisy, and there is a day coming when he will bring to light all 
 these hidden works of darkness and every man will appear in his own 
 colours. 

 (2.) The judgments threatened against them: <I>The king of Babylon 
 shall slay them before your eyes;</I> nay, he shall put them to a 
 miserable death, <I>roast them in the fire,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 We may suppose that it was not for their impiety and immorality that 
 Nebuchadnezzar punished them thus severely, but for sedition, and some 
 attempts of their turbulent spirits upon the public peace, and stirring 
 up the people to revolt and rebel. So much of their wickedness shall 
 then be detected, and in such a wretched manner they shall end their 
 days, that their names shall be a curse among the captives in Babylon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 When men would imprecate the greatest evil upon one they hated they 
 would think they could not load them with a heavier curse, in fewer 
 words, than to say, <I>The Lord make thee like Zedekiah and like 
 Ahab.</I> Thus were they made ashamed of the prophets they had been 
 proud of, and convinced at last of their folly in hearkening to them.
 God's faithful prophets were sometimes charged with being the troublers 
 of the land, and as such were tortured and slain; but their names were 
 a blessing when they were gone and their memory sweet, not as these 
 false prophets. As malefactors are attended with infamy and disgrace, 
 so martyrs with glory and honour.</P>

 Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have perused the contents of Jeremiah's letter to the captives in 
 Babylon, who had reason, with a great deal of thanks to God and him, to 
 acknowledge the receipt of it, and lay it up among their treasures. But 
 we cannot wonder if the false prophets they had among them were enraged 
 at it; for it gave them their true character. Now here we are told 
 concerning one of them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How he manifested his malice against Jeremiah. This busy fellow is
 called <I>Shemaiah the Nehelamite,</I> the <I>dreamer</I> (so the 
 margin reads it), because all his prophecies he pretended to have 
 received from God in a dream. He had got a copy of Jeremiah's letter to 
 the captives, or had heard it read, or information was given to him 
 concerning it, and it nettled him exceedingly; and he will take pen in 
 hand, and answer it, yea, that he will. But how? He does not write to 
 Jeremiah in justification of his own mission, nor offer any rational 
 arguments for the support of his prophecies concerning the speedy 
 return of the captives; but he writes to the priests, those faithful 
 patrons of the false prophets, and instigates them to persecute 
 Jeremiah. He writes in his own name, not so much as pretending to have
 the people's consent to it; but, as if he must be dictator to all 
 mankind, he sends a circular letter (as it should seem) among the 
 priests at Jerusalem and the rest of the people, probably by the same 
 messengers that brought the letter from Jeremiah. But it is chiefly 
 directed to Zephaniah, who was either the immediate son of Maaseiah, or 
 of the 24th course of the priests, of which Maaseiah was the father and 
 head. He was not the high priest, but sagan or suffragan to the high 
 priest, or in some other considerable post of command in the temple, as 
 Pashur, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+20:1"><I>ch.</I> xx. 1</A>.

 Perhaps he was chairman of that committee of priests that was appointed
 in a particular manner to take cognizance of those that pretended to be 
 prophets, of which there were very many at this time, and to give 
 judgment concerning them. Now, 

 1. He puts him and the other priests in mind of the duty of their place

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>The Lord hath made thee priest instead of Jehoiada the priest.</I> 
 Some think that he refers to the famous Jehoiada, that great reformer 
 in the days of Joash; and (says Mr. Gataker) he would insinuate that 
 this Zephaniah is for spirit and zeal such another as he, and raised 
 up, as he was, for the glory of God and the good of the church; and 
 therefore it was expected from him that he should proceed against 
 Jeremiah. Thus (says he) there is no act so injurious or impious, but 
 that wicked wretches and false prophets will not only attempt it, but 
 colour it also with some specious pretence of piety and zeal for God's 
 glory, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:6,Joh+16:2">Isa. lxvi. 5; John xvi. 2</A>.

 Or, rather, it was some other Jehoiada, his immediate predecessor in
 this office, who perhaps was carried to Babylon among the priests,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Zephaniah is advanced, sooner than he expected, to this place of trust 
 and power, and Shemaiah would have him think that Providence had 
 preferred him that he might persecute God's prophets, that he had come 
 to this government for such a time as this, and that he was unjust and 
 ungrateful if he did not thus improve his power, or, rather, abuse it.
 Their hearts are wretchedly hardened who can justify the doing of 
 mischief by their having a power to do it. These priests' business was
 to examine <I>every man that is mad and makes himself a prophet.</I> 
 God's faithful prophets are here represented as prophets of their own 
 making, usurpers of the office, and lay-intruders, as men that were 
 mad, actuated by some demon, and not divinely inspired, or as 
 distracted men and men in a frenzy. Thus the characters of the false 
 prophets are thrown upon the true ones; and, if this had been indeed 
 their character, they would have deserved to be bound as madmen and
 punished as pretenders, and therefore he concludes that Jeremiah must 
 be so treated. He does not bid them examine whether Jeremiah could 
 produce any proofs of his mission and could make it to appear that he 
 was not mad. No; that is taken for granted, and, when once he has had a 
 bad name given him, he must be run down of course. 

 2. He informs them of the letter which Jeremiah had written to the 
 captives

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 <I>He sent unto us in Babylon,</I> with the authority of a prophet, 
 saying, <I>This captivity is long,</I> and therefore resolve to make 
 the best of it. And what harm was there in this, that it should be 
 objected to him as a crime? The false prophets had formerly said that 
 the captivity would never come,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:3"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 13</A>.

 Jeremiah had said that it would come, and the event had already proved
 him in the right, which obliged them to give credit to him who now said 
 that it would be long, rather than to those who said that it would be 
 short, but had once before been found liars. 

 3. He demands judgment against him, taking it for granted that he is
 <I>mad,</I> and <I>makes himself a prophet.</I> He expects that they 
 will order him to be put <I>in prison</I> and <I>in the stocks</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 that they will thus punish him, and by putting him to disgrace possess 
 the people with prejudices against him, ruin his reputation, and so 
 prevent the giving of any credit to his prophecies at Jerusalem, hoping 
 that, if they could gain that point, the captives in Babylon would not 
 be influenced by him. Nay, he takes upon him to chide Zephaniah for his 
 neglect 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>Why hast thou not rebuked and restrained Jeremiah of Anathoth?</I> 
 See how insolent and imperious these false prophets had grown, that, 
 though they were in captivity, they would give law to the priests who 
 were not only at liberty, but in power. It is common for those that 
 pretend to more knowledge than their neighbours to be thus assuming. 
 Now here is a remarkable instance of the hardness of the hearts of 
 sinners, and it is enough to make us all fear <I>lest our hearts be at 
 any time hardened.</I> For here we find, 

 (1.) That these sinners would not be convinced by the clearest 
 evidence. God had confirmed his word in the mouth of Jeremiah; it had 
 <I>taken hold</I> of them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:6">Zech. i. 6</A>);
 
 and yet, because he does not prophesy to them the smooth things they
 desired, they are resolved to look upon him as not duly called to the 
 office of a prophet. None so blind as those that will not see. 

 (2.) That they would not be reclaimed and reformed by the most severe
 chastisement. They were now sent into a miserable thraldom for 
 <I>mocking the messengers of the Lord</I> and <I>misusing his 
 prophets.</I> This was the sin for which God now contended with them; 
 and yet in <I>their distress they trespass yet more against the 
 Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:22">2 Chron. xxviii. 22</A>.

 This very sin they are notoriously guilty of in their captivity, which
 shows that afflictions will not of themselves cure men of their sins, 
 unless the grace of God work with them, but will rather exasperate the 
 corruptions they are intended to mortify; so true is that of Solomon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:22">Prov. xxvii. 22</A>),

 <I>Though thou shouldst bray a fool in a mortar, yet will not his 
 foolishness depart from him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How Jeremiah came to the knowledge of this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 <I>Zephaniah read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah.</I> He did not 
 design to do as Shemaiah would have him, but, as it should seem, had a 
 respect for Jeremiah (for we find him employed in messages to him as a 
 <I>prophet,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+21:1,37:3"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 1, xxxvii. 3</A>),

 and therefore protected him. He that continued in his dignity and power
 stood more in awe of God and his judgments than he that was now a 
 captive. Nay, he made Jeremiah acquainted with the contents of the 
 letter, that he might see what enemies he had even among the captives. 
 Note, It is kindness to our friends to let them know their foes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What was the sentence passed upon Shemaiah for writing this 
 letter. God sent him an answer, for to him Jeremiah committed his 
 cause: it was ordered to be sent not to him, but <I>to those of the 
 captivity,</I> who encouraged and countenanced him as if he had been a 
 prophet of God's raising up, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:31,32"><I>v.</I> 31, 32</A>.

 Let them know, 

 1. That Shemaiah had made fools of them. He promised them peace in 
 God's name, but God did not send him; he forged a commission, and 
 counterfeited the broad seal of Heaven to it, and made the people <I>to 
 trust in a lie,</I> and by preaching false comfort to them deprived 
 them of true comfort. Nay, he had not only made fools of them, but, 
 which was worse, he had made traitors of them; he had <I>taught 
 rebellion against the Lord,</I> as Hananiah had done,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+28:16"><I>ch.</I> xxviii. 16</A>.

 And, if vengeance shall be taken on those that rebel, much more on
 those that teach rebellion by their doctrine and example. 

 2. That at his end <I>he shall also be a fool</I> (as the expression 
 is,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:11"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 11</A>);

 his name and family shall be extinct and shall be buried in oblivion;
 he shall leave no issue behind him to bear up his name; his pedigree 
 shall end in him: <I>He shall not have a man to dwell among this 
 people;</I> and neither he nor any that come from him shall <I>behold 
 the good that I will do for my people.</I> Note, Those are unworthy to 
 share in God's favours to his church that are not willing to stay his 
 time for them. Shemaiah was angry at Jeremiah's advice to the captives 
 to see to the building up of their families in Babylon, that they might 
 be increased and not diminished, and therefore justly is he written 
 childless there. Those that slight the blessings of God's word deserve 
 to lose the benefit of them. See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:16,17">Amos vii. 16, 17</A>.</P>
