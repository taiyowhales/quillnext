 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter goes on with the good words and comfortable words which we 
 had in the chapter before, for the encouragement of the captives, 
 assuring them that God would in due time restore them or their children 
 to their own land, and make them a great and happy nation again, 
 especially by sending them the Messiah, in whose kingdom and grace many 
 of these promises were to have their full accomplishment. 

 I. They shall be restored to peace and honour, and joy and great plenty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:1-14">ver. 1-14</A>.

 II. Their sorrow for the loss of their children shall be at an end, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:15-17">ver. 15-17</A>.

 III. They shall repent of their sins, and God will graciously accept
 them in their repentance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:18-20">ver. 18-20</A>.

 IV. They shall be multiplied and increased, both their children and
 their cattle, and not be cut off and diminished as they had been, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:21-30">ver. 21-30</A>.

 V. God will renew his covenant with them, and enrich it with spiritual
 blessings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:31-34">ver. 31-34</A>.

 VI. These blessings shall be secured to theirs after them, even to the 
 spiritual seed of Israel for ever, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:35-37">ver. 35-37</A>.

 VII. As an earnest of this the city of Jerusalem shall be rebuilt, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:38-40">ver. 38-40</A>.

 These exceedingly great and precious promises were firm foundations of 
 hope and full fountains of joy to the poor captives; and we also may 
 apply them to ourselves and mix faith with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  At the same time, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, will I be the God of all
 the families of Israel, and they shall be my people.
 &nbsp; 2  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, The people <I>which were</I> left of the
 sword found grace in the wilderness; <I>even</I> Israel, when I went
 to cause him to rest.
 &nbsp; 3  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath appeared of old unto me, <I>saying,</I> Yea, I have
 loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with
 lovingkindness have I drawn thee.
 &nbsp; 4  Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of
 Israel: thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt
 go forth in the dances of them that make merry.
 &nbsp; 5  Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the
 planters shall plant, and shall eat <I>them</I> as common things.
 &nbsp; 6  For there shall be a day, <I>that</I> the watchmen upon the mount
 Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God.
 &nbsp; 7  For thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and
 shout among the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and
 say, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, save thy people, the remnant of Israel.
 &nbsp; 8  Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather
 them from the coasts of the earth, <I>and</I> with them the blind and
 the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child
 together: a great company shall return thither.
 &nbsp; 9  They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I
 lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a
 straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father
 to Israel, and Ephraim <I>is</I> my firstborn.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God here assures his people,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That he will again take them into a covenant relation to himself, 
 from which they seemed to be cut off. <I>At the same time,</I> when 
 God's anger breaks out against the wicked 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:24"><I>ch.</I> xxx. 24</A>),

 his own people shall be owned by him as the children of his love: <I>I
 will be the God</I> (that is, I will show myself to be the God) <I>of 
 all the families of Israel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),--

 not of the two tribes only, but of all the tribes,--not of the house of 
 Aaron only, and the families of Levi, but of all their families; not 
 only their state in general, but their particular families, and the 
 interests of them, shall have the benefit of a special relation to God. 
 Note, The families of good people, in their family capacity, may apply 
 to God and stay themselves upon him as their God. If we and our houses 
 serve the Lord, we and our houses shall be protected and blessed by 
 him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:33">Prov. iii. 33</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That he will do for them, in bringing them out of Babylon, as he 
 had done for their fathers when he delivered them out of Egypt, and as 
 he had purposed to do when he first took them to be his people. 

 1. He puts them in mind of what he did for their fathers when he
 brought them out of Egypt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 They were then, as these were, a <I>people left of the sword,</I> that 
 sword of Pharaoh with which he cut off all the male children as soon as 
 they were born (a bloody sword indeed they had narrowly escaped) and 
 that sword with which he threatened to cut them off when he pursued 
 them to the Red Sea. They were then <I>in the wilderness,</I> where 
 they seemed to be lost and forgotten, as these were now in a strange 
 land, and yet they found grace in God's sight, were owned and highly 
 honoured by him, and blessed with wonderful instances of his peculiar 
 favour, and he was at this time going <I>to cause them to rest</I> in 
 Canaan. Note, When we are brought very low, and insuperable 
 difficulties appear in the way of our deliverance, it is good to 
 remember that it has been so with the church formerly, and yet that it 
 has been raised up from its low estate and has got to Canaan through 
 all the hardships of a wilderness; and God is still the same. 

 2. They put him in mind of what God had done for their fathers, 
 intimating that they now saw not such signs, and were ready to ask, as 
 Gideon did, <I>Where are all the wonders that our fathers told us 
 of?</I> It is true, <I>The Lord hath appeared of old unto me</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 in Egypt, in the wilderness, hath appeared with me and for me, hath 
 been seen in his glory as my God. The years of ancient times were 
 glorious years; but now it is otherwise; what good will it do us that 
 he <I>appeared of old</I> to us when now he is <I>a God that hides 
 himself</I> from us?
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:15">Isa. xlv. 15</A>.

 Note, It is hard to take comfort from former smiles under present
 frowns.

 3. To this he answers with an assurance of the constancy of his love:
 <I>Yea, I have loved thee,</I> not only with an ancient love, but 
 <I>with an everlasting love,</I> a love that shall never fail, however 
 the comforts of it may for a time be suspended. It is <I>an everlasting 
 love; therefore have I</I> extended or <I>drawn out lovingkindness unto 
 thee</I> also, as well as to thy ancestors, or, <I>with lovingkindness 
 have I drawn thee</I> to myself as thy God, from all the idols to which 
 thou hadst turned aside. Note, It is the happiness of those who are
 through grace interested in the love of God that it is <I>an 
 everlasting love</I> (from everlasting in the counsels of it, <I>to</I> 
 everlasting in the continuance and consequences of it), and that 
 nothing can separate them from that love. Those whom God loves with
 this love he will draw into covenant and communion with himself, by the 
 influences of his Spirit upon their souls; he will <I>draw them with 
 lovingkindness,</I> with the cords of a man and bands of love, than 
 which no attractive can be more powerful.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That he will again form them into a people, and give them a very 
 joyful settlement in their own land, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 Is the church of God his house, his temple? Is it now in ruins? It is
 so; but, <I>Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built.</I> Are 
 they parts of this building dispersed? They shall be collected and put 
 together again, each in its place. If God undertake to build them, they 
 shall be built, whatever opposition may be given to it? Is 
 <I>Israel</I> a beautiful <I>virgin?</I> Is she now stripped of her 
 ornaments and reduced to a melancholy state? She is so; but <I>thou 
 shalt again be adorned</I> and made fine, adorned <I>with thy 
 tabrets,</I> or timbrels, the ornaments of thy chamber, and made merry. 
 They shall resume their harps which had been hung upon the 
 willow-trees, shall tune them, and shall themselves be in tune to make 
 use of them. They shall be adorned with their tabrets, for now their 
 mirth and music shall be seasonable; it shall be a proper time for it, 
 God in his providence shall call them to it, and then it shall be an 
 ornament to them; whereas tabrets, at a time of common calamity, when 
 God called to mourning, were a shame to them. Or it may refer to their 
 use of tabrets in the solemnizing of their religious feasts and their 
 <I>going forth in dances</I> then, as the <I>daughters of Shiloh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+21:19,21">Judg. xxi. 19, 21</A>.

 Our mirth is then indeed an ornament to us when we serve God and honour
 him with it. Is the joy of the city maintained by the products of the 
 country? It is so; and therefore it is promised

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 <I>Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria,</I> which 
 had been the head city of the kingdom of Israel, in opposition to that 
 of Judah; but they shall now be united 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:22">Ezek. xxxvii. 22</A>),

 and there shall be such perfect peace and security that men shall apply
 themselves wholly to the improvement of their ground: <I>The planters 
 shall plant,</I> not fearing the soldiers' coming to eat the fruits of 
 what they had planted, or to pluck it up; but they themselves <I>shall 
 eat them</I> freely, <I>as common things,</I> not forbidden fruits, not 
 forbidden by the law of God (as they were till the fifth year,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:23-25">Lev. xix. 23-25</A>),

 not forbidden by the owners, because there shall be such plenty as to 
 yield enough for all, enough for each.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That they shall have liberty and opportunity to worship God in the
 ordinances of his own appointment, and shall have both invitations and 
 inclinations to do so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>There shall be a day,</I> and a glorious day it will be, when <I>the 
 watchmen upon Mount Ephraim,</I> that are set to stand sentinel there, 
 to give notice of the approach of the enemy, finding that all is very 
 quiet and that there is no appearance of danger, shall desire for a 
 time to be discharged from their post, that they may <I>go up to 
 Zion,</I> to praise God for the public peace. Or <I>the watchmen</I> 
 that tend the vineyards (spoken of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 shall stir up themselves, and one another, and all their neighbours, to 
 go and keep the solemn feasts at Jerusalem. Now this implies that the 
 service of God shall be again set up in Zion, that there shall be a 
 general resort to it, with much affection and mutual excitement, as in 
 David's time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+122:1">Ps. cxxii. 1</A>.

 But that which is most observable here is <I>that the watchmen of
 Ephraim</I> are forward to promote the worship of God at Jerusalem, 
 whereas formerly <I>the watchman of Ephraim was hatred against the 
 house of his God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:8">Hos. ix. 8</A>),

 and, in stead of inviting people to Zion, laid snares for those that
 set their faces thitherward,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:1">Hos. v. 1</A>.

 Note, God can make those who have been enemies to religion and the true
 worship of God to become encouragers of them and leaders in them. This
 promise was to have its full accomplishment in the days of the Messiah, 
 when the gospel should be preached to all these countries, and a 
 general invitation thereby given into the church of Christ, of which 
 Zion was a type.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. That God shall have the glory and the church both the honour and
 comfort of this blessed change 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Sing with gladness for Jacob,</I> that is, let all her friends and 
 well-wishers rejoice with her, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:43">Deut. xxxii. 43</A>.

 <I>Rejoice, you Gentiles with his people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:10">Rom. xv. 10</A>.

 The restoration of Jacob will be taken notice of by all the neighbours,
 it will be matter of joy to them all, and they shall all join with 
 Jacob in his joys, and thereby pay him respect and put a reputation 
 upon him. Even <I>the chief of the nations,</I> that make the greatest
 figure, shall think it an honour to them to congratulate the 
 restoration of Jacob, and shall do themselves the honour to send their 
 ambassadors on that errand. <I>Publish you, praise you.</I> In 
 publishing these tidings, praise the God of Israel, praise the Israel 
 of God, speak honourably of both. The publishers of the gospel must 
 publish it with praise, and therefore it is often spoken of in the 
 <I>Psalms</I> as mingled with <I>praises,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+67:2,3,96:2,3">Ps. lxvii. 2, 3; cxvi. 2, 3</A>.
 
 What we either bring to others or take to ourselves the comfort of we
 must be sure to give God the praise of. <I>Praise you, and say, O Lord! 
 save thy people;</I> that is, perfect their salvation, go on to save 
 <I>the remnant of Israel,</I> that are yet in bondage; as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+126:3,4">Ps. cxxvi. 3, 4</A>.
 
 Note, When we are praising God for what he has done we must call upon 
 him for the future favours which his church is in need and expectation 
 of; and in praying to him we really praise him and give him glory; he 
 takes it so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. That, in order to a happy settlement in their own land, they shall 
 have a joyful return out of the land of their captivity and a very 
 comfortable passage homeward 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>),

 and this beginning of mercy shall be to them a pledge of all the other 
 blessings here promised.

 1. Though they are scattered to places far remote, yet they shall be
 brought together <I>from the north country, and from the coasts of the 
 earth;</I> wherever they are, God will find them out. 

 2. Though many of them are very unfit for travel, yet that shall be no 
 hindrance to them: <I>The blind and the lame</I> shall come; such a 
 good-will shall they have to their journey, and such a good heart upon 
 it, that they shall not make their blindness and lameness an excuse for 
 staying where they are. There companions will be ready to help them, 
 will be <I>eyes to the blind and legs to the lame,</I> as good 
 Christians ought to be to one another in their travels heavenward, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+29:15">Job xxix. 15</A>.

 But, above all, their God will help them; and let none plead that he is
 blind who has God for his guide, or lame who has God for his strength. 
 <I>The women with child</I> are heavy, and it is not fit that they 
 should undertake such a journey, much less those <I>that travail with 
 child;</I> and yet, when it is to return to Zion, neither the one nor 
 the other shall make any difficulty of it. Note, When God calls we must 
 not plead any inability to come; for he that calls us will help us, 
 will strengthen us.

 3. Though they seem to be diminished, and to have become few in
 numbers, yet, when they come all together, they shall be <I>a great 
 company;</I> and so will God's spiritual Israel be when there shall be 
 a general rendezvous of them, though now they are but a little flock.

 4. Though their return will be matter of joy to them, yet prayers and 
 tears will be both their stores and their artillery 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>They shall come with weeping and with supplications,</I> weeping for 
 sin, supplication for pardon; for <I>the goodness of God</I> shall 
 <I>lead them to repentance;</I> and they shall weep with more 
 bitterness and more tenderness for sin, when they are delivered out of 
 their captivity, than ever they did when they were groaning under it. 
 Weeping and praying do well together; tears put life into prayers, and 
 express the liveliness of them, and prayers help to wipe away tears.
 <I>With favours will I lead them</I> (so the margin reads it); in their 
 journey they shall be compassed with God's favours, the fruits of his 
 favour.

 5. Though they have a perilous journey, yet they shall be safe under a 
 divine convoy. Is the country they pass through dry and thirsty? <I>I 
 will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters,</I> not the waters of 
 a land-flood, which fail in summer. Is it a wilderness where there is 
 no road, no track? <I>I will cause them t walk in a straight way,</I> 
 which they shall not miss. Is it a rough and rocky country? Yet <I>they 
 shall not stumble.</I> Note, Whithersoever God gives his people a clear 
 call he will either find them or make them a ready way; and while we 
 are following Providence we may be sure that Providence will not be 
 wanting to us. And, <I>lastly,</I> here is a reason given why God will 
 take all this care of his people: <I>For I am a Father to Israel,</I> a 
 Father that begat him, and therefore will maintain him, that have the 
 care and compassion of a father for him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:13">Ps. ciii. 13</A>);

 <I>and Ephraim is my first-born;</I> even <I>Ephraim,</I> who, having
 gone astray from God, was <I>no more worthy to be called a son,</I> 
 shall yet be owned as a <I>first-born,</I> particularly dear, and heir 
 of a double portion of blessings. The same reason that was given for 
 their release out of Egypt is given for their release out of Babylon; 
 they are free-born and therefore must not be enslaved, are born to God 
 and therefore must not be the servants of men. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:22,23">Exod. iv. 22, 23</A>,

 <I>Israel is my son, even my first-born; let my son go that he may
 serve me.</I> If we take God for our Father, and join ourselves to 
 <I>the church of the first-born,</I> we may be assured that we shall 
 want nothing that is good for us.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Hear the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, O ye nations, and declare <I>it</I> in
 the isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather
 him, and keep him, as a shepherd <I>doth</I> his flock.
 &nbsp; 11  For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the
 hand of <I>him that was</I> stronger than he.
 &nbsp; 12  Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion,

 and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of
 the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they
 shall not sorrow any more at all.
 &nbsp; 13  Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men
 and old together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and
 will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.
 &nbsp; 14  And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and
 my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 15  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; A voice was heard in Ramah,
 lamentation, <I>and</I> bitter weeping; Rachel weeping for her children
 refused to be comforted for her children, because they <I>were</I>
 not.
 &nbsp; 16  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and
 thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.
 &nbsp; 17  And there is hope in thine end, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that thy
 children shall come again to their own border.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This paragraph is much to the same purport with the last, publishing to 
 the world, as well as to the church, the purposes of God's love 
 concerning his people. This is a <I>word of the Lord</I> which the 
 <I>nations</I> must <I>hear,</I> for it is a prophecy of a work of the 
 Lord which the nations cannot but take notice of. Let them hear the 
 prophecy, that they may the better understand and improve the 
 performance; and let those that hear it themselves declare it to 
 others, <I>declare it in the isles afar off.</I> It will be a piece of 
 news that will spread all the world over. It will look very great in
 history; let us see how it looks in prophecy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is foretold, 

 1. That those who are dispersed shall be brought together again from
 their dispersions: <I>He that scattereth Israel will gather him;</I> 
 for he knows whither he scattered them and therefore where to find 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 <I>Una eademque manus vulnus opemque tulit</I>--<I>The hand that 
 inflicted the wound shall heal it.</I> And when he has gathered him 
 into one body, one fold, he will <I>keep him, as a shepherd does his 
 flock,</I> from being scattered again.

 2. That those who are sold and alienated shall be redeemed and brought 
 back, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Though the enemy that had got possession of him was <I>stronger than 
 he,</I> yet <I>the Lord,</I> who is stronger than all. <I>has redeemed
 and ransomed him,</I> not by price, but by power, as of old out of the 
 Egyptians' hands.

 3. That with their liberty they shall have plenty and joy, and God
 shall be honoured and served with it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.

 When they shall have returned to their own land <I>they shall come and 
 sing in the high place of Zion;</I> on the top of that holy mountain 
 they shall sing to the praise and glory of God. We read that they did 
 so when the foundation of the temple was laid there; they <I>sang 
 together, praising and giving thanks to the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:11">Ezra iii. 11</A>.

 They <I>shall flow together to the goodness of the Lord;</I> that is,
 they shall flock in great numbers and with great forwardness and 
 cheerfulness, as streams of water, <I>to the goodness of the Lord,</I> 
 to the temple where he causes his goodness to pass before his people.
 They shall come together in solemn assemblies, to <I>praise him for his 
 goodness,</I> and to pray for the fruits of it and the continuance of 
 it; they shall come to bless him for his goodness, in giving them 
 <I>wheat, and wine, and oil, and the young of the flock and of the 
 herd,</I> which, now that they have obtained their freedom, they have 
 an uncontested property in and the quiet and peaceable enjoyment of, 
 and which therefore they honour God with the first-fruits of and out of 
 which they bring offerings to his altar. Note, It is comfortable to 
 observe the goodness of the Lord in the gifts of common providence, and 
 even in them to taste covenant-love. Having plenty (plenty out of want 
 and scarcity) they shall greatly rejoice, <I>their soul shall be as a 
 watered garden,</I> flourishing and fruitful

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:11">Isa. lviii. 11</A>),

 pleasant and fragrant, and abounding in all good things. Note, Our
 souls are never valuable as gardens but when they are watered with the 
 dews of God's Spirit and grace. It is a precious promise which follows, 
 and which will not have its full accomplishment any where on this side 
 the height of the heavenly Zion, that <I>they shall not sorrow any more 
 at all;</I> for it is only in that new Jerusalem <I>that all tears 
 shall be wiped away,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:4">Rev. xxi. 4</A>.

 However, so far it was fulfilled to the returned captives that they had 
 not any more those causes for sorrow which they had formerly had; and 
 therefore 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)

 <I>young men and old shall rejoice together;</I> so grave shall the 
 young men be in their joys as to keep company with the old men, and so 
 transported shall the old men be as to associate with the young. 
 <I>Salva res est, saltat senex--The state prospers, and the aged 
 dance.</I> God <I>will turn their mourning into joy,</I> their fasts 
 into solemn feasts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:19">Zech. viii. 19</A>.

 It was in the return out of Babylon that those <I>who sowed in
 tears</I> were made to <I>reap in joy,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+126:5,6">Ps. cxxvi. 5, 6</A>.

 Those are comforted indeed whom God comforts, and may forget their 
 troubles when he <I>makes them</I> to <I>rejoice from their sorrow,</I> 
 not only rejoice after it, but rejoice from it their joy shall borrow 
 lustre from their sorrow, which shall serve as a foil to it; and the 
 more they think of their troubles the more they rejoice in their 
 deliverance.

 4. That both the ministers and those they minister to shall have
 abundant satisfaction in what God gives them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness;</I> there shall 
 be such a plenty of sacrifices brought to the altar that those who 
 <I>live upon the altar</I> shall live very comfortably, they and their 
 families shall be <I>satiated with fatness,</I> they shall have enough, 
 and that of the best; <I>and my people shall be satisfied with my 
 goodness,</I> and shall think there is enough in that to make them 
 happy; and so there is. God's people have an abundant satisfaction in 
 God's goodness, though they have but little of this world. Let them be 
 satisfied of God's lovingkindness, and they will be satisfied with it 
 and desire no more to make them happy. All this is applicable to the 
 spiritual blessings which the redeemed of the Lord enjoy by Jesus 
 Christ, infinitely more valuable than corn, and wine, and oil, and the 
 satisfaction of soul which they have in the enjoyment of them.

 5. That those particularly who had been in sorrow for the loss of their
 children who were carried into captivity should have that sorrow turned 
 into joy upon their return, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:15-17"><I>v.</I> 15-17</A>.
 
 Here we have,

 (1.) The sad lamentation which the mothers made for the loss of their 
 children 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>In Ramah was there a voice heard,</I> at the time when the general 
 captivity was, nothing but <I>lamentation, and bitter weeping,</I> more 
 there than in other places, because there Nebuzaradan had the general 
 rendezvous of his captives, as appears,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+40:1"><I>ch.</I> xl. 1</A>,

 where we find him sending Jeremiah back from Ramah. <I>Rachel</I> is
 here said to <I>weep for her children.</I> The sepulchre of Rachel was 
 between Ramah and Bethlehem. Benjamin, one of the two tribes, and 
 Ephraim, head of the ten tribes, were both descendants from Rachel. She 
 had but two sons, the elder of whom was one for whom his father grieved 
 and<I>refused to be comforted</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:35">Gen. xxxvii. 35</A>);

 the other she herself called <I>Benoni--the son of my sorrow.</I> Now
 the inhabitants of Ramah did in like manner <I>grieve for their sons 
 and their daughters</I> that were carried away (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:6">1 Sam. xxx. 6</A>),

 and such a voice of lamentation was there as, to speak poetically,
 might even have raised Rachel out of her grave to mourn with them. The 
 tender parents even <I>refused to be comforted for their children, 
 because they were not,</I> were not with them, but were in the hands of 
 their enemies; they were never likely to see them any more. This is 
 applied by the evangelists to the great mourning that was at Bethlehem 
 for the murder of the infants there by Herod

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:17-18">Matt. ii. 17-18</A>),

 and this scripture is said to be then fulfilled. They wept for them,
 <I>and would not be comforted,</I> supposing the case would not admit 
 any ground of comfort, <I>because they were not.</I> Note, Sorrow for 
 the loss of children cannot but be great sorrow, especially if we so 
 far mistake as to think <I>they are not.</I>

 (2.) Seasonable comfort administered to them in reference hereunto, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 They are advised to moderate that sorrow, and to set bounds to it: 
 <I>Refrain thy voice from weeping and thy eyes from tears.</I> We are 
 not forbidden to mourn in such a case; allowances are made for natural 
 affection. But we must not suffer our sorrow to run into an extreme, to 
 hinder our joy in God, or take us off from our duty to him. Though we
 mourn, we must not murmur, nor must we resolve, as Jacob did, to go to 
 the grave mourning. In order to repress inordinate grief, we must 
 consider that <I>there is hope in our end,</I> hope that there will be 
 an end (the trouble will not last always), that it will be a happy 
 and--the end will be peace. Note, It ought to support us under our 
 troubles that we have reason to hope they will end well. <I>The
 righteous has hope in his death;</I> that will be the blessed period of 
 his grief and the blessed passage to his joys. "<I>There is hope for
 thy posterity</I>" (so some read it); "though thou mayest not live to 
 see these glorious days thyself, there is hope that thy posterity 
 shall. Though one generation falls in the wilderness, the next shall 
 enter Canaan. Two things thou mayest comfort thyself with the hope 
 of:"--

 [1.] "The reward of thy work:--<I>Thy</I> suffering <I>work shall be
 rewarded.</I> The comforts of the deliverance shall be sufficient to 
 balance all the grievances of thy captivity." God makes his people 
 <I>glad according to the days wherein he has afflicted them,</I> and so 
 there is a proportion between the joys and the sorrows, as between the 
 reward and the work. The <I>glory to be revealed,</I> which the saints 
 hope for in the end, will abundantly countervail <I>the sufferings of 
 this present time,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:18">Rom. viii. 18</A>.

 [2.] "The restoration of thy children: <I>They shall come again from 
 the land of the enemy</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);

 they <I>shall come again to their own border,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 <I>There is hope</I> that children at a distance may be brought home. 
 Jacob had a comfortable meeting with Joseph after he had despaired of 
 ever seeing him. There is hope concerning children removed by death 
 that they shall <I>return to their own border,</I> to the happy lot 
 assigned them in the resurrection, a lot in the heavenly Canaan, that 
 border of his sanctuary. We shall see reason to repress our grief for 
 the death of our children that are taken into covenant with God when we 
 consider the hopes we have of their resurrection to eternal life. They 
 are not lost, but gone before.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself <I>thus;</I> Thou
 hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed
 <I>to the yoke:</I> turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou
 <I>art</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> my God.
 &nbsp; 19  Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I

 confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.
 &nbsp; 20  <I>Is</I> Ephraim my dear son? <I>is he</I> a pleasant child? for

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Ephraim's repentance, and return to God. Not only Judah, but Ephraim 
 the ten tribes, shall be restored, and therefore shall thus be prepared 
 and qualified for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:8">Hos. xiv. 8</A>.

 <I>Ephraim shall say, What have I do to any more with idols?</I>
 Ephraim the people, is here spoken of as a single person to denote 
 their unanimity; they shall be as one man in their repentance and shall 
 glorify God in it with one mind and one mouth, one and all. It is
 likewise thus expressed that it might be the better accommodated to 
 particular penitents, for whose direction and encouragement this 
 passage is intended. Ephraim is here brought in weeping for sin, 
 perhaps because Ephraim, the person from whom that tribe had its 
 denomination, was a man of a tender spirit, <I>mourned for his children 
 many days</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+7:21,22">1 Chron. vii. 21, 22</A>),

 and sorrow for sin is compared to that <I>for an only son.</I> This
 penitent is here brought in,

 1. Bemoaning himself and the miseries of his present case. True
 penitents do thus bemoan themselves. 

 2. Accusing himself, laying a load upon himself as a sinner, a great
 sinner. He charges upon himself, in the first place, that sin which his 
 conscience told him that he was more especially guilty of at this time, 
 and that was impatience under correction: "<I>Thou has chastised 
 me;</I> I have been under the rod, and I needed it, I deserved it; I 
 was justly chastised, chastised <I>as a bullock,</I> who would never 
 have felt the goad if he had not first rebelled against the yoke." True 
 penitents look upon their afflictions as fatherly chastisements: 
 "<I>Thou hast chastised me and I was chastised;</I> that is, it was 
 well that I was chastised, otherwise I should have been undone; it did 
 me good, or at least was intended to do me good; and yet I have been 
 impatient under it." Or it may intimate his want of feeling under the 
 affliction: "<I>Thou hast chastised me and I was chastised,</I> that 
 was all; I was not awakened by it and quickened by it; I looked no 
 further than the chastisement. <I>I have been</I> under the 
 chastisement <I>as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke,</I> unruly and 
 unmanageable, kicking against the pricks, <I>like a wild bull in a 
 net,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:20">Isa. li. 20</A>.

 This is the sin he finds himself guilty of now; but

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>)

 he reflects upon his former sins and looks as far back as the days of 
 his youth. The discovery of one sin should put us upon searching out 
 more; now he remembers <I>the reproach of his youth.</I> Ephraim, as a 
 people, reflect upon the misconduct of their ancestors when they were 
 first formed in a people. It is applicable to particular persons. Note, 
 The sin of our youth was the reproach of our youth, and we ought often 
 to remember it against ourselves and to bear it in a penitential sorrow 
 and shame.

 3. He is here brought in angry at himself, having a holy indignation at
 himself for his sin and folly: He <I>smote upon his thigh,</I> as the 
 publican upon his breast. He was even amazed at himself, and at his own 
 stupidity and frowardness: He <I>was ashamed, yea even confounded,</I> 
 could not with any confidence look up to God, nor with any comfort 
 reflect upon himself. 

 4. He is here recommending himself to the mercy and grace of God. He 
 finds he is bent to backslide from God, and cannot by any power of his 
 own keep himself close with God, much less, when he has revolted, bring 
 himself back to God, and therefore he prays, <I>Turn thou me and I 
 shall be turned,</I> which implies that unless God do turn him by his 
 grace he shall never be turned, but wander endlessly, that therefore he 
 is very desirous of converting grace, has a dependence upon it, and 
 doubts not but that that grace will be sufficient for him, to help him 
 over all the difficulties that were in the way of his return to God. 
 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:14"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 14</A>,

 <I>Heal me and I shall be healed.</I> God works with power, can make
 the unwilling willing; if he undertake the conversion of a soul, it 
 will be converted. 

 5. He is here pleasing himself with the experience he had of the
 blessed effect of divine grace: <I>Surely after that I was turned I 
 repented.</I> Note, All the pious workings of our heart towards God are 
 the fruit and consequence of the powerful working of his grace in us. 
 And observe, He was <I>turned,</I> he was <I>instructed,</I> his will 
 was bowed to the will of God, by the right in forming of his judgment 
 concerning the truths of God. Note, The way God takes of converting 
 souls to himself is by opening the eyes of their understandings, and 
 all good follows thereupon: <I>After that I was instructed</I> I 
 yielded, <I>I smote upon my thigh.</I> When sinners come to a right 
 knowledge they will come to a right way. Ephraim was chastised, and
 that did not produce the desired effect, it went no further: <I>I was 
 chastised,</I> and that was all. But, when the instructions of God's 
 Spirit accompanied the corrections of his providence, then the work was 
 done, then he <I>smote upon his thigh,</I> was so humbled for sin as to 
 have no more to do with it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God's compassion on Ephraim and the kind reception he finds with 
 God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 1. God owns him for a child and a prodigal: <I>Is Ephraim my dear son?
 Is he a pleasant child?</I> Thus when Ephraim bemoans himself God 
 bemoans him, as <I>one whom his mother comforts,</I> though she had 
 chidden him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:13">Isa. lxvi. 13</A>.

 <I>Is</I> this <I>Ephraim my dear son? Is</I> this that <I>pleasant
 child?</I> Is it he that is thus sad in spirit and that complains so 
 bitterly? So it is like that of Saul

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+26:17">1 Sam. xxvi. 17</A>),

 <I>Is this thy voice, my son David?</I> Or, as it is sometimes
 supplied, <I>Is not Ephraim my dear son? Is he not a pleasant 
 child?</I> Yes, now he is, now he repents and returns. Note, Those that 
 have been undutiful backsliding children, if they sincerely return and 
 repent, however they have been under the chastisement of the rod, shall 
 be accepted of God as dear and pleasant children. Ephraim had afflicted 
 himself, but God thus heals him--had abased himself, but God thus 
 honours him; as the returning prodigal who thought himself no more 
 worthy to be <I>called a son,</I> yet, by his father, had the <I>best 
 robe</I> put on him and <I>a ring on his hand.</I>

 2. He relents towards him, and speaks of him with a great deal of 
 tender compassion: <I>Since I spoke against him,</I> by the 
 threatenings of the word and the rebukes of providence, <I>I do 
 earnestly remember him still,</I> my thoughts towards him are thoughts 
 of peace. Note, When God afflicts his people, yet he does not forget 
 them; when he casts them out of their land, yet he does not cast them 
 out of sight, nor out of mind. Even then when God is speaking against 
 us, yet he is acting for us, and designing our good in all; and this is 
 our comfort in our affliction, that<I>the Lord thinks upon us,</I> 
 though we have forgotten him. <I>I remember him still,</I> and 
 therefore <I>my bowels are troubled for him,</I> as Joseph's yearned 
 towards his brethren, even when he <I>spoke roughly</I> to them. When 
 Israel's afflictions extorted a penitent confession and submission it 
 is said that his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:16">Judg. x. 16</A>),

 for he always afflicts with the greatest tenderness. It was God's
 compassion that mitigated Ephraim's punishment: <I>My heart is turned 
 within me</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:8,9">Hos. xi. 8, 9</A>);

 and now the same compassion accepted Ephraim's repentance. Ephraim had
 pleaded

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 <I>Thou art the Lord my God,</I> therefore to thee will I return, 
 therefore on thy mercy and grace I will depend; and God shows that it 
 was a valid plea and prevailing, for he makes it appear both that he is 
 God and not man and that he is <I>his God.</I>

 3. He resolves to do him good: <I>I will surely have mercy upon him,
 saith the Lord,</I> Note, God has mercy in store, rich mercy, sure 
 mercy, suitable mercy, for all that insincerity seek him and submit to 
 him; and the more we are afflicted for sin the better prepared we are 
 for the comforts of that mercy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Gracious excitements and encouragements given to the people of God 
 in Babylon to prepare for their return to their own land. Let them not 
 tremble and lose their spirits; let them not trifle and lose their 
 time; but with a firm resolution and a close application address 
 themselves to their journey, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.

 1. They must think of nothing but of coming back to their own country,
 out of which they had been driven: "<I>Turn again, O virgin of 
 Israel!</I> a virgin to be again espoused to thy God; <I>turn again to 
 these thy cities;</I> though they are laid waste and in ruins, they are 
 <I>thy cities,</I> which thy God gave thee, and therefore <I>turn 
 again</I> to them." They must be content in Babylon no longer than till 
 they had liberty to return to Zion. 

 2. They must return the same way that they went, that the remembrance 
 of the sorrows which attended them, or which their fathers had told 
 them of, in such and such places upon the road, the sight of which 
 would, by a local memory, put them in mind of them, might make them the 
 more thankful for their deliverance. Those that have departed from God
 into the bondage of sin must return by the way in which they went 
 astray, to the duties they neglected, must <I>do their first works.</I> 

 3. They must engage themselves and all that is within them in this 
 affair: <I>Set thy heart towards the highway;</I> bring thy mind to it; 
 consider thy duty, the interest, and go about it with a good-will. 
 Note, The way from Babylon to Zion, from the bondage of sin to the 
 glorious liberty of God's children, is a highway; it is right, it is 
 plain, it is safe, it is well-tracked 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:8">Isa. xxxv. 8</A>);

 yet none are likely to walk in it, unless they <I>set their hearts
 towards it.</I>

 4. They must furnish themselves with all needful accommodations for the 
 journey: <I>Set thee up way-marks,</I> and <I>make thee high heaps</I> 
 or <I>pillars;</I> send before to have such set up in all places where 
 there is any danger of missing the road. Let those that go first, and 
 are best acquainted with the way, set up such directions for those that 
 follow. 

 5. They must compose themselves for their journey: <I>How long will
 thou go about, O backsliding daughter?</I> Let not their minds 
 fluctuate, or be uncertain about it, but resolve upon it; let them not 
 distract themselves with care and fear; let them not seek about to 
 creatures for assistance, not hurry hither and thither in courting 
 them, which had often been an instance of their backsliding from God; 
 but let them cast themselves upon God, and then let their minds be 
 fixed. 

 6. They are encouraged to do this by an assurance God gives them that 
 he would <I>create a new thing</I> (strange and surprising) <I>in the 
 earth</I> (in that land), <I>a woman shall compass a man.</I> The 
 church of God, that is weak and feeble as a woman, altogether unapt for 
 military employments and of a timorous spirit 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:6">Isa. liv. 6</A>),

 shall surround, besiege, and prevail against a mighty man. The church
 is compared to a woman,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:1">Rev. xii. 1</A>.

 And, whereas we find <I>armies compassing the camp of the saints</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:9">Rev. xx. 9</A>),

 now the camp of the saints shall compass them. Many good interpreters 
 understand this <I>new thing</I> created in that land to be the 
 incarnation of Christ, which God an eye to in bringing them back to 
 that land, and which had sometimes been given them for a sign, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:14,9:6">Isa. vii. 14; ix. 6</A>.

 <I>A woman,</I> the virgin Mary, enclosed in her womb <I>the Mighty
 One;</I> for so <I>Geber,</I> the word here used, signifies; and God is 
 called <I>Gibbor, the Mighty God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:18"><I>ch.</I> xxxii. 18</A>),

 as also is Christ in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:6">Isa. ix. 6</A>,

 where his incarnation is spoken of, as it is supposed to be here. He
 is <I>El-Gibbor,</I> the <I>mighty God.</I> Let this assure them that 
 God would not cast off this people, for that blessing was to be among 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:8">Isa. lxv. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. A comfortable prospect given them of a happy settlement in their
 own land again. 

 1. They shall have an interest in the esteem and good-will of all their
 neighbours, who will give them a good word and put up a good prayer for 
 them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>As yet</I> or rather <I>yet again</I> (though Judah and Jerusalem 
 have long been an astonishment and a hissing), <I>this speech shall be 
 used,</I> as it was formerly, <I>concerning the land of Judah and the 
 cities thereof, The Lord bless you, O habitation of justice and 
 mountain of holiness!</I> This intimates that they shall return much 
 reformed and every way better; and this reformation shall be so 
 conspicuous that all about them shall take notice of it. The 
 <I>cities,</I> that used to be nests of pirates, shall be 
 <I>habitations of justice;</I> the <I>mountain of Israel</I> (so the 
 whole land is called, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:54">Ps. lxxviii. 54</A>),

 and especially Mount Zion, shall be a <I>mountain of holiness.</I>
 Observe, Justice towards men, and holiness towards God, must go 
 together. Godliness and honesty are what God has joined, and let no
 man think to put them asunder, not to make one to atone for the want of 
 the other. It is well with a people when they come out of trouble thus 
 refined, and it is a sure presage of further happiness. And we may
 with great comfort pray for the blessing of God upon those houses that 
 are <I>habitations of justice,</I> those cities and countries that are 
 <I>mountains of holiness.</I> There the Lord will undoubtedly 
 <I>command the blessing.</I>

 2. There shall be great plenty of all good things among them 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>):

 <I>There shall dwell in Judah itself,</I> even in it, though it has now 
 long lain waste, both husbandmen and shepherds, the two ancient and 
 honourable employments of Cain and Abel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:2">Gen. iv. 2</A>.

 It is comfortable dwelling in a <I>habitation of justice</I> and a
 <I>mountain of holiness.</I> "And the husbandmen and shepherds shall 
 eat of the fruit of their labours; for I have <I>satiated the weary and 
 sorrowful soul;</I>" that is, those that came weary from their journey, 
 and have been long sorrowful in their captivity, shall now enjoy great 
 plenty. This is applicable to the spiritual blessings God has in store
 for all true penitents, for all that are just and holy; they shall be 
 abundantly satisfied with divine graces and comforts. In the love and 
 favour of God the weary soul shall find rest and the sorrowful soul 
 joy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The prophet tells us what pleasure the discovery of this brought to
 his mind, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 The foresights God had given him sometimes of the calamities of Judah 
 and Jerusalem were exceedingly painful to him (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:19"><I>ch.</I> iv. 19</A>),

 but these views were pleasant ones, though at a distance. "<I>Upon
 this I awaked,</I> overcome with joy, which burst the fetters of sleep; 
 and I reflected upon my dream, and it was such as had made <I>my sleep 
 sweet to me;</I> I was refreshed, as men are with quiet sleep." Those 
 may sleep sweetly that lie down and rise up in the favour of God and in 
 communion with him. Nor is any prospect in this world more pleasing to 
 good men, and good ministers, than that of the flourishing state of the 
 church of God. What can we see with more satisfaction than <I>the good 
 of Jerusalem, all the days of our life, and peace upon Israel?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>27  Behold, the days come, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that I will sow the
 house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and
 with the seed of beast.
 &nbsp; 28  And it shall come to pass, <I>that</I> like as I have watched
 over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and
 to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build,
 and to plant, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 29  In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten
 a sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge.
 &nbsp; 30  But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that
 eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.
 &nbsp; 31  Behold, the days come, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that I will make a
 new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of
 Judah:
 &nbsp; 32  Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers
 in the day <I>that</I> I took them by the hand to bring them out of
 the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was
 a husband unto them, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 &nbsp; 33  But this <I>shall be</I> the covenant that I will make with the
 house of Israel; After those days, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, I will put my
 law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will
 be their God, and they shall be my people.
 &nbsp; 34  And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and
 every man his brother, saying, Know the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: for they shall all
 know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember
 their sin no more.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet, having found his sleep sweet, made so by the revelations 
 of divine grace, sets himself to sleep again, in hopes of further 
 discoveries, and is not disappointed; for it is here further 
 promised,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That the people of God shall become both numerous and prosperous. 
 Israel and Judah shall be replenished both with men and cattle, as if 
 they were sown with the seed of both, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 They shall increase and multiply like a field sown with corn; and this 
 is the product of God's blessing 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 for whom God blessed, to them he said, <I>Be fruitful.</I> This should 
 be a type of the wonderful increase of the gospel-church. God will 
 build them, and plant them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 He <I>will watch over them</I> to do them good; no opportunity shall be 
 lost that may further their prosperity. Every thing for a long time had 
 turned so much against them, and all occurrences did so transpire to 
 ruin them, that it seemed as if God had <I>watched over them to pluck 
 up and to throw down;</I> but now every thing that falls out shall 
 happily fall in to strengthen and advance their interests. God will be
 as ready to comfort those that repent of their sins, and are humbled 
 for them, as he is to punish those that continue in love with their 
 sins, and are hardened in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That they shall be reckoned with no further for the sins of their 
 fathers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:29,30"><I>v.</I> 29, 30</A>):

 <I>They shall say no more</I> (they shall have no more occasion to say) 
 that <I>God visits the iniquity of the parents upon the children,</I> 
 which God had done in the captivity, for the sins of their ancestors 
 came into the account against them, particularly those of Manasseh: 
 this they had complained of as a hardship. Other scriptures justify God 
 in this method of proceeding, and our Saviour tells the wicked Jews in 
 his days that they should smart for their fathers' sins, because they 
 persisted in them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:35,36">Matt. xxiii. 35, 36</A>.

 But it is here promised that this severe dispensation with them should
 now be brought to an end, that God would proceed no further in his 
 controversy with them for their fathers' sins, but remember for them 
 his covenant with their fathers and do them good according to that 
 covenant: <I>They shall no more</I> complain, as they have done, that
 <I>the fathers have eaten sour grapes and the children's teeth are set 
 on edge</I> (which speaks something of an absurdity, and is an 
 invidious reflection upon God's proceedings), but <I>every one shall 
 die for his own iniquity</I> still; though God will cease to punish 
 them in their national capacity, yet he will still reckon with 
 particular persons that provoke him. Note, Public salvations will give 
 no impunity, no security, to private sinners: still every man that 
 <I>eats the sour grapes</I> shall have his <I>teeth set on edge.</I> 
 Note, Those that eat forbidden fruit, how tempting soever it looks, 
 will find it a <I>sour grape,</I> and it will <I>set their teeth on 
 edge;</I> sooner or later they will feel from it and reflect upon it 
 with bitterness. There is as direct a tendency in sin to make a man 
 uneasy as there is in sour grapes to set the teeth on edge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That God will renew his covenant with them, so that all these 
 blessings they shall have, not by providence only, but by promise, and 
 thereby they shall be both sweetened and secured. But this covenant 
 refers to gospel times, the latter days that <I>shall come;</I> for of 
 gospel grace the apostle understands it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:8,9">Heb. viii. 8, 9</A>,

 &c.), where this whole passage is quoted as a summary of the covenant
 of grace made with believers in Jesus Christ. Observe, 

 1. Who the persons are with whom this covenant is made--<I>with the
 house of Israel and Judah,</I> with the gospel church, <I>the Israel of 
 God</I> on which <I>peace shall be</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:16">Gal. vi. 16</A>),

 with the spiritual seed of believing Abraham and praying Jacob. Judah
 and Israel had been two separate kingdoms, but were united after their 
 return, in the joint favours God bestowed upon them; so Jews and 
 Gentiles were in the gospel church and covenant.

 2. What is the nature of this covenant in general: it is a <I>new
 covenant</I> and <I>not according to the covenant made with them when 
 they came out of Egypt;</I> not as if that made with them at Mount 
 Sinai were a covenant of nature and innocency, such as was made with 
 Adam in the day he was created; no, that was, for substance, a covenant 
 of grace, but it was a dark dispensation of that covenant in comparison 
 with this in gospel times. Sinners were saved by that covenant upon 
 their repentance, and faith in a Messiah to come, whose blood, 
 confirming that covenant, was typified by that of the legal sacrifices, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+24:7,8">Exod. xxiv. 7, 8</A>.

 Yet this may upon many accounts be called new, in comparison with that;
 the ordinances and promises are more spiritual and heavenly, and the 
 discoveries much more clear. That covenant God made with them when he 
 <I>took them by the hand,</I> as they had been blind, or lame, or weak, 
 <I>to lead them out of the land of Egypt, which covenant they 
 broke.</I> Observe, It was God that made this covenant, but it was the 
 people that broke it; for our salvation is of God, but our sin and ruin 
 are of ourselves. It was an aggravation of their breach of it that God 
 <I>was a husband to them,</I> that he had espoused them to himself; it 
 was a marriage-covenant that was between him and them, which they broke 
 by idolatry, that spiritual adultery. It is a great aggravation of our 
 treacherous departures from God that he has been a husband to us, a 
 loving, tender, careful husband, faithful to us, and yet we false to 
 him.

 3. What are the particular articles of his covenant. They all contain
 spiritual blessings; not, "I will give them the land of Canaan and a 
 numerous issue," but, "I will give them pardon, and peace, and grace, 
 good heads and good hearts." He promises,

 (1.) That he will incline them to their duty; <I>I will put my law in 
 their inward part and write it in their heart;</I> not, I will give 
 them a new law (as Mr. Gataker well observes), for Christ <I>came not 
 to destroy the law, but to fulfil it;</I> but the law shall be written 
 in their hearts by the finger of the Spirit as formerly it was written 
 in the tables of stone. God writes his law in the hearts of all 
 believers, makes it ready and familiar to them, at hand when they have 
 occasion to use it, as that which is <I>written in the heart,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:3">Prov. iii. 3</A>.

 He makes them in care to observe it, for that which we are solicitous 
 about is said to lie near our hearts. He works in them a disposition to 
 obedience, a conformity of thought and affection to the rules of the 
 divine law, as that of the copy to the original. This is here promised, 
 and ought to be prayed for, that our duty may be done conscientiously 
 and with delight.

 (2.) That he will take them into relation to himself: <I>I will be 
 their God,</I> a God all-sufficient to them, <I>and they shall be my 
 people,</I> a loyal obedient people to me. God's being to us a God is 
 the summary of all happiness; heaven itself is no more, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:16,Re+21:3">Heb. xi. 16; Rev. xxi. 3</A>.

 Our being to him a people may be taken either as the condition on our 
 part (those and those only shall have God to be to them a God that are 
 truly willing to engage themselves to be to him a people) or as a 
 further branch of the promise that God will by his grace make us his 
 people, a <I>willing people, in the day of his power;</I> and, whoever 
 are his people, it is his grace that makes them so.

 (3.) That there shall be an abundance of the knowledge of God among all 
 sorts of people, and this will have an influence upon all good: for 
 those that rightly know God's name will seek him, and serve him, and 
 put their trust in him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>):

 <I>All shall know me;</I> all shall be welcome to the knowledge of God 
 and shall have the means of that knowledge; <I>his ways shall be known 
 upon earth,</I> whereas, for many ages, <I>in Judah only was God 
 known.</I> Many more shall know God than did in the Old Testament 
 times, which among the Gentiles were times of ignorance, the true God 
 being to them an unknown God. The things of God shall in gospel times 
 be made more plain and intelligible, and level to the capacities of the 
 meanest, than they were while Moses had a <I>veil upon his face.</I> 
 There shall be such a general knowledge of God that there shall not be 
 so much need as had formerly been of teaching. Some take it as a 
 hyperbolical expression (and the dulness of the Jews needed such 
 expressions to awaken them), designed only to show that the knowledge 
 of God in gospel times should vastly exceed that knowledge of him which 
 they had under the law. Or perhaps it intimates that in gospel times 
 there shall be such great plenty of public preaching, statedly and 
 constantly, by men authorized and appointed to <I>preach the word in 
 season and out of season,</I> much beyond what was under the law, that 
 there shall be less need than there was then of fraternal teaching, by 
 a neighbour and a brother. The priests preached but now and then, and 
 in the temple, and to a few in comparison; but now all shall or may 
 know God by frequenting the assemblies of Christians, wherein, through 
 all parts of the church, the good knowledge of God shall be taught. 
 Some give this sense of it (Mr. Gataker mentions it), That many shall
 have such clearness of understanding in the things of God that they may 
 seem rather to have been taught by some immediate irradiation than by 
 any means of instruction. In short, the things of God shall by the 
 gospel of Christ be brought to a clearer light than ever 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:10">2 Tim. i. 10</A>),

 and the people of God shall by the grace of Christ be brought to a
 clearer sight of those things than ever,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:17,18">Eph. i. 17, 18</A>.

 (4.) That, in order to all these blessings, sin shall be pardoned.
 This is made the reason of all the rest: <I>For I will forgive their 
 iniquity,</I> will not impute that to them, nor deal with them 
 according to the desert of that, <I>will forgive</I> and forget: <I>I 
 will remember their sin no more.</I> It is sin that keeps good things 
 from us, that stops the current of God's favours; let sin betaken away 
 by pardoning mercy, and the obstruction is removed, and divine grace 
 runs down like a river, like a mighty stream.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Glorious things have been spoken in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:1-34">foregoing verses</A>

 concerning the gospel church, which that epocha of the Jewish church
 that was to commence at the return from captivity would at length 
 terminate in, and which all those promises were to have their full 
 accomplishment in. But may we depend upon these promises? Yes, we have 
 here a ratification of them, and the utmost assurance imaginable given 
 of the perpetuity of the blessings contained in them. The great thing 
 here secured to us is that while the world stands God will have a 
 church in it, which, though sometimes it may be brought very low, shall 
 yet be raised again, and its interests re-established; it is <I>built 
 upon a rock, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.</I> 
 Now here are two things offered for the confirmation of our faith in 
 this matter--the building of the world and the rebuilding of 
 Jerusalem.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The building of the world, and the firmness and lastingness of that 
 building, are evidences of the power and faithfulness of that God who 
 has undertaken the establishment of his church. <I>He that built all 
 things</I> at first <I>is God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:4">Heb. iii. 4</A>),

 and the same is he that makes all things now. The constancy of the
 glories of the kingdom of nature may encourage us to depend upon the 
 divine promise for the continuance of the glories of the kingdom of 
 grace, for <I>this is as the waters of Noah,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:9">Isa. liv. 9</A>.

 Let us observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The glories of the kingdom of nature, and infer thence how happy 
 those are that have this God, the God of nature, to be their God for 
 ever and ever. Take notice, 

 (1.) Of the steady and regular motion of the heavenly bodies, which God 
 is the first mover and supreme director of: <I>He gives the sun for a 
 light by day</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>),

 not only made it at first to be so, but still gives it to be so; for 
 the light and heat, and all the influences of the sun, continually 
 depend upon its great Creator. He gives <I>the ordinances of the moon 
 and stars for a light by night;</I> their motions are called 
 <I>ordinances</I> both because they are regular and by rule and because 
 they are determined and under rule. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:31-33">Job xxxviii. 31-33</A>.

 (2.) Take notice of the government of the sea, and the check that is 
 given to its proud billows: <I>The Lord of hosts divides the sea,</I> 
 or (as some read it) <I>settles the sea, when the waves thereof roar 
 (divide et impera--divide and rule</I>); when it is most tossed God 
 keeps it within compass 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:22">Jer. v. 22</A>),

 and soon quiets it and makes it calm again. The power of God is to be
 magnified by us, not only in maintaining the regular motions of the 
 heavens, but in controlling the irregular motions of the seas.

 (3.) Take notice of the vastness of the heavens and the unmeasurable 
 extent of the firmament; he must needs be a great God who manages such 
 a great world as this is; the <I>heavens above cannot be measured</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>),
 
 and yet God fills them.

 (4.) Take notice of the mysteriousness even of that part of the 
 creation in which our lot is cast and which we are most conversant 
 with. <I>The foundations of the earth cannot be searched out 
 beneath,</I> for the Creator <I>hangs the earth upon nothing</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+26:7">Job xxvi. 7</A>),

 and we <I>know not how the foundations thereof are fastened,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:6">Job xxxviii. 6</A>.

 (5.) Take notice of the immovable stedfastness of all these 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>):
 
 <I>These ordinances cannot depart from before God;</I> he has all the 
 hosts of heaven and earth continually under his eye and all the motions 
 of both; he has established them, and they abide, <I>abide according to 
 his ordinance, for all are his servants,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:90,91">Ps. cxix. 90, 91</A>.

 The heavens are often clouded, and the sun and moon often eclipsed, the
 earth may quake and the sea be tossed, but they all keep their place, 
 are moved, but not removed. Herein we must acknowledge the power, 
 goodness, and faithfulness of the Creator.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The securities of the kingdom of grace inferred hence: we may be 
 confident of this very thing that <I>the seed of Israel shall not cease 
 from being a nation,</I> for the spiritual Israel, the gospel church, 
 shall be <I>a holy nation, a peculiar people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:9">1 Pet. ii. 9</A>.

 When Israel according to the flesh is no longer a nation the
 <I>children of the promise are counted for the seed</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:8">Rom. ix. 8</A>)

 and God <I>will not cast off all the seed of Israel,</I> no, not <I>for
 all that they have done,</I> though they have done very wickedly,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 He justly might cast them off, but he will not. Though he cast them out 
 from their land, and cast them down for a time, yet he will not cast 
 them off. Some of them he casts off, but not all; to this the apostle
 seems to refer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:1">Rom. xi. 1</A>),

 <I>Hath God cast away his people? God forbid</I> that we should think
 so! For

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 <I>at this time there is a remnant,</I> enough to save the credit of 
 the promise that God <I>will not cast off all the seed of Israel,</I> 
 though many among them throw away themselves by unbelief. Now we may be 
 assisted in the belief of this by considering,

 (1.) That the God that has undertaken the preservation of the church is 
 a God of almighty power, who <I>upholds all things by his</I> almighty 
 <I>word. Our help stands in his name who made heaven and earth,</I> and 
 therefore can do any thing. 

 (2.) That God would not take all this care of the world but that he 
 designs to have some glory to himself out of it; and how shall he have 
 it but by securing to himself a church in it, a people that <I>shall be 
 to him for a name and a praise?</I> 

 (3.) That if the order of the creation therefore continues firm because 
 it was well-fixed at first, and is not altered because it needs no 
 alteration, the method of grace shall for the same reason continue 
 invariable, as it was a first well settled.

 (4.) That he who has promised to preserve a church for himself has 
 approved himself faithful to the word which he has spoken concerning 
 the stability of the world. He that is true to his covenant with Noah
 and his sons, because he established it for an <I>everlasting 
 covenant</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:9,16">Gen. ix. 9, 16</A>),

 will not, we may be sure, be false to his covenant with Abraham and his
 seed, his spiritual seed, for that also is an <I>everlasting 
 covenant.</I> Even that which they have done amiss, though they have 
 done much, shall not prevail to defeat the gracious intentions of the 
 covenant. See

 II. The rebuilding of Jerusalem which was now in ruins, and the 
 enlargement and establishment of that, shall be an earnest of these 
 great things that God will do for the gospel church, the <I>heavenly 
 Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:38-40"><I>v.</I> 38-40</A>.

 <I>The days will come,</I> though they may be long in coming, when,

 1. Jerusalem shall be entirely built again, as large as ever it was;
 the dimensions are here exactly described by the places through which 
 the circumference passed, and no doubt the wall which Nehemiah built, 
 and which, the more punctually to fulfil the prophecy, began about the 
 <I>tower of Hananeel,</I> here mentioned

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+3:1">Neh. iii. 1</A>),

 enclosed as much ground as is here intended, though we cannot certainly
 determine the places here called <I>the gate of the corner, the hill 
 Gareb,</I> &c.

 2. When built it shall be consecrated to God and to his service. It
 <I>shall be built to the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>),

 and even the suburbs and fields adjacent <I>shall be holy unto the 
 Lord.</I> It shall not be polluted with idols as formerly, but God 
 shall be praised and honoured there; the whole city shall be as it were 
 one temple, one holy place, as the new Jerusalem is, which 
 <I>therefore</I> has no temple, because it is all temple.

 3. Being thus built by virtue of the promise of God, <I>it shall not be
 plucked up, nor thrown down, any more for ever;</I> that is, it shall 
 continue very long, the time of the new city from the return to its 
 last destruction being fully as long as that of the old from David to 
 the captivity. But this promise was to have its full accomplishment in 
 the gospel church, which, as it is the spiritual Israel, and therefore 
 God will not cast it off, so it is the holy city, and therefore all the 
 powers of men <I>shall not pluck it up, nor throw it down.</I> It may 
 lie waste for a time, as Jerusalem did, but shall recover itself, shall 
 weather the storm and gain its point, <I>and the gates of hell shall 
 not prevail against it.</I></P>
