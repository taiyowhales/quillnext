 In this chapter we have, 

 I. Another vision which the prophet saw, not for his own entertainment,
 but for his satisfaction and the edification of those to whom he was 
 sent, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. A sermon upon it, in the rest of the chapter, 

 1. By way of explication of the vision, showing it to be a prediction
 of the replenishing of Jerusalem and of its safety and honour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>.
 
 2. By way of application. Here is, 

 (1.) A use of exhortation to the Jews that were yet in Babylon,
 pressing them to hasten their return to their own land, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:6-9">ver. 6-9</A>.

 (2.) A use of consolation to those that were returned, in reference to
 the many difficulties they had to struggle with, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:10-12">ver. 10-12</A>.

 (3.) A use of caution to all not to prescribe to God, or limit him, but 
 patiently to wait for him,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man
 with a measuring line in his hand.
 &nbsp; 2 Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To
 measure Jerusalem, to see what <I>is</I> the breadth thereof, and what
 <I>is</I> the length thereof.
 &nbsp; 3 And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and
 another angel went out to meet him,
 &nbsp; 4 And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying,
 Jerusalem shall be inhabited <I>as</I> towns without walls for the
 multitude of men and cattle therein:
 &nbsp; 5 For I, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, will be unto her a wall of fire round
 about, and will be the glory in the midst of her.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This prophet was ordered, in God's name, to assure the people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:16"><I>ch.</I> i. 16</A>)

 that a <I>line should be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.</I> Now here
 we have that promise illustrated and confirmed, that the prophet might 
 deliver that part of his message to the people with the more clearness 
 and assurance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He sees, in a vision, a man going to measure Jerusalem 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>):
 
 <I>He lifted up his eyes again, and looked.</I> God had shown him that 
 which was very encouraging to him, 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:20"><I>ch.</I> i. 20</A>),

 and therefore now he <I>lifted up his eyes again and looked.</I> Note,
 The comfortable sights which by faith we have had of God's goodness 
 made to pass before us should engage us to lift up our eyes again, and 
 to search further into the discoveries made to us of the divine grace; 
 for there is still more to be seen. In the close of the foregoing 
 chapter he had seen Jerusalem's enemies baffled and broken, so that now 
 he begins to hope she shall not be ruined. But that is not enough to 
 make her happy, and therefore that is not all that is promised. Here is 
 more carpenter's work to be done. When David had resolved to <I>cut off 
 the horns of the wicked</I> he engaged likewise that the <I>horns of 
 the righteous</I> should be <I>exalted,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+75:10">Ps. lxxv. 10</A>.

 And so does the <I>Son of David</I> here; for he is <I>the man,</I>
 even <I>the man Christ Jesus,</I> whom the prophet sees <I>with a 
 measuring line in his hand;</I> for he is the master builder of his 
 church

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:3">Heb. iii. 3</A>),

 and he builds exactly by line and level. Zechariah took the boldness to
 ask him <I>whither he was going</I> and what he designed to do with 
 that measuring line. And he readily told him that he was going to 
 <I>measure Jerusalem,</I> to take a particular account of the 
 dimensions of it each way, that it might be computed what was necessary 
 for the making of a wall about it, and that it might appear, by 
 comparing its dimensions with the vast numbers that should inhabit it, 
 what additions were necessary to be made for the receiving and 
 containing of them; when multitudes flock to Jerusalem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:4">Isa. lx. 4</A>)

 it is time for her to <I>enlarge the place of her tent,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:2">Isa. liv. 2</A>.
 
 Note, God takes notice of the extent of his church, and will take care
 that, when ever so many guests are brought in to the wedding supper, 
 still there <I>shall be room,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:22">Luke xiv. 22</A>.

 <I>In</I> the New Jerusalem, <I>my Father's house</I> above, <I>there
 are many mansions.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He is informed that this vision means well to Jerusalem, that the 
 measuring line he saw was not a <I>line of confusion</I> (as that 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:11">Isa. xxxiv. 11</A>),

 not a line to mete out for destruction, as when God <I>purposed to
 destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion he stretched out a line</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:8">Lam. ii. 8</A>);

 but it is as when he <I>divided the inheritance by line,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:55">Ps. lxxviii. 55</A>.

 The <I>angel that talked with</I> the prophet <I>went forth,</I> as he
 designed, <I>to measure Jerusalem,</I> but <I>another angel went out to 
 meet him,</I> to desire that he would first explain this vision to the 
 prophet, that it might not occasion him any uneasy speculations: 
 <I>Run, and speak to this young man</I> (for, it seems, the prophet 
 entered upon his prophecy when he was young, yet no man ought to 
 despise his youth when God thus highly honoured it); he is a young man, 
 not experienced, and may be ready to fear the worst; therefore bid him 
 hope the best; tell him that Jerusalem shall be both safe and great,

 1. As safe and great as numbers of men can make it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls;</I> the
 inhabitants of it shall increase, and multiply, and replenish it to 
 admiration, so that it shall extend itself far beyond the present 
 dimensions which now there is an account taken of. The walls of a
 city, as they defend it, so they straiten and confine it, and keep its 
 inhabitants from multiplying beyond such a pitch; but Jerusalem, even 
 when it is walled, to keep off the enemy, shall be inhabited <I>as 
 towns without walls.</I> The city shall be in a manner lost in the 
 suburbs, as London is, where the out-parishes are more populous than 
 those within the walls. So shall it be with Jerusalem; it shall be 
 extended as freely as if it had no walls at all, and yet shall be as 
 safe as if it had the strongest walls, such a <I>multitude of men</I> 
 (which are the best walls of a city) <I>shall there be therein,</I> and 
 of <I>cattle too,</I> to be not only food, but wealth too, for those 
 men. Note, The increase of the numbers of a people is a great blessing, 
 is a fruit of God's blessing on them and an earnest of further 
 blessings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:38">Ps. cvii. 38</A>.
 
 <I>They are multiplied, for he blesses them.</I>
 
 2. As safe and great as the presence of God can make it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 (1.) It shall be safe, for God himself will be a <I>wall of fire round
 about it.</I> Jerusalem had no walls about it at this time, but lay 
 naked and exposed; formerly, when it had walls, the enemies not only 
 broke through them, but broke them down; but now God will be unto her a 
 wall of fire. Some think it alludes to shepherds that made fires about 
 their flocks, or travellers that made fires about their tents in desert 
 places, to frighten wild beasts from them. God will not only <I>make a 
 hedge</I> about them as he did about Job

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:10"><I>ch.</I> i. 10</A>),

 not only make walls and bulwarks about them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:1">Isa. xxvi. 1</A>

 (those may be battered down), not only be as the mountains round about
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+125:2">Ps. cxxv. 2</A>

 (mountains may be got over), but he will be a wall of fire round them,
 which cannot be broken through, nor scaled, nor undermined, nor the 
 foundations of it sapped, nor can it be attempted, or approached, 
 without danger to the assailants. God will not only make a wall of fire 
 about her, but he will himself be such a wall; for <I>our God is a 
 consuming fire</I> to his and his church's enemies. He is a wall of 
 fire, not on one side only, but round about on every side.

 (2.) It shall be great, for God himself <I>will be the glory in the
 midst of it.</I> His temple, his altar, shall be set up and attended 
 there, and his institutions observed, and there then shall the tokens 
 of his special presence and favour be, which will be the glory in the 
 midst of them, will make them truly admirable in the eyes of all about 
 them. God will have honour from them, and put honour upon them. Note, 
 Those that have God for their God have him for their glory; those that 
 have him in the midst of them have glory in the midst of them, and 
 thence the church is said to be <I>all glorious within.</I> And those 
 persons and places that have God to be the glory in the midst of them 
 have him for a wall of fire round about them, for <I>upon all that 
 glory there is,</I> and shall be, <I>a defence,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+4:5">Isa. iv. 5</A>.

 Now all this was fulfilled in part in Jerusalem, which in process of
 time became a very flourishing city, and made a very great figure in 
 those parts of the world, much beyond what could have been expected, 
 considering how low it was brought and how long it was ere it recovered 
 itself; but it was to have its full accomplishment in the 
 gospel-church, which is extended far, as towns without walls, by the 
 admission of the Gentiles into it, and which has God, the Son of God, 
 for its prince and protector.</P>

 One would have thought that Cyrus's proclamation, which gave liberty to 
 the captive Jews to return to their own land, would suffice to bring 
 them all back, and that, as when Pharaoh gave them leave to quit Egypt 
 and their house of bondage there, they would not leave a hoof behind; 
 but it seems it had not that effect. There were about 40,000 whose 
 spirits God stirred up to go, and they went; but many, perhaps the 
 greater part, staid behind. The land of their captivity was to most of 
 them the land of their nativity; they had taken root there, had gained 
 a settlement, and many of them a very comfortable one; some perhaps had 
 got estates and preferments there, and they did not think they could 
 better themselves by returning to their own land. <I>Patria est 
 ubicunque bene est--My country is every spot where I feel myself
 happy.</I> They had no great affection to their own land, and 
 apprehended the difficulties in their way to it insuperable. This 
 proceeded from a bad cause--a distrust of the power and promise of God,
 a love of ease and worldly wealth, and an indifference to the religion 
 of their country and to the God of Israel himself; and it had a bad 
 effect, for it was a tacit censure of those as foolish, rash, and given 
 to change, that did return, and a weakening of their hands in the work 
 of God. Such as these could not sing 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:1-9">Ps. cxxxvii.</A>)

 in their captivity, for they had <I>forgotten thee, O Jerusalem!</I>
 and were so far from preferring thee before their chief joy that they 
 preferred any joy before thee. Here is therefore another proclamation
 issued out by the God of Israel, strictly charging and commanding all 
 his free-born subjects, wherever they were dispersed, speedily to 
 return into their own land and render themselves at their respective 
 posts there. They are loudly summoned

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Ho! ho! come forth, and flee from the land of the north, saith the 
 Lord.</I> This fitly follows upon the promise of the rebuilding and 
 enlarging of Jerusalem. If God will build it for them and their 
 comfort, they must come and inhabit it for him and his glory, and not 
 continue sneaking in Babylon. Note, The promises and privileges with 
 which God's people are blessed should engage us, whatever it cost us, 
 to join ourselves to them and <I>cast in our lot among them.</I> When 
 Zion is enlarged, to make room for all God's Israel, it is the greatest 
 madness imaginable for any of them to stay in Babylon. The captivity of 
 a sinful state is by no means to be continued in, though a man be ever 
 so easy upon temporal accounts. No: <I>Come forth and flee</I> with all 
 speed, and lose no time. <I>Escape for thy life; look not behind 
 thee.</I> To induce them to hasten their return, let them consider, 

 1. They are now dispersed, and are concerned to incorporate themselves
 for their mutual common defence

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>I have spread you abroad as the four winds of heaven,</I> sent some 
 into one corner of the world and some into another; this has been your 
 condition a long time, and therefore you should now think of coming 
 together again, to help one another." God owns that his scattering them 
 was in wrath, and therefore they must take this invitation as a token 
 of God's being willing to be reconciled to them again, so that they 
 kicked at his kindness in refusing to accept the call. 

 2. They are now in bondage, and are concerned to assert their own
 liberty; and therefore, "<I>Deliver thyself, O Zion!</I> flee from the 
 oppressor, and make the best of thy way. Let us see some such bold 
 efforts and struggles to help thyself as become the generous gracious 
 seed of Abraham."

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Note, When Christ has proclaimed that deliverance to the captives which
 he has himself wrought out it then concerns each of us to <I>deliver
 ourselves,</I> to <I>loose ourselves from the bands of our necks</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:2">Isa. lii. 2</A>),

 and, since we are under grace, to resolve that <I>sin shall not have 
 dominion over us,</I> Zion herself is here said to <I>dwell with the 
 daughter of Babylon,</I> because many of the <I>precious sons of 
 Zion</I> dwelt there, and where the people of God are there the church 
 of God is, for it is not tied to places. Now it is not fit that Zion 
 should dwell with the daughter of Babylon; what communion can light 
 have with darkness? Zion will be in danger of partaking with the 
 daughter of Babylon both <I>in her sins</I> and <I>in her plagues;</I> 
 and therefore, "<I>Come out of her, my people,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:4">Rev. xviii. 4</A>.

 <I>Deliver thyself, O Zion!</I> by a speedy return to thy own land, and 
 do not destroy thyself by continuing in that polluted devoted land." 
 Those that would be found among the generation of God's children must 
 <I>save themselves from</I> the <I>untoward generation</I> of this 
 world; it was St. Peter's charge to his new converts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:40">Acts ii. 40</A>.

 3. They have seemed to be forsaken and forgotten of God, but God will
 now make it to appear that he espouses their cause and will plead it 
 with jealousy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 It was a discouragement to those who remained in Babylon to hear of the 
 difficulties and oppositions which their brethren met with that had 
 returned, by which they were still in danger of being crushed and 
 overpowered. "And we might as well sit still" (think they) "as rise up 
 and fall." In answer to this objection, the <I>angel that talked 
 with</I> the prophet (that is, Jesus Christ) tells him what he had 
 commission to do for their protection and the perfecting of their 
 salvation, and herein he has an eye to the great redemption which, in 
 the fulness of time, he was to be the author of. Christ, who is
 Jehovah, and the <I>Lord of hosts,</I> of all the hosts of heaven and 
 earth, in both which he has a sovereign power, <I>says, He</I> (that 
 is, the Father) <I>has sent me.</I> Note, What Jesus has done, and 
 does, for his church against his enemies, he was sent and commissioned 
 by the Father to do. With great satisfaction he often speaks of <I>the 
 Father that sent him.</I> 

 (1.) He is sent <I>after the glory.</I> After the glorious beginning of
 their deliverance he is sent to perfect it, for he is the finisher of
 that work which he is the author of. Christ is sent, in the first
 place, to the nation and people of the Jews, <I>to whom pertained the
 glory,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:4">Rom. ix. 4</A>.

 And he was himself the <I>glory of his people Israel.</I> But <I>after
 the glory,</I> after his care of them, he is <I>sent to the nations, to 
 be a light to lighten the Gentiles,</I> by the power of his gospel to 
 captivate them, and bring them, and every high thought among them, into 
 obedience to himself.

 (2.) He is <I>sent to the nations that spoiled them,</I> to take
 vengeance on them for the wrongs done to Zion, when the year of his
 redeemed comes and the <I>year of recompences for the controversy of
 Zion,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:8">Isa. xxxiv. 8</A>.

 He is sent to <I>shake his hand upon them,</I> to lift up his mighty
 hand against them and to lay upon them his heavy hand, to <I>bruise
 them with a rod of iron</I> and <I>dash them in pieces like a potter's
 vessel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:9">Ps. ii. 9</A>.

 Some think it intimates how easily God can subdue and humble them with
 the turn of his hand; it is but shaking his hand over them and the work 
 is done. <I>They shall be a spoil to their servants,</I> shall be
 enslaved to those whom they had enslaved, and be plundered by those 
 whom they had plundered. In Esther's time this was fulfilled, when the 
 <I>Jews had rule over those that hated them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:1">Esth. ix. 1</A>),

 and often in the time of the Maccabees. The promise is further
 fulfilled in Christ's victory over our spiritual enemies, his
 <I>spoiling principalities and powers and making a show of them
 openly,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:15">Col. ii. 15</A>.

 And it is still in force to the gospel-church. Christ will reckon with
 all that are enemies to it, and sooner or later will make them <I>his 
 footstool,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:1,Re+3:9">Ps. cx. 1; Rev. iii. 9</A>.

 (3.) What he will do for his church shall be an evident proof of God's 
 tender care of it and affection to it: <I>He that touches you touches 
 the apple of his eye.</I> This is a high expression of God's love to 
 his church. By his resentment of the injuries done to her it appears 
 how dear she is to him, how he interests himself in all her interests, 
 and takes what is done against her, not only as done against himself, 
 but as done against the very apple of his eye, the tenderest part, 
 which nature has made very fine, has put a double guard upon, and 
 taught us to be in a special manner careful of, and which the least 
 touch is a great offence to. This encourages the people of God to pray 
 with David 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:8">Ps. xvii. 8</A>),

 <I>Keep me as the apple of thy eye;</I> and engages them to do as 
 Solomon directs

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+7:2">Prov. vii. 2</A>),

 to <I>keep his law as the apple of their eye.</I> Some understand it 
 thus: "<I>He that touches you touches the apple of his own eye;</I> 
 whoever do you any injury will prove, in the issue, to have done the 
 greatest injury to themselves." 

 (4.) It shall be an evident proof of Christ's mission: <I>You shall
 know that the Lord of hosts has sent me</I> to be the protector of his 
 church, that the promises made to the church are yea and amen in him. 
 Christ's victory over our spiritual enemies proves that the Father sent 
 him and was with him.</P>

 Here is, 

 I. Joy proclaimed to the church of God, to the <I>daughter of Zion,</I> 
 that had separated herself from the <I>daughter of Babylon.</I> The 
 Jews that had returned were in distress and danger, their enemies in 
 the neighbourhood were spiteful against them, their friends that 
 remained in Babylon were cool towards them, shy of them, and declined 
 coming in to their assistance; and yet they are directed to 
 <I>sing,</I> and to <I>rejoice</I> even in tribulation. Note, Those 
 that have recovered their purity, and integrity, and spiritual liberty, 
 though they have not yet recovered their outward prosperity, have 
 reason to sing and rejoice, to give glory to God and take comfort to 
 themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God will have a people among them. If their brethren in Babylon will 
 not come to them, those of other nations shall, and shall replenish 
 Jerusalem and the cities of Judah: <I>Many nations shall be joined to 
 the Lord in that day</I> that are now at a distance from him and 
 strangers to him. The Jewish nation, after the captivity, multiplied 
 very much, by the accession of proselytes to it, that were naturalized, 
 and were entitled to all the privileges of native Israelites, and 
 perhaps they were equal in number; and therefore Paul mentions it as an 
 honour to him which many Jews had not, that he was of <I>the tribe of 
 Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:5">Phil. iii. 5</A>.

 And this was an earnest of the bringing in of the Gentiles into the
 christian church and in that this and other similar promises were to 
 have their full accomplishment. It was therefore strange that that 
 should be so great an offence to the Jews, as we find it was in the 
 apostles' times, which was promised them as a blessing in the prophets' 
 times--that <I>many nations</I> should be <I>joined to the Lord.</I> 
 And, as there had been one law, so should there be one gospel <I>for 
 the stranger and for those born in the land;</I> whatever nation they 
 come from, when they <I>join themselves to the Lord, they shall be my 
 people,</I> as dear to God as ever Israel had been. Note, God will own 
 those for his people who with purpose of heart join themselves to him; 
 and, when many do so, we ought to look upon them, not with a jealous 
 eye, but with a joyful one. Angels rejoice, and therefore so should the 
 daughter of Zion, when many nations are joined to the Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They shall have his presence among them: <I>Sing and rejoice, for I 
 come.</I> Those to whom God comes have reason to rejoice, for he will 
 be to them their chief joy. God will come, not to make them a visit 
 only, but to reside with them and preside over them: <I>I will dwell in 
 the midst of thee</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),
 
 and it is repeated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 because it was to have a double accomplishment, 

 1. In the dedication of the temple, in their regularly observing all 
 God's institutions there and God's owning them therein. Those have God 
 <I>dwelling in the midst of them</I> that have his ordinances 
 administered in their purity, and a divine power going along with them; 
 with these tokens of God's presence the Jewish church was blessed, 
 after this, as much as ever. 

 2. In the incarnation of Christ. He that here promises to dwell among
 them is that <I>Lord whom the Lord of hosts has sent</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 and therefore must be the <I>Lord Jesus,</I> who came and dwelt in the 
 midst of the Jewish nation, the eternal <I>Word,</I> that was <I>made 
 flesh, and dwelt among us.</I> This was the great honour reserved for 
 that nation in its last days; the promise of it effectually secured 
 their continuance till it was accomplished. They could not be destroyed 
 while that blessing was in them; and the prospect of it, according to 
 the promise, was the great support and comfort of those who <I>looked 
 for redemption in Jerusalem.</I> It is promised that when Christ comes 
 and dwells among them <I>they shall know that the Lord of hosts has 
 sent him;</I> all that were Israelites indeed were made to know it; 
 sufficient proofs were given of it by the miracles Christ wrought, so 
 that they might have known it, and yet there were those that perished 
 in ignorance and unbelief, that would not know it, for, <I>if they had 
 known</I> it, <I>they would not have crucified the Lord of 
 glory.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They shall have all their ancient dignities and privileges 
 restored to them again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 1. Canaan shall be a holy land again, not polluted by sin as it had 
 been formerly, not profaned by the enemies as it had been of late; it 
 shall be an enclosure again, and not laid in common. 

 2. Judah shall be in this holy land, shall inhabit it, and enjoy the
 comfort of it, and no longer be lost and scattered in Babylon. 

 3. Judah shall be God's portion, which he will delight in, which shall
 be dear to him, by which he will be served, and in which he will be 
 glorified. <I>The Lord's portion is his people.</I>

 4. God will <I>inherit Judah</I> again as <I>his portion,</I> will
 claim his interest, and recover the possession out of the hands of 
 those that had invaded his right. He will protect his people and govern 
 them as a man does his inheritance, and will be at home among them. 

 5. He will <I>choose Jerusalem again,</I> as he had chosen it
 formerly, to <I>put his name there;</I> he will renew and confirm the 
 choice, and continue it a chosen place, till it must resign its honours 
 to the Jerusalem that is from above. Though the election seemed to be 
 set aside for a while, yet it <I>shall obtain.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is silence proclaimed to all the world besides, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 The daughter of Zion must sing, but <I>all flesh</I> must <I>be 
 silent.</I> Observe here, 

 1. A very awful description of God's appearances for the relief of his 
 people. He is <I>raised up out of his holy habitation;</I> as a man out 
 of sleep 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:23,78:65">Ps. xliv. 23; lxxviii. 65</A>),

 or as a man entering with resolution upon a business that he will go
 through with. Heaven is his holy habitation above; thence we must
 expect him to appear, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:1">Isa. lxiv. 1</A>.

 His temple is so in this lower world; thence from <I>between the
 cherubim</I> he will <I>shine forth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:1">Ps. lxxx. 1</A>.

 He is about to do something unusual, unexpected, and very surprising,
 and to plead his people's cause, which had long seemed neglected. 

 2. A seasonable caution and direction at such a time: <I>Be silent, O
 all flesh! before the Lord</I>--before Christ and his grace (let not 
 flesh object against the methods he takes)--before God and his
 providence; the enemies of the church shall be silenced; all iniquity 
 shall stop her mouth. The friends of the church also must be silent.
 Leave it to God to take his own way, and neither prescribe to him what 
 he should do nor quarrel with him whatever he does. <I>Be still, and 
 know that he is God. Stand still, and see his salvation.</I> See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:20,Zep+1:7">Hab. ii. 20; Zeph. i. 7</A>.

 Silently acquiesce in his holy will, and patiently wait the issue, as
 those who are assured that when God is <I>raised up out of his holy 
 habitation</I> he will not retreat, nor sit down again, till he has 
 accomplished his whole work.</P>
