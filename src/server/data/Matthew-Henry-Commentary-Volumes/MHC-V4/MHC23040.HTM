 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 At this chapter begins the latter part of the prophecy of this book,
 which is not only divided from the former by the historical chapters
 that come between, but seems to be distinguished from it in the scope
 and style of it. In the former part the name of the prophet was
 frequently prefixed to the particular sermons, besides the general
 title (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:1,7:3,13:1"><I>ch.</I> ii. 1; vii. 3; xiii. 1</A>);

 but this is all one continued discourse, and the prophet not so much as
 once named. That consisted of many burdens, many woes; this consists of
 many blessings. There the distress which the people of God were in by
 the Assyrian, and their deliverance out of that, were chiefly
 prophesied of; but that is here spoken of as a thing past 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:4"><I>ch.</I> lii. 4</A>);

 and the captivity in Babylon, and their deliverance out of that, which
 were much greater events, of more extensive and abiding concern, are
 here largely foretold. Before God sent his people into captivity he
 furnished them with precious promises for their support and comfort in
 their trouble; and we may well imagine of what great use to them the
 glorious, gracious, light of this prophecy was, in that cloudy and dark
 day, and how much it helped to dry up their tears by the rivers of
 Babylon. But it looks further yet, and to greater things; much of
 Christ and gospel grace we meet with in the foregoing part of this 
 book, but in this latter part we shall find much more; and, as if it 
 were designed for a prophetic summary of the New Testament, it begins 
 with that which begins the gospels, "The voice of one crying in the 
 wilderness" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:3"><I>ch.</I> xl. 3</A>),

 and concludes with that which concludes the book of the Revelation, 
 "The new heavens and the new earth," 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:22"><I>ch.</I> lxvi. 22</A>).

 Even Mr. White acknowledges that, as all the mercies of God to the
 Jewish nation bore some resemblance to those glorious things performed
 by our Saviour for man's redemption, so they are by the Spirit of God 
 expressed in such terms as show plainly that while the prophet is 
 speaking of the redemption of the Jews he had in his thoughts a more
 glorious deliverance. And we need not look for any further
 accomplishment of these prophecies yet to come; for if Jesus be he, and
 his kingdom be it, that should come, we are to look for no other, but
 the carrying on and completing of the same blessed work which was begun
 in the first preaching and planting of Christianity in the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have,

 I. Orders given to preach and publish the glad tidings of redemption,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+401,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. These glad tidings introduced by a voice in the wilderness, which
 gives assurance that all obstructions shall be removed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>),

 and that, though all creatures fail and fade, the word of God shall be
 established and accomplished,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:5-8">ver. 5-8</A>.

 III. A joyful prospect given to the people of God of the happiness
 which this redemption should bring along with it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:9-11">ver. 9-11</A>.

 IV. The sovereignty and power of that God magnified who undertakes to
 work out this redemption,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:12-17">ver. 12-17</A>.

 V. Idols therefore triumphed over and idolaters upbraided with their
 folly,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:18-26">ver. 18-26</A>.

 VI. A reproof given to the people of God for their fears and
 despondencies, and enough said, in a few words, to silence these fears,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:27-31">ver. 27-31</A>.

 And we, through patience and comfort of this scripture, may have hope.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.
 &nbsp; 2  Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her
 warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she
 hath received of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s hand double for all her sins.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the commission and instructions given, not to this prophet 
 only, but, with him, to all the Lord's prophets, nay, and to all 
 Christ's ministers, to proclaim comfort to God's people. 

 1. This did not only warrant, but enjoin, this prophet himself to
 encourage the good people who lived in his own time, who could not but 
 have very melancholy apprehensions of things when they saw Judah and 
 Jerusalem by their daring impieties ripening apace for ruin, and God in 
 his providence hastening ruin upon them. Let them be sure that, 
 notwithstanding all this, God had mercy in store for them. 

 2. It was especially a direction to the prophets that should live in 
 the time of captivity, when Jerusalem was in ruins; they must encourage 
 the captives to hope for enlargement in due time. 

 3. Gospel ministers, being employed by the blessed Spirit as
 comforters, and as helpers of the joy of Christians, are here put in 
 mind of their business. Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Comfortable words directed to God's people in general, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 The prophets have instructions from their God (for he is the <I>Lord 
 God of the holy prophets,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:6">Rev. xxii. 6</A>)

 to comfort the people of God; and the charge is doubled, <I>Comfort
 you, comfort you</I>--not because the prophets are unwilling to do it 
 (no, it is the most pleasant part of their work), but because sometimes 
 the souls of God's people refuse to be comforted, and their comforters 
 must repeat things again and again, ere they can fasten any thing upon 
 them. Observe here, 

 1. There are a people in the world that are God's people. 

 2. It is the will of God that his people should be a comforted people, 
 even in the worst of times. 

 3. It is the work and business of ministers to do what they can for the
 comfort of God's people. 

 4. Words of conviction, such as we had in the former part of this book, 
 must be followed with words of comfort, such as we have here; for he 
 that has torn will heal us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Comfortable words directed to Jerusalem in particular: "<I>Speak to 
 the heart of Jerusalem</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 speak that which will revive her heart, and be a cordial to her and to 
 all that belong to her and wish her well. Do not whisper it, but <I>cry 
 unto her:</I> cry aloud, to show saints their comforts as well as to 
 show sinners their transgressions; make her hear it:" 

 1. "That the days of her trouble are numbered and finished: <I>Her
 warfare is accomplished,</I> the set time of her servitude; the 
 campaign is now at an end, and she shall retire into quarters of 
 refreshment." Human life is a warfare

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:1">Job vii. 1</A>);

 the Christian life much more. But the struggle will not last always;
 the warfare will be accomplished, and then the good soldiers shall not 
 only enter into rest, but be sure of their pay.

 2. "That the cause of her trouble is removed, and, when that is taken
 away, the effect will cease. Tell her that <I>her iniquity is 
 pardoned,</I> God is reconciled to her, and she shall no longer be 
 treated as one guilty before him." Nothing can be spoken more 
 comfortably than this, <I>Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven 
 thee.</I> Troubles are <I>then</I> removed in love when sin is 
 pardoned. 

 3. "That the end of her trouble is answered: <I>She has received of the
 Lord double for</I> the cure of <I>all her sins,</I> sufficient, and 
 more than sufficient, to separate between her and her idols," the 
 worship of which was the great sin for which God had a controversy with 
 them, and from which he designed to reclaim them by their captivity in 
 Babylon: and it had that effect upon them; it begat in them a rooted 
 antipathy to idolatry, and was physic doubly strong for the purging out 
 of that iniquity. Or it may be taken as the language of the divine 
 compassion: <I>His soul was grieved for the misery of Israel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:16">Judges x. 16</A>),

 and, like a tender father, <I>since he spoke against them he earnestly
 remembered them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:20">Jer. xxxi. 20</A>),

 and was ready to say that he had given them too much correction. They,
 being very penitent, acknowledged that God has <I>punished them less 
 than their iniquities deserved;</I> but he, being very pitiful, owned, 
 in a manner, that he had punished them more than they deserved. True 
 penitents have indeed, in Christ and his sufferings, <I>received of the 
 Lord's hand double for all their sins;</I> for the satisfaction Christ 
 made by his death was of such an infinite value that it was more than 
 double to the demerits of sin; <I>for God spared not his own 
 Son.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye
 the way of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, make straight in the desert a highway for
 our God.
 &nbsp; 4  Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill
 shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and

 <I>is</I> grass, and all the goodliness thereof <I>is</I> as the flower of

 God shall stand for ever.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The time to favour Zion, yea, the set time, having come, the people of 
 God must be prepared, by repentance and faith, for the favours designed 
 them; and, in order to call them to both these, we have here <I>the 
 voice of one crying in the wilderness,</I> which <I>may</I> be applied 
 to those prophets who were with the captives in their wilderness-state, 
 and who, when they saw the day of their deliverance dawn, called 
 earnestly upon them to prepare for it, and assured them that all the 
 difficulties which stood in the way of their deliverance should be got 
 over. It is a good sign that mercy is preparing for us if we find God's 
 grace preparing us for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:17">Ps. x. 17</A>.

 But it <I>must</I> be applied to John the Baptist; for, though God was
 the speaker, he was <I>the voice of one crying in the wilderness,</I> 
 and his business was to <I>prepare the way of the Lord,</I> to dispose 
 men's minds for the reception and entertainment of the gospel of 
 Christ. The way of the Lord is prepared,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. By repentance for sin; that was it which John Baptist preached to 
 all Judah and Jerusalem 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:2,5">Matt. iii. 2, 5</A>),

 and thereby <I>made ready a people prepared for the Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:17">Luke i. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The alarm is given; let all take notice of it at their peril; God is 
 coming in a way of mercy, and we must prepare for him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:3-5"><I>v.</I> 3-5</A>.

 If we apply it to their captivity, it may be taken as a promise that, 
 whatever difficulties lie in their way, when they return they shall be 
 removed. This voice in the wilderness (divine power going along with 
 it) sets pioneers on work to level the roads. But it may be taken as a 
 call to duty, and it is the same duty that we are called to, in 
 preparation for Christ's entrance into our souls. 

 (1.) We must get into such a frame of spirit as will dispose us to 
 receive Christ and his gospel: "<I>Prepare you the way of the Lord;</I> 
 prepare yourselves for him, and let all that be suppressed which would 
 be an obstruction to his entrance. Make room for Christ: <I>Make 
 straight a highway for him.</I>" If he prepare the end for us, we ought 
 surely to prepare the way for him. Prepare for the Saviour; <I>lift up 
 your heads, O you gates!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:7,9">Ps. xxiv. 7, 9</A>.

 Prepare for the salvation, the great salvation, and other minor
 deliverances. Let us get to be fit for them, and then God will work 
 them out. Let us not stand in our own light, nor put a bar in our own 
 door, but find, or make, a highway for him, even in that which was 
 desert ground. This is that for which he waits to be gracious.

 (2.) We must get our hearts levelled by divine grace. Those that are 
 hindered from comfort in Christ by their dejections and despondencies 
 are the valleys that must be exalted. Those that are hindered from
 comfort in Christ by a proud conceit of their own merit and worth are 
 the mountains and hills that must be made low. Those that have 
 entertained prejudices against the word and ways of God, that are 
 untractable, and disposed to thwart and contradict even that which is 
 plain and easy because it agrees not with their corrupt inclinations 
 and secular interests, are the crooked that must be made straight and 
 the rough places that must be made plain. Let but the gospel of Christ 
 have a fair hearing, and it cannot fail of acceptance. This prepares 
 the way of the Lord; and thus God will by his grace prepare his own way 
 in all the vessels of mercy, whose hearts he opens as he did 
 Lydia's.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. When this is done <I>the glory of the Lord shall be revealed,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 (1.) When the captives are prepared for deliverance Cyrus shall 
 proclaim it, and those shall have the benefit of it, and those only, 
 whose hearts the Lord shall stir up with courage and resolution to 
 break through the discouragements that lay in their way, and to make 
 nothing of the hills, and valleys, and all the rough places. 

 (2.) When John Baptist has for some time preached repentance, 
 mortification, and reformation, and so made ready a people prepared for 
 the Lord 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:17">Luke i. 17</A>),

 then the Messiah himself shall be revealed in his glory, working
 miracles, which John did not, and by his grace, which is his glory, 
 binding up and healing with consolations those whom John had wounded 
 with convictions. And this revelation of divine glory shall be <I>a 
 light to lighten the Gentiles. All flesh shall see it together,</I> and 
 not the Jews only; they shall see and admire it, see it and bid it 
 welcome; as the return out of captivity was taken notice of by the 
 neighbouring nations, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+126:2">Ps. cxxvi. 2</A>.

 And it shall be the accomplishment of the word of God, not one
 <I>iota</I> or tittle of which shall fall to the ground: <I>The mouth 
 of the Lord has spoken it,</I> and therefore the hand of the Lord will 
 effect it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. By confidence in the word of the Lord, and not in any creature. 
 <I>The mouth of the Lord having spoken it,</I> the voice has this 
 further to cry (he that has ears to hear let him hear it), <I>The word 
 of our God shall stand for ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. By this accomplishment of the prophecies and promises of salvation, 
 and the performance of them to the utmost in due time, it appears that 
 the word of the Lord is sure and what may be safely relied on. 
 <I>Then</I> we are prepared for deliverance when we depend entirely 
 upon the word of God, build our hopes on that, with an assurance that 
 it will not make us ashamed: in a dependence upon this word we must be 
 brought to own that <I>all flesh is grass,</I> withering and fading. 
 
 (1.) The power of man, when it does appear against the deliverance, is 
 not to be feared; for it shall be as grass before the word of the Lord: 
 it shall wither and be trodden down. The insulting Babylonians, who 
 promise themselves that the desolations of Jerusalem shall be 
 perpetual, are but as grass which the spirit of the Lord blows upon, 
 makes nothing of, but blasts all its glory; for the word of the Lord, 
 which promises their deliverance, shall stand for ever, and it is not 
 in the power of their enemies to hinder the execution of it. 

 (2.) The power of man, when it would appear for the deliverance, is not 
 to be trusted to; for it is but as grass in comparison with the word of 
 the Lord, which is the only firm foundation for us to build our hope 
 upon. When God is about to work salvation for his people he will take
 them off from depending upon creatures, and looking for it from hills 
 and mountains. They shall fail them, and their expectations from them 
 shall be frustrated: <I>The Spirit of the Lord shall blow upon 
 them;</I> for God will have no creature to be a rival with him for the 
 hope and confidence of his people; and, as it is his word only that 
 shall stand for ever, so in that word only our faith must stand. When 
 we are brought to this, then, and not till then, we are fit for 
 mercy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The word of our God, that glory of the Lord which is now to be 
 revealed, the gospel, and that grace which is brought with it to us and 
 wrought by it in us, shall stand for ever; and this is the satisfaction 
 of all believers, when they find all their creature-comforts withering 
 and fading like grass. Thus the apostle applies it to <I>the word which 
 by the gospel is preached unto us, and which lives and abides for ever 
 as the incorruptible seed by which we are born again,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:23-25">1 Pet. i. 23-25</A>.

 To prepare the way of the Lord we must be convinced,

 (1.) Of the vanity of the creature, that all flesh is grass, weak and 
 withering. We ourselves are so, and therefore cannot save ourselves; 
 all our friends are so, and therefore are unable to save us. All the 
 beauty of the creature, which might render it amiable, is but as the 
 flower of grass, soon blasted, and therefore cannot recommend us to God 
 and to his acceptance. We are dying creatures; all our comforts in this 
 word are dying comforts, and therefore cannot be the felicity of our 
 immortal souls. We must look further for a salvation, look further for 
 a portion. 

 (2.) Of the validity of the promise of God. We must be convinced that 
 the word of the Lord can do that for us which all flesh cannot--that, 
 forasmuch as it stands for ever, it will furnish us with a happiness 
 that will run parallel with the duration of our souls, which must live 
 for ever; for the things that are not seen, but must be believed, are 
 eternal.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It was promised 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 <I>that the glory of the Lord shall be revealed;</I> that is it with 
 the hopes of which God's people must be comforted. Now here we are 
 told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How it shall be revealed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 1. It shall be revealed to Zion and Jerusalem; notice shall be given of 
 it to the remnant that are left in Zion and Jerusalem, the poor of the 
 land, who were vine-dressers and husbandmen; it shall be told them that 
 their brethren shall return to them. This shall be told also to the 
 captives who belonged to Zion and Jerusalem, and retained their 
 affection for them. Zion is said to <I>dwell with the daughter of 
 Babylon</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:7">Zech. ii. 7</A>);

 and there she receives notice of Cyrus's gracious proclamation; and so
 the margin reads it, <I>O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion,</I> 
 &c., meaning the persons who were employed in publishing that 
 proclamation; let them do it with a good will, let them make the 
 country ring of it, and let them tell it to the sons of Zion in their 
 own language, <I>saying to them, Behold your God.</I> 

 2. It shall be published by Zion and Jerusalem (so the text reads it); 
 those that remain there, or that have already returned, when they find 
 the deliverance proceeding towards perfection, let them proclaim it in 
 the most public places, whence they may be best heard by all the cities 
 of Judah; let them proclaim it as loudly as they can: let them <I>lift 
 up their voice with strength,</I> and not be afraid of overstraining 
 themselves; let them not be afraid lest the enemy should hear it and 
 quarrel with them, or lest it should not prove true, or not such good 
 tidings as at first it appeared; let them say to the cities of Judah, 
 and all the inhabitants of the country, <I>Behold your God.</I> When 
 God is going on with the salvation of his people, let them 
 industriously spread the news among their friends, let them tell them 
 that it is God that has done it; whoever were the instruments, God was 
 the author; it is <I>their</I> God, a God in covenant with them, and he 
 does it as theirs, and they will reap the benefit and comfort of it.
 "Behold him, take notice of his hand in it, and look above second 
 causes; behold, the God you have long looked for has come at last

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:9"><I>ch.</I> xxv. 9</A>):

 <I>This is our God, we have waited for him.</I>" This may refer to the
 invitation which was sent forth from Jerusalem to the cities of Judah, 
 as soon as they had set up an altar, immediately upon their return out 
 of captivity, to come and join with them in their sacrifices, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:2-4">Ezra iii. 2-4</A>.

 "When the worship of God is set up again, send notice of it to all your
 brethren, that they may share with you in the comfort of it." But this 
 was to have its full accomplishment in the apostles' public and 
 undaunted preaching of the gospel to all nations, beginning at 
 Jerusalem. The voice crying in the wilderness gave notice that he was 
 coming; but now notice is given that he has come. <I>Behold the Lamb of 
 God;</I> take a full view of your Redeemer. Behold your King, behold
 your God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What that glory is which shall be revealed. "Your God will come, 
 will show himself,"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. "With the power and greatness of a prince 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>He will come with strong hand,</I> too strong to be obstructed, 
 though it may be opposed. His strong hand shall subdue his people to 
 himself, and shall restrain and conquer his and their enemies. He will
 come who is strong enough to break through all the difficulties that 
 lie in his way." Our Lord Jesus was full of power, a mighty Saviour. 
 Some read, it, <I>He will come against the mighty one,</I> and 
 overpower him, overcome him. Satan is the strong man armed; but our
 Lord Jesus is stronger than he, and he shall make it to appear that he 
 is so, for, 

 (1.) He shall reign in defiance of all opposition: <I>His arm shall 
 rule,</I> shall overrule <I>for him,</I> for the fulfilling of his 
 counsels, to his own glory; for he is his own end. 

 (2.) He shall recompense to all according to their works, as a 
 righteous Judge: <I>His reward is with him;</I> he brings along with 
 him, as a returning prince, punishments for the rebels and preferments 
 for his loyal subjects. 

 (3.) He shall proceed and accomplish his purpose: <I>His work is before 
 him,</I> that is, he knows perfectly well what he has to do, which way 
 to go about it, and how to compass it. <I>He himself knows what he will 
 do.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. "With the pity and tenderness of a shepherd," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 God is the <I>Shepherd of Israel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:1">Ps. lxxx. 1</A>);

 Christ is the good Shepherd, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:11">John x. 11</A>.

 The same that rules with the strong hand of a prince leads and feeds
 with the kind hand of a shepherd.

 (1.) He takes care of all his flock, the little flock: <I>He shall feed 
 his flock like a shepherd.</I> His word is food for his flock to feed 
 on; his ordinances are fields for them to feed in; his ministers are 
 under-shepherds that are appointed to attend them. 

 (2.) He takes particular care of those that most need his care, the 
 lambs that are weak, and cannot help themselves, and are unaccustomed 
 to hardship, and <I>those that are with young,</I> that are therefore 
 heavy, and, if any harm be done them, are in danger of casting their 
 young. He particularly takes care for a succession, that it may not 
 fail or be cut off. The good Shepherd has tender care for children that 
 are towardly and hopeful, for young converts, that are setting out in 
 the way to heaven, for weak believers, and those that are of a 
 sorrowful spirit. These are the lambs of his flock, that shall be sure 
 to want nothing that their case requires. 

 [1.] He will gather them in the arms of his power; his strength shall 
 be made <I>perfect in their weakness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:9">2 Cor. xii. 9</A>.

 He will gather them in when they wander, gather them up when they fall,
 gather them together when they are dispersed, and gather them home to 
 himself at last; and all this with his own arm, out of which none shall 
 be able to pluck them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:28">John x. 28</A>.

 [2.] He will carry them in the bosom of his love and cherish them 
 there. When they tire or are weary, are sick and faint, when they meet 
 with foul ways, he will carry them on, and take care they are not left 
 behind. 

 [3.] He will gently lead them. By his word he requires no more
 service, and by his providence he inflicts no more trouble, than he 
 will fit them for; for he considers their frame.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and

 earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the
 hills in a balance?

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The scope of these verses is to show what a great and glorious being
 the Lord Jehovah is, who is Israel's God and Saviour. It comes in here, 

 1. To encourage his people that were captives in Babylon to hope in 
 him, and to depend upon him for deliverance, though they were ever so 
 weak and their oppressors ever so strong. 

 2. To engage them to cleave to him, and not to turn aside after other 
 gods; for there are none to be compared with him. 

 3. To possess all those who receive the glad tidings of redemption by
 Christ with a holy awe and reverence of God. Though it was said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 <I>Behold your God,</I> and 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)

 <I>He shall feed his flock like a shepherd,</I> yet these 
 condescensions of his grace must not be thought of with any diminution 
 to the transcendencies of his glory. Let us see how great our God is, 
 and fear before him; for,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His power is unlimited, and what no creature can compare with, much 
 less contend with, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 1. He has a vast reach. View the celestial globe, and you are 
 astonished at the extent of it; but the great God <I>metes the heavens 
 with a span;</I> to him they are but a hand-breadth, so large-handed is 
 he. View the terraqueous globe, and he has the command of that too. All 
 the waters in the world he can <I>measure in the hollow of his 
 hand,</I> where we can hold but a little water; and the dry land he 
 easily manages, for he <I>comprehends the dust of the earth in a 
 measure,</I> or with his three fingers; it is no more to him than a 
 <I>pugil,</I> or that which we take up between our thumb and two 
 fingers. 

 2. He has a vast strength, and can as easily move mountains and hills 
 as the tradesman heaves his goods into the scales and out of them 
 again; he poises them with his hand as exactly as if he weighed them in 
 a pair of balances. This may refer to the work of creation, when the 
 heavens were stretched out as exactly as that which is spanned, and the 
 earth and waters were put together in just proportions, as if they had 
 been measured, and the mountains made of such a weight as to serve for 
 ballast to the globe, and no more. Or it may refer to the work of 
 providence (which is a continued creation) and the consistency of all 
 the creatures with each other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His wisdom is unsearchable, and what no creature can give either 
 information or direction to, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 As none can do what God has done and does, so none can assist him in 
 the doing of it or suggest any thing to him which he thought not of. 
 When the Lord by his Spirit made the world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+26:13">Job xxvi. 13</A>)

 there was none that directed his Spirit, or gave him any advice, either
 what to do or how to do it. Nor does he need any counsellor to direct 
 him in the government of the world, nor is there any with whom he 
 consults, as the wisest kings do with those that <I>know law and 
 judgment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:13">Esther i. 13</A>.

 God needs not to be told what is done, for he knows it perfectly; nor
 needs he be advised concerning what is to be done, for he knows both 
 the right end and the proper means. This is much insisted upon here, 
 because the poor captives had no politicians among them to manage their 
 concerns at court or to put them in a way of gaining their liberty. "No 
 matter," says the prophet, "you have a God to act for you, who needs 
 not the assistance of statesmen." In the great work of our redemption 
 by Christ matters were concerted <I>before the world was,</I> when 
 there was one to <I>teach God in the path of judgment,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:7">1 Cor. ii. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The nations of the world are nothing in comparison of him, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:15,17"><I>v.</I> 15, 17</A>.

 Take them all together, all the great and mighty nations of the earth, 
 kings the most pompous, kingdoms the most populous, both the most 
 wealthy; take the isles, the multitude of them, the isles of the 
 Gentiles: <I>Before him,</I> when they stand in competition with him or 
 in opposition to him, they are <I>as a drop of the bucket</I> compared 
 with the vast ocean, or <I>the small dust of the balance</I> (which 
 does not serve to turn it, and therefore is not regarded, it is so 
 small) in comparison with all the dust of the earth. <I>He takes them 
 up,</I> and throws them away from him, <I>as a very little thing,</I> 
 not worth speaking of. They are all in his eye <I>as nothing,</I> as if 
 they had no being at all; for they add nothing to his perfection and 
 all-sufficiency. <I>They are counted by him,</I> and are to be counted 
 by us in comparison of him, <I>less than nothing, and vanity.</I> When 
 he pleases, he can as easily bring them all into nothing as at first he 
 brought them out of nothing. When God has work to do he values not 
 either the assistance or the resistance of any creature. They are all 
 <I>vanity;</I> the word that is used for the chaos 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:2">Gen. i. 2</A>),

 to which they will at last be reduced. Let this beget in us high
 thoughts of God and low thoughts of this world, and engage us to make 
 God, and not man, both our fear and our hope. This magnifies God's love 
 to the world, that, though it is of such small account and value with 
 him, yet, for the redemption of it, he <I>gave his only-begotten 
 Son,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:16">John iii. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The services of the church can make no addition to him nor do they 
 bear any proportion to his infinite perfections 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>Lebanon is not sufficient to burn;</I> not the wood of it, to be for 
 the fuel of the altar, though it be so well stocked with cedars; not 
 the beasts of it, to be for sacrifices, though it be so well stocked 
 with cattle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Whatever we honour God with, it falls infinitely short of the merit of 
 his perfection; for he is exalted <I>far above all blessing and 
 praise,</I> all burnt-offerings and sacrifices.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye
 compare unto him?
 &nbsp; 19  The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith
 spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains.
 &nbsp; 20  He that <I>is</I> so impoverished that he hath no oblation
 chooseth a tree <I>that</I> will not rot; he seeketh unto him a
 cunning workman to prepare a graven image, <I>that</I> shall not be
 moved.
 &nbsp; 21  Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told
 you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the
 foundations of the earth?
 &nbsp; 22  <I>It is</I> he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and
 the inhabitants thereof <I>are</I> as grasshoppers; that stretcheth
 out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to
 dwell in:
 &nbsp; 23  That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges
 of the earth as vanity.
 &nbsp; 24  Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown:
 yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall
 also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind
 shall take them away as stubble.
 &nbsp; 25  To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith
 the Holy One.
 &nbsp; 26  Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these
 <I>things,</I> that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them
 all by names by the greatness of his might, for that <I>he is</I>
 strong in power; not one faileth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet here reproves those, 

 1. Who represented God by creatures, and so changed his truth into a
 lie and his glory into shame, who made images and then said that they 
 resembled God, and paid their homage to them accordingly. 

 2. Who put creatures in the place of God, who feared them more than 
 God, as if they were a match for him, or loved them more than God, as 
 if they were fit to be rivals with him. Twice the challenge is here 
 made, <I>To whom will you liken God?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>,

 and again 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 The Holy One himself says, <I>To whom will you liken me?</I> This shows 
 the folly and absurdity, 

 (1.) Of corporal idolatry, making visible images of him who is 
 invisible, imagining the image to be animated by the deity, and the 
 deity to be presentiated by the image, which, as it was an instance of 
 the corruption of the human nature, so it was an intolerable injury to 
 the honour of the divine nature. 

 (2.) Of spiritual idolatry, making creatures equal with God in our 
 affections. Proud people make themselves equal with God; covetous
 people make their money equal with God; and whatever we esteem or love, 
 fear or hope in, more than God, that creature we equal with God, which 
 is the highest affront imaginable to him who is <I>God over all.</I> 
 Now, to show the absurdity of this,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The prophet describes idols as despicable things and worthy of the 
 greatest contempt 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>):

 "Look upon the better sort of them, which rich people set up, and 
 worship; they are made of some base metal, cast into what shape the 
 founder pleases, and that is gilded, or overlaid with plates of gold, 
 that it may pass for a golden image. It is a creature; for the workman 
 made it; <I>therefore it is not God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:6">Hos. viii. 6</A>.

 It depended upon his will whether it should be a god at all, and of
 what shape it should be. It is a cheat; for it is gold on the outside,
 but within it is lead or copper, in this indeed representing the 
 deities, that they were not what they seemed to be, and deceived their 
 admirers. How despicable then are the worst sort of them--the poor 
 men's gods! <I>He that is so impoverished</I> that he has scarcely a 
 sacrifice to offer to his god when he has made him will yet not be 
 without an enshrined deity of his own; and, though he cannot procure 
 one of brass or stone, he will have a wooden one rather than none, and 
 for that purpose <I>chooses a tree that will not soon rot,</I> and of 
 that he will have his graven image made. Both agree to have their image 
 well fastened, that they may not be robbed of it. The better sort have 
 silver chains to fix theirs with; and, though it be but a wooden image, 
 care is taken that it <I>shall not be moved.</I>" Let us pause a little 
 and see,

 1. How these idolaters shame themselves, and what a reproach they put
 upon their own reason, in dreaming that gods of their own making 
 (<I>Nehushtans,</I> pieces of brass or logs of wood) should be able to 
 do them any kindness. Thus vain were they in their imaginations; and 
 how was their foolish heart darkened! 

 2. See how these idolaters shame us, who worship the only living and 
 true God. They spared no cost upon their idols; we grudge that as
 waste which is spent in the service of our God. They took care that 
 their idols should not be moved; we wilfully provoke our God to depart 
 from us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He describes God as infinitely great, and worthy of the highest 
 veneration; so that between him and idols, whatever competition there 
 may be, there is no comparison. To prove the greatness of God he 
 appeals,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. To what they had <I>heard of him by the hearing of the ear,</I> and 
 the consent of all ages and nations concerning him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 "<I>Have you not known</I> by the very light of nature? <I>Has it not 
 been told you by your fathers</I> and teachers, according to the 
 constant tradition received from their ancestors and predecessors, even 
 from the beginning?" (Those notices of God are as ancient as the 
 world.) "<I>Have you not understood</I> it as always acknowledged 
 <I>from the foundation of the earth,</I> that God is a great God, and a 
 great King above all gods?" It has been a truth universally admitted 
 that there is an infinite Being who is the fountain of all being. This 
 is understood not only ever since the beginning of the world, but from 
 and by the origin of the universe. It is founded upon the foundation of 
 the earth. The invisible things of God are <I>clearly seen from the
 creation of the world,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:20">Rom. i. 20</A>.

 Thou mayest not only ask thy father, and he shall tell thee this, and
 thy elders

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:7">Deut. xxxii. 7</A>);

 but <I>ask those that go by the way</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:29">Job xxi. 29</A>),

 ask the first man you meet, and he will say the same. Some read it,
 <I>Will you not know? Will you not hear it?</I> For those that are
 ignorant of this are willingly ignorant; the light shines in their 
 faces, but they shut their eyes against it. Now that which is here said 
 of God is,

 (1.) That he has the command of all the creatures. The heaven and the 
 earth themselves are under his management: <I>He sits upon the 
 circle,</I> or globe, <I>of the earth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 He that has the special residence of his glory in the upper world 
 maintains a dominion over this lower world, gives law to it, and 
 directs all the motions of it to his own glory. He sits undisturbed 
 upon the earth, and so establishes it. He is still stretching out the 
 heavens, his power and providence keep them still stretched out, and 
 will do so till the day comes that they shall be rolled together like a 
 scroll. He spreads them out as easily as we draw a curtain to and fro, 
 opening these curtains in the morning and drawing them close again at 
 night. And the heaven is to this earth <I>as a tent to dwell in;</I> it 
 is a canopy drawn over our heads, <I>et quod tegit omnia c&oelig;lum--and it 
 encircles all.</I>--Ovid. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:2">Ps. civ. 2</A>.

 (2.) That the children of men, even the greatest and mightiest, are as 
 nothing before him. The numerous inhabitants of this earth are in his 
 eye as grasshoppers in ours, so little and inconsiderable, of such 
 small value, of such little use, and so easily crushed. Proud men's
 lifting up themselves is but like the grasshopper's leap; in an instant 
 they must stoop down to the earth again. If the spies thought 
 themselves grasshoppers before the sons of Anak 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:33">Num. xiii. 33</A>),

 what are we before the great God? Grasshoppers live but awhile, and
 live carelessly, not like the ant; so do the most of men.

 (3.) That those who appear and act against him, how formidable soever 
 they may be to their fellow-creatures, will certainly be humble and 
 brought down by the mighty hand of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.
 
 Princes and judges, who have great authority, and abuse it to the 
 support of oppression and injustice, make nothing of those about them; 
 <I>as for all their enemies they puff at them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:5,12:5">Ps. x. 5; xii. 5</A>);
 
 but, when the great God takes them to task, he brings them to nothing;
 he humbles them, and tames them, and makes them as vanity, little 
 regarded, neither feared nor loved. He makes them utterly unable to 
 stand before his judgments, which shall either, 

 [1.] Prevent their settlement in their authority: <I>They shall not be 
 planted; they shall not be sown;</I> and those are the two ways of 
 propagating plants, either by seed or slips. Nay, if they should gain a 
 little interest, and so be planted or sown, yet <I>their stock shall 
 not take root in the earth,</I> they shall not continue long in power. 
 Eliphaz saw the foolish taking root, but <I>suddenly cursed their 
 habitation.</I> And then how soon is the fig-tree withered away! Or,

 [2.] He will blast them when they think they are settled. He does but 
 <I>blow upon them,</I> and then <I>they shall wither,</I> and come to 
 nothing, and <I>the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.</I> For 
 God's wrath, though it seem at first to blow slightly upon them, will 
 soon become a mighty whirlwind. When God judges he will overcome.
 Those that will not bow before him cannot stand before him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He appeals to what <I>their eyes saw of him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 "<I>Lift up your eyes on high;</I> be not always poring on this earth" 
 (<I>O curv&aelig; in terras anim&aelig; et c&oelig;lestium 
 inanes!--Degenerate minds, that can bend so towards the earth, having 
 nothing celestial in them!</I>), "but sometimes look up" (<I>Os homini 
 sublime dedit, c&oelig;lumque tueri jussit--Heaven gave to man an erect 
 countenance, and bade him gaze on the stars</I>); "behold the glorious 
 lights of heaven, consider who has created them. They neither made nor
 marshalled themselves; doubtless, therefore, there is a God that gave 
 them their being, power, and motion." What we see of the creature 
 should lead us to the Creator. The idolaters, when they lifted up their 
 eyes and beheld the hosts of heaven, being wholly immerged in sense, 
 looked no further, but worshipped them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:19,Job+31:26">Deut. iv. 19; Job xxxi. 26</A>.

 Therefore the prophet here directs us to make use of our reason as well
 as our senses, and to consider who created them, and to pay our homage 
 to him. Give him the glory of his sovereignty over them--He <I>brings
 out their host by number,</I> as a general draws out the squadrons and 
 battalions of his army; of the knowledge he has of them--<I>He calls 
 them all by names,</I> proper names, according as their place and 
 influence are

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:4">Ps. cxlvii. 4</A>);

 and of the use he makes of them; when he calls them out to any service,
 so obsequious are they that, <I>by the greatness of his might, not one 
 of them fails,</I> but, as when <I>the stars in their courses fought 
 against Sisera,</I> every one does that to which he is appointed. To 
 make these creatures therefore rivals with God, which are such ready 
 servants to him, is an injury to them as well as an affront to him.</P>

 Here, 

 I. The prophet reproves the people of God, who are now supposed to be 
 captives in Babylon for their unbelief and distrust of God, and the 
 dejections and despondencies of their spirit under their affliction 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 "<I>Why sayest thou, O Jacob!</I> to thyself and to those about thee, 
 <I>My way is hidden from the Lord?</I> Why dost thou make hard and 
 melancholy conclusions concerning thyself and thy present case as if 
 the latter were desperate?" 

 1. The titles he here gives them were enough to shame them out of their
 distrusts: <I>O Jacob! O Israel!</I> Let them remember whence they took 
 these names--from one who had found God faithful to him and kind in all 
 his straits; and why they bore these names--as God's professing people, 
 a people in covenant with him.

 2. The way of reproving them is by reasoning with them: "Why? Consider 
 whether thou hast any ground to say so." Many of our foolish frets and 
 foolish fears would vanish before a strict enquiry into the causes of 
 them. 

 3. That which they are reproved for is an ill-natured, ill-favoured,
 word they spoke of God, as if he had cast them off. There seems to be 
 an emphasis laid upon their saying it: Why <I>sayest</I> thou and 
 <I>speakest</I> thou? It is bad to have evil thoughts rise in our mind, 
 but it is worse to put an <I>imprimatur--a sanction</I> to them, and 
 turn them into evil words. David reflects with regret upon what he
 said in his haste, when he was in distress. 

 4. The ill word they said was a word of despair concerning their 
 present calamitous condition. They were ready to conclude,

 (1.) That God would not heed them: "<I>My way is hidden from the 
 Lord;</I> he takes no notice of our straits, nor concerns himself any 
 more in our concernments. There are such difficulties in our case that 
 even divine wisdom and power will be nonplussed." A man <I>whose way is 
 hidden</I> is one whom <I>God has hedged in,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:23">Job iii. 23</A>.

 (2.) That God could not help them: "<I>My judgment is passed over from 
 my God;</I> my case is past relief, so far past it that God himself 
 cannot redress the grievances of it. <I>Our bones are dried.</I>" 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:11">Ezek. xxxvii. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He reminds them of that which, if duly considered, was sufficient 
 to silence all those fears and distrust. For their conviction, as 
 before for the conviction of idolaters 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 he appeals to what they had known and what they had heard. Jacob and 
 Israel were a knowing people, or might have been, and their knowledge 
 came by hearing; for Wisdom cried in their chief places of concourse. 
 Now, among other things, they had heard that <I>God had spoken once, 
 twice,</I> yea, many a time they had <I>heard it, That power belongs 
 unto God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:11">Ps. lxii. 11</A>),
 
 That is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He is himself an almighty God. He must needs be so, for he is <I>the 
 everlasting God, even Jehovah.</I> He was from eternity; he will be to 
 eternity; and therefore with him there is no deficiency, no decay. He 
 has his being of himself, and therefore all his perfections must needs 
 be boundless. He is without beginning of days or end of life, and 
 therefore with him there is no change. He is also <I>the Creator of the 
 ends of the earth,</I> that is, of the whole earth and all that is in 
 it from end to end. He therefore is the rightful owner and ruler of 
 all, and must be concluded to have an absolute power over all and an 
 all-sufficiency to help his people in their greatest straits. Doubtless 
 he is still as able to save his church as he was at first to make the 
 world. 

 (1.) He has wisdom to contrive the salvation, and that wisdom is never 
 at a loss: <I>There is no searching of his understanding,</I> so as to 
 countermine the counsels of it and defeat its intentions; no, nor so as 
 to determine what he will do, for he has ways by himself, ways in the 
 sea. None can say, "Thus far God's wisdom can go, and no further;" for, 
 when we know not what to do, he knows. 

 (2.) He has power to bring about the salvation, and that power is never 
 exhausted: <I>He faints not, nor is weary;</I> he upholds the whole 
 creation, and governs all the creatures, and is neither tired nor 
 toiled; and therefore, no doubt, he has power to relieve his church, 
 when it is brought ever so low, without weakness or weariness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He gives strength and power to his people, and helps them by 
 enabling them to help themselves. He that is the strong God is the 
 strength of Israel. 
 
 (1.) He can help the weak, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 Many a time <I>he gives power to the faint,</I> to those that are ready 
 to faint away; and <I>to those that have no might he</I> not only 
 gives, but <I>increases strength,</I> as there is more and more 
 occasion for it. Many out of bodily weakness are wonderfully
 recovered, and made strong, by the providence of God: and many that are 
 feeble in spirit, timorous and faint-hearted, unfit for services and 
 sufferings, are yet strengthened by the grace of God <I>with all might 
 in the inward man.</I> To those who are sensible of their weakness, and 
 ready to acknowledge they have no might, God does in a special manner 
 increase strength; for, <I>when we are weak</I> in ourselves, <I>then 
 are we strong in the Lord.</I> 

 (2.) He will help the willing, will help those who, in a humble
 dependence upon him, help themselves, and will do well for those who do 
 their best,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:30,31"><I>v.</I> 30, 31</A>.

 Those who trust to their own sufficiency, and are so confident of it 
 that they neither exert themselves to the utmost nor seek unto God for 
 his grace, are <I>the youth</I> and <I>the young men,</I> who are 
 strong, but are apt to think themselves stronger than they are. And 
 they <I>shall faint and be weary,</I> yea, they <I>shall utterly 
 fail</I> in their services, in their conflicts, and under their 
 burdens; they shall soon be made to see the folly of trusting to 
 themselves. <I>But those that wait on the Lord,</I> who make conscience 
 of their duty to him, and by faith rely upon him and commit themselves 
 to his guidance, shall find that God will not fail them. 

 [1.] They shall have grace sufficient for them: They <I>shall renew 
 their strength</I> as their work is renewed, as there is new occasion; 
 they shall be anointed, and their lamps supplied, with fresh oil. God 
 will be their <I>arm every morning,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:2"><I>ch.</I> xxxiii. 2</A>.

 If at any time they have been foiled and weakened they shall recover
 themselves, and so renew their strength. Heb. <I>They shall change 
 their strength,</I> as their work is changed--doing work, suffering 
 work; they shall have strength to labour, strength to wrestle, strength 
 to resist, strength to bear. As the day so shall the strength be.

 [2.] They shall use this grace for the best purposes. Being
 strengthened, <I>First,</I> They shall soar upward, upward towards God: 
 <I>They shall mount up with wings like eagles,</I> so strongly, so 
 swiftly, so high and heaven-ward. In the strength of divine grace, 
 their souls shall ascend above the world, and even enter into the 
 holiest. Pious and devout affections are the eagles' wings on which 
 gracious souls mount up, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+25:1">Ps. xxv. 1</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> They shall press forward, forward towards heaven. They
 shall walk, they shall run, the way of God's commandments, cheerfully 
 and with alacrity (they <I>shall not be weary</I>), constantly and with 
 perseverance (they <I>shall not faint</I>); and therefore in due season 
 they shall reap. Let Jacob and Israel therefore, in their greatest
 distresses, continue waiting upon God, and not despair of timely and 
 effectual relief and succour from him.</P>
