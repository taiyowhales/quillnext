 The iniquities and calamities of God's Israel had been largely and 
 pathetically lamented before, in this book. Now in this chapter the 
 shepherds of Israel, their rulers both in church and state, are called 
 to an account, as having been very much accessory to the sin and ruin 
 of Israel, by their neglecting to do the duty of their place. Here is, 
 
 I. A high charge exhibited against them for their negligence, their
 unskillfulness, and unfaithfulness in the management of public affairs, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:1-6,8">ver. 1-6 and ver. 8</A>.

 II. Their discharge from their trust, for their insufficiency and
 treachery, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:7-10">ver. 7-10</A>.

 III. A gracious promise that God would take care of his flock, though
 they did not, and that it should not always suffer as it had done by
 their mal-administrations, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:11-16">ver. 11-16</A>.

 IV. Another charge exhibited against those of the flock that were fat
 and strong, for the injuries they did to those that were weak and 
 feeble, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:17-22">ver. 17-22</A>.

 V. Another promise that God would in the fulness of time send the 
 Messiah, to be the great and good Shepherd of the sheep, who should 
 redress all grievances and set every thing to rights with the flock, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:23-31">ver. 23-31</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel,
 prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> unto the
 shepherds; Woe <I>be</I> to the shepherds of Israel that do feed
 themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks?
 &nbsp; 3  Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them
 that are fed: <I>but</I> ye feed not the flock.
 &nbsp; 4  The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed
 that which was sick, neither have ye bound up <I>that which was</I>
 broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away,
 neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and
 with cruelty have ye ruled them.
 &nbsp; 5  And they were scattered, because <I>there is</I> no shepherd: and
 they became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were
 scattered.
 &nbsp; 6  My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every
 high hill: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the
 earth, and none did search or seek <I>after them.</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophecy of this chapter is not dated, nor any of those that follow 
 it, till 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:1-49"><I>ch.</I> xl.</A>

 It is most probable that it was delivered after the completing of
 Jerusalem's destruction, when it would be very seasonable to enquire 
 into the causes of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The prophet is ordered to <I>prophesy against the shepherds of 
 Israel</I>--the princes and magistrates, the priests and Levites, the
 great Sanhedrim or council of state, or whoever they were that had the 
 direction of public affairs in a higher or lower sphere, the kings 
 especially, for there were two of them now captives in Babylon, who, as 
 well as the people, must have their transgressions shown them, that 
 they might repent, as Manasseh in his captivity. God has something to 
 <I>say to the shepherds,</I> for they are but under-shepherds, 
 accountable to him who is the great <I>Shepherd of Israel,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:1">Ps. lxxx. 1</A>.

 And that which he says is, <I>Woe to the shepherds of Israel!</I>
 Though they are shepherds, and shepherds of Israel, yet he must not 
 spare them, must not flatter them. Note, If men's dignity and power do 
 not, as they ought, keep them from sin, they will not serve to exempt 
 them from reproof, to excuse their repentance, or to secure them from 
 the judgments of God if they do not repent. We had a <I>woe to the 
 pastors,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:1">Jer. xxiii. 1</A>.

 God will in a particular manner reckon with them if they be false to
 their trust.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He is here directed what to charge the shepherds with, in God's 
 name, as the ground of God's controversy with them; for it is not a 
 causeless quarrel. Two things they are charged with:--

 1. That all their care was to advance and enrich themselves and to make
 themselves great. Their business was to take care of those that were
 committed to their charge: <I>Should not the shepherds feed the 
 flocks?</I> No doubt they should; they betray their trust if they do 
 not. Not that they are to put the meat into their mouths, but to 
 provide it for them and bring them to it. But <I>these</I> shepherds 
 made this the least of their care; they <I>fed themselves,</I> 
 contrived every thing to gratify and indulge their own appetite, and to 
 make themselves rich and great, fat and easy. They made sure of the 
 profits of their places; they did <I>eat the fat,</I> the <I>cream</I> 
 (so some), for he <I>that feeds a flock eats of the milk of it</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:7">1 Cor. ix. 7</A>),

 and they made sure of the best of the milk. They made sure of the
 fleece, and <I>clothed themselves with the wool,</I> getting into their 
 hands as much as they could of the estates of their subjects, yea, and 
 <I>killed those that were</I> well <I>fed,</I> that what they had might 
 be fed upon, as Naboth was put to death for his vineyard. Note, There 
 is a woe to those who are in public trusts, but consult only their own 
 private interest, and are more inquisitive about the benefice than 
 about the office, what money is to be got than what good to be done. It 
 is an old complaint, <I>All seek their own,</I> and too many <I>more 
 than their own.</I>

 2. That they took no care for the benefit and welfare of those that
 were committed to their charge: <I>You feed not the flock.</I> They 
 neither knew how to do it, so ignorant were they, nor would they take 
 any pains to do it, so lazy and slothful were they; nay, they never 
 desired nor designed it, so treacherous and unfaithful were they.

 (1.) They did not do their duty to those of the flock that were 
 distempered, did not strengthen them, nor heal them, nor bind them up,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 When any of the flock were sick or hurt, worried or wounded, it was all 
 one to them whether they lived or died; they never looked after them. 
 The princes and judges took no care to right those that suffered wrong 
 or to shelter injured innocency. They took no care of the poor to see 
 them provided for; they might starve, for them. The priests took no 
 care to instruct the ignorant, to rectify the mistakes of those that 
 were in error, to warn the unruly, or to comfort the feeble-minded. The 
 ministers of state took no care to check the growing distempers of the 
 kingdom, which threatened the vitals of it. Things were amiss, and out 
 of course, every where, and nothing was done to rectify them. 

 (2.) They did not do their duty to those of the flock that were 
 dispersed, that were driven away by the enemies that invaded the 
 country, and were forced to seek for shelter where they could find a 
 place, or that <I>wandered</I> of choice upon <I>the mountains and 
 hills</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),
 
 where they were exposed to the beasts of prey and became <I>meat to 
 them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Every one is ready to seize a waif and stray. Some went abroad and 
 begged, some went abroad and traded, and thus the country became thin 
 of inhabitants, and was weakened and impoverished, and wanted hands 
 both in the fields of corn and in the fields of battle, both in harvest 
 and in war: <I>My flock was scattered upon all the face of the 
 earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 And they were never enquired after, were never encouraged to return to 
 their own country: <I>None did search or seek after them.</I> Nay, 
 <I>with force and cruelty they ruled them,</I> which drove more away, 
 and discouraged those that were driven away from all thoughts of 
 returning. <I>Their</I> case is bad who have reason to expect better 
 treatment among strangers than in their own country. It may be meant of 
 those of the flock that went astray from God and their duty; and the 
 priests, that should have taught the good knowledge of the Lord, used 
 no means to convince and reclaim them, so that they became an easy prey 
 to seducers. Thus were <I>they scattered because there was no 
 shepherd,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 There were those that called themselves shepherds, but really they were 
 not. Note, Those that do not do the work of shepherds are unworthy of 
 the name. And if those that undertake to be shepherds are <I>foolish 
 shepherds</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:15">Zech. xi. 15</A>),

 if they are proud and above their business, idle and do not love their
 business, or faithless and unconcerned about it, the case of the flock 
 is as bad as if it were without a shepherd. Better no shepherd than
 such shepherds. Christ complains that his flock were <I>as sheep
 having no shepherd,</I> when yet the scribes and Pharisees <I>sat in 
 Moses' seat,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:36">Matt. ix. 36</A>.

 It is ill with the patient when his physician is his worst disease, ill
 with the flock when the shepherds drive them away and disperse them, 
 <I>by ruling them with force.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>;
 &nbsp; 8  <I>As</I> I live, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, surely because my flock
 became a prey, and my flock became meat to every beast of the
 field, because <I>there was</I> no shepherd, neither did my shepherds
 search for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed
 not my flock;
 &nbsp; 9  Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>;
 &nbsp; 10  Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Behold, I <I>am</I> against the
 shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause
 them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds
 feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their
 mouth, that they may not be meat for them.
 &nbsp; 11  For thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Behold, I, <I>even</I> I, will both
 search my sheep, and seek them out.
 &nbsp; 12  As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is
 among his sheep <I>that are</I> scattered; so will I seek out my
 sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have
 been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.
 &nbsp; 13  And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them
 from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and
 feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all
 the inhabited places of the country.
 &nbsp; 14  I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high
 mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in
 a good fold, and <I>in</I> a fat pasture shall they feed upon the
 mountains of Israel.
 &nbsp; 15  I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down,
 saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 16  I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which
 was driven away, and will bind up <I>that which was</I> broken, and
 will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat
 and the strong; I will feed them with judgment.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Upon reading the foregoing articles of impeachment drawn up, in God's 
 name, against the shepherds of Israel, we cannot but look upon the 
 shepherds with a just indignation, and upon the flock with a tender 
 compassion. God, by the prophet, here expresses both in a high degree; 
 and the shepherds are called upon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:7,9"><I>v.</I> 7, 9</A>)

 to <I>hear the word of the Lord,</I> to hear this word. Let them hear 
 how little he regards them, who made much of themselves, and how much 
 he regards the flock, which they made nothing of; both will be humbling 
 to them. Those that will not <I>hear the word of the Lord</I> giving 
 them their direction shall be made to hear the word of the Lord reading 
 them their doom. Now see here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How much displeased God is at the shepherds. Their crimes are 
 repeated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 God's flock became a prey to the deceivers first that drew them to 
 idolatry, and then to the destroyers that carried them into captivity; 
 and these shepherds took no care to prevent either the one or the 
 other, but were as if there had been <I>no shepherds;</I> and therefore 
 God says 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 and confirms it with an oath 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 <I>I am against the shepherds.</I> They had a commission from God to 
 feed the flock, and made use of this name in what they did, expecting 
 he would stand by them. "No," says God, "so far from that, <I>I am 
 against them.</I>" Note, It is not our having the name and authority of 
 shepherds that will engage God for us, if we do not the work enjoined 
 us, and be not faithful to the trust reposed in us. God is <I>against 
 them,</I> and they shall know it; for, 

 1. They shall be made to account for the manner in which they have
 discharged their trust: "<I>I will require my flock at their hands,</I> 
 and charge it upon them that so many of them are missing." Note, Those 
 will have a great deal to answer for in the judgment-day who take upon 
 them the care of souls and yet take no care of them. Ministers must 
 <I>watch</I> and work as those that <I>must give account,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:17">Heb. xiii. 17</A>.

 2. They shall be deprived <I>officio et beneficio--both of the work and 
 of the wages. They shall cease from feeding the flock,</I> that is, 
 from pretending to feed it. Note, It is just with God to take out of
 men's hands that power which they have abused and that trust which they 
 have betrayed. But, if this were all their punishment, they could bear 
 it well enough; therefore it is added, "<I>Neither shall the shepherds 
 feed themselves any more,</I> for <I>I will deliver my flock from their 
 mouth,</I> which, instead of protecting, they had made a prey of." 
 Note, Those that are enriching themselves with the spoils of the public 
 cannot expect that they shall always be suffered to do so. Nor will
 God always permit his people to be trampled upon by those that should 
 support them, but will find a time to deliver them from the shepherds 
 their false friends, as well as from the lions their open enemies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How much concerned God is for the flock; he speaks as if he were 
 the more concerned for them because he saw them thus neglected, for 
 <I>with him the fatherless finds mercy.</I> Precious promises are made 
 here upon the occasion, which were to have their accomplishment in the 
 return of the Jews out of their captivity and their re-establishment in 
 their own land. Let the shepherds <I>hear this word of the Lord,</I> 
 and know that they have no part nor lot in the matter. But let the poor 
 sheep hear it and take the comfort of it. Note, Though magistrates and 
 ministers fail in doing their part, for the good of the church, yet God 
 will not fail in doing his; he will take the flock into his own hand 
 rather than the church shall come short of any kindness he has designed 
 for it. The under-shepherds may prove careless, but the chief Shepherd 
 <I>neither slumbers nor sleeps.</I> They may be false, but God 
 <I>abides faithful.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God will gather his sheep together that were scattered, and bring 
 those back to the fold that had wandered from it: "<I>I, even I,</I> 
 who alone can do it, will do it, and will have all the glory of it. 
 <I>I will both search my sheep and find them out</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)

 as a <I>shepherd</I> does 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 and bring them back as he does the stray-sheep, upon his shoulders, 
 <I>from all the places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and 
 dark day.</I>" There are cloudy and dark days, windy and stormy ones, 
 which scatter God's sheep, which send them hither and thither, to 
 divers and distant places, in quest of secresy and safety. But, 

 (1.) Wherever they are the eye of God will <I>find them out;</I> for 
 his eyes run to and fro through the earth, in favour of them. <I>I will 
 seek out my sheep;</I> and not one that belongs to the fold, though 
 driven ever so far off, shall be lost. <I>The Lord knows those that
 are his;</I> he <I>knows their work</I> and <I>where they dwell</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:13">Rev. ii. 13</A>),

 and where they are hidden.

 (2.) When his time shall come his arms will <I>fetch them home</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>I will bring them out from the people.</I> God will both incline
 their hearts to come by his grace and will by his providence open a 
 door for them and remove every difficulty that lies in the way. They
 shall not return one by one, clandestinely stealing away, but they 
 shall return in a body: "<I>I will gather them from the countries</I> 
 into which they are dispersed, not only the most considerable families 
 of them, but every particular person. <I>I will seek that which was 
 lost and bring again that which was driven away,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 This was done when so many thousand Jews returned triumphantly out of 
 Babylon, under the conduct of Zerubbabel, Ezra, and others. When those 
 that have gone astray from God into the paths of sin are brought back 
 by repentance, when those that erred come to the acknowledgment of the 
 truth, when God's outcasts are gathered and restored, and religious 
 assemblies, that were dispersed, rally again, upon the ceasing of 
 persecution, and when the churches have rest and liberty, then this 
 promise has a further accomplishment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. God will feed his people as the <I>sheep of his pasture,</I> that 
 had been famished. God will bring the returning captives safely to 
 their own land 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 <I>will feed them upon the mountains of Israel,</I> and that is a 
 <I>good pasture,</I> and a <I>fat pasture</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);

 there shall their <I>feeding</I> be, and there shall be <I>their 
 fold;</I> and it is a <I>good fold.</I> There God will not only <I>feed 
 them,</I> but <I>cause them to lie down</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 which denotes a comfortable rest after they had tired themselves with 
 their wanderings, and a constant continuing residence; they shall not 
 be driven out again from these green pastures, as they have been, nor 
 shall they be disturbed, but shall lie down in a sweet repose and there 
 shall be <I>none to make them afraid.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+23:2">Ps. xxiii. 2</A>,

 <I>He makes me to lie down in green pastures.</I> Compare this with the
 like promise

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:3,4">Jer. xxiii. 3, 4</A>),

 when God restored them not only to the milk and honey of their own
 land, to the enjoyment of its fruits, but to the privileges of his 
 sanctuary on Mount Zion, the chief of the mountains of Israel. When 
 they had an altar and a temple again, and the benefit of a settled 
 priesthood, then they were fed in a good pasture.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He will succour those that are hurt, will <I>bind up that which was 
 broken and strengthen that which was sick,</I> will comfort those that 
 <I>mourn in Zion</I> and with Zion. If ministers, who should speak 
 peace to those who are of a sorrowful spirit, neglect their duty, yet 
 the Holy Ghost the Comforter will be faithful to his office. But, as it 
 follows, the <I>fat and the strong shall be destroyed.</I> He that has 
 rest for disquieted saints has terror to speak to presumptuous sinners. 
 As <I>every valley</I> shall be <I>filled,</I> so <I>every mountain and 
 hill shall be brought low,</I>

 &nbsp; 20  Therefore thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> unto them; Behold, I,
 <I>even</I> I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean
 cattle.
 &nbsp; 21  Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and
 pushed all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered
 them abroad;
 &nbsp; 22  Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a
 prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle.
 &nbsp; 23  And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed
 them, <I>even</I> my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall
 be their shepherd.
 &nbsp; 24  And I the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will be their God, and my servant David a
 prince among them; I the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> have spoken <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 25  And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will
 cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall
 dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.
 &nbsp; 26  And I will make them and the places round about my hill a
 blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season;
 there shall be showers of blessing.
 &nbsp; 27  And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the
 earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their
 land, and shall know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, when I have broken the
 bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those
 that served themselves of them.
 &nbsp; 28  And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither
 shall the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell
 safely, and none shall make <I>them</I> afraid.
 &nbsp; 29  And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they
 shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear
 the shame of the heathen any more.
 &nbsp; 30  Thus shall they know that I the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> their God <I>am</I> with
 them, and <I>that</I> they, <I>even</I> the house of Israel, <I>are</I> my
 people, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 31  And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, <I>are</I> men, <I>and</I> I
 <I>am</I> your God, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet has no more to say to the shepherds, but he has now a 
 message to deliver to the flock. God had ordered him to speak tenderly 
 to them, and to assure them of the mercy he had in store for them. But 
 here he is ordered to make a difference between some and others of 
 them, to separate between the precious and the vile and then to give 
 them a promise of the Messiah, by whom this distinction should be 
 effectually made, partly at his first coming (for <I>for judgment he 
 came into this world,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:39">John ix. 39</A>,

 to <I>fill the hungry with good things and to send the rich empty
 away,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:53">Luke i. 53</A>),

 but completely at his second coming, when he shall, as it is here said,
 <I>judge between cattle and cattle, as a shepherd divides between the 
 sheep and the goats, and shall set the sheep on his right hand and the 
 goats on his left</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:32,33">Matt. xxv. 32, 33</A>),

 which seems to have reference to this. We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Conviction spoken to those of the flock that were fat and strong, 
 the <I>rams and the he-goats</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 those that, though they had not power, as shepherds and rulers, to 
 oppress with, yet, being rich and wealthy, made use of the opportunity 
 which this gave them to bear hard upon their poor neighbours. Those 
 that have much would have more, and, if they set to it, will have more, 
 so many ways have they of encroaching upon their poor neighbours, and 
 forcing from them the one ewe-lamb, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:4">2 Sam. xii. 4</A>.

 Do not the rich oppress the poor merely with the help of their riches,
 and <I>draw them before the judgment-seats?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:6">Jam. ii. 6</A>.

 Poor servants and tenants are hardly used by their rich lords and
 masters. The <I>rams</I> and the <I>he-goats</I> not only kept all the 
 good pasture to themselves, ate the fat and drank the sweet, but they 
 would not let the poor of the flock have any comfortable enjoyment of 
 the little that was left them; they <I>trod down the residue of the 
 pastures and fouled the residue of the waters,</I> so that the flock 
 was obliged to eat that which they had trodden into the dirt, and drink 
 that which they had muddied,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 This intimates that the great men not only by extortion and oppression 
 made and kept their neighbours poor, and scarcely left them enough to 
 subsist on, but were so vexatious to them that what little coarse fare 
 they had was embittered to them. And this <I>seemed a small thing</I> 
 to them; they thought there was no harm in it, as if it were the 
 privilege of their quality to be injurious to all their neighbours.
 Note, Many that live in pomp and at ease themselves care not what 
 straits those about them are reduced to, so they may but have every 
 thing to their mind. Those that <I>are at ease,</I> and <I>the 
 proud,</I> grudge that any body should live by them with any comfort.
 But this as not all; they not only robbed the poor, to make them 
 poorer, but were troublesome to the sick and weak of the flock 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):
 
 They <I>thrust with side and shoulder</I> those that were feeble (for 
 the weakest goes to the wall) and <I>pushed the diseased with their 
 horns,</I> because they knew they could be too hard for them, when they 
 durst not meddle with their match. It has been observed concerning 
 sheep that if one of the flock be sick and faint the rest will secure 
 it as well as they can, and shelter it from the scorching heat of the 
 sun; but these, on the contrary, were most injurious to the diseased.
 Those that they could not serve themselves of they did what they could 
 to rid the country of, and so <I>scattered them abroad,</I> as if the 
 poor, whom, Christ says, we must have always with us, were public 
 nuisances, not to be relieved, but sent far away from us. Note, It is a 
 barbarous thing to <I>add affliction to the afflicted.</I> Perhaps 
 these <I>rams</I> and <I>he-goats</I> are designed to represent the 
 scribes and Pharisees, for they are such troublers of the church as 
 Christ himself must come to deliver it from, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 They devoured widows' houses, took away the key of knowledge, corrupted 
 the pure water of divine truths, and oppressed the consciences of men 
 with the traditions of the elders, besides that they were continually 
 vexatious and injurious to <I>the poor of the flock</I> that <I>waited 
 on the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:11">Zech. xi. 11</A>.

 Note, It is no new thing for the flock of God to receive a great deal
 of damage and mischief from those that are themselves of the flock, and
 in eminent stations in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:30">Acts xx. 30</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Comfort spoken to those of the flock that are poor and feeble, and 
 that wait for the consolation of Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 "<I>I will save my flock,</I> and they shall no more be spoiled as they 
 have been by the beasts of prey, by their own shepherds or by the rams 
 and he-goats among themselves." Upon this occasion, as is usual in the 
 prophets, comes in a prediction of the coming of the Messiah, and the 
 setting up of his kingdom, and the exceedingly great and precious 
 benefits which the church should enjoy under the protection and 
 influence of that kingdom. Observe what is here foretold,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Concerning the Messiah himself. 

 (1.) He shall have his commission from God himself: I will <I>set him 
 up</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>);

 <I>I will raise him up,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 He sanctified and sealed him, appointed and anointed him. 

 (2.) He shall be the great <I>Shepherd</I> of the sheep, who shall do 
 that for his flock which no one else could do. He is the <I>one 
 Shepherd,</I> under whom Jews and Gentiles should be <I>one fold.</I> 
 
 (3.) He is <I>God's servant,</I> employed by him and for him, and doing 
 all in obedience to his will, with an eye to his glory--his servant, to 
 re-establish his kingdom among men and advance the interests of that 
 kingdom. 

 (4.) He is David, one after God's own heart, set as his King upon the 
 holy hill of Zion, made the head of the corner, with whom the covenant 
 of royalty is made, and to whom God would <I>give the throne of his 
 father David.</I> He is both the <I>root and offspring of David.</I> 
 
 (5.) He is the <I>plant of renown,</I> because a <I>righteous 
 branch</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:5">Jer. xxiii. 5</A>),

 a branch of the Lord, that is <I>beautiful</I> and <I>glorious,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+4:2">Isa. iv. 2</A>.

 He has a name above every name, a throne above every throne, and may
 therefore well be called a <I>branch of renown.</I> Some understand it 
 of the church, the <I>planting of the Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:3">Isa. lxi. 3</A>.
 
 <I>Its name shall be remembered</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:17">Ps. xlv. 17</A>)

 and Christ's in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Concerning the great charter by which the kingdom of the Messiah 
 should be incorporated, and upon which it should be founded 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):
 
 <I>I will make with them a covenant of peace.</I> The covenant of grace 
 is a covenant of peace. In it God is at peace with us, speaks peace to 
 us, and assures us of peace, of all good, all the good we need to make 
 us happy. The tenour of this covenant is: "<I>I the Lord will be their 
 God,</I> a God all-sufficient to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 will own them and will be owned by them; in order to this <I>my servant 
 David shall be a prince among them,</I> to reduce them to their 
 allegiance, to receive their homage, and to reign over them, in them, 
 and for them." Note, Those, and those only, that have the Lord Jesus 
 for <I>their prince</I> have the Lord Jehovah for <I>their God.</I> And 
 then <I>they, even the house of Israel, shall be my people.</I> If we 
 take God to be <I>our God,</I> he will take us to be <I>his people.</I> 
 From this covenant between God and Israel there results communion: 
 "<I>I the Lord their God am with them,</I> to converse with them; and 
 <I>they shall know it,</I> and have the comfort of it."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Concerning the privileges of those that are the faithful subjects of 
 this kingdom of the Messiah and interested in the covenant of peace. 
 These are here set forth figuratively, as the blessings of the flock. 
 But we have a key to it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 Those that belong to this flock, though they are spoken of as 
 <I>sheep,</I> are really men, men that have <I>the Lord for their 
 God,</I> and are in covenant with him. Now to them it is promised,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That they shall enjoy a holy security under the divine protection. 
 Christ, our good Shepherd, has <I>caused the evil beasts to cease out 
 of the land</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 having vanquished all our spiritual enemies, broken their power, and 
 triumphed over them; the roaring lion is not a roaring devouring lion 
 to them; <I>they shall no more be a prey to the heathen</I> nor the 
 heathen a terror to them, <I>neither shall the beasts of the land 
 devour them.</I> Sin and Satan, death and hell, are conquered. And then 
 <I>they shall dwell safely,</I> not only in the folds, but in the 
 fields, <I>in the wilderness, in the woods,</I> where the beasts of 
 prey are; they shall not only dwell there, but they shall sleep there, 
 which denotes not only that the beasts being <I>made to cease</I> there 
 shall be no danger, but, their consciences being purified and pacified, 
 they shall be in no apprehension of danger; not only safe from evil, 
 but quiet from the fear of evil. Note, Those may lay down and sleep 
 securely, sleep at ease, that have Christ for their prince; for he will 
 be their protector, and make them to dwell in safety. None shall hurt 
 them, nay, <I>none shall make them afraid.</I> If God be for us, who 
 can be against us? <I>Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be 
 removed.</I> Through Christ, God delivers his people not only from the 
 things they have reason to fear, but from their fear even of death 
 itself, from all that fear that has torment. This safety from evil is
 promised 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>They shall be safe in their land,</I> in no danger of being invaded 
 and enslaved, though their great plenty be a temptation to their 
 neighbours to <I>desire their land;</I> and that which shall make them 
 think themselves safe is their confidence in the wisdom, power, and 
 goodness of God: <I>They shall know that I am the Lord.</I> All our 
 disquieting fears arise from our ignorance of God and mistakes 
 concerning him. Their experience of his particular care concerning them 
 encourages their confidence in him: "<I>I have broken the bands of 
 their yoke,</I> with which they have been brought and held down under 
 oppression, and have <I>delivered them out of the hand of those that 
 served themselves of them,</I> whence they shall argue, He that has 
 delivered does and will, therefore will we dwell safely." This is 
 explained, and applied to our gospel-state, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:74">Luke i. 74</A>.

 <I>That we, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, might serve
 him without fear,</I> as those may do that serve him in faith.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That they shall enjoy a spiritual plenty of all good things, the 
 best things, for their comfort and happiness: <I>They shall no more be 
 consumed with hunger in the land,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 Famine and scarcity, when Israel was punished with that judgment, 
 turned as much to their reproach among the heathen as any other, 
 because the fruitfulness of Canaan was so much talked of. But now 
 <I>they shall not bear that shame of the heathen any more</I> For the 
 <I>showers shall come down in their season,</I> even <I>showers of 
 blessing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Christ is a Shepherd that will feed his people; and they shall <I>go in 
 and out, and find pasture.</I> 

 [1.] They shall not be consumed with hunger; for they shall not be put 
 off with the world for a portion, which is not bread, which satisfies 
 not, and which leaves those that are put off with it to be <I>consumed 
 with hunger.</I> The ordinances of the ceremonial law are called 
 <I>beggarly elements,</I> for there was little in them, compared with 
 the Christian institutes, <I>wherewith the mower fills his hand and he 
 that binds sheaves his bosom.</I> Those that <I>hunger and thirst after 
 righteousness</I> shall not be consumed with that hunger, for <I>they 
 shall be filled.</I> And he that drinks of the water that Christ gives 
 him, the still waters by which he leads his sheep, shall <I>never 
 thirst.</I>

 [2.] <I>Showers of blessings</I> shall come upon them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>.

 The heavens shall yield their dews; the <I>trees of the field</I> also
 shall <I>yield their fruit.</I> The seat of this plenty is <I>God's 
 hill,</I> his holy hill of Zion, for on that mountain, in the gospel 
 church, it is, that God has <I>made to all nations a feast;</I> to that 
 those must join themselves who would partake of gospel benefits. The 
 cause of this plenty is the <I>showers that come down in their 
 season,</I> that descend upon the mountains of Zion, the graces of 
 Christ, his doctrine that drops as the dew, the graces of Christ, and 
 the fruits and comforts of his Spirit, by which we are made fruitful in 
 the fruits of righteousness. The instances of this plenty are the 
 blessings of heaven poured down upon us and the productions of grace 
 brought forth by us, our comfort in God's favour and God's glory in our 
 fruit-bearing. The extent of this plenty is very large, to all the 
 <I>places round about my hill;</I> for <I>out of Zion shall go forth 
 the law,</I> shall go forth light to a dark world, and the river that 
 shall water a dry and desert world; all that are in the neighbourhood 
 of Zion shall fare the better for it; and the nearer the church the 
 nearer its God. And, <I>lastly,</I> The <I>effect of this plenty</I> 
 is, <I>I will make them a blessing,</I> eminently and exemplarily 
 blessed, patterns of happiness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:24">Isa. xix. 24</A>.

 Or, They shall be blessings to all about them, diffusively useful.
 Note, Those that are the <I>blessed of the Lord</I> must study to make 
 themselves blessings to the world. He that is good, let him do 
 <I>good;</I> he that has received the gift, the grace, let him minister 
 the same.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now this promise of the Messiah and his kingdom spoke much comfort to 
 those to whom it was then made, for they might be sure that God would 
 not utterly <I>destroy</I> their nation, how low soever it might be 
 brought, as long as that <I>blessing</I> was <I>in</I> the womb of
 <I>it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:8">Isa. lxv. 8</A>.

 But it speaks much more comfort to us, to whom it is fulfilled, who are
 the sheep of this good Shepherd, are fed in his pastures, and 
 <I>blessed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly things</I> by 
 him.</P>
