 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter, as the former, in intended both for the conviction of 
 idolaters and for the consolation of all God's faithful worshippers; 
 for the Spirit is sent, and ministers are employed by him, both to 
 convince and to comfort. And however this might be primarily intended 
 for the conviction of Babylonians, and the comfort of Israelites, or 
 for the conviction of those in Israel that were addicted to idolatry, 
 as multitudes were, and the comfort of those that kept their integrity, 
 doubtless it was intended both for admonition and encouragement to us, 
 admonition to keep ourselves from idols and encouragement to trust in 
 God. Here, 

 I. God by the prophet shows the folly of those that worshipped idols,
 especially that thought their idols able to contest with him and 
 control him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:1-9">ver. 1-9</A>.

 II. He encourages his faithful ones to trust in him, with an assurance
 that he would take their part against their enemies, make them 
 victorious over them, and bring about a happy change of their affairs, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:10-20">ver. 10-20</A>.

 III. He challenges the idols, that were rivals with him for men's
 adoration, to vie with him either for knowledge or power, either to 
 show things to come or to do good or evil, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:21-29">ver. 21-29</A>.

 So that the chapter may be summed up in those words of Elijah, "If 
 Jehovah be God, then follow him; but, if Baal be God, then follow him;" 
 and in the people's acknowledgment, upon the issue of the trial, 
 "Jehovah he is the God, Jehovah he is the God."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Keep silence before me, O islands; and let the people renew
 <I>their</I> strength: let them come near; then let them speak: let us
 come near together to judgment.
 &nbsp; 2  Who raised up the righteous <I>man</I> from the east, called him
 to his foot, gave the nations before him, and made <I>him</I> rule
 over kings? he gave <I>them</I> as the dust to his sword, <I>and</I> as
 driven stubble to his bow.
 &nbsp; 3  He pursued them, <I>and</I> passed safely; <I>even</I> by the way
 <I>that</I> he had not gone with his feet.
 &nbsp; 4  Who hath wrought and done <I>it,</I> calling the generations from
 the beginning? I the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the first, and with the last; I <I>am</I>
 he.
 &nbsp; 5  The isles saw <I>it,</I> and feared; the ends of the earth were
 afraid, drew near, and came.
 &nbsp; 6  They helped every one his neighbour; and <I>every one</I> said to
 his brother, Be of good courage.
 &nbsp; 7  So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, <I>and</I> he that
 smootheth <I>with</I> the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It
 <I>is</I> ready for the sodering: and he fastened it with nails,
 <I>that</I> it should not be moved.
 &nbsp; 8  But thou, Israel, <I>art</I> my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen,
 the seed of Abraham my friend.
 &nbsp; 9  <I>Thou</I> whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and
 called thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou
 <I>art</I> my servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 That particular instance of God's care for his people Israel in raising 
 up Cyrus to be their deliverer is here insisted upon as a great proof 
 both of his sovereignty above all idols and of his power to protect his 
 people. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A general challenge to the worshippers and admirers of idols to make 
 good their pretensions, in competition with God and opposition to him, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 
 Is is renewed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>Produce your cause.</I> The court is set, summonses are sent to the
 islands that lay most remote, but not out of God's jurisdiction, for he 
 is the <I>Creator and possessor of the ends of the earth,</I> to make 
 their appearance and give their attendance. Silence (as usual) is 
 proclaimed while the cause is in trying: "<I>Keep silence before 
 me,</I> and judge nothing before the time" ; while the cause is in 
 trying between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of Satan it becomes 
 all people silently to expect the issue, not to object against God's 
 proceedings, but to be confident that he will carry the day. The 
 defenders of idolatry are called to say what they can in defence of it: 
 "<I>Let them renew their strength,</I> in opposition to God, and see 
 whether it be equal to the strength which those renew that wait upon 
 him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:31"><I>ch.</I> xl. 31</A>);

 let them try their utmost efforts, whether by force of arms or force of 
 argument. <I>Let them come near;</I> they shall not complain that God's 
 <I>dread makes them afraid</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:21">Job xiii. 21</A>),

 so that they cannot say what they have to say, in vindication and
 honour of their idols; no, <I>let them speak</I> freely: <I>Let us come 
 near together to judgment.</I>" Note.

 1. The cause of God and his kingdom is not afraid of a fair trial; if 
 the case be but fairly stated, it will be surely carried in favour of 
 religion.

 2. The enemies of God's church and his holy religion may safely be 
 challenged to say and do their worst for the support of their 
 unrighteous cause. He that <I>sits in heaven laughs at them,</I> and 
 the <I>daughter of Zion despises them;</I> for <I>great is the truth 
 and will prevail.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He particularly challenges the idols to do that for their 
 worshippers, and against his, which he had done and would do for his 
 worshippers, and against theirs. Different senses are given of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>,
 
 concerning <I>the righteous man raised up from the east;</I> and, since
 we cannot determine which is the true, we will make use of each as 
 good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That which is to be proved is, 

 (1.) That <I>the Lord is God</I> alone, <I>the first and with the 
 last</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 that he is infinite, eternal, and unchangeable, that he governed the 
 world from the beginning, and will to the end of time. He has reigned 
 of old, and will reign for ever; the counsels of his kingdom were from 
 eternity, and the continuance of it will be to eternity. 

 (2.) That <I>Israel</I> is <I>his servant</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 whom he owns, and protects, and employs, and in whom he is and will be
 glorified. As there is a God in heaven, so there is a church on earth 
 that is his particular care. Elijah prays
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:36">1 Kings xviii. 36</A>),

 <I>Let it be known that thou art God, and that I am thy servant.</I>
 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. To prove this he shows,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That it was he who called Abraham, the father of this despised 
 nation, out of an idolatrous country, and by many instances of his 
 favour <I>made his name great,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:2">Gen. xii. 2</A>.

 He is <I>the righteous man whom God raised up from the east.</I> Of him
 the Chaldee paraphrast expressly understands it: <I>Who brought Abraham 
 publicly from the east?</I> To maintain the honour of the people of 
 Israel, it was very proper to show what a figure this great ancestor of 
 theirs made in his day; and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>

 seems to be the explication of it, where God calls Israel the <I>seed 
 of Abraham my friend;</I> and

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)

 he <I>calls the generations</I> (namely, the generations of Israel) 
 <I>from the beginning.</I> Also, to put contempt upon idolatry, and 
 particularly the Chaldean idolatry, it was proper to show how Abraham 
 was called from serving other gods

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:2,3">Josh. xxiv. 2, 3</A>,

 &c.), so that an early testimony was borne against that idolatry which
 boasted so much of its antiquity. Also, to encourage the captives in
 Babylon to hope that God would find a way for their return to their own 
 land, it was proper to remind them how at first he brought their father 
 Abraham out of the same country into this land, to give it to him for 
 an inheritance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:7">Gen. xv. 7</A>.

 Now observe what is here said concerning him.

 [1.] That he was a <I>righteous man,</I> or <I>righteousness,</I> a 
 <I>man of righteousness,</I> that <I>believed God, and it was counted 
 to him for righteousness;</I> and so he became the father of all those 
 who by faith in Christ are made the <I>righteousness of God through 
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:3,11,2Co+5:21">Rom. iv. 3, 11; 2 Cor. v. 21</A>.

 He was a great example of righteousness in his day, and <I>taught his
 household to do judgment and justice,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:19">Gen. xviii. 19</A>.

 [2.] That God <I>raised him up from the east,</I> from Ur first and 
 afterwards from Haran, which lay east from Canaan. God would not let 
 him settle in either of those places, but did by him as the eagle by 
 her young, when she stirs up her nest: he raised him out of iniquity 
 and made him pious, out of obscurity and made him famous. 

 [3.] He <I>called him to his foot,</I> to follow him with an implicit 
 faith; for he <I>went out, not knowing whither he went,</I> but whom he 
 followed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:8">Heb. xi. 8</A>.

 Those whom God effectually calls he calls to his foot, to be subject to
 him, to attend him, and <I>follow the Lamb whithersoever he goes;</I> 
 and we must all either come to his foot or be made his footstool.

 [4.] <I>He gave nations before him,</I> the nations of Canaan, which he 
 promised to make him master of, and thus far gave him an interest in 
 that the Hittites acknowledged him a mighty prince among them, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+23:6">Gen. xxiii. 6</A>.

 He <I>made him rule over</I> those <I>kings</I> whom he conquered for
 the rescue of his brother Lot,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:1-24">Gen. xiv</A>.

 And when God <I>gave them as dust to his sword, and as driven stubble
 to his bow</I> (that is, made them an easy prey to his catechised 
 servants), <I>he</I> then <I>pursued them, and passed safely,</I> or in 
 peace, under the divine protection, though it was in a way he was 
 altogether unacquainted with; and so considerable was this victory that 
 Melchizedec himself appeared to celebrate it. Now who did this but the 
 great Jehovah? Can any of the gods of the heathen do so?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That it is he who will, ere long, raise up Cyrus from the east. It 
 is spoken of according to the language of prophecy as a thing past, 
 because as sure to be done in its season as if it were already done. 
 <I>God will raise him up in righteousness</I> (so it may be read, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:13"><I>ch.</I> xlv. 13</A>),

 <I>will call him to his foot,</I> make what use of him he pleases, and
 make him victorious over the nations that oppose his coming to the 
 crown, and give him success in all his wars; and he shall be a type of 
 Christ, who is righteousness itself, the Lord our righteousness, whom 
 God will, in the fulness of time, raise up and make victorious over the 
 powers of darkness; so that he shall spoil them and make a show of them 
 openly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He exposes the folly of idolaters, who, notwithstanding the 
 convincing proofs which the God of Israel had given of his being God 
 alone, obstinately persisted in their idolatry, nay, were so much the 
 more hardened in it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>The isles of the Gentiles saw this,</I> not only what God did for 
 Abraham himself, but what he did for his seed, for his sake, how he 
 brought them out of Egypt, and made them <I>rule over kings,</I> and 
 <I>they feared,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:14-16">Exod. xv. 14-16</A>.

 They were afraid, and, according to the summons

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 they <I>drew near, and came;</I> they could not avoid taking notice of 
 what God did for Abraham and his seed; but, instead of helping to 
 reason one another out of their sottish idolatries, they helped to 
 confirm one another in them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 1. They looked upon it as a dangerous design upon their religion,
 which they were jealous for the honour of, and were resolved, right or 
 wrong, to adhere to, and therefore were alarmed to appear vigorously 
 for the support of it, as the Ephesians for their Diana. When God, by
 his wonderful appearances on the behalf of his people, went about to 
 wrest their idols from them, they held them so much the faster, and 
 said one to another, "<I>Be of good courage;</I> let us unanimously 
 agree to keep up the reputation of our gods. Though Dagon fall before 
 the ark, he shall be set up again in his place." One tradesman 
 encourages another to come into a confederacy for the keeping up of the 
 noble craft of god-making. Thus men's convictions often exasperate 
 their corruptions, and they are made worse both by the word and the 
 works of God, which should make them better.

 2. They looked upon it as a dangerous design upon themselves. They 
 thought themselves in danger from the growing greatness both of Abraham 
 that was a convert from idolatry, and of the people of Israel that were 
 separatists from it; and therefore they not only had recourse to their 
 old gods for protection, but made <I>new</I> ones, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:17">Deut. xxxii. 17</A>.

 <I>So the carpenter,</I> having done his part to the timberwork,
 <I>encouraged the goldsmith</I> to do his part in gilding or overlaying 
 it; and, when it came into the goldsmith's hand, <I>he that smooths 
 with the hammer</I> that polishes it, or beats it thin, quickened 
 <I>him that smote the anvil,</I> bade him be expeditious, and told him 
 it was <I>ready for the soldering,</I> which perhaps was the last 
 operation about it, and then it is <I>fastened with nails,</I> and you 
 have a god of it presently. Do sinners thus animate and quicken one 
 another in the ways of sin? And shall not the servants of the living 
 God both stir up one another to, and strengthen one another in, his 
 service? Some read all this ironically, and by way of permission: 
 <I>Let them help every one his neighbour; let the carpenter encourage 
 the goldsmith;</I> but all in vain; idols shall fall for all this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He encourages his own people to trust in him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>):

 "<I>But thou, Israel, art my servant.</I> They know me not, but thou 
 knowest me, and knowest better than to join with such ignorant besotted 
 people as these" (for it is intended for a warning to the people of God 
 not to <I>walk in the way of the heathen</I>); "they put themselves 
 under the protection of these impotent deities, but thou art under my 
 protection. <I>Those that make them are like unto them, and so is
 every one that trusts in them; but thou, O Israel!</I> art the servant 
 of a better Master." Observe what is suggested here for the 
 encouragement of God's people when they are threatened and insulted 
 over. 

 1. They are God's servants, and he will not see them abused, especially 
 for what they do in his service: <I>Thou art my servant</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),
 
 and 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 "<I>I have said unto thee, Thou art my servant;</I> and I will not go 
 back from my word." 

 2. He has <I>chosen</I> them to be a peculiar people to himself. They 
 were not forced upon him, but of his own good-will he set them apart. 

 3. They were the seed of Abraham his friend. It was the honour of 
 Abraham that he was <I>called the friend of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:23">James ii. 23</A>),

 whom God covenanted and conversed with as a friend, and the <I>man of
 his counsel;</I> and <I>this honour have all the saints,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:15">John xv. 15</A>.
 
 And for the father's sake the people of Israel were beloved. God was
 pleased to look upon them as the posterity of an old friend of his, and 
 therefore to be kind to them; for the covenant of friendship was made 
 with Abraham and his seed.

 4. He had sometimes, when they had been scattered among the heathen,
 fetched them from the ends of the earth and taken them out of the hands 
 of the chief ones thereof, and therefore he would not now abandon them.
 Abraham their father was fetched from a place at a great distance, and 
 they in his loins; and those who had been thus far-fetched and 
 dear-bought he could not easily part with. 

 5. He had not yet cast them away, though they had often provoked him,
 and therefore he would not now abandon them. What God has done for his 
 people, and what he has further engaged to do, should encourage them to 
 trust in him at all times.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The scope of these verses is to silence the fears, and encourage the 
 faith, of the servants of God in their distresses. Perhaps it is 
 intended, in the first place, for the support of God's Israel, in 
 captivity; but all that faithfully serve God <I>through patience and 
 comfort of this scripture may have hope.</I> And it is addressed to 
 Israel as a single person, that it might the more easily and readily be 
 accommodated and applied by every Israelite indeed to himself. That is 
 a word of caution, counsel, and comfort, which is so often repeated, 
 <I>Fear thou not;</I> and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 <I>Fear not;</I> and 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 "<I>Fear not, thou worm Jacob;</I> fear not the threatenings of the 
 enemy, doubt not the promise of thy God; fear not that thou shalt 
 perish in thy affliction or that the promise of thy deliverance shall 
 fail." It is against the mind of God that his people should be a 
 timorous people. For the suppressing of fear he assures them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That they may depend upon his presence with them as their God, and a 
 God all-sufficient for them in the worst of times. Observe with what 
 tenderness God speaks, and how willing he is to let the heirs of 
 promise know the immutability of his counsel, and how desirous to make 
 them easy: "<I>Fear thou not, for I am with thee,</I> not only within 
 call, but present with thee; <I>be not dismayed</I> at the power of 
 those that are against thee, for <I>I am thy God,</I> and engaged for 
 thee. Art thou weak? <I>I will strengthen thee.</I> Art thou destitute
 of friends? <I>I will help thee</I> in the time of need. Art thou ready 
 to sink, ready to fall? <I>I will uphold thee with the right hand of my 
 righteousness,</I> that right hand which is full of righteousness, in 
 dispensing rewards and punishments," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:10">Ps. xlviii. 10</A>.
 
 And again
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)

 it is promised, 

 1. That God will strengthen their hands, that is, will help them: "<I>I 
 will hold thy right hand,</I> go hand in hand with thee" (so some): he 
 will take us by the hand as our guide, to lead us in our way, will help 
 us up when we are fallen or prevent our falls; when we are weak he will 
 hold us up-wavering, he will fix us-trembling, he will encourage us, 
 and so <I>hold us by the right hand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:23">Ps. lxxiii. 23</A>.

 2. That he will silence their fears: <I>Saying unto thee, Fear
 not.</I> He has said it again and again in his word, and has there 
 provided sovereign antidotes against fear: but he will go further; he 
 will by his Spirit say it to their hearts, and make them to hear it, 
 and so will help them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That though their enemies be now very formidable, insolent, and 
 severe, yet the day is coming when God will reckon with them and they 
 shall triumph over them. There are those that are incensed against 
 God's people, that <I>strive with them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 that war against them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 that hate them, that seek their ruin, and are continually picking 
 quarrels with them. But let not God's people be incensed at them, nor 
 strive with them, nor render evil for evil; but wait God's time, and 
 believe, 

 1. That they shall be convinced of the folly, at least, if not of the
 sin of striving with God's people; and, finding it to no purpose, 
 <I>they shall be ashamed and confounded,</I> which might bring them to 
 repentance, but will rather fill them with rage. 

 2. That they shall be quite ruined and undone

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>They shall be as nothing</I> before the justice and power of God. 
 When God comes to deal with his proud enemies he makes nothing of them. 
 Or they shall be brought to nothing, shall be as if they had never 
 been. This is repeated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 They <I>shall be as nothing and as a thing of nought,</I> or as that 
 which is gone and has failed. Those that were formidable shall become 
 despicable; those that fancied they could do any thing shall be able to 
 bring nothing to pass; those that made a figure in the world, and a 
 mighty noise, shall become mere ciphers and be buried in silence. They 
 shall perish, not only be nothing, but be miserable: <I>Thou shalt seek 
 them,</I> shalt enquire what has become of them, that they do not 
 appear as usual, but thou <I>shalt not find them</I> as David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:36">Ps. xxxvii. 36</A>.
 
 <I>I sought him, but he could not be found.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That they themselves should become a terror to those who were now 
 a terror to them, and victory should turn on their side, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:14-16"><I>v.</I> 14-16</A>.

 See here, 

 1. How Jacob and Israel are reduced and brought very low. It is the 
 <I>worm Jacob,</I> so little, so weak, and so defenceless, despised and 
 trampled on by every body, forced to creep even into the earth for 
 safety; and we must not wonder that Jacob has become a worm, when even 
 Jacob's King calls himself <I>a worm and no man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:6">Ps. xxii. 6</A>.

 God's people are sometimes as worms, in their humble thoughts of
 themselves and their enemies' haughty thoughts of them--worms, but not 
 vipers, as their enemies are, not of the serpent's seed. God regards 
 Jacob's low estate, and says, "<I>Fear not, thou worm Jacob;</I> fear 
 not that thou shalt be crushed; and <I>you men of Israel</I>" (<I>you 
 few men,</I> so some read it, <I>you dead men,</I> so others) "do not 
 give up yourselves for gone notwithstanding." Note, The grace of God 
 will silence fears even when there seems to be the greatest cause for 
 them. <I>Perplexed but not in despair.</I>

 2. How Jacob and Israel are advanced from this low estate, and made as 
 formidable as ever they have been despicable. But <I>by whom shall 
 Jacob arise, for he is small?</I> We are here told: <I>I will help
 thee, saith the Lord;</I> and it is the honour of God to help the weak. 
 He will help them, for he is their Redeemer, who is wont to redeem 
 them, who has undertaken to do it. Christ is the Redeemer, from him is
 our help found. He will help them, for he is the <I>Holy One of 
 Israel,</I> worshipped among them in the beauty of holiness and engaged 
 by promise to them. The Lord will help them by enabling them to help 
 themselves and making Jacob to become <I>a threshing instrument.</I> 
 Observe, He is but an instrument, a tool in God's hand, that he is 
 pleased to make use of; and he is an instrument of God's making and is 
 no more than God makes him. But, if God make him a threshing 
 instrument, he will make use of him, and therefore will make him fit 
 for use, <I>new</I> and <I>sharp,</I> and <I>having teeth,</I> or sharp 
 spikes; and then, by divine direction and strength, <I>thou shalt 
 thresh the mountains,</I> the highest, and strongest, and most stubborn 
 of thy enemies: thou shalt not only be at them, but <I>beat them 
 small;</I> they shall not be a corn threshed out, which is valuable, 
 and is carefully preserved (such God's people are when they are under 
 the flail,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:10"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 10</A>:

 <I>O my threshing!</I> yet <I>the corn of my floor,</I> that shall not
 be lost); but these are made <I>as chaff,</I> which is good for 
 nothing, and which the husbandman is glad to get rid of. He pursues the 
 metaphor, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Having threshed them, <I>thou shalt winnow them, and the wind shall 
 scatter them.</I> This perhaps had its accomplishment, in part, in the 
 victories of the Jews over their enemies in the times of the Maccabees; 
 but it seems in general designed to read the final doom of all the 
 implacable enemies of the church of God, and to have its accomplishment 
 like wise in the triumphs of the cross of Christ, the gospel of Christ, 
 and all the faithful followers of Christ, over the powers of darkness, 
 which, first or last, shall all be dissipated, and in Christ all 
 believers shall be more than conquerors, and <I>he that overcomes shall 
 have power over the nations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:26">Rev. ii. 26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That, hereupon, they shall have abundance of comfort in God, and 
 God shall have abundance of honour from them: <I>Thou shalt rejoice in 
 the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 When we are freed from that which hindered our joy, and are blessed 
 with that which is the matter of it, we ought to remember that God is 
 our exceeding joy and in him all our joys must terminate. When we 
 rejoice over our enemies we must rejoice in the Lord, for to him alone 
 we owe our liberties and victories. "Thou shalt also <I>glory in the 
 Holy One of Israel,</I> in thy interest in him and relation to him, and 
 what he has done for thee." And, if thus we make God our praise and 
 glory, we become to him for a praise and a glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. That they shall have seasonable and suitable supplies of every thing 
 that is proper for them in the time of need; and, if there be occasion, 
 God will again do for them as he did for Israel in their march from 
 Egypt to Canaan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:17-19"><I>v.</I> 17-19</A>.

 When the captives, either in Babylon or in their return thence, are in 
 distress for want of water or shelter, God will take care of them, and, 
 one way or other, make their journey, even through a wilderness, 
 comfortable to them. But doubtless this promise has more than such a 
 private interpretation. Their return out of Babylon was typical of our 
 redemption by Christ; and so the contents of these promises, 

 1. Were provided by the gospel of Christ. That glorious discovery of 
 his love has given full assurance to all those who hear this joyful 
 sound that God has provided inestimable comforts for them, sufficient 
 for the supply of all their wants, the balancing of all their griefs, 
 and the answering of all their prayers. 

 2. They are applied by the grace and Spirit of Christ to all believers, 
 that they may have strong consolation in their way and a complete 
 happiness in their end. Our way to heaven lies through the wilderness 
 of this world. Now,

 (1.) It is here supposed that the people of God, in their passage 
 through this world, are often in straits: <I>The poor and needy seek 
 water, and there is none; the poor in spirit hunger and thirst after 
 righteousness.</I> The soul of man, finding itself empty and 
 necessitous, seeks for satisfaction somewhere, but soon despairs of 
 finding it in the world, that has nothing in it to make it easy: 
 creatures are <I>broken cisterns, that can hold no water;</I> so that 
 <I>their tongue fails for thirst,</I> they are weary of seeking that 
 satisfaction in the world which is not to be had in it. Their sorrow 
 makes them thirsty; so does their toil. 

 (2.) It is here promised that, one way or other, all their grievances 
 shall be redressed and they shall be made easy.

 [1.] God himself will be nigh unto them in all that which they call 
 upon him for. Let all the praying people of God take notice of this, 
 and take comfort of it; he has said, "<I>I the Lord will hear them,</I> 
 will answer them; <I>I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them;</I> I 
 will be with them, as I have always been, in their distresses." While 
 we are in the wilderness of this world this promise is to us what the 
 pillar of cloud and fire was to Israel, an assurance of God's gracious 
 presence. 

 [2.] They shall have a constant supply of fresh water, as Israel had in 
 the wilderness, even where one would least expect it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>I will open rivers in high places,</I> rivers of grace, rivers of 
 pleasure, <I>rivers of living water,</I> which he spoke of the Spirit 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:38,39">John vii. 38, 39</A>),

 that Spirit which should be poured out upon the Gentiles, who had been
 as high places, dry and barren, and lifted up on their own conceit 
 above the necessity of that gift. And there shall be <I>fountains in 
 the midst of the valleys,</I> the valleys of Baca

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:6">Ps. lxxxiv. 6</A>),

 that are sandy and wearisome; or among the Jews, who had been as
 fruitful valleys in comparison with the Gentile mountains. The
 preaching of the gospel to the world turned that wilderness into a pool 
 of water, yielding fruit to the owner of it and relief to the 
 travellers through it.

 [3.] They shall have a pleasant shade to screen them from the scorching 
 heat of the sun, as Israel when they pitched at Elim, where they had 
 not only wells of water, but palm-trees 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:27">Exod. xv. 27</A>):

 "<I>I will plant in the wilderness the cedar,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 I will turn the wilderness into an orchard or garden, such as used to 
 be planted with these pleasant trees, so that they shall pass through 
 the wilderness with as much ease and delight as a man walks in his 
 grove. These trees shall be to them what the pillar of cloud was to
 Israel in the wilderness, a shelter from the heat." Christ and his 
 grace are so to believers, <I>as the shadow of a great rock,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:2"><I>ch.</I> xxxii. 2</A>.

 When God sets up his church in the Gentile wilderness there shall be as
 great a change made by it in men's characters as if thorns and briers 
 were turned into cedars, and fir-trees, and myrtles; and by this a 
 blessed change is described,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:13"><I>ch.</I> lv. 13</A>.

 [4.] They shall see and acknowledge the hand of God, his power and his
 favour, in this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 God will do these strange and surprising things on purpose to awaken 
 them to a conviction and consideration of his hand in all: <I>That they 
 may see</I> this wonderful change, <I>and knowing</I> that it is above 
 the ordinary course and power of nature may consider that therefore it 
 comes from a superior power, and, comparing notes upon it, <I>may 
 understand together,</I> and concur in the acknowledgment of it, 
 <I>that the hand of the Lord,</I> that mighty hand of his which is 
 stretched out for his people and stretched out to them, <I>has done 
 this,</I> and <I>the Holy One of Israel has created it,</I> made it 
 anew, made it out of nothing, made it for the comfort of his people. 
 Note, God does great things for his people, that he may be taken notice 
 of.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  Produce your cause, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; bring forth your strong

 &nbsp; 22  Let them bring <I>them</I> forth, and show us what shall happen:

 consider them, and know the latter end of them; or declare us
 things for to come.

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The Lord, by the prophet, here repeats the challenge to idolaters to 
 make out the pretentions of their idols: "<I>Produce your cause</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>)

 and make your best of it; <I>bring forth the strongest reasons</I> you 
 have to prove that your idols are gods, and worthy of your adoration." 
 Note, There needs no more to show the absurdity of sin than to produce 
 the reasons that are given in defence of it, for they carry with them 
 their own confutation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The idols are here challenged to bring proofs of their knowledge and 
 power. Let us see what they can inform us of, and what they can do. 
 Understanding and active power are the accomplishments of a man. 
 Whoever pretends to be a god must have these in perfection; and have 
 the idols made it to appear that they have? No;</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. "They can tell us nothing that we did not know before, so ignorant 
 are they. We challenge them to inform us," 

 (1.) "What has been formerly: <I>Let them show the former things,</I> 
 and raise them out of the oblivion in which they were buried" (God 
 inspired Moses to write such a history of the creation as the gods of 
 the heathen could never have dictated to any of their enthusiasts); or 
 "let the defenders of idols tell us what mighty achievements they can 
 boast of as performed by their gods in former times. What did they ever 
 do that was worth taking notice of? Let them specify any thing, and it 
 shall be considered, its due weight shall be given it, and it shall be 
 compared with the latter end of it; and if, in the issue, it prove to 
 be as great as it pretended to be, they shall have the credit of it." 
 
 (2.) "We challenge them to tell us what shall happen, to declare to us 
 <I>things to come</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),
 
 and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 <I>show the things that are to come hereafter.</I> Give this evidence 
 of your omniscience, that nothing can be hidden from you, and of your 
 sovereignty and dominion. Make it to appear that you have the doing of 
 all, by letting us know beforehand what you deign to do. Do this 
 kindness to the world; let them know what is to come, that they may 
 provide accordingly. Do this, and we will own that you are gods above 
 us, and gods to us, and worthy of our adoration." No creature can 
 foretel things to come, otherwise than by divine information, with any 
 certainty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. "They can do nothing that we cannot do ourselves, so impotent are 
 they." He challenges them to do either <I>good or evil,</I> good to 
 their friends or evil to their enemies: "Let them do, if they can, any 
 thing extraordinary, that people will admire and be affected with. Let 
 them either bless or curse, with power. Let us see them either inflict 
 such plagues such as God brought on Egypt or bestow such blessings as 
 God bestowed on Israel. Let them do some great thing, and we shall be 
 amazed when we see it, and frightened into a veneration of them, as 
 many have been into a veneration of the true God." That which is 
 charged upon these idols, and let them disprove it if they can, is that 
 <I>they are of nothing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Their claims have no foundation at all, nor is there any ground or 
 reason in the least for men's paying them the respect they do; there is 
 nothing in them worthy our regard. "They are less than nothing, worse
 than nothing;" so some read it. "<I>The work they do is of nought,</I>
 and so is the ado that is made about them. There is no pretence or 
 colour for it; it is all a jest; it is all a sham put upon the world; 
 and therefore <I>he that chooses you,</I> and so give you your deity, 
 and" (as some read it) "that delights in you, <I>is an 
 abomination;</I>" so some take it. A servant is at liberty to choose 
 his master, but a man is not at liberty to choose his God. He that 
 chooses any other than the true God chooses an abomination; his 
 choosing it makes it so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God here produces proofs that he is the true God, and that there is 
 none besides him. Let him produce his strong reasons.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He has an irresistible power. This he will shortly make to appear in 
 the raising up of Cyrus and making him a type of Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>He will raise him up from the north</I> and <I>from the rising of 
 the sun.</I> Cyrus by his father was a Mede, by his mother a Persian; 
 and his army consisted of Medes, whose country lay north, and Persians, 
 whose country lay east, from Babylon. God will raise him up to great 
 power, and he shall come against Babylon with ends of his own to serve.
 But, 

 (1.) <I>He shall proclaim God's name;</I> so it may be read. He shall 
 publish the honour of the God of Israel; so he did remarkably when, in 
 his proclamation for the release of the Jews out of their captivity, he 
 acknowledged that the Lord God of Israel was the Lord God of heaven, 
 and <I>the God:</I> and he might be said to call on his name when he 
 encouraged the building of his temple, and very probably did himself 
 call upon him and pray to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:2,3">Ezra i. 2, 3</A>.

 (2.) All opposition shall fall before him: <I>He shall come upon the 
 princes of Babylon,</I> and all others that stood in his way, <I>as 
 mortar,</I> and trample upon them <I>as the potter treads clay,</I> to 
 serve his own purposes with it. Christ, as man, was raised up from the 
 north, for Nazareth lay in the northern parts of Canaan; as the angel 
 of the covenant, he ascends from the east. He maintained the honour of 
 heaven (<I>he shall call upon my name</I>), and broke the powers of 
 hell, came upon the prince of darkness as mortar and trod him down.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He has an infallible foresight. He would not only do this, but he 
 did now, by his prophet, foretel it. Now the false gods not only could 
 not do it, but they could not foresee it. 

 (1.) He challenges them to produce any of their pretended deities, or 
 their diviners, that had given notice of this, or could

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 "<I>Who has declared from the beginning</I> any thing of this kind, or 
 has told it before-time? Tell us if there be any that you know of, for 
 we know not any; if there be any, <I>we will say, He is righteous,</I> 
 he is true, his cause is just, his claims are proved, and he is in the 
 right in demanding to be worshipped." This agrees with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>.

 (2.) He challenges to himself the sole honour of doing it and 
 foretelling it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>I am the first</I> (so it may be read) <I>that will say to Zion, 
 Behold, behold them,</I> that will let the people of Israel know their 
 deliverers are at hand (for there were those who understood by books, 
 God's books, the approach of the time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:2">Dan. ix. 2</A>),

 and I am he that <I>will give to Jerusalem one that brings good
 tidings,</I> these good tidings of their enlargement. This is 
 applicable to the work of redemption, in which the Lord showed himself 
 much more than in the release of the Jews out of Babylon: he it was 
 that contrived our salvation, and he brought it about, and he has given 
 to us the glad tidings of reconciliation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Judgment is here given upon this trial. 

 1. None of all the idols had foretold, or could foresee, this work of 
 wonder. Other nations besides the Jews were released out of captivity 
 in Babylon by Cyrus, or at least were greatly concerned in the 
 revolution of the monarchy and there transferring of it to the 
 Persians; and yet none of them had any intelligence given them of it 
 beforehand, by any of their gods or prophets: "<I>There is none that 
 shows</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 <I>none that declares,</I> none that gives the least intimation of it; 
 <I>there is none</I> of the nations <I>that hears your words,</I> that 
 can pretend to have heard from their gods such words as you, O 
 Israelites! have heard from your God, by your prophets," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:20">Ps. cxlvii. 20</A>.
 
 None of all the gods of the nations have shown their worshippers the
 way of salvation, which God will show by the Messiah. The good tidings 
 which the Lord will send in the gospel is a mystery hidden from ages 
 and generations, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:25,26">Rom. xvi. 25, 26</A>.

 2. None of those who pleaded for them could produce any instance of 
 their knowledge or power that had in it any colour of proof that they 
 were gods. All their advocates were struck dumb with this challenge

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 "<I>I beheld, and there was no man</I> that could give evidence for 
 them, even among those that were their most zealous admirers; <I>and 
 there was no counsellor,</I> none that could offer any thing for the 
 support of their cause. Even among the idols themselves there was none 
 fit to give counsel in the most trivial matters, and yet there were 
 those that asked counsel of them in the most important and difficult 
 affairs. When I asked them what they had to say for themselves they 
 stood mute; the case was so plain against them that there was <I>none 
 who could answer a word.</I>" Judgment must therefore be given against 
 the defendant upon <I>Nihil dicit--He is mute.</I> He has nothing to 
 say for himself. <I>He was speechless,</I>

 3. Sentence is therefore given according to the charge exhibited
 against them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):
 
 "<I>Behold, they are all vanity</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>);

 they are a lie and a cheat; they are not in themselves what they 
 pretend to be, nor will their worshippers find that in them which they 
 promise themselves. <I>Their works are nothing,</I> of no force, of no
 worth; their enemies need fear no hurt from them; their worshippers can 
 hope for no good from them. <I>Their molten images,</I> and indeed all 
 their images, <I>are wind and confusion,</I> vanity and vexation; those 
 that worship them will be deceived in them, and will reflect upon their 
 own folly with the greatest bitterness. Therefore, <I>dearly beloved, 
 flee from idolatry,</I>"
