 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE</FONT> captivity in Babylon gave a very remarkable 
 turn to the affairs of the Jewish church both in history and prophecy. 
 It is made a signal epocha in our Saviour's genealogy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:17">Matt. i. 17</A>.

 Nine of the twelve minor prophets, whose oracles we have been hitherto
 consulting, lived and preached before that captivity, and most of them
 had an eye to it in their prophecies, foretelling it as the just
 punishment of Jerusalem's wickedness. But the last three (in whom the
 Spirit of prophecy took its period, until it revived in Christ's
 forerunner) lived and preached after the return out of captivity, not
 immediately upon it, but some time after. Haggai and Zechariah appeared
 much about the same time, eighteen years after the return, when the
 building of the temple was both retarded by its enemies and neglected
 by its friends. <I>Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet and Zechariah
 the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Jerusalem, in
 the name of the God of Israel, even unto them</I> (so we read 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+5:1">Ezra v. 1</A>),

 to reprove them for their remissness, and to encourage them to revive 
 that good work when it had stood still for some time, and to go on with 
 it vigorously, notwithstanding the opposition they met with in it. 
 Haggai began two months before Zechariah, who was raised up to second 
 him, that out of the mouth of two witnesses the word might be 
 established. But Zechariah continued longer at the work; for all 
 Haggai's prophecies that are recorded were delivered within four 
 months, in the second year of Darius, between the beginning of the 
 sixth month and the end of the ninth. But we have Zechariah's 
 prophecies dated above two years after, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+7:1">Zech. vii. 1</A>.

 Some have the honour to lead, others to last, in the work of God. The
 Jews ascribe to these two prophets the honour of being members of the 
 great synagogue (as they call it), which was formed after the return 
 out of captivity; we think it more certain, and it was their honour, 
 and a much greater honour, that they prophesied of Christ. Haggai
 spoke of him as the <I>glory of the latter house,</I> and Zechariah as 
 <I>the man, the branch.</I> In them the light of that morning star 
 shone more brightly than in the foregoing prophecies, as they lived 
 nearer the time of the rising of the Sun of righteousness, and now 
 began to see his day approaching. The LXX. makes Haggai and Zechariah 
 to be the penmen of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+138:1-8">Ps. cxxxviii.</A>

 and of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+146:1-148:14">Ps. cxlvi., 
 cxlvii., and cxlviii.</A></P>
