 God, having in the foregoing chapter reckoned with the Babylonians, and 
 shown them their sins and the desolation that was coming upon them for 
 their sins, to show that he hates sin wherever he finds it and will not 
 connive at it in his own people, comes, in this chapter, to show the 
 house of Jacob their sins, but, withal, the mercy God had in store for 
 them notwithstanding; and he therefore sets their sins in order before 
 them, that by their repentance and reformation they might be prepared 
 for that mercy. 

 I. He charges them with hypocrisy in that which is good and obstinacy
 in that which is evil, especially in their idolatry, notwithstanding 
 the many convincing proofs God had given them that he is God alone, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>.

 II. He assures them that their deliverance would be wrought purely for
 the sake of God's own name and not for any merit of theirs, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:9-11">ver. 9-11</A>.
 
 III. He encourages them to depend purely upon God's power and promise
 for this deliverance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:12-15">ver. 12-15</A>.

 IV. He shows them that, as it was by their own sin that they brought 
 themselves into captivity, so it would be only by the grace of God that 
 they would obtain the necessary preparatives for their enlargement, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:16-19">ver. 16-19</A>.

 V. He proclaims their release, yet with a proviso that the wicked shall 
 have no benefit by it,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name
 of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which
 swear by the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and make mention of the God of
 Israel, <I>but</I> not in truth, nor in righteousness.
 &nbsp; 2  For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay
 themselves upon the God of Israel; The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts <I>is</I> his
 name.
 &nbsp; 3  I have declared the former things from the beginning; and
 they went forth out of my mouth, and I showed them; I did <I>them</I>
 suddenly, and they came to pass.
 &nbsp; 4  Because I knew that thou <I>art</I> obstinate, and thy neck <I>is</I>
 an iron sinew, and thy brow brass;
 &nbsp; 5  I have even from the beginning declared <I>it</I> to thee; before
 it came to pass I showed <I>it</I> thee: lest thou shouldest say, Mine
 idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image,
 hath commanded them.
 &nbsp; 6  Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare <I>it?</I>
 I have showed thee new things from this time, even hidden things,
 and thou didst not know them.
 &nbsp; 7  They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before
 the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say,
 Behold, I knew them.
 &nbsp; 8  Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that
 time <I>that</I> thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou
 wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor
 from the womb.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The hypocritical profession which many of the Jews made of religion 
 and relation to God. To those who made such a profession the prophet is 
 here ordered to address himself, for their conviction and humiliation, 
 that they might own God's justice in what he had brought upon them. Now 
 observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How high their profession of religion soared, what a fair show they 
 made in the flesh and how far they went towards heaven, what a good 
 livery they wore and what a good face they put upon a very bad heart. 
 
 (1.) They were the <I>house of Jacob;</I> they had a place and a name 
 in the visible church. <I>Jacob have I loved.</I> Jacob is God's 
 chosen; and they are not only retainers to his family, but descendants 
 from him. 

 (2.) They were <I>called by the name of Israel,</I> an honourable name; 
 they were of that people to whom pertained both the giving of the law 
 and the promises. <I>Israel</I> signifies <I>a prince with God;</I> and 
 they prided themselves in being of that princely race. 

 (3.) <I>They came forth out of the waters of Judah,</I> and thence were 
 called <I>Jews;</I> they were of the royal tribe, the tribe of which 
 Shiloh was to come, the tribe that adhered to God when the rest 
 revolted. 

 (4.) They <I>swore by the name of the Lord,</I> and thereby owned him 
 to be the true God, and their God, and gave glory to him as the 
 righteous Judge of all. They <I>swore to the name of the Lord</I> (so 
 it may be read); they took an oath of allegiance to him as their King 
 and joined themselves to him in covenant. 

 (5.) They <I>made mention of the God of Israel</I> in their prayers and 
 praises; they often spoke of him, observed his memorials, and pretended 
 to be very mindful of him.

 (6.) They <I>called themselves of the holy city,</I> and, when they 
 were captives in Babylon, purely from a principle of honour, and 
 jealousy for their native country, they valued themselves upon their 
 interest in it. Many, who are themselves unholy, are proud of their 
 relation to the church, the holy city. 

 (7.) They <I>stayed themselves upon the God of Israel,</I> and boasted 
 of his promises and his covenant with them; they <I>leaned on the 
 Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+3:11">Mic. iii. 11</A>.

 And, if they were asked concerning their God, they could say, "<I>The
 Lord of hosts is his name,</I> the Lord of all;" happy are we 
 therefore, and very great, who have relation to him!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How low their profession of religion sunk, notwithstanding all this. 
 It was all in vain; for it was all a jest; it was <I>not in truth and 
 righteousness.</I> Their hearts were not true nor right in these 
 professions. Note, All our religious professions avail nothing further 
 than they are made in truth and righteousness. If we be not sincere in 
 them, we do but <I>take the name of the Lord our God in vain.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The means God used, and the method he took, to keep them close to 
 himself, and to prevent their turning aside to idolatry. The many 
 excellent laws he gave them, with their sanctions, and the hedges about 
 them, it seems, would not serve to restrain them from that sin which 
 did most easily beset them, and therefore to those God added remarkable 
 prophecies, and remarkable providences in pursuance of those 
 prophecies, which were all designed to convince them that their God was 
 the only true God and that it was therefore both their duty and 
 interest to adhere to him. 

 1. He both dignified and favoured them with remarkable prophecies

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>I have declared the former things from the beginning.</I> Nothing 
 material happened to their nation from its original which was not 
 prophesied of before--their bondage in Egypt, their deliverance thence, 
 the situation of their tribes in Canaan, &c. All these things <I>went
 forth out of God's mouth and he showed them.</I> Herein they were 
 honoured above any nation, and even their curiosity was gratified. 
 Their prophecies were such as they could rely upon, and such as 
 concerned themselves and their own nation; and they were all verified 
 by the accomplishment of them. <I>I did them suddenly,</I> when they 
 were least expected by themselves or others, and therefore could not be 
 foreseen by any but a divine prescience. <I>I did them and they came
 to pass;</I> for what God does he does effectually. The very calamities 
 they were now groaning under in Babylon God did from the beginning 
 declare to them by Moses, as the certain consequences of their apostasy 
 from God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:31,De+28:36,29:28">Lev. xxvi. 31, &c.; 
 Deut. xxviii. 36, &c.; xxix. 28</A>.

 He also declared to them their return to God, and to their own land
 again,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:4,Le+26:44,45">Deut. xxx. 4, &c.; Lev. xxvi. 44, 45</A>.

 Thus he showed them how he would deal with them long before it came to
 pass. Let them compare their present state together with the 
 deliverance they had now in prospect with what was written in the law, 
 and they would find the scripture exactly fulfilled. 

 2. He both dignified and favoured them with remarkable providence

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>I have shown thee new things from this time.</I> Besides the general 
 view given from the beginning of God's proceedings with them, he showed 
 them new things by the prophets of their own day, and created them. 
 They were <I>hidden things,</I> which they could not otherwise know, as 
 the prophecy concerning Cyrus and the exact time of their release out 
 of Babylon. These things God <I>created now,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Their restoration was in effect their creation, and they had a promise 
 of it not from the beginning, but of late; for to prevent their 
 apostasy from God, or to recover them, prophecy was kept up among them. 
 Yet it was told them when they could not come to the knowledge of it in 
 any other way than by divine revelation. "Consider," says God, "how 
 much soever it is talked of now among you and expected, it was told you 
 by the prophets, when it was the furthest thing from your thoughts, 
 when you had not heard it, when you had not known it, nor had any 
 reason to expect it, and when your ear was not opened concerning it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>),
 
 when the thing seemed utterly impossible, and you would scarcely have 
 given any one the hearing who should have told you of it." God had 
 shown them hidden things which were out of the reach of their 
 knowledge, and done for them great things, out of the reach of their 
 power: "Now," says he 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 "<I>thou hast heard; see all this.</I> Thou hast heard the prophecy; 
 see the accomplishment of it, and observe whether the word and works of 
 God do not exactly agree; <I>and will you not declare it,</I> that as 
 you have heard so you have seen? Will you not own that the Lord is the 
 true God, the only true God, that he has the knowledge and power which 
 no creature has and which none of the gods of the nations can pretend 
 to? Will you not own that your God has been a good God to you? Declare 
 this to his honour, and your own shame, who have dealt so deceitfully 
 with him and preferred others before him."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The reasons why God would take this method with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Because he would anticipate their boastings of themselves and their 
 idols. 

 (1.) God by his prophets told them beforehand of their deliverance, 
 lest they should attribute the accomplishment of it to their idols. 
 Thus he saw it necessary to secure the glory of it to himself, which 
 otherwise would have been given by some of them to their graven images: 
 "I spoke of it," says God, "<I>lest thou shouldst say, My idol has done 
 it or has commanded it to be done,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 There were those that would be apt to say so, and so would be confirmed 
 in their idolatry by that which was intended to cure them of it. But 
 they would now be for ever precluded from saying this; for, if the 
 idols had done it, the prophets of the idols would have foretold it; 
 but, the prophets of the Lord having foretold it, it was no doubt the 
 power of the Lord that effected it. 

 (2.) God foretold it by his prophets, lest they should assume the 
 foresight of it to themselves. Those that were not so profane as to
 have ascribed the thing itself to an idol were yet so proud as to have 
 pretended that by their own sagacity they foresaw it, if God had not 
 been beforehand with them and spoken first: <I>Lest thou shouldst say, 
 Behold, I knew them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 Thus vain men, who would be thought wise, commonly undervalue a thing 
 which is really great and surprising with this suggestion, that it was 
 no more than they expected and they knew it would come to this. To 
 anticipate this, and that this boasting might for ever be excluded, God 
 told them of it before the day, when as yet they dreamed not of it. God 
 has said and done enough to prevent men's boastings of themselves, and 
 that <I>no flesh may glory in his presence,</I> and, if it have not the 
 intended effect, it will aggravate the sin and ruin of the proud; and, 
 sooner, or later, <I>every mouth shall be stopped, and all flesh shall 
 become silent before God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Because he would leave them inexcusable in their obstinacy. 
 <I>Therefore</I> he took this pains with them, because he knew they 
 were obstinate, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 He knew they were so obstinate and perverse that, if he had not 
 supported the doctrine of providence by prophecy, they would have had 
 the impudence to deny it, and would have said that their idol had done 
 that which God did. He knew very well, 

 (1.) How wilful they would be, and how fully bent they would be upon 
 that which is evil: <I>I knew that thou wast hard;</I> so the word is. 
 There were prophecies as well as precepts which God gave them because 
 of the hardness of their hearts: "<I>Thy neck is an iron sinew,</I> 
 unapt to yield and submit to the yoke of God' commandments, unapt to 
 turn and look back upon his dealings with thee or look up to his 
 displeasure against thee; not flexible to the will of God, nor pliable 
 to his intentions, nor manageable by his word or providence. <I>Thy 
 brow is brass;</I> thou art impudent and canst not blush, insolent and 
 wilt not fear or give back, but wilt thrust on in the way of thy 
 heart." God uses means to bring sinners to comply with him, though he 
 knows they are obstinate.

 (2.) How deceitful they would be and how insincere in that which is
 good,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 God sent his prophets to them, but they did not hear, they would not 
 know, and it was no more than was expected, considering what they had 
 been. Thou <I>wast called,</I> and not miscalled, <I>a transgressor 
 from the womb.</I> Ever since they were first formed into a people they 
 were prone to idolatry; they brought with them out of Egypt a strange 
 addictedness to that sin; and they were murmurers as soon as ever they 
 began their march to Canaan. They were justly upbraided with it then, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:7,24">Deut. ix. 7, 24</A>.

 Therefore <I>I knew that thou wouldst deal very treacherously.</I> God
 foresaw their apostasy, and gave this reason for it, that he had always 
 found them false and fickle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:16,27,29">Deut. xxxi. 16, 27, 29</A>.

 This is applicable to particular persons. We are all born children of
 disobedience; we were called <I>transgressors from the womb,</I> and 
 therefore it is easy to foresee that we shall deal treacherously, very 
 treacherously. Where original sin is actual sin will follow of course.
 God knows it, and yet deals not with us according to our deserts.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The deliverance of God's people out of their captivity in Babylon was a 
 thing upon many accounts so improbable that there was need of line upon 
 line for the encouragement of the faith and hope of God's people 
 concerning it. Two things were discouraging to them--their own
 unworthiness that God should do it for them and the many difficulties 
 in the thing itself; now, in these verses, both these discouragements
 are removed, for here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A reason why God would do it for them, though they were unworthy; 
 not for their sake, be it known to them, but <I>for his name's sake, 
 for his own sake,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:9-11"><I>v.</I> 9-11</A>.

 1. It is true they had been very provoking, and God had been justly 
 angry with them. Their captivity was the punishment of their iniquity; 
 and if, when he had them in Babylon, he had left them to pine away and 
 perish there, and made the desolations of their country perpetual, he 
 would only have dealt with them according to their sins, and it was 
 what such a sinful people might expect from an angry God. "But," says 
 God, "<I>I will defer my anger</I>" (or, rather, <I>stifle and suppress 
 it</I>); "I will make it appear that I am slow to wrath, and will 
 refrain from thee, not pour upon thee what I justly might, that I 
 should cut thee off from being a people." And why will God thus stay 
 his hand? <I>For my name's sake;</I> because this people was called by 
 his name, and made profession of his name, and, if they were cut off, 
 the enemies would blaspheme his name. <I>It is for my praise;</I> 
 because it would redound to the honour of his mercy to spare and 
 reprieve them, and, if he continued them to be to him a people, they 
 might be to him for a name and a praise. 

 1. It is true they were very corrupt and ill-disposed, but God would
 himself refine them, and make them fit for the mercy he intended for 
 them: "<I>I have refined thee,</I> that thou mightest be made a vessel 
 of honour." Though he does not find them meet for his favour, he will 
 make them so. And this accounts for his bringing them into the trouble, 
 and continuing them in it so long as he did. It was not to cut them 
 off, but to do them good. It was to refine them, <I>but not as
 silver,</I> or <I>with silver,</I> not so thoroughly as men refine 
 their silver, which they continue in the furnace till all the dross is 
 separated from it; if God should take that course with them, they would 
 be always in the furnace, for they are all dross, and, as such, might 
 justly be put away 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:119">Ps. cxix. 119</A>)
 
 as reprobate silver, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:30">Jer. vi. 30</A>.

 He therefore takes them as they are, refined in part only, and not
 thoroughly. "<I>I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction,</I> 
 that is, I have made thee a choice one by the good which the affliction 
 has done thee, and then designed thee for great things." Many have been 
 brought home to God as chosen vessels and a good work of grace has been 
 begun in them in the furnace of affliction. Affliction is no bar to 
 God's choice, but subservient to his purpose.

 3. It is true they could not pretend to merit at God's hand so great a
 favour as their deliverance out of Babylon, which would put such an 
 honour upon them and bring them so much joy; therefore, says God, 
 <I>For my own sake, even for my own sake, will I do it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 See how the emphasis is laid upon that; for it is a reason that cannot 
 fail, and therefore the resolution grounded upon it cannot fall to the 
 ground. God will do it, not because he owes them such a favour, but to 
 save the honour of his own name, that that may not be polluted by the 
 insolent triumphs of the heathen, who, in triumphing over Israel, 
 thought they triumphed over the God of Israel and imagined their gods 
 too hard for him. This was plainly the language of Belshazzar's revels, 
 when he profaned the holy vessels of God's temple at the same time that 
 he praised his idols 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:2,4">Dan. v. 2, 4</A>),
 
 and of the Babylonians' demand

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:3">Ps. cxxxvii. 3</A>),

 <I>Sing us one of the songs of Zion.</I> God will <I>therefore</I>
 deliver his people, because he will not suffer his glory to be thus 
 given to another. Moses pleaded this often with God: Lord, <I>what will 
 the Egyptians say?</I> Note, God is jealous for the honour of his own 
 name, and will not suffer the wrath of man to proceed any further than 
 he will make it turn to his praise. And it is matter of comfort to
 God's people that, whatever becomes of them, God will secure his own 
 honour; and, as far as is necessary to that, God will work deliverance 
 for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is a proof that God could do it for them, though they were 
 unable to help themselves and the thing seemed altogether 
 impracticable. Let Jacob and Israel hearken to this, and believe it, 
 and take the comfort of it. They are God's called, <I>called according 
 to his purpose,</I> called by him out of Egypt 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:1">Hos. xi. 1</A>)

 and now out of Babylon, a people whom with a distinguishing favour he
 calls by name, and to whom he calls. They are his called, for they are 
 called to him, called by his name, and called his; and therefore he 
 will look after them, and they may be assured that, as he will deliver 
 them for his own sake, so he will deliver them by his own strength. 
 They need not fear them, for,

 1. He is God alone, and the eternal God
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):
 
 "<I>I am he</I> who can do what I will and will do what is best, he 
 whom none can compare with, much less contend with. <I>I am the first; 
 I also am the last.</I>" Who can be too quick for him that is the 
 first, or anticipate him? Who can be too hard for him that is the last, 
 and will keep the field against all opposers, and will reign till they 
 are all made his footstool? What room then is left to doubt of their 
 deliverance when <I>he</I> undertakes it whose designs cannot but be 
 well laid, for he is the first, and well executed, for he is the last. 
 As for this God, his work is perfect. 

 2. He is the God that made the world, and he that did that can do any 
 thing,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Look we down? We see the earth firm under us, and feel it so; it was 
 his hand that <I>laid the foundation</I> of it. Look we up? We see the 
 heavens spread out as a canopy over our heads, and it was his hand that 
 spread them, that <I>spanned</I> them, that stretched them out, and did 
 it by an exact measure, as the workman sometimes metes out his work by 
 spans. This intimates that God has a vast reach and can compass
 designs of the greatest extent. <I>If the palm of his right hand</I> 
 (so the margin reads it) has gone so far as to stretch out the heavens, 
 what will he do with his outstretched arm? Yet this is not all: he has
 not only made the heavens and the earth, and therefore he in whom our 
 hope and help is omnipotent 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+124:8">Ps. cxxiv. 8</A>),

 but he has the command of all the hosts of both; when he calls them
 into his service, to go on his errands, they stand up together, they 
 come at the call, they answer to their names: "Here we are; what wilt 
 thou have us to do?" They stand up, not only in reverence to their 
 Creator, but in a readiness to execute his orders: <I>They stand up 
 together,</I> unanimously concurring, and helping one another in the 
 service of their Maker. If God therefore will deliver his people, he 
 cannot be at a loss for instruments to be employed in effecting their 
 deliverance.

 3. He has already foretold it, and, having infinite knowledge, so that
 he foresaw it, no doubt he has almighty power to effect it: "<I>All 
 you</I> of the house of Jacob, <I>assemble yourselves, and hear</I> 
 this for your comfort, <I>Which among them,</I> among the gods of the 
 heathen, or their wise men, <I>has declared these things,</I> or could 
 declare them?"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 They had no foresight of them at all, but those who consulted them were 
 very confident that Babylon should be a lady for ever and Israel 
 perpetual slave; and their oracles did not give them the least hint to 
 the contrary, to undeceive them; whereas God by his prophets had given 
 notice to the Jews, long before, of their captivity and the destruction 
 of Jerusalem, as he had now likewise given them notice of their release

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>I, even I, have spoken;</I> and he would not have spoken it if he 
 could not have made it good: none could out-see him, and therefore we 
 may be sure that none could outdo him. 

 4. The person is pitched upon who is to be employed in this service, 
 and the measures are concerted in the divine counsels, which are 
 unalterable. Cyrus is the man who must do it; and it tends much to 
 strengthen our assurance that a thing shall be done when we are 
 particularly informed how and by whom. It is not left at uncertainty 
 who shall do it, but the matter is fixed.

 (1.) It is one whom God is well pleased in, upon this account, because 
 he is designed for this service: <I>The Lord has loved him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);

 he has done him this favour, this honour, to make him an instrument in 
 the redemption of his people and therein a type of the great Redeemer, 
 God's beloved Son, <I>in whom he was well pleased.</I> Those God does a 
 great kindness to, and has a great kindness for, whom he makes 
 serviceable to his church. 

 (2.) It is one to whom God will give authority and commission: <I>I 
 have called him,</I> have given him a sufficient warrant, and therefore 
 will bear him out. 

 (3.) It is one whom God will by a series of providences lead to this 
 service: "<I>I have brought him from a far</I> country, brought him to 
 engage against Babylon, brought him step by step, quite beyond his own 
 intentions." Whom God calls he will bring, will <I>cause them to 
 come</I> (so the word is), to come at the call.

 (4.) It is one whom God will own and give success to. Cyrus will <I>do 
 God's pleasure on Babylon,</I> that which it is his pleasure should be 
 done and which he will be pleased with the doing of, though Cyrus has 
 ends of his own to serve and has no regard either to the will of God or 
 to his favour in the doing of it. <I>His arm</I> (Cyrus's army, and in
 it God's arm) <I>shall</I> come, and <I>be upon the Chaldeans,</I> to 
 bring them down

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);

 for, if God call him and bring him, he will certainly <I>make his way 
 prosperous,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 <I>Then</I> we may hope to prosper in our way when we follow a divine 
 call and guidance.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in
 secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there <I>am</I>
 I: and now the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, and his Spirit, hath sent me.
 &nbsp; 17  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I
 <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which
 leadeth thee by the way <I>that</I> thou shouldest go.
 &nbsp; 18  O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy
 peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the
 sea:
 &nbsp; 19  Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy
 bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut
 off nor destroyed from before me.
 &nbsp; 20  Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a
 voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it <I>even</I> to the
 end of the earth; say ye, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath redeemed his servant
 Jacob.
 &nbsp; 21  And they thirsted not <I>when</I> he led them through the
 deserts: he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them:
 he clave the rock also, and the waters gushed out.
 &nbsp; 22  <I>There is</I> no peace, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, unto the wicked.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, as before, Jacob and Israel are summoned to hearken to the 
 prophet speaking in God's name, or rather to God speaking in and by the 
 prophet, and that as a type of the great prophet by whom God has in 
 these last days spoken unto us, and that is sufficient: <I>Come 
 near</I> therefore, <I>and hear this.</I> Note, Those that would hear 
 and understand what God says must come near, and approach to him; let 
 them come as near as they can. Let those that have hearkened to the 
 tempter now come near, and hear this, that they may be confirmed in 
 their resolutions to serve God. Those that draw nigh to God may depend 
 upon this, that his secret shall be with them. Here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God refers them to what he hath both said to them and done for them 
 formerly, which if they would reflect upon, they might thence fetch 
 great encouragement to trust in God at this time. 

 1. He had always spoken plainly to them <I>from the beginning,</I> by
 Moses and all the prophets: <I>I have not spoken in secret,</I> but 
 publicly, from the top of Mount Sinai, and in the chief places of 
 concourse, the solemn assemblies of their tribes; he did not deliver 
 his oracles obscurely and ambiguously, but so that they might be 
 understood, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:2">Hab. ii. 2</A>.

 2. He had always acted wonderfully for them: "<I>From the time</I> that 
 they were first formed into a people <I>there I am,</I> there have I 
 been resident among them and presiding in their affairs (he sent them 
 prophets, raised them up judges, and frequently appeared for them), and 
 therefore there I will be still." He that has been with his people 
 hitherto will be to the end.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The prophet himself, as a type of the great prophet, asserts his 
 own commission to deliver this message: <I>Now the Lord God</I> (the 
 same that spoke from the beginning and did not speak in secret) <I>has 
 by his Spirit sent me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 The Spirit of God is here spoken of as a person distinct from the 
 Father and the Son, and having a divine authority to send prophets. 
 Note, Whom God sends the Spirit sends. Those whom God commissions for
 any service the Spirit in some measure qualifies for it; and those may 
 speak boldly, and must be heard obediently, whom God and his Spirit 
 send. As that which the prophet says to the same purport with this

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:1"><I>ch.</I> lxi. 1</A>)

 is applied to Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:21">Luke iv. 21</A>),

 so may this be; the Lord God sent him, and he had the Spirit without
 measure.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. God by the prophet sends them a gracious message for their support 
 and comfort under their affliction. The preface to this message is both 
 awful and encouraging 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>Thus saith Jehovah,</I> the eternal God, <I>thy Redeemer,</I> that 
 has often been so, that has engaged to be so, and will be faithful to 
 the engagement, for he is <I>the Holy One,</I> that cannot deceive, 
 <I>the Holy One of Israel,</I> that will not deceive them. The same 
 words that introduce the law, and give authority to that, introduce the 
 promise, and give validity to that: "<I>I am the Lord thy God,</I> whom 
 thou mayest depend upon as in relation to thee and in covenant with 
 thee."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here is the good work which God undertakes to fulfil in them. He 
 that is their Redeemer, in order to that, will be, 

 (1.) Their instructor: "<I>I am thy God that teaches thee to
 profit,</I> that is, teaches thee such things as are profitable for 
 thee, things that belong to thy peace." By <I>this</I> God shows 
 himself to be a God in covenant with us, by his <I>teaching us</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:10,11">Heb. viii. 10, 11</A>);

 and none teaches like him, for he gives an understanding. Whom God
 redeems he teaches; whom he designs to deliver out of their afflictions 
 he first teaches to profit by their afflictions, makes them partakers 
 of his holiness, for that is the <I>profit for which he chastens 
 us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:10">Heb. xii. 10</A>.

 (2.) Their guide: <I>He leads them</I> to the way and <I>in the way by 
 which they should go.</I> He not only enlightens their eyes, but 
 directs their steps. By his grace he leads them in the way of duty, by 
 his providence he leads them in the way of deliverance. Happy are those 
 that are under such a guidance!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here is the good-will which God declares he had for them by his good 
 wishes concerning them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 He had indeed brought them into captivity, but it was owing to 
 themselves, nor did he afflict them willingly. 

 (1.) As when he gave them his law he earnestly wished they might be 
 obedient (<I>O that there were such a heart in them!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+5:29">Deut. v. 29</A>.
 
 <I>O that they were wise!</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:29">Deut. xxxii. 29</A>),

 so, when he had punished them for the breach of his law, he wished they
 had been obedient: <I>O that thou hadst hearkened to my 
 commandments!</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 <I>O that my people had hearkened unto me!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:13">Ps. lxxxi. 13</A>.

 This confirms what God had said and sworn, that he has <I>no pleasure
 in the death of sinners.</I>

 (2.) He assures them that, if they had been obedient, that would not 
 only have prevented their captivity, but would have advanced and 
 perpetuated their prosperity. He had abundance of good things ready to 
 bestow upon them if their sins had not <I>turned them away,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:1,2"><I>ch.</I> lix. 1, 2</A>.

 [1.] They should have been carried on in a constant uninterrupted
 stream of prosperity: "<I>Thy peace should have been as a river;</I> 
 thou shouldst have enjoyed a series of mercies, one continually 
 following another, as the waters of a river, which always last." 
 <I>Labitur, et labetur in omne volubilis &aelig;vum--It flows, and will 
 for ever flow;</I> not like the waters of a land-flood, which are soon 
 gone. 

 [2.] Their virtue and honour, and the justice of their cause, should in 
 all cases have borne down opposition by their own strength, <I>as the 
 waves of the sea.</I> Such should their righteousness have been that 
 nothing should have stood before it; whereas, now they had been 
 disobedient, the current of their prosperity was interrupted, and their 
 righteousness overpowered. 

 [3.] The rising generation should have been very numerous and very 
 prosperous; whereas they were now very few, as appears by the small 
 number of the returning captives 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:64">Ezra ii. 64</A>),

 not so many as of one tribe when they came out of Egypt. They should
 have been <I>numberless as the sand,</I> according to the promise

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:17">Gen. xxii. 17</A>),

 which they had forfeited the benefit of: "<I>The offspring of thy
 bowels</I> would have been innumerable, <I>like the gravel of the 
 sea,</I> if thy righteousness had been irresistible and unconquerable 
 as the waves of the sea."

 [4.] The honour of Israel should still have been unstained, untouched: 
 <I>His name should not have been cut off,</I> as now it is in the land 
 of Israel, which is either desolate or inhabited by strangers; nor 
 should it have <I>been destroyed from before God.</I> We cannot reckon 
 the name either of a family or of a kingdom destroyed till it is 
 destroyed from before God, till it ceases to be a name in his holy 
 place. Now God tells them thus what he would have done for them if they 
 had persevered in their obedience, <I>First,</I> That they might be the 
 more humbled for their sins, by which they had forfeited such rich 
 mercies. Note, <I>This</I> should engage us (I might say, enrage us) 
 against sin, that it has not only deprived us of the good things we 
 have enjoyed, but prevented the good things God had in store for us. It 
 will make the misery of the disobedient the more intolerable to think 
 how happy they might have been. <I>Secondly,</I> That his mercy might 
 appear the more illustrious in working deliverance for them, though 
 they had forfeited it and rendered themselves unworthy of it. Nothing 
 but a prerogative of mercy would have saved them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Here is assurance given of the great work which God designed to work 
 for them, even their salvation out of their captivity, when he had 
 accomplished his work in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Here is a commission granted them to leave Babylon. God 
 proclaimed, long before Cyrus did, that whoever would might return to 
 his own land 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 "You have a full discharge sent you: <I>Go you forth out of 
 Babylon;</I> the prison-doors are thrown open, and the trumpet sounds, 
 proclaiming a release." Perhaps with this word, as a means, the Spirit 
 of the Lord stirred up the spirits of those that did take the benefit 
 of Cyrus's proclamation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:5">Ezra i. 5</A>):

 <I>Flee you from the Chaldeans,</I> not with an ignominious stolen
 flight, as Jacob fled from Laban, but with a holy disdain, as scorning 
 to stay any longer among them; flee you, not silently and sorrowfully, 
 but with a voice, with a voice of singing, as they fled of old out of 
 Egypt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:1">Exod. xv. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Here is the news of this sent to all parts: "Let it be declared; 
 let it be told; let it be uttered; make it to be heard by the most 
 remote, by the most remiss; send the tidings of it by word of mouth; 
 send it by writing, from city to city, from kingdom to kingdom, even to 
 the utmost regions, <I>to the ends of the earth.</I>" This was a figure 
 of the publishing of the gospel to all the world; but that brings glad 
 tidings which all the world is concerned in, this only that which it is 
 fit all should take notice of, that they may be invited by it to 
 forsake their idols and come into the service of the God of Israel. Let 
 them all know then, 

 [1.] That those whom God owns for his are such as he has dearly bought 
 and paid for: <I>The Lord has redeemed his servant Jacob;</I> he has 
 done it formerly, when he brought them out of Egypt, and now he is 
 about to do it again. Jacob was God's servant, and therefore he 
 redeemed him; for what had other masters to do with God's servants? 
 Israel is God's son, therefore Pharaoh must let him go. God redeemed 
 Jacob, and therefore it was fit that he should be his servant 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:16">Ps. cxvi. 16</A>);

 the bonds God had loosed tied them the faster to him. He that redeemed
 us has an unquestionable right to us.

 [2.] That those whom God designs to bring home to himself he will take 
 care of, that they want not for the necessary expenses of their 
 journey. When he brought them out of Egypt, and <I>led them through the 
 deserts,</I> they <I>thirsted not</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 for in all their removals the water out of the rock followed them; 
 thence <I>he caused the waters to flow,</I> and, since rock-water is 
 the clearest and finest, God <I>clave the rock, and the waters gushed 
 out;</I> for he can fetch in necessary supplies for his people in a way 
 that they think the least likely. This refers to what he did for them 
 when he brought them out of Egypt; when all this was literally true. 
 But it should now be in effect done again, in their return out of 
 Babylon, so well provided for should they and theirs be in their 
 return. God does his work as effectually by marvellous providences as 
 by miracles, though perhaps they are not so much taken notice of. This 
 is applicable to those treasures of grace laid up for us in Jesus 
 Christ, from which all good flows to us as the water did to Israel out 
 of the rock, for that rock is Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Here is a caveat put in against the wicked who go on still in 
 their trespasses. Let not them think to have any benefit among God's 
 people. Though in show and profession they herd themselves among them, 
 let them not expect to come in sharers; no 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 though God's thoughts concerning the body of that people were thoughts 
 of peace, yet to those among them that were <I>wicked</I> and hated to 
 be reformed <I>there is no peace,</I> no peace with God or their own 
 consciences, no real good, whatever is pretended to. What have those to 
 do with peace who are enemies to God? Their false prophets cried Peace 
 to those to whom it did not belong; but God tells them that there shall 
 be no peace, nor any think like it, to the wicked. The quarrel sinners 
 have commenced with God, if not taken up in time by repentance, will be 
 an everlasting quarrel.</P>
