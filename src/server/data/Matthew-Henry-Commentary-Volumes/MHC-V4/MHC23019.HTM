 As Assyria was a breaking rod to Judah, with which it was smitten, so 
 Egypt was a broken reed, with which it was cheated; and therefore God 
 had a quarrel with them both. We have before read the doom of the 
 Assyrians; now here we have the burden of Egypt, a prophecy concerning 
 that nation, 

 I. That it should be greatly weakened and brought low, and should be as
 contemptible among the nations as now it was considerable, rendered so 
 by a complication of judgments which God would bring upon them, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:1-17">ver. 1-17</A>.

 II. That at length God's holy religion should be brought into Egypt,
 and set up there, in part by the Jews that should flee thither for
 refuge, but more fully by the preachers of the gospel of Christ,
 through whose ministry churches should be planted in Egypt in the says
 of the Messiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:18-25">ver. 18-25</A>),

 which would abundantly balance all the calamities here threatened.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The burden of Egypt. Behold, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> rideth upon a swift
 cloud, and shall come into Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall be
 moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the
 midst of it.
 &nbsp; 2  And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they
 shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against
 his neighbour; city against city, <I>and</I> kingdom against kingdom.
 &nbsp; 3  And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof; and
 I will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the
 idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar
 spirits, and to the wizards.
 &nbsp; 4  And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel
 lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts.
 &nbsp; 5  And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall
 be wasted and dried up.
 &nbsp; 6  And they shall turn the rivers far away; <I>and</I> the brooks of
 defence shall be emptied and dried up: the reeds and flags shall
 wither.
 &nbsp; 7  The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks,
 and every thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away,
 and be no <I>more.</I>
 &nbsp; 8  The fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast angle
 into the brooks shall lament, and they that spread nets upon the
 waters shall languish.
 &nbsp; 9  Moreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave
 networks, shall be confounded.
 &nbsp; 10  And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof, all that
 make sluices <I>and</I> ponds for fish.
 &nbsp; 11  Surely the princes of Zoan <I>are</I> fools, the counsel of the
 wise counsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto
 Pharaoh, I <I>am</I> the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?
 &nbsp; 12  Where <I>are</I> they? where <I>are</I> thy wise <I>men?</I> and let them
 tell thee now, and let them know what the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts hath
 purposed upon Egypt.
 &nbsp; 13  The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph
 are deceived; they have also seduced Egypt, <I>even they that are</I>
 the stay of the tribes thereof.
 &nbsp; 14  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst
 thereof: and they have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof,
 as a drunken <I>man</I> staggereth in his vomit.
 &nbsp; 15  Neither shall there be <I>any</I> work for Egypt, which the head
 or tail, branch or rush, may do.
 &nbsp; 16  In that day shall Egypt be like unto women: and it shall be
 afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of
 hosts, which he shaketh over it.
 &nbsp; 17  And the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt, every
 one that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself,
 because of the counsel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, which he hath
 determined against it.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Though the land of Egypt had of old been a house of bondage to the 
 people of God, where they had been ruled with rigour, yet among the 
 unbelieving Jews there still remained much of the humour of their 
 fathers, who said, <I>Let us make us a captain and return into 
 Egypt.</I> Upon all occasions they trusted to Egypt for help 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:2"><I>ch.</I> xxx. 2</A>),

 and thither they fled, in disobedience to God's express command, when
 things were brought to the last extremity in their own country, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+43:7">Jer. xliii. 7</A>.

 Rabshakeh upbraided Hezekiah with this,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+36:6"><I>ch.</I> xxxvi. 6</A>.

 While they kept up an alliance with Egypt, and it was a powerful ally,
 they stood not in awe of the judgments of God; for against them they 
 depended upon Egypt to protect them. Nor did they depend upon the power 
 of God when at anytime they were in distress; but Egypt was their 
 confidence. To prevent all this mischief, Egypt must be mortified, and 
 many ways God here tells them he will take to mortify them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The gods of Egypt shall appear to them to be what they always really
 were, utterly unable to help them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 "<I>The Lord rides upon a cloud, a swift cloud, and shall come into
 Egypt.</I> As a judge goes in state to the bench to try and condemn the 
 malefactors, or as a general takes the field with his troops to crush 
 the rebels, so shall God come into Egypt with his judgments; and when 
 he comes he will certainly overcome." In all this burden of Egypt here 
 is no mention of any foreign enemy invading them; but God himself will 
 come against them, and raise up the causes of their destruction from 
 among themselves. He comes upon a cloud, above the reach of the 
 opposition or resistance. He comes apace upon a swift cloud; for their 
 judgment lingers not when the time has come. He <I>rides upon the wings 
 of the wind,</I> with a majesty far excelling the greatest pomp and 
 splendour of earthly princes. He <I>makes the clouds his chariots,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:9,104:3">Ps. xviii. 9; civ. 3</A>.

 When he comes <I>the idols of Egypt shall be moved,</I> shall be
 removed at his presence, and perhaps be made to fall as Dagon did 
 before the ark. Isis, Osiris, and Apis, those celebrated idols of
 Egypt, being found unable to relieve their worshippers, shall be 
 disowned and rejected by them. Idolatry had got deeper rooting in Egypt 
 than in any land besides, even the most absurd idolatries; and yet now 
 the idols shall be moved and they shall be ashamed of them. When the 
 Lord brought Israel out of Egypt he <I>executed judgments upon the gods 
 of the Egyptians</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+33:4">Num. xxxiii. 4</A>);

 no marvel then if, when he comes, they begin to tremble. The Egyptians
 <I>shall seek to the idols,</I> when they are at their wits' end, and 
 consult <I>the charmers and wizards</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 but all in vain; they see their ruin hastening on them
 notwithstanding.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The militia of Egypt, that had been famed for their valour, shall 
 be quite dispirited and disheartened. No kingdom in the world was ever 
 in a better method of keeping up a standing army than the Egyptians 
 were; but now their heroes, that used to be celebrated for courage, 
 shall be posted for cowards: <I>The heart of Egypt shall melt in the 
 midst of it,</I> like wax before the fire 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>);

 <I>the spirit of Egypt shall fail,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 They shall have no inclination, no resolution, to stand up in defence
 of their country, their liberty, and property; but shall tamely and 
 ingloriously yield all to the invader and oppressor. The Egyptians 
 <I>shall be like women</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);

 they shall be frightened and put into confusion by the least alarm;
 even those that dwell in the heart of the country, in the midst of it, 
 and therefore furthest from danger, will be as full of frights as those 
 that are situate on the frontiers. Let not the bold and brave be proud 
 or secure, for God can easily <I>cut off the spirit of princes</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:12">Ps. lxxvi. 12</A>)
 
 and <I>take away their hearts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:24">Job xii. 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The Egyptians shall be embroiled in endless dissensions and 
 quarrels among themselves. There shall be no occasion to bring a 
 foreign force upon them to destroy them; they shall destroy one another 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians.</I> As these
 divisions and animosities are their sin, God is not the author of them, 
 they come from men's lusts; but God, as a Judge, permits them for their 
 punishment, and by their destroying differences corrects them for their 
 sinful agreements. Instead of helping one another, and acting each in 
 his place for the common good, <I>they shall fight every one against 
 his brother and neighbour,</I> whom he ought to love as 
 himself--<I>city against city, and kingdom against kingdom.</I> Egypt 
 was then divided into twelve provinces, or dynasties; but Psammetichus, 
 the governor of one of them, by setting them at variance with one 
 another, at length made himself master of them all. A kingdom thus 
 divided against itself would soon be brought to desolation. <I>En quo 
 discordi&acirc; cives perduxit miseros!--Oh the wretchedness brought 
 upon a people by their disagreements among themselves!</I> It is 
 brought to this by <I>a perverse spirit,</I> a spirit of contradiction, 
 which the Lord would mingle, as an intoxicating draught made up of 
 several ingredients, for the Egyptians, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 One party shall be for a thing for no other reason than because the
 other is against it; that is a perverse spirit, which, if it mingle 
 with the public counsels, tends directly to the ruin of the public 
 interests.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Their politics shall be all blasted, and turned into foolishness. 
 When God will destroy the nation he will <I>destroy the counsel 
 thereof</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),
 
 by taking away wisdom from the statesmen

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:20">Job xii. 20</A>),

 or setting them one against another (as Hushai and Ahithophel), or by
 his providence breaking their measures even when they seemed well laid; 
 so that the <I>princes of Zoan are fools:</I> they make fools of one 
 another, every one betrays his own folly, and divine Providence makes 
 fools of them all, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Pharaoh had his wise counsellors. Egypt was famous for such. But their
 <I>counsel has all become brutish;</I> they have lost all their 
 forecast; one would think they had become idiots, and were bereaved of 
 common sense. Let no man glory then in his own wisdom, nor depend upon 
 that, nor upon the wisdom of those about him; for he that gives 
 understanding can when he please take it away. And from those it is
 most likely to be taken away that boast of their policy, as Pharaoh's 
 counsellors here did, and, to recommend themselves to places of public 
 trust, boast of their great understanding ("<I>I am the son of the 
 wise,</I> of the God of wisdom, of wisdom itself," says one; "my father 
 was an eminent privy-counsellor of note in his day for wisdom"), or of 
 the antiquity and dignity of their families: "I am," says another, 
 "<I>the son of ancient kings.</I>" The nobles of Egypt boasted much of 
 their antiquity, producing fabulous records of their succession for 
 above 10,000 years. This humour prevailed much among them about this
 time, as appears by Herodotus, their common boast being that Egypt was 
 some thousands of years more ancient than any other nation. "But 
 <I>where are thy wise men?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Let them now show their wisdom by foreseeing what ruin is coming upon
 their nation, and preventing it, if they can. Let them with all their 
 skill <I>know what the Lord of hosts has purposed upon Egypt,</I> and 
 arm themselves accordingly. Nay, so far are they from doing this that 
 they themselves are, in effect, contriving the ruin of Egypt, and 
 hastening it on, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:13"><I>v.</I>  13</A>.

 <I>The princes of Noph</I> are not only deceived themselves, but they
 <I>have seduced Egypt,</I> by putting their kings upon arbitrary 
 proceedings" (by which both themselves and their people were soon 
 undone); "the governors of Egypt, that are the stay and cornerstones of 
 the tribes thereof, are themselves undermining it." It is sad with a 
 people when those that undertake for their safety are helping forward 
 their destruction, and the physicians of the state are her worst 
 disease, when the things that belong to the public peace are so far 
 hidden from the eyes of those that are entrusted with the public 
 counsels that in every thing they blunder and take wrong measures; so 
 here

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>They have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof.</I> Every step
 they took was a false step. They always mistook either the end or the 
 means, and their counsels were all unsteady and uncertain, like the 
 staggerings and stammerings of a drunken man in his vomit, who knows 
 not what he says nor where he goes. See what reason we have to pray for 
 our privy-counsellors and ministers of state, who are the great 
 supports and blessings of the state if God give them a spirit of 
 wisdom, but quite the contrary if he hide their heart from 
 understanding.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The rod of government shall be turned into the serpent of tyranny 
 and oppression 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>The Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord,</I>
 not a foreigner, but one of their own, one that shall rule over them by 
 an hereditary right, but shall be a fierce king and rule them with 
 rigour," either the twelve tyrants that succeeded Sethon, or rather 
 Psammetichus that recovered the monarchy again; for he speaks of one 
 cruel lord. Now the barbarous usage which the Egyptian task masters 
 gave to God's Israel long ago was remembered against them and they were 
 paid in their own coin by another Pharaoh. It is sad with a people when 
 the powers that should be for edification are for destruction, and they 
 are ruined by those by whom they should be ruled, when such as this is 
 the manner of the king, as it is described (<I>in terrorem--in order to 
 impress alarm</I>), 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:11">1 Sam. viii. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Egypt was famous for its river Nile, which was its wealth, and 
 strength, and beauty, and was idolized by them. Now it is here 
 threatened that <I>the waters shall fail from the sea</I> and the river 
 shall be <I>wasted and dried up,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Nature shall not herein favour them as she has done. Egypt was never
 watered with the rain of heaven

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:18">Zech. xiv. 18</A>),

 and therefore the fruitfulness of their country depended wholly upon
 the overflowing of their river; if that therefore be dried up, their 
 fruitful land will soon be turned into barrenness and their harvests 
 cease: <I>Every thing sown by the brooks will wither</I> of course, 
 will <I>be driven away, and be no more,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 If the paper-reeds by the brooks, at the very mouth of them, wither,
 much more the corn, which lies at a greater distance, but derives its 
 moisture from them. Yet this is not all; the drying up of their rivers
 is the destruction,

 1. Of their fortifications, for they are <I>brooks of defence</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 making the country difficult of access to an enemy. Deep rivers are the
 strongest lines, and most hardly forced. Pharaoh is said to be a
 <I>great dragon lying in the midst of his rivers,</I> and guarded by 
 them, bidding defiance to all about him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:3">Ezek. xxix. 3</A>.

 But these <I>shall be emptied and dried up,</I> not by an enemy, as
 Sennacherib with the <I>sole of his foot dried up mighty rivers</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:25"><I>ch.</I> xxxvii. 25</A>),

 and as Cyrus, who took Babylon by drawing Euphrates into many streams,
 but by the providence of God, which sometimes <I>turns water-springs 
 into dry ground,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:33">Ps. cvii. 33</A>.

 2. It is the destruction of their fish, which in Egypt was much of
 their food, witness that base reflection which the children of Israel 
 made

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:5">Num. xi. 5</A>):

 <I>We remember the fish which we did eat in Egypt freely.</I> The
 drying up of the rivers will <I>kill the fish</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:29">Ps. cv. 29</A>),

 and will thereby ruin those who make it their business,

 (1.) To catch fish, whether by angling or nets

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 they shall <I>lament</I> and <I>languish,</I> for their trade is at an
 end. There is nothing which the children of this world do more heartily 
 lament than the loss of that which they used to get money by. 
 <I>Ploratur lachrymis amissa pecunia veris--Those are genuine tears 
 which are shed over lost money.</I>

 (2.) To keep fish, that it may be ready when it is called for. There
 were those that <I>made sluices and ponds for fish</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 but <I>they shall be broken in the purposes thereof;</I> their business
 will fail, either for want of water to fill their ponds or for want of 
 fish to replenish their waters. God can find ways to deprive a country 
 even of that which is its staple commodity. The Egyptians may
 themselves remember <I>the fish they have formerly eaten freely,</I> 
 but now cannot have for money. And that which aggravates the loss of 
 these advantages by the river is that it is their own doing

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>They shall turn the rivers far away.</I> Their kings and great men,
 to gratify their own fancy, will drain water from the main river to 
 their own houses and grounds at a distance, preferring their private 
 convenience before the public good, and so by degrees the force of the 
 river is sensibly weakened. Thus many do themselves a greater prejudice 
 at last than they think of, 

 [1.] Who pretend to be wiser than nature, and to do better for
 themselves than nature has done. 

 [2.] Who consult their own particular interest more than the common
 good. Such may gratify themselves, but surely they can never satisfy 
 themselves, who to serve a turn contribute to a public calamity, which 
 they themselves, in the long run, cannot avoid sharing in. Herodotus 
 tells us that Pharaoh-Necho (who reigned not long after this), 
 projecting to cut a free passage by water from Nilus into the Red Sea, 
 employed a vast number of men to make a ditch or channel for that 
 purpose, in which attempt he impaired the river, lost 120,000 of his 
 people, and yet left the work unaccomplished.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. Egypt was famous for the linen manufacture; but that trade shall 
 be ruined. Solomon's merchants traded with Egypt for linen-yarn, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:28">1 Kings x. 28</A>.

 Their country produced the best flax and the best hands to work it; but
 <I>those that work in fine flax shall be confounded</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),
 
 either for want of flax to work on or for want of a demand for that
 which they have worked or opportunity to export it. The decay of trade 
 weakens and wastes a nation and by degrees brings it to ruin. The trade 
 of Egypt must needs sink, for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 <I>there shall not be any work for Egypt</I> to be employed in; and
 where there is nothing to be done there is nothing to be got. There 
 shall be a universal stop put to business, <I>no work which either head 
 or tail, branch or rush, may do;</I> nothing for high or low, weak or 
 strong, to do; <I>no hire,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:10">Zech. viii. 10</A>.

 Note, The flourishing of a kingdom depends much upon the industry of
 the people; and <I>then</I> things are likely to do well when all hands 
 are at work, when the head and top-branch do not disdain to labour, and 
 the labour of the tail and rush is not disdained. But when the learned 
 professions are unemployed, the principal merchants have no stocks, and 
 the handicraft tradesmen nothing to do, poverty comes upon a people 
 <I>as one that travaileth</I> and <I>as an armed man.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. A general consternation shall seize the Egyptians; they <I>shall 
 be afraid and fear</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 which will be both an evidence of a universal decay and a means and
 presage of utter ruin. Two things will put them into this fright:--

 1. What they hear from <I>the land of Judah;</I> that <I>shall be a
 terror to Egypt,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 When they hear of the desolations made in Judah by the army of
 Sennacherib, considering both the near neighbourhood and the strict 
 alliance that was between them and Judah, they will conclude it must be 
 their turn next to become a prey to that victorious army. When their
 neighbour's house was on fire they could not but see their own in 
 danger; and therefore every one of the Egyptians that makes mention of 
 Judah shall be afraid of himself, expecting the bitter cup shortly to 
 be put into his hands.

 2. What they see in their own land. They shall <I>fear</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 <I>because of the shaking of the hand of the Lord of hosts,</I> and

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>)

 <I>because of the counsel of the Lord of hosts,</I> which from the
 shaking of his hand they shall conclude <I>he has determined</I> 
 against Egypt as well as Judah. For, if judgment begin at the house of 
 God, where will it end? <I>If this be done in the green tree, what 
 shall be done in the dry?</I> See here,

 (1.) How easily God can make those a terror to themselves that have
 been, not only secure, but a terror to all about them. It is but 
 shaking his hand over them, or laying it upon some of their neighbours, 
 and the stoutest hearts tremble immediately.

 (2.) How well it becomes us to fear before God when he does but shake
 his hand over us, and to humble ourselves under his mighty hand when it 
 does but threaten us, especially when we see his counsel determined 
 against us; for who can change his counsel?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Out of the thick and threatening clouds of the foregoing prophecy the 
 sun of comfort here breaks forth, and it is the sun of righteousness. 
 Still God has mercy in store for Egypt, and he will show it, not so 
 much by reviving their trade and replenishing their river again as by 
 bringing the true religion among them, calling them to, and accepting 
 them in, the worship of the one only living and true God; and these 
 blessings of grace were much more valuable than all the blessings of 
 nature wherewith Egypt was enriched. We know not of any event in which 
 this prophecy can be thought to have its full accomplishment short of 
 the conversion of Egypt to the faith of Christ, by the preaching (as is 
 supposed) of Mark the Evangelist, and the founding of many Christian 
 churches there, which flourished for many ages. Many prophecies of this 
 book point to the days of the Messiah; and why not this? It is no 
 unusual thing to speak of gospel graces and ordinances in the language 
 of the Old-Testament institutions. And, in these prophecies, those 
 words, <I>in that day,</I> perhaps have not always a reference to what 
 goes immediately before, but have a peculiar significancy pointing at 
 that day which had been so long fixed, and so often spoken of, when the 
 day-spring from on high should visit this dark world. Yet it is not 
 improbable (which some conjecture) that this prophecy was in part 
 fulfilled when those Jews who fled from their own country to take 
 shelter in Egypt, when Sennacherib invaded their land, brought their 
 religion along with them, and, being awakened to great seriousness by 
 the troubles they were in, made an open and zealous profession of it 
 there, and were instrumental to bring many of the Egyptians to embrace 
 it, which was an earnest and specimen of the more plentiful harvest of 
 souls that should be gathered in to God by the preaching of the gospel 
 of Christ. Josephus indeed tells us that Onias the son of Onias the 
 high priest, living an outlaw at Alexandria in Egypt, obtained leave of 
 Ptolemy Philometer, then king, and Cleopatra his queen, to build a 
 temple to the God of Israel, like that at Jerusalem, at Bubastis in 
 Egypt, and pretended a warrant for doing it from this prophecy in 
 Isaiah, that there shall be an <I>altar to the Lord in the land of 
 Egypt;</I> and the service of God, Josephus affirms, continued in it 
 about 333 years, when it was shut up by Paulinus soon after the 
 destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans; see <I>Antiq.</I> 13.62-79, and
 <I>Jewish War</I> 7.426-436. But that temple was all along looked upon 
 by the pious Jews as so great an irregularity, and an affront to the 
 temple at Jerusalem, that we cannot suppose this prophecy to be 
 fulfilled in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe how the conversion of Egypt is here described.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They shall <I>speak the language of Canaan,</I> the holy language, 
 the scripture-language; they shall not only understand it, but use it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>);

 they shall introduce that language among them, and converse freely with
 the people of God, and not, as they used to do, <I>by an 
 interpreter,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:23">Gen. xlii. 23</A>.

 Note, Converting grace, by changing the heart, changes the language;
 <I>for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. Five cities 
 in Egypt</I> shall speak this language; so many Jews shall come to 
 reside in Egypt, and they shall so multiply there, that they shall soon 
 replenish five cities, one of which shall be the city of Heres, or of 
 the sun, Heliopolis, where the sun was worshipped, the most infamous of 
 all the cities of Egypt for idolatry; even there shall be a wonderful 
 reformation, they shall speak the language of Canaan. Or it may be 
 taken thus, as we render it--That for every five cities that shall 
 embrace religion there shall be one (a sixth part of the cities of 
 Egypt) that shall reject it, and that shall be called <I>a city of 
 destruction,</I> because it refuses the methods of salvation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They shall swear to the Lord of hosts, not only swear by him, 
 giving him the honour of appealing to him, as all nations did to the 
 gods they worshipped; but they shall by a solemn oath and vow devote 
 themselves to his honour and bind themselves to his service. They shall 
 swear to cleave to him with purpose of heart, and shall worship him, 
 not occasionally, but constantly. They shall swear allegiance to him as 
 their King, to Christ, to whom all judgment is committed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They shall set up the public worship of God in their land 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):
 
 <I>There shall be an altar to the Lord</I> in the <I>midst of the land
 of Egypt,</I> an altar on which <I>they shall do sacrifice and 
 oblation</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>);

 therefore it must be understood spiritually. Christ, the great altar,
 who sanctifies every gift, shall be owned there, and the gospel 
 sacrifices of prayer and praise shall be offered up; for by the law of 
 Moses there was to be no altar for sacrifice but that at Jerusalem. In 
 Christ Jesus all distinction of nations is taken away; and a spiritual 
 altar, a gospel church, in the midst of the land of Egypt, is as 
 acceptable to God as one in the midst of the land of Israel; and 
 spiritual sacrifices of faith and love, and a contrite heart, <I>please 
 the Lord better than an ox or bullock.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. There shall be a face of religion upon the nation, and an open 
 profession made of it, discernible to all who come among them. Not only 
 in the heart of the country, but even in <I>the borders</I> of it, 
 <I>there shall be a pillar,</I> or pillars, inscribed, <I>To 
 Jehovah,</I> to his honour, as before there had been such pillars set 
 up in honour of false gods. As soon as a stranger entered upon the 
 borders of Egypt he might perceive what God they worshipped. Those that 
 serve God must not be ashamed to own him, but be forward to do any 
 thing that may be for a sign and for a witness to the Lord of hosts. 
 Even in the land of Egypt he had some faithful worshippers, who boasted 
 of their relation to him and made his name their strong tower, or 
 bulwark, on their borders, with which their coasts were fortified 
 against all assailants.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Being in distress, they shall seek to God, and he shall be found of 
 them; and this <I>shall be a sign and a witness for the Lord of 
 hosts</I> that he is a <I>God hearing prayer</I> to <I>all flesh</I>
 that <I>come to him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:20">
 <I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 
 See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:2">Ps. lxv. 2</A>.

 When they cry to God by reason of their oppressors, the cruel lords
 that shall <I>rule over them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)
 
 he <I>shall be entreated of them</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>);

 whereas he had told his people Israel, who had made it their own choice
 to have such a king, that they should <I>cry to him by reason of their 
 king,</I> and he <I>would not hear them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:18">1 Sam. viii. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. They shall have an interest in the great Redeemer. When they were 
 under the oppression of cruel lords perhaps God sometimes raised them 
 up mighty deliverers, as he did for Israel in the days of the judges; 
 and by them, though he had smitten the land, he healed it again; and, 
 upon their return to God in a way of duty, he returned to them in a way 
 of mercy, and repaired the breaches of their tottering state. For 
 repenting Egyptians shall find the same favour with God that repenting 
 Ninevites did. But all these deliverances wrought for them, as those
 for Israel, were but figures of gospel salvation. Doubtless Jesus 
 Christ is <I>the Saviour and the great one</I> here spoken of, whom God 
 will send the glad tidings of to the Egyptians, and by whom he will 
 <I>deliver them out of the hands of their enemies,</I> that they may 
 <I>serve him without fear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:74,75">Luke i. 74, 75</A>.

 Jesus Christ delivered the Gentile nations from the service of dumb
 idols, and did himself both purchase and preach liberty to the 
 captives.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The knowledge of God shall prevail among them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 1. They shall have the means of knowledge. For many ages in <I>Judah
 only was God known,</I> for there only were the lively oracles found; 
 but now <I>the Lord,</I> and his name and will, <I>shall be known to 
 Egypt.</I> Perhaps this may in part refer to the translation of the Old 
 Testament out of Hebrew into Greek by the LXX., which was done at 
 Alexandria in Egypt, by the command of Ptolemy king of Egypt; and it 
 was the first time that the scriptures were translated into any other 
 language. By the help of this (the Grecian monarchy having introduced 
 their language into that country) <I>the Lord was known to Egypt,</I> 
 and a happy omen and means it was of his being further known. 

 2. They shall have grace to improve those means. It is promised not
 only that the Lord shall be known to Egypt, but that <I>the Egyptians 
 shall know the Lord;</I> they shall receive and entertain the light 
 granted to them, and shall submit themselves to the power of it. The 
 Lord is known to our nation, and yet I fear there are many of our 
 nation that do not know the Lord. But the promise of the new covenant 
 is that <I>all shall know the Lord, from the least even to the 
 greatest,</I> which promise is sure to all the seed. The effect of this 
 knowledge of God is that <I>they shall vow a vow to the Lord and 
 perform it.</I> For those do not know God aright who either are not 
 willing to come under binding obligations to the Lord or do not make 
 good those obligations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. They shall come into the communion of saints. Being joined to the 
 Lord, they shall be added to the church, and be incorporated with all 
 the saints. 

 1. All enmities shall be slain. Mortal feuds there had been between
 Egypt and Assyria; they often made war upon one another; but now 
 <I>there shall be a highway between Egypt and Assyria</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),
 
 a happy correspondence settled between he two nations; they shall trade
 with one another, and every thing that passes between them shall be 
 friendly. <I>The Egyptians shall serve</I> (shall worship the true
 God) <I>with the Assyrians;</I> and therefore the Assyrians shall come 
 into Egypt and the Egyptians into Assyria. Note, It becomes those who 
 have communion with the same God, through the same Mediator, to keep up 
 an amicable correspondence with one another. The consideration of our 
 meeting at the same throne of grace, and our serving with each other in 
 the same business of religion, should put an end to all heats and 
 animosities, and knit our hearts to each other in holy love. 

 2. The Gentile nations shall not only unite with each other in the
 gospel fold under Christ the great shepherd, but they shall all be 
 united with the Jews. When Egypt and Assyria become partners in serving 
 God <I>Israel</I> shall <I>make a third with</I> them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>);

 they shall become a <I>three-fold cord, not easily broken.</I> The
 ceremonial law, which had long been the partition-wall between Jews and 
 Gentiles, shall be taken down, and then they shall become <I>one 
 sheep-fold under one shepherd.</I> Thus united, they shall be <I>a 
 blessing in the midst of the land, whom the Lord of hosts shall 
 bless,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>.

 (1.) Israel shall be a blessing to them all, because of <I>them, as
 concerning the flesh, Christ came,</I> and they were the natural 
 branches of the good olive, to whom did originally pertain <I>its root 
 and fatness,</I> and the Gentiles were but <I>grafted in among 
 them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:17">Rom. xi. 17</A>.

 Israel lay between Egypt and Assyria, and was a blessing to them both
 by bringing them to meet in that word of the Lord which went forth from 
 Jerusalem, and that church which was first set up in the land of 
 Israel. <I>Qui conveniunt in aliquo tertio inter se conveniunt--Those 
 who meet in a third meet in each other.</I> Israel is that third in 
 whom Egypt and Assyria agree, and is therefore a blessing; for those 
 are real and great blessings to their generation who are instrumental 
 to unite those that have been at variance.

 (2.) They shall all be a blessing to the world: so the Christian church 
 is, made up of Jews and Gentiles; it is the beauty, riches, and support 
 of the world.

 (3.) They shall all be blessed of the Lord. 

 [1.] They shall all be owned by him as his. Though Egypt was formerly a
 house of bondage to the people of God, and Assyria an unjust invader of 
 them, all this shall now be forgiven and forgotten, and they shall be 
 as welcome to God as Israel. They are all alike his people whom he 
 takes under his protection. They are formed by him, for they are the 
 <I>work of his hands;</I> not only as <I>a</I> people, but as 
 <I>his</I> people. They are formed for him; for they are his 
 inheritance, precious in his eyes, and dear to him, and from whom he 
 has his rent of honour out of this lower world. 

 [2.] They shall be owned together by him as jointly his, his in
 concert; they shall all share in one and the same blessing. Note,
 Those that are united in the love and blessing of God ought, for that 
 reason, to be united to each other in charity.</P>
