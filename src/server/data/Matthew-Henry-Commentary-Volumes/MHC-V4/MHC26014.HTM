 Hearing the word, and prayer, are two great ordinances of God, in which 
 we are to give honour to him and may hope to find favour and acceptance 
 with him; and yet in this chapter, to our great surprise, we find some 
 waiting upon God in the one and some in the other and yet not meeting 
 with success as they expected. 

 I. The elders of Israel come to hear the word, and enquire of the
 prophet, but, because they are not duly qualified, they meet with a 
 rebuke instead of acceptance 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>)

 and are called upon to repent of their sins and reform their lives,
 else it is at their peril to enquire of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:6-11">ver. 6-11</A>.

 II. Noah, Daniel, and Job, are supposed to pray for this people, and
 yet, because the decree has gone forth, and the destruction of them is
 determined by a variety of judgments, their prayers shall not be
 answered,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:12-21">ver. 12-21</A>.

 And yet it is promised, in the close, that a remnant shall escape,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat
 before me.
 &nbsp; 2  And the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 3  Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart,
 and put the stumbling-block of their iniquity before their face:
 should I be enquired of at all by them?
 &nbsp; 4  Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the
 Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his
 idols in his heart, and putteth the stumbling-block of his
 iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his
 idols;
 &nbsp; 5  That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart,
 because they are all estranged from me through their idols.
 &nbsp; 6  Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord
 G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Repent, and turn <I>yourselves</I> from your idols; and turn away
 your faces from all your abominations.
 &nbsp; 7  For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that
 sojourneth in Israel, which separateth himself from me, and
 setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumbling-block
 of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to a prophet to
 enquire of him concerning me; I the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will answer him by
 myself:
 &nbsp; 8  And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a
 sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my
 people; and ye shall know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 9  And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my
 hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people
 Israel.
 &nbsp; 10  And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the
 punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him
 that seeketh <I>unto him;</I>
 &nbsp; 11  That the house of Israel may go no more astray from me,
 neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions; but
 that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the
 Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The address which some of the elders of Israel made to the prophet, 
 as an oracle, to enquire of the Lord by him. They <I>came, and sat 
 before him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 It is probable that they were not of those who were now his 
 fellow-captives, and constantly attended his ministry (such as those we 
 read of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:1"><I>ch.</I> viii. 1</A>),

 but some occasional hearers, some of the grandees of Jerusalem who had
 come upon business to Babylon, perhaps public business, on an embassy 
 from the king, and in their way called on the prophet, having heard 
 much of him and being desirous to know if he had any message from God, 
 which might be some guide to them in their negotiation. By the severe 
 answer given them one would suspect they had a design to ensnare the 
 prophet, or to try if they could catch hold of any thing that might 
 look like a contradiction to Jeremiah's prophecies, and so they might 
 have occasion to reproach them both. However, they feigned themselves
 just men, complimented the prophet, and sat before him gravely enough, 
 as God's people used to sit. Note, It is no new thing for bad men to be 
 found employed in the external performances of religion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The account which God gave the prophet privately concerning them. 
 They were strangers to him; he only knew that they were <I>elders of 
 Israel;</I> that was the character they wore, and as such he received 
 them with respect, and, it is likely, was glad to see them so well 
 disposed. But God gives him their real character 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 they were idolaters, and did only consult Ezekiel as they would any 
 oracle of a pretended deity, to gratify their curiosity, and therefore 
 he appeals to the prophet himself whether they deserved to have any 
 countenance or encouragement given them: "<I>Should I be enquired of at 
 all by them?</I> Should I accept their enquiries as an honour to 
 myself, or answer them for satisfaction to them? No; they have no 
 reason to expect it;" for, 

 1. They <I>have set up their idols in their heart;</I> they not only
 have idols, but they are in love with them, they dote upon them, are 
 wedded to them, and have laid them so near their hearts, and have given 
 them so great a room in their affections, that there is no parting with 
 them. The idols they have set up in their houses, though they are now 
 at a distance from <I>the chambers of their imagery,</I> yet they have 
 them in their hearts, and they are ever and anon worshipping them in 
 their fancies and imaginations. <I>They have made their idols to ascend 
 upon their hearts</I> (so the word is); they have subjected their 
 hearts to their idols, they are upon the throne there. Or when they
 came to enquire of the prophet they pretended to put away their idols, 
 but it was in pretence only; they still had a secret reserve for them. 
 They kept them <I>up in their hearts;</I> and, if they left them for a 
 while, it was <I>cum animo revertendi--with an intention to return to 
 them,</I> not a final farewell. Or it may be understood of spiritual
 idolatry; those whose affections are placed upon the wealth of the 
 world and the pleasures of sense, whose god is their money, <I>whose 
 god is their belly,</I> they <I>set up their idols in their heart.</I> 
 Many who have no idols in their sanctuary have idols in their hearts, 
 which is no less a usurpation of God's throne and a profanation of his 
 name. <I>Little children, keep yourselves from</I> those <I>idols.</I> 

 2. They <I>put the stumbling-block of their iniquity before their
 face.</I> Their <I>silver and gold</I> were called <I>the 
 stumbling-block of their iniquity</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:19"><I>ch.</I> vii. 19</A>),

 their <I>idols of silver and gold,</I> by the beauty of which they were
 allured to idolatry, and so it was the block at which they stumbled, 
 and fell into that sin; or <I>their iniquity</I> is their 
 <I>stumbling-block,</I> which throws them down, so that they fall into 
 ruin. Note, Sinners are their own tempters (<I>every man is tempted 
 when he is drawn aside of his own lust</I>), and so they are their own 
 destroyers. <I>If thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it;</I> and thus 
 <I>they put the stumbling-block of their iniquity before their</I> own 
 <I>faces,</I> and stumble upon it though they see it before their eyes. 
 It intimates that they are resolved to go on in sin, whatever comes of 
 it. <I>I have loved strangers, and after them I will go;</I> that is 
 the language of their hearts. And <I>should</I> God <I>be enquired 
 of</I> by such wretches? Do they not hereby rather put an affront upon 
 him than do him any honour, as those did who <I>bowed the knee</I> to 
 Christ in mockery? Can those expect an answer of peace from God who 
 thus continue their acts of hostility against him? "Ezekiel, what 
 thinkest thou of it?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The answer which God, in just displeasure, orders Ezekiel to give 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Let them know that it is not out of any disrespect to their persons 
 that God refuses to give them an answer, but it is laid down as a rule 
 for <I>every man of the house of Israel,</I> whoever he be, that if he 
 continue in love and league with his idols, and come to enquire of God, 
 God will resent it as an indignity done to him, and will answer him 
 according to his real iniquity, not according to his pretended piety. 
 He <I>comes to the prophet,</I> who, he expects, will be civil to him, 
 but God will give him his answer, by punishing him for his impudence: 
 <I>I the Lord,</I> who <I>speak and it is done, I will answer him that 
 cometh, according to the multitude of his idols.</I> Observe, Those who 
 <I>set up idols in their hearts,</I> and set their hearts upon their 
 idols, commonly have a multitude of them. Humble worshippers God 
 answers <I>according to the multitude of his mercies,</I> but bold 
 intruders he answers <I>according to the multitude of their idols,</I> 
 that is, 

 1. According to the desire of their idols; he will give them up <I>to
 their own hearts' lust,</I> and leave them to themselves to be as bad 
 as they have a mind to be, till they <I>have filled up the measure of 
 their iniquity.</I> Men's corruptions are <I>idols in their hearts,</I> 
 and they are of their own setting up; their temptations are <I>the 
 stumbling-block of their iniquity,</I> and they are of their own 
 putting, and God will answer them accordingly; let them take their 
 course. 

 2. According to the desert of their idols; they shall have such an 
 answer as it is just that such idolaters should have. God will punish 
 them as he usually punishes idolaters, that is, when they stand in need 
 of his help he will <I>send them to the gods whom they have chosen,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:13,14">Judg. x. 13, 14</A>.

 Note, The judgment of God will dwell with men according to what they
 are really (that is, according to what their hearts are), not according 
 to what they are in show and profession. And what will be the end of
 this? What will this threatened answer amount to? He tells them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart,</I> may lay 
 them open to the world, that they may be ashamed; nay, lay them open to 
 the curse, that they may be ruined. Note, The sin and shame, and pain
 and ruin, of sinners, are all from themselves, and their own hearts are 
 the snares in which they are taken; they seduce them, they betray them; 
 their own consciences witness against them, condemn them, and are a 
 terror to them. If God take them, if he discover them, if he convict 
 them, if he bind them over to his judgment, it is all by <I>their own 
 hearts. O Israel! thou hast destroyed thyself. The house of Israel</I> 
 is ruined by its own hands, <I>because they are all estranged from me 
 through their idols.</I> Note, 

 (1.) The ruin of sinners is owing to their estrangement from God.

 (2.) It is through some idol or other that the hearts of men are 
 estranged from God; some creature has gained that place and dominion in 
 the heart that God should have.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The extent of this answer which God had given them--to all <I>the
 house of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 The same thing is repeated, which intimates God's just displeasure 
 against hypocrites, who mock him with the shows and forms of devotion, 
 while their hearts are estranged from him and at war with him. Observe, 

 1. To whom this declaration belongs. It concerns not only every one of
 the house of Israel (as before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 but <I>the stranger that sojourns in Israel;</I> let him not think it 
 will be an excuse for him in his idolatries that he is but a stranger 
 and a sojourner in Israel, and does but worship the gods that his 
 father served and that he himself was bred up in the service of; no, 
 let him not expect any benefit from Israel's oracles or prophets unless 
 he thoroughly renounce his idolatry. Note, Even proselytes shall not be 
 countenanced if they be not sincere: a dissembled conversion is no 
 conversion. 

 2. The description here given of hypocrites: They <I>separate 
 themselves from</I> God by their fellowship with idols; they cut 
 themselves off from their relation to God and their interest in him; 
 they break off their acquaintance and intercourse with him, and set 
 themselves at a distance from him. Note, Those that join themselves to 
 idols separate themselves from God; nor shall any be for ever separated 
 from the vision and fruition of God, but such as now separate 
 themselves from his service and wilfully withdraw their allegiance from 
 him. But there are those who thus separate themselves from God, and yet 
 come to the prophets with a seeming respect and deference to their 
 office, <I>to enquire of them concerning</I> God, in order to satisfy a 
 vain curiosity, to stop the mouth of a clamorous conscience, or to get 
 or save a reputation among men, but without any desire to be acquainted 
 with God or any design to be ruled by him. 

 3. The doom of those who thus trifle with God and think to impose upon
 him: "<I>I the Lord will answer him by myself;</I> let me alone to deal 
 with him; I will give him an answer that shall fill him with confusion, 
 that shall make him repent of his daring impiety." He shall have his 
 answer, not by the words of the prophet, but by the judgments of God. 
 <I>And I will set my face against that man,</I> which denotes great 
 displeasure against him and a fixed resolution to ruin him. God can 
 outface the most impenitent sinner. The hypocrite thought to save his 
 credit, nay, and to gain applause, but, on the contrary, God <I>will 
 make him a sign and a proverb,</I> will inflict such judgments upon him 
 as shall make him remarkable and contemptible in the eyes of all about 
 him; his misery shall be made use of to express the greatest misery, as 
 when the worst of sinners are said to have <I>their portion appointed 
 them with hypocrites,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:51">Matt. xxiv. 51</A>.

 God will make him an example; his judgments upon him shall be for
 warning to others to take heed of mocking God: for <I>thus shall it be 
 done to the man that separates himself from</I> God, and yet pretends 
 to <I>enquire concerning him.</I> The hypocrite thought to pass for one 
 of God's people, and to crowd into heaven among them; but God <I>will 
 cut him off from the midst of his people,</I> will discover him, and 
 pluck him out from the thickest of them; and by this, says God, <I>you 
 shall know that I am the Lord.</I> By the discovery of hypocrites it 
 appears that God is omniscient: ministers know not how people stand 
 affected when they come to hear the word, by God does. And by the 
 punishment of hypocrites it appears that he is a jealous God, and one 
 that cannot and will not be imposed upon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The doom of those pretenders to prophecy who give countenance to 
 these pretenders to piety, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 These hypocritical enquirers, though Ezekiel will not give them a 
 comfortable answer, yet hope to meet with some other prophets that 
 will; and if they do, as perhaps they may, let them know that God 
 permits those lying prophets to deceive them in part of punishment: 
 "<I>If the prophet</I> that flatters them <I>be deceived,</I> and gives 
 them hopes which there is no ground for, <I>I the Lord have deceived 
 that prophet,</I> have suffered the temptation to be laid before him, 
 and suffered him to yield to it, and overruled it for the hardening of 
 those in their wicked courses who were resolved to go on in them." We 
 are sure that God is not the author of sin, but we are sure that he is 
 the Lord of all and the Judge of sinners, and that he often makes use 
 of one wicked man to destroy another, and so of one wicked man to 
 deceive another. Both are sins in him who does them, and so they are
 <I>not</I> from God; both are punishments to him to whom they are done, 
 and so they <I>are</I> from God. We have a full instance of this in the 
 story of Ahab's prophets, who were deceived by a lying spirit, which 
 God put into their mouths 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+22:23">1 Kings xxii. 23</A>),

 and another in those whom God <I>gives up to strong delusions, to
 believe a lie, because they received not the love of the truth,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:10,11">2 Thess. ii. 10, 11</A>.

 But read the fearful doom of the lying prophet: <I>I will stretch out
 my hand upon him and will destroy him.</I> When God has served his own 
 righteous purposes by him he shall be reckoned with for his unrighteous 
 purposes. As, when God had made use of the Chaldeans for the wasting
 of a sinful people, he justly punished them for their rage, so when he 
 had made use of <I>false prophets,</I> and afterwards of <I>false 
 Christs,</I> for the deceiving of a sinful people, he justly punished 
 them for their falsehood. But herein we must acknowledge (as Calvin 
 upon this place reminds us) that God's <I>judgments are a great 
 deep,</I> that we are incompetent judges of them, and that, though we 
 cannot account for the equity of God's proceedings to the satisfying 
 and silencing of every caviller, yet there is a day coming when he will 
 be justified before all the world, and particularly in this instance, 
 when <I>the punishment of the prophet</I> that flattereth the hypocrite 
 in his evil way shall be as the punishment of the hypocrite that 
 seeketh to him and bespeaks <I>smooth things</I> only, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:10">Isa. xxx. 10</A>.

 The ditch shall be the same to the blind leader and the blind
 followers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The good counsel that is given them for the preventing of this 
 fearful doom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>Therefore repent, and turn yourselves from your idols.</I> Let 
 <I>this</I> separate between you and them, that they separate between 
 you and God; because they set God's face against you, do you <I>turn 
 away your faces from them,</I>" which denotes, not only forsaking them, 
 but forsaking them with loathing and detestation: "Turn from them as 
 from abominations that you are sick of; and then you will be welcome to 
 enquire of the Lord. <I>Come now, and let us reason together.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The good issue of all this as to the house of Israel; 
 <I>therefore</I> the pretending prophets, and the pretending saints, 
 shall perish together by the judgments of God, that, some being made 
 examples, the body of the people may be reformed, <I>that the house of 
 Israel may go no more astray from me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Note, The punishments of some are designed for the prevention of sin, 
 that others may hear, and fear, and take warning. When we see what 
 becomes of those that go astray from God we should thereby be engaged 
 to keep close to him. And, if <I>the house of Israel go not astray, 
 they will not be polluted any more.</I> Note, Sin is a polluting thing; 
 it renders the sinner odious in the eyes of the pure and holy God, and 
 in his own eyes too whenever conscience is awakened; and therefore they 
 shall <I>no more be polluted, that they may be my people and I may be 
 their God.</I> Note, Those whom God takes into covenant with himself 
 must first be cleansed from the pollutions of sin; and those who are so 
 cleansed shall not only be saved from ruin, but be entitled to all the 
 privileges of God's people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  The word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came again to me, saying,
 &nbsp; 13  Son of man, when the land sinneth against me by trespassing
 grievously, then will I stretch out mine hand upon it, and will
 break the staff of the bread thereof, and will send famine upon
 it, and will cut off man and beast from it:
 &nbsp; 14  Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it,
 they should deliver <I>but</I> their own souls by their righteousness,
 saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 15  If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they
 spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through
 because of the beasts:
 &nbsp; 16  <I>Though</I> these three men <I>were</I> in it, <I>as</I> I live, saith
 the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they
 only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.
 &nbsp; 17  Or <I>if</I> I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go
 through the land; so that I cut off man and beast from it:
 &nbsp; 18  Though these three men <I>were</I> in it, <I>as</I> I live, saith the
 Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they
 only shall be delivered themselves.
 &nbsp; 19  Or <I>if</I> I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my
 fury upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast:
 &nbsp; 20  Though Noah, Daniel, and Job, <I>were</I> in it, <I>as</I> I live,
 saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter;
 they shall <I>but</I> deliver their own souls by their righteousness.
 &nbsp; 21  For thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; How much more when I send my
 four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine,
 and the noisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man
 and beast?
 &nbsp; 22  Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be
 brought forth, <I>both</I> sons and daughters: behold, they shall come
 forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and their doings: and
 ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought
 upon Jerusalem, <I>even</I> concerning all that I have brought upon
 it.
 &nbsp; 23  And they shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their
 doings: and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all
 that I have done in it, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.

 <I>When the land sins against me,</I> when vice and wickedness become 
 epidemical, <I>when the land sins by trespassing grievously,</I> when 
 the sinners have become very numerous and their sins very heinous, when 
 gross impieties and immoralities universally prevail, <I>then will I 
 stretch forth my hand upon it,</I> for the punishment of it. The divine 
 power shall be vigorously and openly exerted; the judgments shall be 
 extended and stretched forth to all the corners of the land, to all the 
 concerns and interests of the nation. Grievous sins bring grievous 
 plagues.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That God has a variety of sore judgments wherewith to punish sinful 
 nations, and he has them all at command and inflicts which he pleases. 
 He did indeed give David his choice what judgment he would be punished 
 with for his sin in numbering the people; for any of them would serve 
 to answer the end, which was to lessen the numbers he was proud of; but 
 David, in effect, referred it to God again: "<I>Let us fall into the 
 hands of the Lord;</I> let him choose with what rod we shall be 
 beaten." But he uses a variety of judgments that it may appear he has a 
 universal dominion, and that in all our concerns we may see our 
 dependence on him. <I>Four sore judgments</I> are here specified:--

 1. <I>Famine,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 The denying and withholding of common mercies is itself judgment 
 enough, there needs no more to make a people miserable. God needs not
 bring the staff of oppression, it is but <I>breaking the staff of 
 bread</I> and the work is soon done; he <I>cuts off man and beast</I> 
 by cutting off the provisions which nature makes for both in the annual 
 products of the earth. God <I>breaks the staff of bread</I> when, 
 though we have bread, yet we are not nourished and strengthened by it. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:6">Hag. i. 6</A>,
 
 <I>You eat, but you have not enough.</I>

 2. Hurtful <I>beasts, noisome</I> and noxious, either as poisonous or 
 as ravenous. God can make these <I>to pass through the land</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 to increase in all parts of it, and to bereave it, not only of the tame 
 cattle, preying upon their flocks and herds, but of their people, 
 devouring men, women, and children, so <I>that no man may pass through 
 because of the beasts;</I> none dare travel even in the high roads for 
 fear of being pulled in pieces by lions, or other beasts of prey, as 
 the children of Beth-el by two bears. Note, When men revolt from their
 allegiance to God, and rebel against him, it is just with God that the 
 inferior creatures should rise up in arms against men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:22">Lev. xxvi. 22</A>.

 3. War. God often chastises sinful nations by bringing a sword upon
 them, the sword of a foreign enemy, and he gives it its commission and 
 orders what execution it shall do 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 he says, <I>Sword, go through the land.</I> It is bad enough if the 
 sword do but enter into the borders of a land, but much worse when it 
 goes through the bowels of a land. By it God <I>cuts off man and 
 beast,</I> horse and foot. What execution the sword does God does by
 it; for it is his sword, and it acts as he directs. 

 4. <I>Pestilence</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 a dreadful disease, which has sometimes depopulated cities; by it God 
 <I>pours out his fury in blood</I> (that is, in death); the pestilence 
 kills as effectually as if the blood were shed by the sword, for it is 
 poisoned by the disease, <I>the sickness</I> we call it. See how 
 miserable the case of mankind is that lies thus exposed to deaths in 
 various shapes. See how dangerous the case of sinners is against whom
 God has so many ways of fighting, so that, though they escape one 
 judgment, God has another waiting for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That when God's professing people revolt from him, and rebel 
 against him, they may justly expect a complication of judgments to fall 
 upon them. God has various ways of contending with a sinful nation; but 
 if Jerusalem, the holy city, <I>become a harlot,</I> God will send upon 
 her all his <I>four sore judgments</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>);

 for the nearer any are to God in name and profession the more severely 
 will he reckon with them if they reproach that worthy name by which 
 they are called and give the lie to that profession. They shall be 
 punished <I>seven times more.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That there may be, and commonly are, some few very good men, even 
 in those places that by sin are ripened for ruin. It is no foreign 
 supposition that, even in a land that has <I>trespassed grievously,</I> 
 there may be <I>three</I> such <I>men</I> as <I>Noah, Daniel, and 
 Job.</I> Daniel was now living, and at this time had scarcely arrived 
 at the prime of his eminency, but he was already famous (at least this 
 word of God concerning him would without fail make him so); yet he was 
 carried away into captivity with the first of all, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:6">Dan. i. 6</A>.

 Some of the better sort of people in Jerusalem might perhaps think
 that, if Daniel (of whose fame in the king of Babylon's court they had 
 heard much) had but continued in Jerusalem, it would have been spared 
 for his sake, as the magicians in Babylon were. "No," says God, "though 
 you had him, who was as eminently good in bad times and places as Noah 
 in the old world and Job in the land of Uz, yet a reprieve should not 
 be obtained." In the places that are most corrupt, and in the ages that 
 are most degenerate, <I>there is a remnant</I> which God reserves to 
 himself, and which <I>still hold fast their integrity</I> and stand 
 fair for the honour of <I>delivering the land,</I> as <I>the 
 innocent</I> are said to do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:30">Job xxii. 30</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. That God often spares very wicked places for the sake of a few godly 
 people in them. This is implied here as the expectation of Jerusalem's 
 friends in the day of its distress: "Surely God will stay his 
 controversy with us; for are there not some among us that are emptying 
 the measure of national guilt by their prayers, as others are filling 
 it by their sins? And, rather than God will <I>destroy the righteous 
 with the wicked,</I> he will preserve <I>the wicked with the 
 righteous.</I> If Sodom might have been spared for the sake of ten good 
 men, surely Jerusalem may."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. That such men as Noah, Daniel, and Job, will prevail, if any can, 
 to turn away the wrath of God from a sinful people. Noah was a perfect 
 man, and kept his integrity when all flesh had corrupted their way; 
 and, for his sake, his family, though one of them was wicked (Ham), was 
 saved in the ark. Job was a great example of piety, and mighty in 
 prayer for his children, for his friends; and God turned his captivity 
 when he prayed. Those were very ancient examples, before Moses, that 
 great intercessor; and therefore God mentions them, to intimate that he 
 had some very peculiar favourites long before the Jewish nation was 
 formed or founded, and would have such when it was ruined, for which 
 reason, it should seem, those names were made use of, rather than 
 Moses, Aaron, or Samuel; and yet, lest any should think that God was 
 partial in his respects to the ancient days, here is a modern instance, 
 a living one, placed between those two that were the glories of 
 antiquity, and he now a captive, and that is Daniel, to teach us not to 
 lessen the useful good men of our own day by over-magnifying the 
 ancients. Let the children of the captivity know that Daniel, their 
 neighbour, and <I>companion in tribulation,</I> being a man of great 
 humility, piety, and zeal for God, and instant and constant in prayer, 
 had as good an interest in heaven as Noah or Job had. Why may not God 
 raise up as great and good men now as he did formerly, and do as much 
 for them?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. That when the sin of a people has come to its height, and the 
 decree has gone forth for their ruin, the piety and prayers of the best 
 men shall not prevail to finish the controversy. This is here asserted 
 again and again, that, <I>though these three men were in</I> Jerusalem 
 at this time, yet they should <I>deliver neither son nor daughter;</I> 
 not so much as the little ones should be spared for their sakes, as the 
 little ones of Israel were upon the prayer of Moses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:31">Num. xiv. 31</A>.

 No; <I>the land shall be desolate,</I> and God would not hear their
 prayers for it, though <I>Moses and Samuel stood before him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:1">Jer. xv. 1</A>.
 
 Note, Abused patience will turn at last into inexorable wrath; and it
 should seem as if God would be more inexorable in Jerusalem's case than 
 in another 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 because, besides the divine patience, they had enjoyed greater 
 privileges than any other people, which were the aggravations of their 
 sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. That, though pious praying men may not prevail to deliver others, 
 yet <I>they shall deliver their own souls by their righteousness,</I> 
 so that, though they may suffer in the common calamity, yet to them the 
 property of it is altered; it is not to them what it is to the wicked; 
 it is unstrung, and does them no hurt; it is sanctified, and does them 
 good. Sometimes <I>their souls</I> (their lives) are remarkably 
 <I>delivered,</I> and <I>given them for a prey;</I> at least <I>their 
 souls</I> (their spiritual interests) are secured. If their bodies be 
 not <I>delivered,</I> yet <I>their souls</I> are. <I>Riches</I> indeed 
 <I>profit not in the day of wrath,</I> but <I>righteousness delivers 
 from death,</I> from so great a death, so many deaths as are here 
 threatened. This should encourage us to keep our integrity in times of 
 common apostasy, that, if we do so, we shall be <I>hidden in the day of 
 the Lord's anger.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IX. That, even when God makes the greatest desolations by his 
 judgments, he reserves some to be the monuments of his mercy, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>.

 In Jerusalem itself, though marked for utter ruin, yet <I>there shall 
 be left a remnant,</I> who shall not be cut off by any of those <I>sore 
 judgments</I> before mentioned, but shall be carried into captivity, 
 both <I>sons and daughters,</I> who shall be the seed of a new 
 generation. The young ones, who had not grown up to such an obstinacy 
 in sin as their fathers had who were therefore cut off as incurable, 
 these <I>shall be brought forth</I> out of the ruins of Jerusalem by 
 the victorious enemy, and <I>behold they shall come forth to you</I> 
 that are in captivity, they shall make a virtue of a necessity, and 
 shall come the more willingly to Babylon because so many of their 
 friends have gone thither before them and are there ready to receive 
 them; and, when they come, <I>you shall see their ways and their 
 doing;</I> you shall hear them make a free and ingenuous confession of 
 the sins they had formerly been guilty of, and a humble profession of 
 repentance for them, with promises of reformation; and you shall see 
 instances of their reformation, shall see what good their affliction 
 has done them, and how prudently and patiently they conduct themselves 
 under it. Their narrow escape shall have a good effect upon them; it 
 shall change their temper and conversation, and make them new men. And 
 this will redound, 

 1. To the satisfaction of their brethren: <I>They shall comfort you
 when you see their ways.</I> Note, It is a very comfortable sight to 
 see people, when they are under the rod, repenting and humbling 
 themselves, justifying God and accepting the punishment of their 
 iniquity. When we sorrow (as we ought to do) for the afflictions of 
 others, it is a great comfort to us in our sorrow to see them improving 
 their afflictions and making a good use of them. When those captives
 told their friends how bad they had been, and how righteous God was in 
 bringing these judgments upon them, it made them very easy, and helped 
 to reconcile them to the calamities of Jerusalem, to the justice of God 
 in punishing his own people so, and to the goodness of God, which now 
 appeared to have had kind intentions in all; and thus "<I>You shall be 
 comforted concerning all the evil that I have brought upon 
 Jerusalem,</I> and, when you better understand the thing, shall not 
 have such direful apprehensions concerning it as you have had." Note, 
 It is a debt we owe to our brethren, if we have got good by our 
 afflictions, to comfort them by letting them know it. 

 2. It will redound to the honour of God: "<I>You shall know that I have 
 not done without cause,</I> not without a just provocation, and yet not 
 without a gracious design, <I>all that I have done in it.</I>" Note, 
 When afflictions have done their work, and have accomplished that for 
 which they were sent, then will appear the wisdom and goodness of God 
 in sending them, and God will be not only justified, but glorified in 
 them.</P>
