 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have, 

 I. Daniel's prayer for the restoration of the Jews who were in
 captivity, in which he confesses sin, and acknowledges the justice of 
 God in their calamities, but pleads God's promises of mercy which he 
 had yet in store for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:1-19">ver. 1-19</A>.

 II. An immediate answer sent him by an angel to his prayer, in which,
 
 1. He is assured of the speedy release of the Jews out of their
 captivity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:20-23">ver. 20-23</A>.
 
 And, 

 2. He is informed concerning the redemption of the world by Jesus
 Christ (of which that was a type), what should be the nature of it and
 when it should be accomplished, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:24-27">ver. 24-27</A>.

 And it is the clearest, brightest, prophecy of the Messiah, in all the 
 Old Testament.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed
 of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the
 Chaldeans;
 &nbsp; 2  In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books
 the number of the years, whereof the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came to
 Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in
 the desolations of Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 3  And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and
 supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We left Daniel, in the close of the foregoing chapter, employed in the 
 <I>king's business;</I> but here we have him employed in better 
 business than any king had for him, speaking to God and hearing from 
 him, not for himself only, but for the church, whose mouth he was to 
 God, and for whose use the <I>oracles</I> of God were <I>committed to 
 him,</I> relating to the days of the Messiah. Observe, 

 1. When it was that Daniel had this communion with God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 <I>in the first year of Darius the Mede,</I> who was newly made king of
 the Chaldeans, Babylon being conquered by him and his nephew, or 
 grandson, Cyrus. In this year the seventy years of the Jews' captivity 
 ended, but the decree for their release was not yet issued out; so that 
 this address of Daniel's to God seems to have been ready in that year, 
 and, probably, before he was cast into the lions' den. And one powerful 
 inducement, perhaps, it was to him then to keep so close to the duty of 
 prayer, though it cost him his life, that he had so lately experienced 
 the benefit and comfort of it. 

 2. What occasioned his address to God by prayer

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 He <I>understood by books</I> that seventy years was the time fixed for 
 the continuance of <I>the desolations of Jerusalem.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The <I>book</I> by which he understood this was the book of the 
 prophecies of Jeremiah, in which he found it expressly foretold 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:10">Jer. xxix. 10</A>),

 <I>After seventy years be accomplished in Babylon</I> (and therefore
 they must be reckoned from the first captivity, in the <I>third 
 year</I> of Jehoiakim, which Daniel had reason to remember by a good 
 token, for it was in that captivity that he was carried away himself,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:1"><I>ch.</I> i. 1</A>),

 <I>I will visit you, and perform my good word towards you.</I> It was
 likewise said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:11">Jer. xxv. 11</A>),

 <I>This whole land shall be seventy years a desolation</I>
 (<I>chorbath</I>), the same word that Daniel here uses for the 
 <I>desolations of Jerusalem,</I> which shows that he had that prophecy 
 before him when he wrote this. Though Daniel was himself a great 
 prophet, and one that was well acquainted with the visions of God, yet 
 he was a diligent student in the scripture, and thought it no 
 disparagement to him to consult Jeremiah's prophecies. He was a great 
 politician, and prime-minister of state to one of the greatest monarchs 
 upon earth, and yet could find both heart and time to converse with the 
 word of God. The greatest and best men in the world must not think 
 themselves above their Bibles. 

 3. How serious and solemn his address to God was when he understood
 that the seventy years were just upon expiring (for it appears, by 
 Ezekiel's dating of his prophecies, that they exactly computed the 
 years of their captivity), then he <I>set his face to seek God by 
 prayer.</I> Note, God's promises are intended, not to supersede, but to 
 excite and encourage, our prayers; and, when we see the day of the 
 performance of them approaching, we should the more earnestly plead 
 them with God and put them in suit. So Daniel did here; he prayed three 
 times a day, and, no doubt, in every prayer made mention of the 
 desolations of Jerusalem; yet he did not think that enough, but even in 
 the midst of his business set time apart for an extraordinary 
 application to Heaven on Jerusalem's behalf. God had said to Ezekiel 
 that though Daniel, among others, stood before him, his intercession 
 should not prevail to prevent the judgment

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:14">Ezek. xiv. 14</A>),
 
 yet he hopes, now that <I>the warfare is accomplished</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:2">Isa. xl. 2</A>),
 
 his prayer may be heard for the removing of the judgment. When the day
 of deliverance dawns it is time for God's praying people to bestir 
 themselves; something extraordinary is then expected and required from 
 them, besides their daily sacrifice. Now <I>Daniel sought by prayer and 
 supplications,</I> for fear lest the sins of the people should provoke 
 him to defer their deliverance longer than was intended, or rather that 
 the people might be prepared by the grace of God for the deliverance 
 now that the providence of God was about to work it out for them. Now 
 observe, 

 (1.) The intenseness of his mind in this prayer; <I>I set my face unto
 the Lord God to seek him,</I> which denotes the fixedness of his 
 thoughts, the firmness of his faith, and the fervour of his devout 
 affections, in the duty. We must, in prayer, set God before us, an set 
 ourselves as in his presence; to him we must <I>direct our prayer</I> 
 and must <I>look up.</I> Probably, in token of his setting his face 
 towards God, he did, as usual, set his face towards Jerusalem, to 
 affect his own heart the more with the desolations of it.

 (2.) The mortification of his body in this prayer. In token of his deep
 humiliation before God for his own sins, and the sins of his people, 
 and the sense he had of his unworthiness, when he prayed he 
 <I>fasted,</I> put on <I>sackcloth,</I> and lay in <I>as hes,</I> the 
 more to affect himself with the desolations of Jerusalem, which he was 
 praying for the repair of, and to make himself sensible that he was now 
 about an extraordinary work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  And I prayed unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> my God, and made my confession,
 and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the
 covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep
 his commandments;
 &nbsp; 5  We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done
 wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts
 and from thy judgments:
 &nbsp; 6  Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets,
 which spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our
 fathers, and to all the people of the land.
 &nbsp; 7  O Lord, righteousness <I>belongeth</I> unto thee, but unto us
 confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to
 the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, <I>that are</I>
 near, and <I>that are</I> far off, through all the countries whither
 thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have
 trespassed against thee.
 &nbsp; 8  O Lord, to us <I>belongeth</I> confusion of face, to our kings, to
 our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against
 thee.
 &nbsp; 9  To the Lord our God <I>belong</I> mercies and forgivenesses,
 though we have rebelled against him;
 &nbsp; 10  Neither have we obeyed the voice of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God, to
 walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the
 prophets.
 &nbsp; 11  Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by
 departing, that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the
 curse is poured upon us, and the oath that <I>is</I> written in the
 law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against
 him.
 &nbsp; 12  And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us,
 and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a
 great evil: for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath
 been done upon Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 13  As <I>it is</I> written in the law of Moses, all this evil is
 come upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God,
 that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy truth.
 &nbsp; 14  Therefore hath the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> watched upon the evil, and brought
 it upon us: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God <I>is</I> righteous in all his works
 which he doeth: for we obeyed not his voice.
 &nbsp; 15  And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth
 out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee
 renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.
 &nbsp; 16  O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee,
 let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city
 Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the
 iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people <I>are become</I>
 a reproach to all <I>that are</I> about us.
 &nbsp; 17  Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant,
 and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy
 sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.
 &nbsp; 18  O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and
 behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name:
 for we do not present our supplications before thee for our
 righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.
 &nbsp; 19  O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer
 not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people
 are called by thy name.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Daniel's prayer to God as his God, and the confession 
 which he joined with that prayer: I <I>prayed, and made my 
 confession.</I> Note, In every prayer we must make confession, not only 
 of the sins we have been guilty of (which we commonly call 
 <I>confession</I>), but of our faith in God and dependence upon him, 
 our sorrow for sin and our resolutions against it. It must be our 
 confession, must be the language of our own convictions and that which 
 we ourselves do heartily subscribe to.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Let us go over the several parts of this prayer, which we have reason 
 to think that he offered up much more largely than is here recorded, 
 these being only the heads of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is his humble, serious, reverent address to God, 

 1. As a God to be feared, and whom it is our duty always to stand in
 awe of: "<I>O Lord! the great and dreadful God,</I> that art able to 
 deal with the greatest and most terrible of the church's enemies." 

 2. As a God to be trusted, and whom it is our duty to depend upon and
 put a confidence in: <I>Keeping the covenant and mercy to those that 
 love him,</I> and, as a proof of their love to him, <I>keep his 
 commandments.</I> If we fulfil our part of the bargain, he will not 
 fail to fulfil his. He will be to his people as good as his word, for 
 he keeps covenant with them, and not one iota of his promise shall fall 
 to the ground; nay, he will be better than his word, for he keeps mercy 
 to them, something more than was in the covenant. It was proper for 
 Daniel to have his eye upon God's mercy now that he was to lay before 
 him the miseries of his people, and upon God's covenant now that he was 
 to sue for the performance of a promise. Note, We should, in prayer, 
 look both at God's greatness and his goodness, his majesty and mercy in 
 conjunction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is a penitent confession of sin, the procuring cause of all 
 the calamities which his people had for so many years been groaning 
 under, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 When we seek to God for national mercies we ought to humble ourselves 
 before him for national sins. These are the sins Daniel here laments;
 and we may here observe the variety of words he makes use of to set 
 forth the greatness of their provocations (for it becomes penitents to 
 lay load upon themselves): <I>We have sinned</I> in many particular 
 instances, nay, <I>we have committed iniquity,</I> we have driven a 
 trade of sin, <I>we have done wickedly</I> with a hard heart and a 
 stiff neck, and herein we have <I>rebelled,</I> have taken up arms 
 against the King of kings, his crown and dignity. Two things aggravated 
 their sins:--

 1. That they had violated the express laws God had given them by Moses:
 "We have <I>departed from they precepts and from thy judgments,</I> and 
 have not conformed to them. And

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>)
 
 <I>we have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God.</I>" That which 
 speaks the nature of sin, that it is <I>the transgression of the 
 law,</I> does sufficiently speak the malignity of it; if sin be made to 
 <I>appear sin,</I> it cannot be made to appear worse; its 
 <I>sinfulness</I> is its greatest hatefulness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:13">Rom. vii. 13</A>.

 God has <I>set his laws before us</I> plainly and fully, as the copy we
 should write after, yet <I>we have not walked in</I> them, but turned 
 aside, or turned back.

 2. That they had slighted the fair warnings God had given them by the
 prophets, which in every age he had sent to them, <I>rising up betimes 
 and sending them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>We have not hearkened to thy servants the prophets,</I> who have 
 put us in mind of thy laws, and of the sanctions of them; though they 
 <I>spoke in thy name,</I> we have not regarded them; though they 
 delivered their message faithfully, with a universal respect to all 
 orders and degrees of men, to <I>our kings and princes,</I> whom they 
 had the courage and confidence to speak to, <I>to our fathers,</I> and 
 to all the <I>people of the land,</I> whom they had the condescension 
 and compassion to speak to, yet <I>we have not hearkened to them,</I> 
 nor heard them, or not heeded them, or not complied with them." Mocking 
 God's messengers, and despising his words, were Jerusalem's 
 measure-filling sins, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:16">2 Chron. xxxvi. 16</A>.

 This confession of sin is repeated here, and much insisted on;
 penitents should again and again accuse and reproach themselves till 
 they find their hearts thoroughly broken. <I>All Israel have
 transgressed thy law,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 It is <I>Israel,</I> God's professing people, who have known better, 
 and from whom better is expected--Israel, God's peculiar people, whom 
 he has surrounded with his favours; not here and there one, but it is 
 <I>all</I> Israel, the generality of them, the body of the people, that 
 <I>have transgressed by departing</I> and getting out of the way, 
 <I>that they might not</I> hear, and so might not <I>obey, thy 
 voice.</I> This disobedience is that which all true penitents do most 
 sensibly charge upon themselves

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>We obeyed not his voice, and</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 <I>we have sinned, we have done wickedly.</I> Those that would find 
 mercy must thus confess their sins.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is a self-abasing acknowledgment of the righteousness of God 
 in all the judgments that were brought upon them; and it is evermore 
 the way of true penitents thus to justify God, that he may be clear 
 when he judges, and the sinner may bear all the blame. 

 1. He acknowledges that it was sin that plunged them in all these
 troubles. Israel is <I>dispersed</I> through <I>all the countries</I>
 about, and so weakened, impoverished, and exposed. God's hand has 
 <I>driven them</I> hither and thither, some <I>near,</I> where they are 
 known and therefore the more ashamed, others <I>afar off,</I> where 
 they are not known and therefore the more abandoned, and it is 
 <I>because of their trespass that they have trespassed</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 they mingled themselves with the nations that they might be debauched 
 by them, and now God mingles them with the nations that they might be 
 stripped by them. 

 2. He owns the righteousness of God in it, that he had done them no
 wrong in all he had brought upon them, but had dealt with them as they 
 deserved

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "<I>O Lord! righteousness belongs to thee;</I> we have no fault to find 
 with thy providence, no exceptions to make against thy judgments, for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)

 <I>the Lord our God is righteous in all his works which he does,</I> 
 even in the sore calamities we are now under, for <I>we obeyed not the 
 words</I> of his mouth, and therefore justly feel the weight of his 
 hand." This seems to be borrowed from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+1:18">Lam. i. 18</A>.

 3. He takes notice of the fulfilling of the scripture in what was
 brought upon them. <I>In very faithfulness he afflicted them;</I> for 
 it was according to the word which he had spoken. <I>The curse is 
 poured upon us and the oath,</I> that is, the curse that was ratified 
 by an oath in the law of Moses,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 This further justifies God in their troubles, that he did but inflict 
 the penalty of the law, which he had given them fair notice of. It was 
 necessary for the preserving of the honour of God's veracity, and 
 saving his government from contempt, that the threatenings of his word 
 should be accomplished, otherwise they look but as bugbears, nay, they 
 seem not at all frightful. Therefore <I>he has confirmed his words 
 which spoke against us</I> because we broke his laws, <I>and against 
 our judges that judged us</I> because they did not according to the 
 duty of their place punish the breach of God's laws. He told them many
 a time that if they did not execute justice, as terrors to 
 evil-workers, he must and would take the work into his own hands; and 
 now he has <I>confirmed</I> what he said <I>by bringing upon us a great 
 evil,</I> in which the princes and judges themselves deeply shared.
 Note, It contributes very much to our profiting by the <I>judgments of 
 God's hand</I> to observe how exactly they agree with the <I>judgments 
 of his mouth.</I> 

 4. He aggravates the calamities they were in, lest they should seem,
 having been long used to them, to make light of them, and so to lose 
 the benefit of the chastening of the Lord by despising it. "It is not 
 some of the common troubles of life that we are complaining of, but 
 that which has in it some special marks of divine displeasure; for 
 <I>under the whole heaven has not been done as has been done upon 
 Jerusalem,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 It is Jeremiah's lamentation in the name of the church, <I>Was ever 
 sorrow like unto my sorrow?</I> which must suppose another similar 
 question, <I>Was ever sin like unto my sin?</I> 

 5. He puts shame upon the whole nation, from the highest to the lowest;
 and if they will say <I>Amen</I> to his prayer, as it was fit they 
 should if they would come in for a share in the benefit of it, they 
 must all put their hand upon their mouth, and their mouth in the dust: 
 "<I>To us belongs confusion of faces as at this day</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);
 
 we lie under the shame of the punishment of our iniquity, for shame is 
 our due." If Israel had retained their character, and had continued a 
 holy people, they would have been <I>high above all nations in praise, 
 and mane, and honour</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+26:19">Deut. xxvi. 19</A>);

 but now that they have <I>sinned and done wickedly</I> confusion and
 disgrace belong to them, to <I>the men of Judah and the inhabitants of 
 Jerusalem,</I> the inhabitants both of the country and of the city, for 
 they have been all alike guilty before God; it belongs to <I>all 
 Israel,</I> both to the two tribes, <I>that are near,</I> by the rivers 
 of Babylon, and to the ten tribes, <I>that are afar off,</I> in the 
 land of Assyria. "Confusion belongs not only to the common people of
 our land, but to <I>our kings, our princes,</I> and <I>our fathers</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 who should have set a better example, and have used their authority and 
 influence for the checking of the threatening torrent of vice 
 profaneness." 

 6. He imputes the continuance of the judgment to their incorrigibleness
 under it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>):

 <I>"All this evil has come upon us,</I> and has lain long upon us, 
 <I>yet made we not our prayer before the Lord our God,</I> not in a 
 right manner, as we should have made it, <I>with a humble, lowly, 
 penitent, and obedient heart.</I> We have been smitten, but have not 
 returned to him that smote us. <I>We have not entreated the face of the 
 Lord our God</I>" (so the word is); "we have taken no care to make our 
 peace with God and reconcile ourselves to him." Daniel set his brethren 
 a good example of praying continually, but he was sorry to see how few 
 there were that followed his example; in their <I>affliction</I> it was 
 expected that they would <I>seek God early,</I> but they sought him 
 not, that they might <I>turn from their iniquities</I> and 
 <I>understand his truth.</I> The errand upon which afflictions are sent 
 is to bring men to <I>turn from their iniquities</I> and to 
 <I>understand God's truth;</I> so Elihu had explained them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:10">Job xxxvi. 10</A>.
 
 God by them <I>opens men's ears to discipline</I> and <I>commands that
 they return from iniquity.</I> And if men were brought rightly to 
 <I>understand God's truth,</I> and to submit to the power and authority 
 of it, they would turn from the error of their ways. Now the first step 
 towards this is to <I>make our prayer before the Lord our God,</I> that 
 the affliction may be sanctified before it is removed, and that the 
 grace of God may go along with the providence of God, to make it answer 
 the end. Those who in their affliction <I>make not their prayer to 
 God,</I> who <I>cry not when he binds them,</I> are not likely to 
 <I>turn from iniquity</I> or to <I>understand his truth. 
 "Therefore,</I> because we have not improved the affliction, <I>the 
 Lord has watched upon the evil,</I> as the judge takes care that 
 execution be done according to the sentence. Because we have not been
 melted, he has kept us still in the furnace, and <I>watched over 
 it,</I> to make the heat yet more intense;" for when God judges he will 
 overcome, and will be justified in all his proceedings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Here is a believing appeal to the mercy of God, and to the ancient 
 tokens of his favour to Israel, and the concern of his own glory in 
 their interests. 

 1. It is some comfort to them (and not a little) that God has been
 always ready to pardon sin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgiveness;</I> this refers 
 to that proclamation of his name, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:6,7">Exod. xxxiv. 6, 7</A>,

 <I>The Lord God, gracious and merciful, forgiving iniquity.</I> Note, 
 It is very encouraging to poor sinners to recollect that <I>mercies 
 belong to God,</I> as it is convincing and humbling to them to 
 recollect that righteousness belongs to him; and those who give him the 
 glory of his righteousness may take to themselves the comfort of his 
 mercies,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:12">Ps. lxii. 12</A>.

 There are abundant mercies in God, and not only forgiveness but
 <I>forgivenesses;</I> he is a <I>God of pardons</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:17">Neh. ix. 17</A>,

 marg.); he <I>multiplies to pardon,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:7">Isa. lv. 7</A>.

 <I>Though we have rebelled against him,</I> yet with him there is
 mercy, pardoning mercy, even <I>for the rebellious.</I>

 2. It is likewise a support to them to think that God had formerly
 glorified himself by delivering them out of Egypt; so far he looks back 
 for the encouragement of his faith

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):
 
 "<I>Thou hast</I> formerly <I>brought thy people out of Egypt with a 
 mighty hand,</I> and wilt thou not now with the same mighty hand bring 
 them out of Babylon? Were they then formed into a people, and shall 
 they not now be reformed and new-formed? Are they now sinful and 
 unworthy, and were they not so then? Are their oppressors now mighty 
 and haughty, and were they not so then? And has not God said the their 
 deliverance out of Babylon shall outshine even that out of Egypt?" 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:14,15">Jer. xvi. 14, 15</A>.

 The force of this plea lies in that, "<I>Thou hast gotten thyself
 renown,</I> hast <I>made thyself a name</I>" (so the word is) "<I>as at 
 this day,</I> even to this day, by bringing us out of Egypt; and wilt 
 thou lose the credit of that by letting us perish in Babylon? Didst
 thou get a renown by that deliverance which we have so often 
 commemorated, and wilt thou not now get thyself a renown by this which 
 we have so often prayed for, and so long waited for?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Here is a pathetic complaint of the reproach that God's people lay 
 under, and the ruins that God's sanctuary lay in, both which redounded 
 very much to the dishonour of God and the diminution of that name and 
 renown which God had gained by bringing them out of Egypt. 

 1. God's holy people were despised. By <I>their sins and the iniquities
 of their fathers</I> they had profaned their crown and made themselves 
 despicable, and then though they are, in name and profession, God's 
 people, and upon that account truly great and honourable, yet they 
 become <I>a reproach to all that are round about them.</I> Their 
 neighbours laugh them to scorn, and triumph in their disgrace. Note, 
 <I>Sin is a reproach to any people,</I> but especially to God's people, 
 that have more eyes upon them and have more honour to lose than other 
 people. 

 2. God's holy place was desolate. Jerusalem, the holy city, was a 
 reproach

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 when it lay in ruins; it was an <I>astonishment</I> and a hissing to 
 all that passed by. The sanctuary, the holy house, was desolate 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 the altars were demolished, and all the buildings laid in ashes. Note,
 The desolations of the sanctuary are the grief of all the saints, who 
 reckon all their comforts in this world buried in the ruins of the 
 sanctuary.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Here is an importunate request to God for the restoring of the poor 
 captive Jews to their former enjoyments again. The petition is very 
 pressing, for God gives us leave in prayer to wrestle with him: "<I>O 
 Lord! I beseech thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 If ever thou wilt do any thing for me, do this; it is my heart's desire 
 and prayer. <I>Now therefore, O our God! hear the prayer of thy servant 
 and his supplication</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),
 
 and grant an answer of peace." Now what are his petitions? What are his 
 requests? 

 1. That God would turn away his wrath from them; that is it which all
 the saints dread and deprecate more than any thing: O let <I>thy anger 
 be turned away from thy Jerusalem, thy holy mountain!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 He does not pray for the turning again of their captivity (let the Lord 
 do with them as seems good in his eyes), but he prays first for the 
 <I>turning away of God's wrath.</I> Take away the cause, and the effect 
 will cease. 

 2. That he would lift up the light of his countenance upon them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 "<I>Cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate;</I> 
 return in thy mercy to us, and show that thou art reconciled to us, and 
 then all shall be well." Note, The shining of God's face upon the 
 desolations of the sanctuary is all in all towards the repair of it; 
 and upon that foundation it must be rebuilt. If therefore its friends 
 would begin their work at the right end, they must first be earnest 
 with God in prayer for his favour, and recommend his desolate sanctuary 
 to his smiles. <I>Cause thy face to shine</I> and then <I>we shall be 
 saved,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:3">Ps. lxxx. 3</A>.

 3. That he would forgive their sins, and then hasten their deliverance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>O Lord! hear; O Lord! forgive.</I> "That the mercy prayed for may be 
 granted in mercy, let the sin that threatens to come between us and it 
 be removed: <I>O Lord! hearken and do,</I> not hearken and speak only, 
 but hearken and do; do that for us which none else can, and that 
 speedily--<I>defer not, O my God!</I>" Now that he saw the appointed 
 day approaching he could in faith pray that God would make haste to 
 them and not defer. David often prays, <I>Make haste, O God! to help
 me.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. Here are several pleas and arguments to enforce the petitions. God 
 gives us leave not only to pray, but to plead with him, which is not to 
 move him (he himself knows what he will do), but to move ourselves, to 
 excite our fervency and encourage our faith. 

 1. They disdain a dependence upon any righteousness of their own; they
 pretend not to merit any thing at God's hand but wrath and the curse

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "<I>We do not present our supplications before thee</I> with hope to 
 speed <I>for our righteousness,</I> as if we were worthy to receive thy 
 favour for any good in us, or done by us, or could demand any thing as 
 a debt; we cannot insist upon our own justification, no, though we were 
 more righteous than we are; nay, though we knew nothing amiss of 
 ourselves, yet are we not thereby justified, nor <I>would we 
 answer,</I> but we would <I>make supplication to our Judge.</I>" Moses 
 had told Israel long before that, whatever God did for them, it was 
 <I>not for their righteousness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:4,5">Deut. ix. 4, 5</A>.

 And Ezekiel had of late told them that their return out of Babylon
 would be <I>not for their sakes,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:22,32">Ezek. xxxvi. 22, 32</A>.

 Note, Whenever we come to God for mercy we must lay aside all conceit
 of, and confidence in, our own righteousness. 

 2. They take their encouragement in prayer from God only, as knowing 
 that his reasons of mercy are fetched from within himself, and 
 therefore from him we must borrow all our pleas for mercy, and so give 
 honour to him when we are suing for grace and mercy from him.

 (1.) "Do it <I>for thy own sake</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 for the accomplishment of thy own counsel, the performance of thy own
 promise, and the manifestation of thy own glory." Note, God will do his 
 own work, not only in his own way and time, but for his own sake, and 
 so we must take it. 

 (2.) "Do it <I>for the Lord's sake,</I> that is, for the Lord Christ's
 sake," for the sake of the Messiah promised, who is the Lord (so the 
 most and best of our Christian interpreters understand it), <I>for the 
 sake of Adonai,</I> so David called the Messiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:1">Ps. cx. 1</A>),

 and mercy is prayed for for the church for the sake of the <I>Son of
 man</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:17">Ps. lxxx. 17</A>),

 and <I>for thy Word's sake,</I> he is Lord of all. It is for his sake
 that God causes his face to shine upon sinners when they repent and 
 turn to him, because of the satisfaction he has made. In all our 
 prayers that therefore must be our plea; we must <I>make mention of his 
 righteousness, even of his only,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:16">Ps. lxxi. 16</A>.

 <I>Look upon the face of the anointed.</I> He has himself directed us
 to <I>ask in his name.</I>

 (3.) "Do it <I>according to all thy righteousness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 that is, plead for us against our persecutors and oppressors 
 <I>according to thy righteousness.</I> Though we are ourselves 
 unrighteous before God, yet with reference to them we have a righteous 
 cause, which we leave it with the righteous God to appear in the 
 defence of." Or, rather, by the <I>righteousness of God</I> here is 
 meant his faithfulness to his promise. God had, <I>according to his 
 righteousness,</I> executed the threatening, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 "Now, Lord, wilt thou not do according to <I>all</I> thy righteousness?
 Wilt thou not be as true to thy promises as thou hast been to thy 
 threatenings and accomplish them also?" 

 (4.) "Do it <I>for thy great mercies</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 to make it to appear that thou art a merciful God." The good things we 
 ask of God we call <I>mercies,</I> because we expect them purely from 
 God's mercy. And, because misery is the proper object of mercy, the 
 prophet here spreads the deplorable condition of the church before God, 
 as it were to move his compassion: "<I>Open thy eyes and behold our 
 desolations,</I> especially the desolations of the sanctuary. O look 
 with pity upon a pitiable case!" Note, The desolations of the church 
 must in prayer be laid before God and then left with him. 

 (5.) "Do it for the sake of the relation we stand in to thee. The
 sanctuary that is desolate is thy sanctuary

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 dedicated to thy honour, employed in thy service, and the place of thy 
 residence. Jerusalem is <I>thy</I> city and <I>thy holy mountain</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);

 it is <I>the city which is called by thy name,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 It was the city which God had <I>chosen out of all the tribes of 
 Israel, to put his name there.</I> "The people that have <I>become a 
 reproach</I> are <I>thy people,</I> and thy name suffers in the 
 reproach cast upon them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);

 they are <I>called by thy name,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Lord, thou hast a property in them, and therefore art interested in 
 their interests; wilt thou not provide for thy own, for those of thy 
 own house? They are <I>thine, save them,</I>"

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  And whiles I <I>was</I> speaking, and praying, and confessing my
 sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my
 supplication before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> my God for the holy mountain of my
 God;
 &nbsp; 21  Yea, whiles I <I>was</I> speaking in prayer, even the man
 Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being
 caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening
 oblation.
 &nbsp; 22  And he informed <I>me,</I> and talked with me, and said, O
 Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding.
 &nbsp; 23  At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came
 forth, and I am come to show <I>thee;</I> for thou <I>art</I> greatly
 beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the
 vision.
 &nbsp; 24  Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy
 holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of
 sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in
 everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and
 prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.
 &nbsp; 25  Know therefore and understand, <I>that</I> from the going forth
 of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the
 Messiah the Prince <I>shall be</I> seven weeks, and threescore and two
 weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in
 troublous times.
 &nbsp; 26  And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off,
 but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come
 shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof
 <I>shall be</I> with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations
 are determined.
 &nbsp; 27  And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week:
 and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the
 oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he
 shall make <I>it</I> desolate, even until the consummation, and that
 determined shall be poured upon the desolate.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the answer that was immediately sent to Daniel's prayer, 
 and it is a very memorable one, as it contains the most illustrious 
 prediction of Christ and gospel-grace that is extant in all the <I>Old 
 Testament.</I> If John Baptist was the morning-star, this was the 
 day-break to the Sun of righteousness, the <I>day-spring from on 
 high.</I> Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The time when this answer was given.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It was while Daniel was at prayer. This he observed and laid a 
 strong emphasis upon: <I>While I was speaking</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 yea, <I>while I was speaking in prayer</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 before he rose from his knees, and while there was yet more which he 
 intended to say.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He mentions the two heads he chiefly insisted upon in prayer, and 
 which perhaps he designed yet further to enlarge upon. 

 [1.] He was confessing sin and lamenting that--"both <I>my sin and the 
 sin of my people Israel.</I>" Daniel was a very great and good man, and 
 yet he finds sin of his own to confess before God and is ready to 
 confess it; for there is not a <I>just man upon earth that does good 
 and sins not,</I> nor that sins and repents not. St. John puts himself 
 into the number of those who deceive themselves if they say that they 
 <I>have no sin,</I> and who therefore <I>confess their sins,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:8">1 John i. 8</A>.

 Good men find it an ease to their consciences to pour out their
 complaints before the Lord against themselves; and that is 
 <I>confessing sin.</I> He also confessed the <I>sin of his people,</I> 
 and bewailed that. Those who are heartily concerned for the glory of
 God, the welfare of the church, and the souls of men, will mourn for 
 the sins of others as well as for their own.

 [2.] He was <I>making supplication before the Lord his God,</I> and 
 presenting it to him as an intercessor for Israel; and in this prayer 
 his concern was for <I>the holy mountain of his God,</I> Mount Zion. 
 The desolations of the sanctuary lay nearer his heart than those of the 
 city and the land; and the repair of that, and the setting up of the 
 public worship of God of Israel again, were the things he had in view, 
 in the deliverance he was preparing for, more than re-establishment of 
 their civil interests. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) While Daniel was thus employed, 

 [1.] He had a grant made him of the mercy he prayed for. Note, God is 
 very ready to hear prayer and to give an answer of peace. Now was 
 fulfilled what God had spoken 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:24">Isa. lxv. 24</A>,

 <I>While they are yet speaking, I will hear.</I> Daniel grew very
 fervent in prayer, and his affections were very strong,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 And, <I>while he was speaking</I> with such fervour and ardency, the 
 angel came to him with a gracious answer. God is well pleased with 
 lively devotions. We cannot now expect that God should send us answers 
 to our prayer by angels, but, if we pray with fervency for that which 
 God has promised, we may by faith take the promise as an immediate 
 answer to the prayer; for <I>he is faithful that has promised.</I> 

 [2.] He had a discovery made to him of a far greater and more glorious 
 redemption which God would work out for his church in the latter days.
 Note, Those that would be brought acquainted with Christ and his grace 
 must be <I>much in prayer.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It was <I>about the time of the evening oblation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 The altar was in ruins, and there was no oblation offered upon it, but, 
 it should seem, the pious Jews in their captivity were daily thoughtful 
 of the time when it should have been offered, and at that hour were 
 ready to weep at the remembrance of it, and desired and hoped that 
 their prayer should be <I>set forth before God as incense,</I> and the 
 <I>lifting up of their hands,</I> and their hearts with their hands, 
 should be acceptable in his sight <I>as the evening-sacrifice,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:2">Ps. cxli. 2</A>.

 The evening oblation was a type of the great sacrifice which Christ was 
 to offer in the evening of the world, and it was in the virtue of that 
 sacrifice that Daniel's prayer was accepted when he prayed <I>for the 
 Lord's sake;</I> and for the sake of that this glorious discovery of 
 redeeming love was made to him. The Lamb <I>opened the seals</I> in the 
 virtue of his own blood.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The messenger by whom this answer was sent. It was not given him in 
 a dream, nor by a voice from heaven, but, for the greater certainty and 
 solemnity of it, an angel was sent on purpose, appearing in a human 
 shape, to give this answer to Daniel. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Who this angel, or messenger, was; it was <I>the man Gabriel.</I> If 
 Michael the archangel be, as many suppose, no other than Jesus Christ, 
 this Gabriel is the only created angel that is named in scripture. 
 Gabriel signifies the <I>mighty one of God;</I> for the angels are 
 <I>great in power and might,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:11">2 Pet. ii. 11</A>.

 It was he <I>whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning.</I> Daniel
 heard him called by his name, and thence learned it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:16">Dan. viii. 16</A>);

 and, though then he trembled at his approach, yet he observed him so
 carefully that now he knew him again, knew him to be the same that he 
 had seen at the beginning, and, being somewhat better acquainted with 
 him, was not now so terrified at the sight of him as he had been at 
 first. When this angel said to <I>Zacharias, I am Gabriel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:19">Luke i. 19</A>),

 he intended thereby to put him in mind of this notice which he had
 given to Daniel of the Messiah's coming when it was at a distance, for 
 the confirming of his faith in the notice he was then about to give of 
 it as at the door.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The instructions which this messenger received from the Father of 
 lights to whom Daniel prayed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>At the beginning of thy supplications</I> the word, <I>the 
 commandment, came forth</I> from God. Notice was given to the angels in 
 heaven of this counsel of God, which they were desirous to look into; 
 and orders were given to Gabriel to go immediately and bring the notice 
 of it to Daniel. By this it appears that it was not any thing which 
 Daniel said that moved God, for the answer was given as he began to 
 pray; but God was well pleased with his serious solemn address to the 
 duty, and, in token of that, sent him this gracious message. Or perhaps 
 it was <I>at the beginning of Daniel's supplications</I> that 
 <I>Cyrus's word,</I> or <I>commandment, went forth to restore and to 
 build Jerusalem,</I> that going forth spoken of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 "The thing was done <I>this very day;</I> the proclamation of liberty 
 to the Jews was signed this morning, just when thou wast praying for 
 it;" and now, at the close of this fast-day, Daniel had notice of it, 
 as, at the close of the <I>day of atonement,</I> the jubilee-trumpet 
 sounded to proclaim liberty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The haste he made to deliver his message: He was <I>caused to fly 
 swiftly,</I>

 Angels are winged messengers, quick in their motions, and delay not to 
 execute the orders they receive; they run and <I>return like a flash of 
 lightning,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:14">Ezek. i. 14</A>.

 But, it should seem, sometimes they are more expeditious than at other
 times, and make a quicker despatch, as here the angel was <I>caused to 
 fly swiftly;</I> that is, he was ordered and he was enabled to fly 
 swiftly. Angels do their work in obedience to divine command and in 
 dependence upon divine strength. Though they excel in wisdom, they fly 
 swifter or slower as God directs; and, though they excel in power, they 
 fly but as God causes them to fly. Angels themselves are to us what he 
 makes them to be; they are <I>his ministers,</I> and <I>do his 
 pleasure,</I>

 4. The prefaces or introductions to his message. 

 (1.) He <I>touched him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),
 
 as before
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:18"><I>ch.</I> viii. 18</A>),

 not to awaken him out of sleep as then, but to give him a hint to break
 off his prayer and to attend to that which he has to say in answer to 
 it. Note, In order to the keeping up of our communion with God we must
 not only be forward to speak to God, but as forward to hear what he has 
 to say to us; when we have prayed we must look up, must look after our 
 prayers, must set ourselves upon our watch-tower. 

 (2.) He <I>talked with him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 talked familiarly with him, as one friend talks with another, that 
 <I>his terror might not make him afraid.</I> He informed him on what 
 errand he came, that he was sent from heaven on purpose with a kind 
 message to him: "<I>I have come to show thee</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 to tell thee that which thou didst not know before." He had shown him 
 the troubles of the church under Antiochus, and the period of those 
 troubles

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:19"><I>ch.</I> viii. 19</A>);

 but now he has greater things to show him, for he that is faithful in a
 little shall be entrusted with more. "Nay, <I>I have now come forth to 
 give thee skill and understanding</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 not only to show thee these things, but to <I>make thee understand</I> 
 them." 

 (3.) He assured him that he was a favourite of Heaven, else he would 
 not have had this intelligence sent him, and he must take it for a 
 favour: "<I>I have come to show thee, for thou art greatly beloved.</I> 
 Thou art <I>a man of desires,</I> acceptable to God, and whom he has a 
 favour for." Note, Though God loves all his children, yet there are 
 some that are more than the rest <I>greatly beloved.</I> Christ had one 
 disciple that lay in his bosom; and that <I>beloved disciple</I> was he 
 that was entrusted with the prophetical visions of the New Testament, 
 as Daniel was with those of the Old. For what greater token can there 
 be of God's favour to any man than for the secrets of the Lord to be 
 with him? Abraham is the <I>friend of God;</I> and therefore <I>Shall
 I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:17">Gen. xviii. 17</A>.

 Note, Those may reckon themselves greatly beloved of God to whom, and
 in whom, he <I>reveals his Son.</I> Some observe that the title which 
 this angel Gabriel gives to the Virgin Mary is much the same with this 
 which he here gives to Daniel, as if he designed to put her in mind of 
 it--<I>Thou that art highly favoured;</I> as Daniel, <I>greatly 
 beloved.</I>

 (4.) He demands his serious attention to the discovery he was now about
 to make to him: <I>Therefore understand the matter, and consider the 
 vision,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.
 
 This intimates that it was a thing well worthy of his regard, above any 
 of the visions he had been before favoured with. Note, Those who would 
 understand the things of God must consider them, must apply their minds 
 to them, ponder upon them, and compare spiritual things with spiritual.
 The reason why we are so much in the dark concerning the revealed will 
 of God, and mistake concerning it, is want of consideration. This 
 vision both requires and deserves consideration.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The message itself. It was delivered with great solemnity, 
 received no doubt with great attention, and recorded with great 
 exactness; but in it, as is usual in prophecies, there are things dark 
 and hard to be understood. Daniel, who understood by the book of the 
 prophet Jeremiah the expiration of the seventy years of the captivity, 
 is now honourably employed to make known to the church another more 
 glorious release, which that was but a shadow of, at the end of another 
 seventy, not years, but weeks of years. He prayed over that prophecy, 
 and received this in answer to that prayer. He had prayed for <I>his 
 people</I> and the <I>holy city</I>--that <I>they</I> might be released,
 that <I>it</I> might be rebuilt; but God answers him <I>above what he 
 was able to ask or think.</I> God not only grants, but outdoes, the 
 desires of those that fear him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:4">Ps. xxi. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The times here determined are somewhat hard to be understood. In 
 general, it is <I>seventy weeks,</I> that is, <I>seventy times seven 
 years,</I> which makes just 490 years. The great affairs that are yet 
 to come concerning the people of Israel, and the city of Jerusalem, 
 will lie within the compass of these years.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) These years are thus described by weeks, 

 [1.] In conformity to the prophetic style, which is, for the most part, 
 abstruse, and out of the common road of speaking, that the things 
 foretold might not lie too obvious. 

 [2.] To put an honour upon the division of time into weeks, which is 
 made purely by the sabbath day, and to signify that that should be 
 perpetual. 

 [3.] With reference to the seventy years of the captivity; as they had 
 been so long kept out of the possession of their own land, so, being 
 now restored to it they should seven times as long be kept in the 
 possession of it. So much more does God delight in showing mercy than 
 in punishing. The land had <I>enjoyed its sabbaths,</I> in a melancholy 
 sense, seventy years,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:34">Lev. xxvi. 34</A>.

 But now the people of the Lord shall, in a comfortable sense, enjoy 
 their sabbaths seven times seventy years, and in them seventy 
 sabbatical years, which makes ten jubilees. Such proportions are there 
 in the disposals of Providence, that we might see and admire the wisdom 
 of him who has <I>determined the times before appointed.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The difficulties that arise about these seventy weeks are, 

 [1.] Concerning the time when they commence and whence they are to be 
 reckoned. They are here dated <I>from the going forth of the 
 commandments to restore and to build Jerusalem,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 I should most incline to understand this of the edict of Cyrus 
 mentioned 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:1">Ezra i. 1</A>,

 for by it the people were <I>restored;</I> and, though express mention 
 be not made there of the building of Jerusalem, yet that is supposed in 
 the building of the temple, and was foretold to be done by Cyrus,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:28">Isa. xliv. 28</A>.

 He shall <I>say to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built.</I> That was, both
 in prophecy and in history, the most famous decree for the building of 
 Jerusalem; nay, it should seem, this <I>going forth of the 
 commandment</I> (which may as well be meant of God's command concerning 
 it as of Cyrus's) is the same with that going forth of the commandment 
 mentioned

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>,

 which was <I>at the beginning of Daniel's supplications.</I> And it 
 looks very graceful that the seventy weeks should begin immediately 
 upon the expiration of the seventy years. And there is nothing to be 
 objected against this but that by this reckoning the <I>Persian 
 monarchy,</I> from the taking of Babylon by Cyrus to Alexander's 
 conquest of Darius, lasted but 130 years; whereas, by the particular 
 account given of the reigns of the Persian emperors, it is computed 
 that it continued 230 years. So Thucydides, Xenophon, and others 
 reckon. Those who fix it to that first edict set aside these
 computations of the heathen historians as uncertain and not to be 
 relied upon. But others, willing to reconcile them, begin the 490 
 years, not at the edict of Cyrus 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:1">Ezra i. 1</A>),

 but at the second edict for the building of Jerusalem, issued out by
 Darius Nothus above 100 years after, mentioned 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:1-12">Ezra vi.</A>

 Others fix on the seventh year of Artaxerxes Mnemon, who sent Ezra with
 a commission,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:8-12">Ezra vii. 8-12</A>.

 The learned Mr. Poole, in his Latin Synopsis, has a vast and most
 elaborate collection of what has been said, <I>pro</I> and <I>con,</I> 
 concerning the different beginnings of these weeks, with which the 
 learned may entertain themselves.

 [2.] Concerning the termination of them; and here likewise interpreters 
 are not agreed. Some make them to end at the death of Christ, and
 think the express words of this famous prophecy will warrant us to 
 conclude that from this very hour when Gabriel spoke to Daniel, at the 
 time of the evening oblation, to the hour when Christ died, which was 
 towards evening too, it was exactly 490 years; and I am willing enough 
 to be of that opinion. But others think, because it is said that <I>in 
 the midst of the weeks</I> (that is, the last of the seventy weeks) he 
 <I>shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease,</I> they end 
 <I>three years and a half</I> after the death of Christ, when the Jews 
 having rejected the gospel, the apostles turned to the Gentiles. But 
 those who make them to end precisely at the death of Christ read it 
 thus, "He shall <I>make strong the testament to the many; the last 
 seven,</I> or the last week, yea, <I>half that seven,</I> or <I>half 
 that week</I> (namely, the latter half, the three years and a half 
 which Christ spent in his public ministry), shall bring to an end 
 sacrifice and oblation." Others make these 490 years to end with the 
 destruction of Jerusalem, about thirty-seven years after the death of 
 Christ, because these seventy weeks are said to be <I>determined upon 
 the people</I> of the Jews <I>and the holy city;</I> and much is said 
 here concerning the destruction of the city and the sanctuary. 

 [3.] Concerning the division of them into seven weeks, and sixty-two 
 weeks, and one week; and the reason of this is as hard to account for 
 as any thing else. In the first seven weeks, or forty-nine years, the 
 temple and city were built; and in the last single week Christ preached 
 his gospel, by which the Jewish economy was taken down, and the 
 foundations were laid of the gospel city and temple, which were to be 
 built upon the ruins of the former.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) But, whatever uncertainty we may labour under concerning the exact 
 fixing of these times, there is enough clear and certain to answer the 
 two great ends of determining them. 

 [1.] It did serve them to raise and support the expectations of 
 believers. There were general promises of the coming of the Messiah 
 made to the patriarchs; the preceding prophets had often spoken of him 
 as <I>one that should come,</I> but never was the time fixed for his 
 coming until now. And, though there might be so much doubt concerning 
 the date of this reckoning that they could not ascertain the time just 
 to a year, yet by the light of this prophecy they were directed about 
 what time to expect him. And we find, accordingly, that when Christ 
 came he was generally <I>looked for</I> as the <I>consolation of 
 Israel,</I> and <I>redemption in Jerusalem</I> by him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:25,38">Luke ii. 25, 38</A>.
 
 There were those that for this reason thought the <I>kingdom of God
 should immediately appear</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:11">Luke xix. 11</A>),

 and some think it was this that brought a more than ordinary concourse
 of people to Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:5">Acts ii. 5</A>.

 [2.] It does serve still to refute and silence the expectations of 
 unbelievers, who will not own that Jesus is he who <I>should come,</I> 
 but still <I>look for another.</I> This prediction should silence them, 
 and will condemn them; for, reckon these seventy weeks from which of 
 the commandments to build Jerusalem we please, it is certain that they 
 have expired above 1500 years ago; so that the Jews are for ever 
 <I>without excuse,</I> who will not own that the Messiah has come when 
 they have gone so far beyond their utmost reckoning for his coming. But 
 by this we are confirmed in our belief of the Messiah's being come, and 
 that our Jesus is he, that he came just at the time prefixed, a time 
 worthy to be had in everlasting remembrance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The events here foretold are more plain and easy to be understood, 
 at least to us now. Observe what is here foretold,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Concerning the return of the Jews now speedily to their own land, 
 and their settlement again there, which was the thing that Daniel now 
 principally prayed for; and yet it is but briefly touched upon here in 
 the answer to his prayer. Let this be a comfort to the pious Jews, that 
 a <I>commandment</I> shall <I>go forth to restore and to build 
 Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 And the commandment shall not be in vain; for though the times will be 
 very troublous, and this good work will meet with great opposition, yet 
 it shall be carried on, and brought to perfection at last. The 
 <I>street</I> shall be <I>built again,</I> as spacious and splendid as 
 ever it was, and <I>the walls, even in troublous times.</I> Note, as 
 long as we are here in this world we must expect <I>troublous 
 times,</I> upon some account or other. Even when we have <I>joyous 
 times</I> we must rejoice with trembling; it is but a gleam, it is but 
 a lucid interval of peace and prosperity; the clouds will <I>return 
 after the rain.</I> When the Jews are restored in triumph to their own 
 land, yet there they must expect troublous times, and prepare for them. 
 But this is our comfort, that God will carry on his own work, will 
 build up his Jerusalem, will beautify it, will fortify it, <I>even in 
 troublous times;</I> nay, the troublousness of the times may by the 
 grace of God contribute to the advancement of the church. The more it 
 is afflicted the more it multiplies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Concerning the Messiah and his undertaking. The carnal Jews looked 
 for a Messiah that could deliver them from the Roman yoke and give them 
 temporal power and wealth, whereas they were here told that the Messiah 
 should come upon another errand, purely spiritual, and upon the account 
 of which he should be the more welcome. 

 [1.] Christ came to <I>take away sin,</I> and to abolish that. Sin had 
 made a quarrel between God and man, had alienated men from God and 
 provoked God against man; it was this that put dishonour upon God and 
 brought misery upon mankind; this was the great mischief-maker. He that 
 would do God a real service, and man a real kindness, must be the 
 destruction of this. Christ undertakes to be so, and <I>for this 
 purpose</I> he is <I>manifested, to destroy the works of the devil.</I> 
 He does not say to <I>finish your</I> transgressions and your sins, but 
 <I>transgression</I> and <I>sin</I> in general, for he is the 
 propitiation not only for <I>our sins,</I> that are Jews, but <I>for 
 the sins of the whole world.</I> He came, <I>First,</I> To <I>finish 
 transgression,</I> to <I>restrain</I> it (so some), to break the power 
 of it, to <I>bruise the head</I> of that serpent that had done so much 
 mischief, to take away the usurped dominion of that tyrant, and to set 
 up a kingdom of holiness and love in the hearts of men, upon the ruins 
 of Satan's kingdom there, that, where <I>sin and death</I> had 
 <I>reigned, righteousness</I> and <I>life</I> through grace might 
 <I>reign.</I> When he died he said, <I>It is finished;</I> sin has now 
 had its death-wound given it, like Samson's, <I>Let me die with the 
 Philistines. Animamque in vulnere ponit--He inflicts the wound and 
 dies. Secondly,</I> To <I>make an end of sin,</I> to abolish it, that 
 it may not rise up in judgment against us, to obtain the pardon of it, 
 that it may not be our ruin, to <I>seal up sins</I> (so the margin 
 reads it), that they may not appear or break out against us, to accuse 
 and condemn us, as, when Christ cast the devil into the bottomless pit, 
 he <I>set a seal upon him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:3">Rev. xx. 3</A>.

 When sin is pardoned it is <I>sought for and not found,</I> as that 
 which is <I>sealed up. Thirdly,</I> To <I>make reconciliation for 
 iniquity,</I> as by a sacrifice, to satisfy the justice of God and so 
 to <I>make peace</I> and bring God and man together, not only as an 
 arbitrator, or referee, who only brings the contending parties to a 
 good understanding one of another, but as a surety, or undertaker, for 
 us. He is not only the <I>peace-maker,</I> but the <I>peace.</I> He is 
 the <I>atonement.</I> 

 [2.] He came to <I>bring in an everlasting righteousness.</I> God might 
 justly have made an end of the sin by making an end of the sinner; but 
 Christ found out another way, and so made an end of sin as to save the 
 sinner from it, by providing a righteousness for him. We are all guilty 
 before God, and shall be condemned as guilty, if we have not a 
 righteousness wherein to appear before him. Had we stood, our innocency 
 would have been our righteousness, but, having fallen, we must have 
 something else to plead; and Christ has provided us a plea. The merit 
 of his sacrifice is <I>our righteousness;</I> with this we answer all 
 the demands of the law; <I>Christ has died, yea, rather, has risen 
 again.</I> Thus Christ is <I>the Lord our righteousness,</I> for he is 
 <I>made of God to us righteousness,</I> that we might be <I>made the 
 righteousness of God in him.</I> By faith we apply this to ourselves 
 and plead it with God, and our <I>faith is imputed to us for 
 righteousness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:3,5">Rom. iv. 3, 5</A>.

 This is an <I>everlasting</I> righteousness, for Christ, who is <I>our
 righteousness,</I> and the <I>prince</I> of our <I>peace,</I> is the 
 <I>everlasting Father.</I> It was from everlasting in the counsels of 
 it and will be to everlasting in the consequences of it. The 
 application of it was from the beginning, for Christ was <I>the Lamb 
 slain from the foundation of the world;</I> and it will be to the end, 
 for he is <I>able to save to the uttermost.</I> It is of everlasting 
 virtue

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:12">Heb. x. 12</A>);
 
 it is the <I>rock that follows us</I> to Canaan.
 
 [3.] He came to <I>seal up the vision and prophecy,</I> all the
 prophetical visions of the Old Testament, which had reference to the 
 Messiah. He <I>sealed them up,</I> that is, he accomplished them, 
 answered to them to a tittle; all things that were written in the law, 
 the prophets, and the psalms, concerning the Messiah, were fulfilled in 
 him. Thus he confirmed the truth of them as well as his own mission. He 
 <I>sealed them up,</I> that is, he put an end to that method of God's 
 discovering his mind and will, and took another course by completing 
 the scripture-canon in the New Testament, which is the more sure word 
 of prophecy than that <I>by vision,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:19,Heb+1:1">2 Pet. i. 19; Heb. i. 1</A>.

 [4.] He came to <I>anoint the most holy,</I> that is, himself, the Holy
 One, who was <I>anointed</I> (that is, appointed to his work and 
 qualified for it) by the Holy Ghost, that oil of gladness which he 
 received <I>without measure,</I> above his fellows; or to <I>anoint</I> 
 the gospel-church, his spiritual temple, or holy place, to sanctify and 
 cleanse it, and appropriate it to himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:26">Eph. v. 26</A>),

 or to consecrate for us <I>a new and living way into the holiest,</I>
 by his own blood

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:20">Heb. x. 20</A>),
 
 as the sanctuary was <I>anointed,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:25">Exod. xxx. 25</A>,

 &c. He is called <I>Messiah</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>),

 which signifies <I>Christ-Anointed</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:41">John i. 41</A>),

 because he received the unction both for himself and for all that are
 his. 

 [5.] In order to all this the Messiah must be <I>cut off,</I> must die 
 a violent death, and so be <I>cut off from the land of the living,</I> 
 as was foretold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:8">Isa. liii. 8</A>.

 Hence, when Paul preaches the death of Christ, he says that he preached
 nothing but <I>what the prophet said should come,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:22,23">Acts xxvi. 22, 23</A>.

 And <I>thus it behoved Christ to suffer.</I> He must be <I>cut off, but
 not for himself</I>--not for any sin of his own, but, as Caiaphas 
 prophesied, he must <I>die for the people,</I> in our stead and for our 
 good,--not for any <I>advantage of his own</I> (the glory he purchased 
 for himself was no more than the glory he had before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:4,5">John xvii. 4, 5</A>);

 no; it was to atone for our sins, and to purchase life for us, that he
 was <I>cut off.</I> 

 [6.] He must <I>confirm the covenant with many.</I> He shall introduce 
 a new covenant between God and man, a covenant of grace, since it had 
 become impossible for us to be saved by a covenant of innocence. This 
 covenant he shall confirm by his doctrine and miracles, by his death 
 and resurrection, by the ordinances of baptism and the Lord's supper, 
 which are the <I>seals</I> of the New Testament, assuring us that God 
 is willing to accept us upon gospel-terms. His death made <I>his 
 testament</I> of force, and enabled us to claim what is bequeathed by 
 it. He confirmed it to <I>the many,</I> to the common people; the poor 
 were <I>evangelized,</I> when the <I>rulers</I> and <I>Pharisees 
 believed not on him.</I> Or, he confirmed it <I>with many,</I> with the 
 Gentile world. The New Testament was not (like the Old) confined to the 
 Jewish church, but was committed to all nations. Christ gave his life
 a <I>ransom for many.</I> 

 [7.] He must <I>cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease.</I> By 
 offering himself a sacrifice once for all he shall put an end to all 
 the Levitical sacrifices, shall supersede them and set them aside; when 
 the substance comes the shadows shall be done away. He causes all the 
 peace-offerings to cease when he has made peace by the blood of his 
 cross, and by it confirmed the covenant of peace and reconciliation. By 
 the preaching of his gospel to the world, with which the apostles were 
 entrusted, he took men off from expecting remission by the blood of 
 bulls and goats, and so <I>caused the sacrifice and oblation to 
 cease.</I> The apostle in his epistle to the Hebrews shows what a 
 better priesthood, altar, and sacrifice, we have now than they had 
 under the law, as a reason why we should <I>hold fast our 
 profession.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Concerning the final destruction of Jerusalem, and of the Jewish 
 church and nation; and this follows immediately upon the cutting off of 
 the Messiah, not only because it was the <I>just punishment</I> of 
 those that put him to death, which was the sin that filled up the 
 measure of their iniquity and brought ruin upon them, but because, as 
 things were, it was necessary to the perfecting of one of the great 
 intentions of his death. He died to take away the ceremonial law, quite 
 to abolish <I>that law of commandments,</I> and to vacate the 
 obligation of it. But the Jews would not be persuaded to quit it; still 
 they kept it up with more zeal than ever; they would hear no talk of 
 parting with it; they stoned Stephen (the first Christian martyr) for 
 saying that Jesus should <I>change the customs which Moses delivered 
 them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:14">Acts vi. 14</A>);

 so that there was no way to abolish the Mosaic economy but by
 destroying the temple, and the holy city, and the Levitical priesthood, 
 and that whole nation which so incurably doted on them. This was 
 effectually done in less than forty years after the death of Christ, 
 and it was a desolation that could <I>never be repaired</I> to this 
 day. And this is it which is here largely foretold, that the Jews who 
 returned out of captivity might not be overmuch lifted up with the 
 rebuilding of their city and temple, because in process of time they 
 would be finally destroyed, and not as now for seventy years only, but 
 might rather rejoice in hope of the coming of the Messiah, and the 
 setting up of his spiritual kingdom in the world, which should <I>never 
 be destroyed.</I> Now, 

 [1.] It is here foretold that <I>the people of the prince that shall 
 come</I> shall be the instruments of this destruction, that is, the 
 Roman armies, belonging to a monarchy yet to come (Christ is <I>the 
 prince that shall come,</I> and they are employed by him in this 
 service; they are <I>his armies,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:7">Matt. xxii. 7</A>),

 or the Gentiles (who, though now strangers, shall become the people of
 the Messiah) shall destroy the Jews. 

 [2.] That the destruction shall be <I>by war,</I> and the <I>end</I> of 
 that <I>war</I> shall be this <I>desolation determined.</I> The <I>wars 
 of the Jews</I> with the Romans were by their own obstinacy made very 
 long and very bloody, and they issued at length in the utter 
 extirpation of that people. 

 [3.] That the <I>city</I> and <I>sanctuary</I> shall in a particular 
 manner be <I>destroyed</I> and laid quite waste. Titus the Roman 
 general would fain have saved the temple, but his soldiers were so 
 enraged against the Jews that he could not restrain them from burning 
 it to the ground, that this prophecy might be fulfilled. 

 [4.] That all the resistance that shall be made to this destruction 
 shall be in vain: <I>The end of it shall be with a flood.</I> It shall 
 be a deluge of destruction, like that which swept away the old world, 
 and which there will be no making head against.

 [5.] That hereby the <I>sacrifice and oblation</I> shall be <I>made to 
 cease.</I> And it must needs cease when the family of the priests was 
 so extirpated, and the genealogies of it were so confounded, that (they 
 say) there is no man in the world that can prove himself of the seed of 
 Aaron. 

 [6.] that there shall be <I>an overspreading of abominations,</I> a 
 general corruption of the Jewish nation and an abounding of iniquity 
 among them, for which it shall be <I>made desolate,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:16">1 Thess. ii. 16</A>.

 Or it is rather to be understood of the armies of the Romans, which
 were abominable to the Jews (they could not endure them), which 
 <I>overspread the nation,</I> and by which it was <I>made desolate;</I> 
 for these are the words which Christ refers to, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:15">Matt. xxiv. 15</A>,

 <I>When you shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by
 Daniel, stand in the holy place, then let those who shall be in Judea 
 flee,</I> which is explained 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:20">Luke xxi. 20</A>,

 <I>When you shall see Jerusalem encompassed with armies then flee.</I>

 [7.] That the desolation shall be total and final: <I>He shall make it 
 desolate, even until the consummation,</I> that is, he shall make it 
 completely desolate. It is a <I>desolation determined,</I> and it will 
 be accomplished to the utmost. And when it is made desolate, it should 
 seem, there is something more determined that is to be <I>poured upon 
 the desolate</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 and what should that be but the <I>spirit of slumber</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:8,25">Rom. xi. 8, 25</A>),

 that blindness which has happened to Israel until the fulness of the
 Gentiles shall come in? And <I>then all Israel shall be saved.</I></P>
