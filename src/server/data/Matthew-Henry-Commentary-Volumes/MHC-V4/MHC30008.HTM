 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Sinful times are here attended with sorrowful times, so necessary is 
 the connexion between them; it is threatened here again and again that 
 the laughter shall be turned into mourning. 

 I. By the vision of "basket of summer-fruit" is signified the hastening
 on of the ruin threatened 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+8:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>)

 and that shall change their note.
 
 II. Oppressors are here called to an account for their abusing the
 poor; and their destruction is foretold, which will set them a mourning, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+8:4-10">ver. 4-10</A>.

 III. A famine of the word of God is here made the punishment of a
 people that go a whoring after other gods 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+8:11-14">ver. 11-14</A>);

 yet for this, which is the most mournful judgment of all, they are not 
 here brought in mourning.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Thus hath the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> shewed unto me: and behold a basket of
 summer fruit.
 &nbsp; 2 And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of
 summer fruit. Then said the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> unto me, The end is come upon my
 people of Israel; I will not again pass by them any more.
 &nbsp; 3 And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day,
 saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>: <I>there shall be</I> many dead bodies in every
 place; they shall cast <I>them</I> forth with silence.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The great reason why sinners defer their repentance <I>de die in 
 diem--from day to day,</I> is because they think God thus defers his 
 judgments, and there is no song wherewith they so effectually sing 
 themselves asleep as that, <I>My Lord delays his coming;</I> and 
 therefore God, by his prophets, frequently represents to Israel the day 
 of his wrath not only as just and certain, but as very near and 
 hastening on apace; so he does in these verses.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The approach of the threatened ruin is represented by <I>a basket of 
 summer-fruit</I> which Amos saw in vision; for the Lord <I>showed 
 it</I> to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+8:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)
 
 and obliged him to take notice of it
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+8:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):
 
 <I>Amos, what seest thou?</I> Note, It concerns us to enquire whether
 we do indeed see that which God has been pleased to show us, and hear 
 what he has been pleased to say to us; for many a thing God speaks, God 
 shows <I>once, yea twice,</I> and men <I>perceive it not.</I> Are we in 
 the midst of the visions of the Almighty? Let us consider what we see. 
 He saw <I>a basket of summer-fruit</I> gathered and ready to be eaten, 
 which signified, 

 1. That they were ripe for destruction, rotten ripe, and it was time
 for God to put in the sickle of his judgments and to cut them off; nay,
 the thing was in effect done already, and they lay ready to be eaten
 up. 

 2. That the year of God's patience was drawing towards a conclusion; it
 was autumn with them, and their year would quickly have its period in a 
 dismal winter. 

 3. Those we call <I>summer-fruits</I> that will not keep till winter,
 but must be used immediately, an emblem of this people, that had 
 nothing solid or consistent in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The intent and meaning of this vision is no more than this: It 
 signifies that <I>the end has come upon my people Israel.</I> The word 
 that signifies <I>the end</I> is <I>ketz,</I> which is of near affinity 
 with <I>kitz,</I> the word used for <I>summer-fruit.</I> God has long 
 spared them, and borne with them, but now his patience is tired out; 
 they are indeed <I>his people Israel,</I> but their end, that <I>latter 
 end</I> they have been so often reminded of, but have so long 
 forgotten, has now come. Note, If sinners do not make an end of sin,
 God will make an end of them, yea though they be <I>his people 
 Israel.</I> What was said 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:8"><I>ch.</I> vii. 8</A>

 is here repeated as God's determined resolution, <I>I will not again
 pass by them any more;</I> they shall not be connived at as they have 
 been, nor the judgment coming turned away.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The consequence of this shall be a universal desolation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+8:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):
 
 When <I>the end</I> shall come sorrow and death shall ride in triumph;
 they are accustomed to go together, and shall at length go away 
 together, when in heaven <I>there shall be no more death, nor 
 sorrow,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:4">Rev. xxi. 4</A>.
 
 But here in a sinful world, in a sinful nation,
 
 1. Sorrow reigns, reigns to such a degree that <I>the songs of the
 temple shall be howlings</I>--the songs of God's temple at Jerusalem, or
 rather of their idol-temples, where they used, when, in honour of the 
 golden calves, they had <I>eaten and drunk,</I> to <I>rise up to 
 play.</I> They were perhaps wanton profane songs; and it is certain 
 that sooner or later those will be turned into howlings. Or, if they 
 had a sound and show of piety and religion, yet, not coming from the 
 heart, nor being sung to the glory of God, he valued them not, but 
 would justly turn them into howlings. Note, Mourning will follow sinful 
 mirth, yea, and sacred mirth too, it if be not sincere. And, when God's 
 judgments are abroad, they will soon turn the greatest joy into the 
 greatest heaviness, the temple-songs, which used to sound so 
 pleasantly, not only into sighs and groans, but into loud howlings, 
 which sound dismally. They shall come to the temple, and, finding that 
 in ruins, there they shall howl most bitterly. 

 2. Death reigns, reigns to such a degree that there shall be <I>dead
 bodies, many</I> dead bodies <I>in every place</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:6">Ps. cx. 6</A>),

 slain by sword or pestilence, so many that the survivors shall not bury
 them with the usual pomp and solemnity of funerals; they shall not so 
 much as have the bell tolled, but they shall <I>cast them forth with 
 silence,</I> shall bury them in the dead of the night, and charge all 
 about them to be silent and to take notice of it, either because they 
 have not wherewithal to bear the charges of a funeral, or because, the 
 killing disease being infectious, none will come near them, or for fear 
 the enemy should be provoked, if they should be known to lament their 
 slain. Or they shall charge themselves and one another silently to 
 submit to the hand of God in these desolating judgments, and not to 
 repine and quarrel with him. Or it may be taken not for a patient, but 
 a sullen silence; their hearts shall be hardened, and all these 
 judgments shall not extort from them one word of acknowledgment either 
 of God's righteousness or their own unrighteousness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4 Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the
 poor of the land to fail,
 &nbsp; 5 Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell
 corn? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the
 ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by
 deceit?
 &nbsp; 6 That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair
 of shoes; <I>yea,</I> and sell the refuse of the wheat?
 &nbsp; 7 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will
 never forget any of their works.
 &nbsp; 8 Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that
 dwelleth therein? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood; and it
 shall be cast out and drowned, as <I>by</I> the flood of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 9 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>,
 that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken
 the earth in the clear day:
 &nbsp; 10 And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your
 songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all
 loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the
 mourning of an only <I>son,</I> and the end thereof as a bitter day.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God is here contending with proud oppressors, and showing them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The heinousness of the sin they were guilty of; in short, they had 
 the character of the unjust judge 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:2">Luke xviii. 2</A>)

 that neither <I>feared God</I> nor <I>regarded man.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Observe them in their devotions, and you will say, "They had no 
 reverence for God." Bad as they are, they do indeed keep up a show and 
 form of godliness; they observe the <I>sabbath</I> and the <I>new 
 moon;</I> they put some difference between those days and other days, 
 but they were soon weary of them, and had no affection at all to them, 
 for their hearts were wholly set upon the world and the things of it. 
 It is a sad character which this gives of them, that they said, <I>When 
 will the sabbath be gone, that we may sell corn?</I> Yet is still the 
 character of many that are called Christians. 

 (1.) They were weary of sabbath days. "When will they be <I>gone?</I>" 
 They were weary of the restraints of the sabbaths and the new-moons, 
 and wished them over because they might <I>do no servile work 
 therein.</I> They were weary of the work or business of the sabbaths 
 and new-moons, snuffed at it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:13">Mal. i. 13</A>),

 and were, as <I>Doeg, detained before the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+21:7">1 Sam. xxi. 7</A>);

 they would rather have been any where else than about God's altars.
 Note, Sabbath days and sabbath work are a burden to carnal hearts, that 
 are always afraid of doing too much for God and eternity. Can we spend
 our time better than in communication with God? And how much time do we 
 spend pleasantly with the world? Will not the sabbath be gone before we 
 have done the work of it and reaped the gains of it? Why then should
 we be in such haste to part with it?

 (2.) They were fond of market-days: they longed to be <I>selling 
 corn</I> and <I>setting forth wheat.</I> When they were employed in 
 religious services they were thinking of their marketings; their hearts 
 <I>went after their covetousness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:31">Ezek. xxxiii. 31</A>),

 and thus made my Father's house a house of merchandise, nay, a den of
 thieves. They were weary of holy duties because their worldly business
 stood still the while; in this they were as in their element, but in 
 God's sanctuary as a fish upon dry ground. Note, Those are strangers to 
 God, and enemies to themselves, that love market days better than 
 sabbath days, that would rather be selling corn than worshipping 
 God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Observe them in their conversations, and you will see they have no 
 regard to man; and this commonly follows upon the former; those that 
 have lost the savour of piety will not long retain the sense of common 
 honesty. They neither <I>do justly</I> nor <I>love mercy.</I> 

 (1.) They cheat those they deal with. When they <I>sell their corn</I> 
 they impose upon the buyer, both in giving out the goods and in 
 receiving the money for them. They measure him the corn by their own 
 measure, and pretend to give him what he agreed for, but they <I>make 
 the ephah small.</I> The measure is scanty, and not statute-measure, 
 and so they wrong him that way. When they receive his money they must 
 weigh fit in their own scales, by their own weights, and the 
 <I>shekel</I> they weigh by is above standard: <I>They make the shekel 
 great,</I> so that the money, being found too light, must have more 
 added to it; and so they cheat that way too, and this under colour and 
 pretence of exactness in doing justice. By such wicked practices as 
 these men show such a greediness of the world, such a love of 
 themselves, such a contempt of mankind in general, of the particular 
 persons they deal with, and of the sacred laws of justice, as prove 
 them to have in their hearts neither the fear nor the love of that God 
 who has so plainly said that <I>false weights and balances are an 
 abomination to him.</I> Another instance of their fraudulent dealing is 
 that they <I>sell the refuse of the wheat,</I> and, taking advantage of 
 their neighbour's ignorance or necessity, make them take it at the same 
 price at which they sell the <I>finest of the wheat.</I> 

 (2.) The are barbarous and unmerciful to the poor: <I>They swallow up 
 the needy,</I> and <I>make the poor of the land to fail.</I>

 [1.] They valued themselves so much on their wealth that they looked 
 upon all that were poor with the highest contempt imaginable; they 
 hated them, could not endure them, but abandoned them, and therefore 
 did what they could to make them cease, not by relieving them to make 
 them cease to be poor, but by banishing and destroying them to make 
 them cease to be, or at least to be in their land. But he who thus 
 <I>reproaches the poor despises his Maker,</I> in whose hands <I>rich 
 and poor meet together.</I> 

 [2.] They were so eager to increase their wealth, and make it more, 
 that they robbed the poor to enrich themselves; and they fastened upon 
 the poor, to <I>make a prey</I> of them, because they were not able to 
 obtain any redress nor to resist or revenge the violence of their 
 oppressors. Those riches that are got by the ruin of the poor will
 bring ruin on those that get them. They swallowed up the poor by making 
 them hard bargains, and cheating them in those bargains; for 
 <I>therefore</I> they <I>falsify the balances by deceit,</I> not only 
 that they <I>may enrich themselves,</I> may have money at command, and 
 so may have every thing else (as they think) at command too, but that 
 they may impoverish those about them, and bring them so low that they 
 may force them to become slaves to them, and so, having drained them of 
 every thing else, they may have their labour for nothing, or next to 
 nothing. Thus <I>they buy the poor for silver;</I> they bring them and 
 their <I>children into bondage,</I> because they have not wherewithal 
 to pay for the corn they have bought; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:2-5">Neh. v. 2-5</A>.

 And there were so many that they were reduced to this extremity that
 the price was very low; and the oppressors had beaten it down so that 
 you might buy a poor man to be your slave <I>for a pair of shoes.</I> 
 Property was first invaded and then liberty; it is the method of 
 oppressors first to make men beggars and then to make them their 
 vassals. Thus is the dignity of the human nature lost in the misery of 
 those that are trampled on and the tenderness of it in the sin of those 
 that trample on them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The grievousness of the punishment that shall be inflicted on them 
 for this sin. When the poor are injured they will <I>cry unto God,</I> 
 and he will hear their cry, and reckon with those that are injurious to 
 them, for, they being his receivers, he takes the wrongs done to them 
 as done to himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:23,24">Exod. xxii. 23, 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God will remember their sin against them: <I>He has sworn by the 
 excellency of Jacob</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+8:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 by himself, for he can swear by no greater; and who but he is the glory
 and magnificence of Jacob? He has sworn by those tokens of his presence 
 with them, and his favour to them, which they had profaned and abused, 
 and had done what they could to make them detestable to him; for he is 
 said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:8"><I>ch.</I> vi. 8</A>)

 to <I>abhor the excellency of Jacob.</I> He swears <I>in his wrath,</I>
 swears by his own name, that name which was so well known and was so 
 great in Israel. He swears, <I>Surely I will never forget any of their
 works,</I> but upon all occasions they shall be remembered against 
 them, for more is implied than is expressed. <I>I will never forget 
 them</I> is as much as to say, <I>I will never forgive them;</I> and 
 then it proclaims the case of these unjust unmerciful men to be 
 miserable indeed, eternally miserable; woe, and a thousand woes, to 
 that man that is cut off by an oath of God from all benefit by 
 pardoning mercy; and those have reason to fear judgment without mercy 
 that have <I>shown no mercy.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He will bring utter ruin and confusion upon them. It is here 
 described largely, and in a great variety of emphatic expressions, 
 that, if possible, they might be frightened into a sincere repentance 
 and reformation. 

 (1.) There shall be a universal terror and consternation: <I>Shall not 
 the land tremble for this</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+8:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 <I>this land,</I> out of which you thought to drive the poor? <I>Shall
 not every one mourn that dwells therein?</I> Certainly he shall. Note, 
 Those that will not tremble and mourn as they ought for national sins 
 shall be made to tremble and mourn for national judgments; those that 
 look without concern upon the sins of the oppressors, which should make 
 them tremble, and upon the miseries of the oppressed, which should them 
 mourn, God will find out a way to make them tremble at the fury of 
 those that oppress them and mourn for their own losses and sufferings 
 by it.

 (2.) There shall be a universal deluge and desolation. When God comes 
 forth against them the waters of trouble and calamity shall <I>rise up 
 wholly as a flood,</I> that swells, when it is dammed up, and soon 
 overflows its banks. Every thing shall make against them. That with 
 which they thought to check the progress of God's judgments shall but 
 make them rise the higher. Judgments shall force their way as the
 <I>breaking forth of waters.</I> The whole land <I>shall be cast out, 
 and drowned,</I> and laid under water, as the land of Egypt is every 
 year by the overflowing of its river Nile. Or the expressions may 
 allude to some former judgments of God. Their ruin <I>shall rise up 
 wholly as a flood,</I> as Noah's flood, which overwhelmed the whole 
 world, so shall this the whole land; and the land shall be <I>cast out, 
 and drowned, as by the flood of Egypt,</I> as Pharaoh and his Egyptians 
 were buried in the Red Sea, which was to them the <I>flood of 
 Egypt,</I> both which judgments, as this which is here threatened, were 
 the punishment of violence and oppression, which the Lord is the 
 avenger of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. It shall surprise them, and come upon them when they little think of 
 it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+8:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>I will cause the sun to go down at noon,</I> when it is in its full
 strength and lustre, at their noon, when they promise themselves a long 
 afternoon, and think they have at least half a day good before them. 
 The <I>earth</I> shall be <I>darkened in the clear day,</I> when every 
 thing looks pleasant and hopeful." Thus uncertain are all our 
 creature-comforts and enjoyments, even life itself; the highest degree 
 of health and prosperity often proves the next degree to sickness and 
 adversity; Job's sun <I>went down at noon;</I> many are taken away in 
 the midst of their days, and their sun goes down at noon. In the midst
 of life we are in death. Thus <I>terrible</I> are the judgments of God 
 to those that sleep in security; they are to them as the sun's <I>going 
 down at noon;</I> the less they are expected the more confounding they 
 are. When they <I>cry Peace and safety</I> then <I>sudden 
 destruction</I> comes, comes <I>as a snare,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:35">Luke xxi. 35</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. It shall change their note, and mar all their mirth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+8:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>I will turn your feasts into mourning,</I> as

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+8:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 the <I>songs of the temple into howlings.</I> Note, The end of the
 sinner's mirth and jollity is heaviness. As <I>to the upright there 
 arises light in the darkness,</I> which gives them <I>the oil of joy 
 for mourning,</I> so on the wicked their falls darkness in the midst of 
 light, which turns their <I>laughter into mourning,</I> their <I>joy 
 into heaviness.</I> So great, so general, shall the desolation be, that 
 <I>sackcloth shall be brought upon all loins, and baldness upon every 
 head,</I> instead of the <I>well-set hair</I> and the rich garments 
 they used to wear. The mourning at that day shall be as <I>mourning for 
 an only son,</I> which denotes the most bitter and lasting lamentation. 
 But are there are no hopes that when things are at the worst they will 
 mend, and that at evening time it will yet be light? No, even <I>the 
 end thereof shall be as a bitter day,</I> a day of bitter mourning; 
 that state of impenitent sinners grows worse and worse, and the last of 
 all will be the worst of all. <I>This shall you have at my hand, you 
 shall lie down in sorrow.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses is threatened,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A general judgment of spiritual famine coming upon the whole land, a 
 <I>famine of the word of God,</I> the failing of oracles and the 
 scarcity of good preaching. This is spoken of as a thing at some 
 distance: <I>The days come,</I> they will come hereafter, when another 
 kind of darkness shall come upon that land of light. When Amos 
 prophesied, and for a considerable time after, they had great plenty of 
 prophets, abundant opportunities of <I>hearing the word of God,</I> in 
 season and out of season; they had precept upon precept and line upon 
 line; prophecy was their daily bread; and it is probable that they 
 surfeited upon it, as Israel on the manna, and therefore God threatens 
 that hereafter he will deprive them of this privilege. Probably in the 
 land of Israel there were not so many prophets, about the time that 
 their destruction came upon them, as there were in the land of Judah; 
 and when the ten tribes went into captivity they <I>saw not their 
 signs,</I> there were <I>no more any prophets,</I> none to <I>show them 
 how long,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:9">Ps. lxxiv. 9</A>.

 The Jewish church, after Malachi, had no prophets for many ages; and
 some think this threatening looks further yet, to the blindness which 
 has in part happened to Israel in the days of the Messiah, and the veil 
 that is on the heart of the unbelieving Jews. They reject the gospel, 
 and the ministers of it that God sends to them, and covet to have 
 prophets of their own, as their fathers had, but they shall have none, 
 <I>the kingdom of God</I> being <I>taken from them</I> and <I>given to 
 another people.</I> Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What the judgment itself is that is threatened. It is a famine, a 
 scarcity, not of bread and water (which are the necessary support of 
 the body, and the want of which is very grievous), but a much sorer 
 judgment than that, even a <I>famine of hearing the words of the 
 Lord.</I> There shall be no congregations for ministers to preach to, 
 nor any ministers to preach, nor any instructions and abilities given 
 to those that do set up for preachers, to fit them for their work. The 
 <I>word of the Lord</I> shall be <I>precious</I> and scarce; there 
 shall be no <I>vision,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:1">1 Sam. iii. 1</A>.

 They shall have the written word, Bibles to read, but no ministers to
 explain and apply it to them, the water in the well, but nothing to 
 draw with. It is a gracious promise

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:20">Isa. xxx. 20</A>)

 that though they have a scarcity of bread they shall have plenty of the
 means of grace. God will <I>give them the bread of adversity and the 
 water of affliction,</I> but their eyes shall see their teachers; and 
 it was a common saying among the Puritans that brown bread and the 
 gospel are good fare. But it is here a threatening that on the contrary 
 they should have plenty enough of bread and water, and yet their 
 teachers should be removed. Now,

 (1.) This was the departure of a great part of their glory from their 
 land. This made their nation great and high, that <I>to them were 
 committed the oracles of God;</I> but, when these were taken from them, 
 their beauty was stained and their honour laid in the dust. 

 (2.) This was a token of God's highest displeasure against them. Surely 
 he was angry indeed with them when he would no more speak to them as he 
 had done, and had abandoned them to ruin when he would no more afford 
 them the means of bringing them to repentance. 

 (3.) This made all the other calamities that were upon them truly 
 melancholy, that they had no prophets to instruct and comfort them from 
 the word of God, nor to give them any hopeful prospect. We should say 
 at any time, and shall say in a time of trouble, that a famine of the 
 word of God is the sorest famine, the heaviest judgment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What will be the effect of this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+8:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>They shall wander from sea to sea,</I> from the sea of Tiberias to
 the Great Sea, from one border of the country to another, to see if God 
 will send them prophets, either by sea or land, from other countries; 
 since they have none among themselves, they shall go from the <I>north 
 to the east;</I> when they are disappointed in one place they shall try 
 another, and shall <I>run to and fro,</I> as men at a loss, and in a 
 hot pursuit to <I>seek the word of the Lord,</I> to enquire if there be 
 any prophets, any prophecy, any message from God, but they <I>shall not 
 find it.</I>

 (1.) Though to many this is no affliction at all, yet some will be very
 sensible of it as a great grievance, and will gladly travel far to hear 
 a good sermon; but they shall sensibly feel the loss of those mercies 
 which others have foolishly sinned away. 

 (2.) Even those that slighted prophets when they had them shall wish 
 for them as Saul did for Samuel, when they are deprived of them. Many
 never know the worth of mercies till they feel the want of them. Or it 
 may be meant thus, Though they should thus wander from sea to sea, in 
 quest of the word of God, yet shall they not find it. Note, The means 
 of grace are moveable things; and the candlestick, when we think it 
 stands most firmly, may be removed out of its place 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:5">Rev. ii. 5</A>);

 and those that now slight the <I>days of the son of man</I> may wish in
 vain to see them. And <I>in the day</I> of this famine <I>the fair 
 virgins and the young men shall faint for thirst</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+8:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 those who, one would think, could well enough have borne the toil,
 shall sink under it. The <I>Jewish churches,</I> and the <I>masters of 
 their synagogues,</I> some take to be meant by the <I>virgins</I> and 
 the <I>young men;</I> these shall lose the word of the Lord, and the 
 benefit of divine revelation, and shall faint away for want of it, 
 shall lose all their strength and beauty. Those that trust in their own 
 merit and righteousness, and think they have no need of Christ, others 
 take to be meant by the <I>fair virgins</I> and the <I>choice young 
 men;</I> they shall <I>faint for thirst,</I> when those that <I>hunger 
 and thirst after the righteousness</I> of Christ shall be abundantly 
 satisfied and filled.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The particular destruction of those that were ringleaders in 
 idolatry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+8:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 
 Observe,

 1. The sin they are charged with: They <I>swear by the sin of
 Samaria,</I> that is, by the god of Samaria, the idol that was 
 worshipped at Bethel, not far off from Samaria. Thus did they glory in 
 their shame, and swear by them as their god which was their iniquity, 
 thinking that could help them which would certainly ruin them, and 
 giving the highest honour to that which they should have looked upon 
 with the utmost abhorrence and detestation. They say, <I>Thy god, O 
 Dan! liveth;</I> that was the other golden calf, a dumb deal idol, and 
 yet caressed and complimented as if it had been the living and true 
 God. They say, <I>The manner,</I> or way, of <I>Beer-sheba liveth;</I> 
 they swore by the <I>religion</I> of Beer-sheba, the way and manner of 
 worship used there, which they looked upon as sacred, and therefore 
 swore by and appealed to as a judge of controversy. Thus the papists 
 swear by the mass, as the <I>manner of Beer-sheba.</I> 

 2. The destruction they are threatened with. Those who thus give that
 honour to idols which is due to God alone will find that the God they 
 affront is thereby made their enemy, so that <I>they shall fall,</I> 
 and the gods they serve cannot stand their friends, so that they shall 
 <I>never rise again.</I> They will find that God is jealous and will 
 resent the indignity done him, and that he will be victorious and it is 
 to no purpose to contend with him.</P>
