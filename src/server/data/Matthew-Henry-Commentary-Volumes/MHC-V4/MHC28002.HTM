 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The scope of this chapter seems to be much the same with that of the 
 foregoing chapter, and to point at the same events, and the causes of 
 them. As there, so here, 

 I. God, by the prophet, discovers sin to them, and charges it home upon
 them, the sin of their idolatry, their spiritual whoredom, their 
 serving idols and forgetting God and their obligations to him, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:1,2,5,8">ver. 1, 2, 5, 8</A>.

 II. He threatens to take away from them that plenty of all good things
 with which they had served their idols, and to abandon them to ruin 
 without remedy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:3,4,6,7,9-13">ver. 3, 4, 6, 7, 9-13</A>.

 III. Yet he promises at last to return in ways of mercy to them for his
 own sake 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:14">ver. 14</A>),

 to restore them to their former plenty

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:15">ver. 15</A>),

 to cure them of their inclination to idolatry

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:16,17">ver. 16, 17</A>),

 to renew his covenant with them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:18-20">ver. 18-20</A>),

 and to bless them with all good things,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters,
 Ruhamah.
 &nbsp; 2  Plead with your mother, plead: for she <I>is</I> not my wife,
 neither <I>am</I> I her husband: let her therefore put away her
 whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her
 breasts;
 &nbsp; 3  Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she
 was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry
 land, and slay her with thirst.
 &nbsp; 4  And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they <I>be</I>
 the children of whoredoms.
 &nbsp; 5  For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived
 them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my
 lovers, that give <I>me</I> my bread and my water, my wool and my
 flax, mine oil and my drink.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The first words of this chapter some make the close of the foregoing 
 chapter, and add them to the promises which we have here of the great 
 things God would do for them. When they shall have appointed Christ 
 their head, and centered in him, then let them say to one another, with 
 triumph and exultation (<I>let the prophets say it</I> to them, so the 
 Chaldee--<I>Comfort you, comfort you, my people,</I> is now their
 commission), "say to them, <I>Ammi,</I> and <I>Ruhamah;</I> call them 
 so again, for they shall no longer lie under the reproach and doom of 
 <I>Lo-ammi</I> and <I>Lo-ruhamah;</I> they shall now be <I>my 
 people</I> again, and shall <I>obtain mercy.</I>" God's spiritual 
 Israel, made up of Jews and Gentiles without distinction, shall call 
 one another brethren and sisters, shall own one another for the people 
 of God and beloved of him, and, for that reason, shall embrace one 
 another, and stir up one another both to give thanks for and to walk 
 worthy of this <I>common salvation</I> which they partake of. Or 
 rather, because the following words seem to have a coherence with 
 these, these also are designed for conviction and humiliation. The 
 <I>mother</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)

 seems to be the same with the <I>brethren</I> and <I>sisters</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 the church of the ten tribes, the body of the people, who were 
 brethren, and in a special manner with the heads and leaders, who were 
 as the mother by whom the rest were brought up and nursed. But who are 
 the children that must <I>plead with their mother</I> thus? Either, 

 1. The godly that were among them, that witnessed against the
 iniquities of the times, let them boldly go on to bear their testimony 
 against the idolatries and gross corruptions that prevail among them. 
 Let those that had not bowed the knee to Baal reason the case with 
 those that had, and endeavour to convince them with such arguments as 
 are here put into their mouths. Note, Private persons may, and ought in 
 their places, to appear and plead against the public profanations of 
 God's name and worship. Children may humbly and modestly argue with
 their parents when they do amiss: <I>Plead with your mother, plead,</I> 
 as Jonathan with Saul concerning David. Or, 

 2. The sufferers among them, that shared in the calamities of the
 times, let them not complain of God, let them not quarrel with him, nor 
 lay the blame on him, as if he had dealt hardly with them, and not like 
 a tender father. No; let them <I>plead with their mother,</I> and lay 
 the fault on her, where it ought to be laid; compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:1">Isa. l. 1</A>.

 "<I>For her transgressions is your mother put away;</I> she may thank
 herself, and you may thank her for all your miseries." Let us see now 
 how they must plead with her.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They must put here in mind of the relation wherein she had stood to 
 God, the kindness he had had for her, the many favours he had bestowed 
 upon her, and the further favours he had designed her. Let them tell 
 their <I>brethren</I> and <I>sisters</I> that they had been <I>Ammi</I> 
 and <I>Ruhamah,</I> that they had been God's people and vessels of his 
 mercy, and might have been so still if it had not been their own fault, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Note, Our relation to God and dependence on him are a great aggravation 
 of our revolts from him and rebellions against him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They must, in God's name, charge her with the violation of the 
 marriage-covenant between her and God. Let them tell her that God does 
 not look upon her as his wife, nor upon himself as her husband any 
 longer. Tell her 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)

 that <I>she is not my wife, neither am I her husband,</I> that by her 
 spiritual whoredom she has forfeited all the honour and comfort of her 
 relation to God, and provoked him to give her a bill of divorce. Note, 
 No consideration can be more powerful to awaken us to repentance than 
 the provocation we have by sin given to God to disown and cast us off. 
 It is time to look about us, and to think what course we must take, 
 when God threatens to reject us; for woe unto us if he be not <I>our 
 husband.</I> They must charge this home upon her 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Their mother has played the harlot; their congregation has run a 
 whoring after false prophets</I> (so the Chaldee), or, rather, <I>after 
 idols,</I> wherein they were encouraged by their false prophets; <I>she 
 that conceived them has done shamefully,</I> in making and worshipping 
 idols. An idol is called a <I>shame</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:10"><I>ch.</I> ix. 10</A>)

 and idolatry is a <I>shameful thing.</I> It is not only an affront to
 God, but a reproach to men, to <I>fall down to the stock of a tree,</I> 
 as the prophet speaks. Or it denotes that the sinner was shameless, 
 impudent in sin, and could not blush; 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:15">Jer. vi. 15</A>.

 Or, <I>She has made ashamed,</I> has made all that see her ashamed of
 her; her own children are ashamed of their relation to her.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They must upbraid her with her horrid ingratitude to God her 
 benefactor, in ascribing to her idols the glory of the gifts he had 
 given her, and then giving that for a reason why she paid them the 
 homage due to him only, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 In this she <I>did shamefully</I> indeed, that <I>she said, I will go 
 after my lovers that give me my bread and my water.</I> Observe here, 
 
 1. Her wicked resolution to persist in idolatry, notwithstanding all
 that God said, both by his prophets and by his providences, to draw her 
 from it. <I>She said,</I> Whatever is offered to the contrary, <I>I 
 will go after my lovers,</I> or <I>those that cause me to love 
 them,</I> whom I cannot but be in love with. The Chaldee understands it 
 of the nations whose alliance Israel courted and depended upon, who 
 supplied them with what they needed. But it is rather to be understood 
 of the idols they worshipped, to justify their love of which they 
 called them their lovers. See who do shamefully; those that are wilful 
 and resolute in sin, and those that openly profess and own their 
 resolution to go on in it. See the folly of idolaters, to call those 
 their lovers that had not so much as life; yet let us learn to call our 
 God our lover; let us keep up good thoughts of him, and put a high 
 value upon our interest in him and in his love. 

 2. The gross mistake upon which this resolution was grounded: "I will
 go after my lovers, because they give me my <I>bread and my water,</I> 
 which are necessary to sustain the body, <I>my wool and my flax,</I> 
 which are necessary to clothe the body, and pleasant things, <I>my 
 oil,</I> and <I>my drink,</I> my liquors" (so the word is), "wine and 
 strong drink." Note,

 (1.) The things of sense are the best things with carnal hearts, and
 the most powerful attractives, in pursuit of which they care not what 
 they follow after. The God of Israel set before them his 
 <I>statutes</I> and <I>judgments</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:8">Deut. iv. 8</A>),

 <I>more to be desired than gold, and sweeter than honey</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:10">Ps. cxix. 10</A>),

 promised them his favour, which would <I>put gladness in their hearts
 more than corn, wine, and oil</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:7">Ps. iv. 7</A>);

 but they had no relish at all for these things. Whence they thought
 their oil and their drink came, thither they would return their best 
 affections. <I>O curv&aelig; in terram anim&aelig; et c&oelig;lestium 
 inanes!</I>--<I>O degenerate minds, bending towards the earth, and 
 devoid of every thing heavenly!</I>

 (2.) It is a great abuse and injury to God, in pursuance of the 
 pleasures and delights of sense to forsake him, who not only gives us 
 better things, but gives us even those things too. The idolaters made 
 Ceres the goddess of their corn, Bacchus the god of their wine, &c., 
 and then foolishly fancied they had their corn and wine from these, 
 forgetting the Lord their God, who both gave them that good land and 
 <I>gave them power to get wealth</I> out of it. 

 (3.) Many are hardened in sin by their worldly prosperity. They had an 
 abundance of those things when they served their idols, and then 
 imagined them to be given them by their idols, which kept them to their 
 service; thus they argued 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+44:17,18">Jer. xliv. 17, 18</A>),

 <I>While we burnt incense to the queen of heaven we had plenty of
 victuals.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. They must persuade her to repent and reform. God will disown her if 
 she persist in her whoredoms; <I>let her therefore put away her 
 whoredoms,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Let her be convinced that it is possible for her to reform; the idols, 
 dear as they are, may yet be parted with; and it will certainly be well 
 with her if she do reform. Note, Our pleading with sinners must be to 
 drive them to repentance, not to drive them to despair. Let her <I>put 
 away her whoredoms and her adulteries;</I> the doubling of words to the 
 same purport, and both plural, denotes the abundance of idolatries they 
 were guilty of, all which must be abandoned ere God would be reconciled 
 to them. Let her put them <I>out of her sight,</I> as detestable things 
 which she cannot endure to look upon; let her say unto them, <I>Get you 
 hence,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:22">Isa. xxx. 22</A>.

 Let her put them <I>from her face</I> and from <I>between her 
 breasts,</I> that is, let her not do as harlots use to do, that both 
 discover their own wicked disposition, and allure others to wickedness, 
 by painting their faces, and exposing their naked breasts, and adorning 
 them; let her not thus, by annexing all possible gaieties and pleasures 
 to the worship of idols, engage herself and allure others to it. Let
 her put away all these. Every sinful course, persisted in, is an 
 adulterous departure from God. And here we may see what it is truly to 
 repent of it and turn from it.

 1. True penitents will forsake both open sins, will put away not only
 the whoredoms that lie in sight, but those that lie in secret 
 <I>between their breasts,</I> the sin that is <I>rolled under the 
 tongue as a sweet morsel.</I> 

 2. They will both avoid the outward occasions of sin and mortify the 
 inward disposition to it. Idolaters walked after their own eyes, which 
 <I>went a whoring</I> after their idols

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+6:9,De+4:19">Ezek. vi. 9, Deut. iv. 19</A>),

 and <I>therefore</I> they must put them away <I>out of their sight,</I>
 lest they should be tempted to worship them. <I>Look not upon the wine
 when it is red.</I> But that is not enough: the axe must be <I>laid to
 the root;</I> the corrupt bent and inclination of the heart must be
 changed, and it must be put away <I>from between the breasts,</I> that
 Christ alone may have the innermost and uppermost place there. 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:13">Cant. i. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. They must show her the utter ruin that will certainly be the fatal 
 consequence of her sin if she do not repent and reform 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Lest I strip her naked.</I> This comes in here not by way of 
 sentence passed upon her, but by way of warning given to her, that she 
 may prevent it: <I>Let her put away her whoredoms, that I may not strip 
 her naked</I> (so it may be read), intimating that God waits to show 
 mercy to sinners, if they would but qualify themselves for that mercy. 
 It is here threatened that God will deal with her as the just and 
 jealous husband at length does with an adulterous wife, that has filled 
 his house with a spurious brood, and will not be reclaimed; he turns 
 her and her children out of doors and sends them a begging; <I>I will 
 not have mercy upon her children</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 the particular persons that share in the calamity of the nation, and 
 the rising generation, shall be ruined by it, for they are <I>children 
 of whoredoms,</I> and keep up the <I>vain conversation received by 
 tradition from their fathers.</I> Now it is here threatened that they 
 shall be both stripped and starved. They thought their idols gave them
 <I>their bread and their water, their wool and their flax;</I> but God, 
 by taking them away, will let them know that it was he that gave them. 
 
 1. She shall be stripped: <I>Lest I strip her</I> of all her ornaments
 which she is proud of, and with which she courts her lovers, <I>strip 
 her</I> and set her <I>as in the day that she was born,</I> send her as 
 naked out of the world as she came into it; this death does, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:21">Job i. 21</A>.
 
 <I>I will strip her,</I> and so expose her to cold, and expose her to
 shame; and justly is she exposed to shame that <I>did shamefully,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The day when God brought them out of Egypt, where they were no better 
 than slaves and beggars, was <I>the day in which they were born;</I> 
 and God threatens to bring them back to as low and miserable a 
 condition as he then found them in. Whatever they had that either 
 gained them respect or screened them from contempt, among their 
 neighbours, should be taken from them. See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:4,39">Ezek. xvi. 4, 39</A>.

 2. She shall be starved, shall be deprived not only of her honours, but
 of her comforts and necessary supports. She shall be famished, shall be 
 made <I>as a wilderness</I> and <I>a dry land,</I> and <I>slain with 
 thirst.</I> She that boasted so much of her bread and water, her oil 
 and her drinks, which her lovers had <I>given her,</I> shall not have 
 so much as necessary food. The land shall not afford subsistence for
 the inhabitants, for want of the rain of heaven; or, if it do, it shall 
 be taken from them by the enemy, so that the rightful owners shall 
 perish for want of it. Some understand it thus: <I>I will make her 
 as</I> she was in the <I>wilderness,</I> and set her as she was <I>in 
 the desert land,</I> where she was sometimes ready to perish <I>for 
 thirst.</I> So it explains the former part of the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:3">verse</A>:

 I will set her <I>as in the day that she was born;</I> for it was in
 the vast howling wilderness that Israel was first formed into a people. 
 They shall be in as deplorable a condition as their fathers were, whose 
 carcases fell in the wilderness, and in this respect, worse, that then 
 the children were reserved to be heirs of the land of promise, but now 
 <I>I will not have mercy upon her children,</I> for <I>their mother has 
 played the harlot.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and
 make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.
 &nbsp; 7  And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not
 overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find
 <I>them:</I> then shall she say, I will go and return to my first
 husband; for then <I>was it</I> better with me than now.
 &nbsp; 8  For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil,
 and multiplied her silver and gold, <I>which</I> they prepared for
 Baal.
 &nbsp; 9  Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time
 thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my
 wool and my flax <I>given</I> to cover her nakedness.
 &nbsp; 10  And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her
 lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand.
 &nbsp; 11  I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days,
 her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.
 &nbsp; 12  And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she
 hath said, These <I>are</I> my rewards that my lovers have given me:
 and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall
 eat them.
 &nbsp; 13  And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she
 burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings
 and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God here goes on to threaten what he would do with this treacherous 
 idolatrous people; and he warns that he may not wound, he threatens 
 that he may not strike. <I>If he turn not, he will whet his sword</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:12">Ps. vii. 12</A>);

 but, if he turn, he will sheathe it. They did not turn, and therefore
 all this came upon them: and its being threatened before shows that it 
 was the execution of a divine sentence upon them for their wickedness; 
 and it is written for admonition to us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They shall be perplexed and embarrassed in all their counsels, and 
 disappointed in all their expectations. This is threatened 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 But to the threatening is annexed a promise that this shall be a means 
 to convince them of their folly, and bring them home to their duty; and 
 so good shall be brought out of evil, in token of the mercy God has yet 
 in reserve for them. And, this being the happy fruit and effect of the 
 distress, it is hard to say whether the prediction, or the distress 
 itself, should be called a threatening or a promise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God will raise up difficulties and troubles in their way, so that 
 their public counsels and affairs shall have no success, nor shall they 
 be able to get forward in them: <I>I will hedge up thy way with 
 thorns,</I> with such crosses as, like thorns and briers, are the 
 product of sin and the curse, and are scratching, and tearing, and 
 vexing, and, when the way we are in is hedged up with them, stop our 
 progress, and force us to turn back. She said, "<I>I will go after my 
 lovers;</I> I will pursue my leagues and alliances with foreign powers, 
 and depend upon them." But God says, "She shall be frustrated in these 
 projects, and not be able to proceed in them. <I>I will hedge up thy 
 way with thorns,</I> and, if that do not serve, <I>I will make a 
 wall.</I>" If some smaller difficulties be got over, and prevail not to 
 break her measures, God will raise greater, for he will overcome when 
 he judges. It shall be such a hedge, and such a wall, that <I>she shall 
 not find her paths.</I> The change of the person here, I will hedge up 
 <I>thy way,</I> and then, <I>She</I> shall not find <I>it,</I> is usual 
 in scripture, especially in an earnest way of speaking. "Sinner, do 
 thou take notice, <I>I will hedge up thy way,</I> and all you that are 
 bystanders take notice what will be the effect of this, you may observe 
 that <I>she</I> cannot find her paths." She shall be as a traveller 
 that not only knows not which way to go, of many that are before him, 
 but that finds no way at all to go forward. And then <I>she shall 
 follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them;</I> she shall 
 endeavour to make an interest in the Assyrians and Egyptians, and to 
 have them for her protectors, but she shall not gain her point; they 
 shall either not come into confederacy with her or not do her any 
 service, shall <I>help in vain</I> and be as the <I>staff of a broken 
 reed. She shall seek them, but shall not find them,</I> shall seek to 
 her idols, but shall not find that satisfaction in them which she 
 promised herself; the gods whom she trusted and courted not only can do 
 nothing for her, but have nothing to say to her to encourage her. Now, 
 
 (1.) This is such a just judgment as the Sodomites met with, that were 
 <I>struck with blindness,</I> and <I>wearied themselves to find the 
 door</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:11">Gen. xix. 11</A>),
 
 and the Syrians,

 Note, Those that are most resolute in their sinful pursuits are
 commonly most crossed in them. <I>Thorns and snares are in the way of 
 the froward</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+22:5">Prov. xxii. 5</A>);
 
 and thus with them God <I>shows himself froward</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:26">Ps. xviii. 26</A>),
 
 and <I>walks contrary to those that walk contrary to him,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:23,24">Lev. xxvi. 23, 24</A>.

 The lamenting prophet complains, <I>He has enclosed my ways,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:7,9">Lam. iii. 7, 9</A>.

 The way of God and duty is often hedged about with thorns, but we have 
 reason to think it is a sinful way that is hedged up with thorns. 

 (2.) This is such a kind rebuke, and indeed such a mercy, as Balaam met 
 with, when the angel stood in his way, to hinder his going forward to 
 <I>curse Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:22">Num. xxii. 22</A>.

 Note, Crosses and obstacles in an evil course are great blessings, and 
 are so to be accounted. They are God's hedges, to keep us from 
 transgressing, to restrain us from wandering out of the green pastures, 
 to <I>withdraw man from his purpose</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:17">Job xxxiii. 17</A>),

 to make the way of sin difficult, that we may not go on in it, and to
 keep us from it whether we will or not. We have reason to bless God 
 both for restraining grace and for restraining providences.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. These difficulties that God raises up in their way shall raise up in 
 their minds thoughts of turning back: "<I>Then shall she say,</I> Since 
 I cannot overtake my lovers, I will even <I>go and return to my first 
 husband,</I> that is, will return to God, and humble myself to him, and 
 desire him to take me in again; for, when I kept close to him, it was 
 every way <I>better with me than now.</I>" Two things are here extorted 
 from this degenerate apostate people:--

 (1.) A just acknowledgement of the folly of their apostasy. They are 
 now brought to own that it was better with them while they kept close 
 to their God than ever it was since they forsook him. Note, Whoever 
 have exchanged the service of God for the services of the world and the 
 flesh have, sooner or later, been made to own that they <I>changed for 
 the worse,</I> and that while they continued in good company, and went 
 on in the way of good duties, and made conscience how they spent their 
 time and what they said or did, it was better with them; they had more 
 true comfort and enjoyment of themselves than ever they had since they 
 went astray. 

 (2.) A good purpose, to come back again to their duty: <I>I will go, 
 and return to my first husband;</I> and she knows so much of his 
 goodness and readiness to forgive that she speaks without any doubt of 
 his receiving her again into favour and making her condition as good as 
 ever. Note, The disappointments we meet with in our pursuits of 
 satisfaction in the creature should, if nothing else will do it, drive 
 us at length to the Creator, in whom alone it is to be had. When Moab 
 is <I>weary of the high place</I> he shall <I>go to the sanctuary,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+16:12">Isa. xvi. 12</A>.

 And when the prodigal son is reduced to husks, short allowance indeed,
 and remembers that <I>in his father's house there is bread enough,</I> 
 then he says, <I>I will arise and go to my father's house,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:17,18">Luke xv. 17, 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The necessary supports and comforts of life shall be taken from 
 them, because they had dishonoured God with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 Their land was plenteous. Now see here, 

 1. How graciously their plenty was given to them. God gave them not
 only corn for necessity, but wine for delight, and oil for ornament. 
 Nay, he <I>multiplied their silver and gold,</I> wherewith to traffic 
 with other nations and bring home their products, and which they might 
 hoard up for posterity. <I>Silver and gold</I> will keep longer than 
 <I>corn, and wine, and oil.</I> He gave them <I>wool</I> and 
 <I>flax</I> too, to <I>cover their nakedness,</I> and to serve for 
 ornament enough to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:10">Ezek. xvi. 10</A>.

 Note, God is a bountiful benefactor even to those who, he foresees,
 will be ungrateful and unthankful to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How basely their plenty was abused by them. 

 (1.) They robbed God of the honour of his gifts: <I>She did not know 
 that I gave her corn and wine;</I> she did not remember it. The law and 
 the prophets had told them, again and again, that all their comforts 
 they received from God's bountiful providence; but they were so often 
 told by their false prophets and idolatrous priests that they had their 
 corn from such an idol, and their wine from such an idol, &c., that 
 they had quite forgotten their relation to their great benefactor and 
 their obligations to him. She did not consider it; she would not 
 acknowledge it. This they were <I>willingly ignorant of,</I> and more 
 brutish than the ox, that <I>knows his owner,</I> and the <I>ass, that 
 knows his master's crib. She did not know it,</I> for she did not 
 return thanks to him for his gifts, nor study what she should render; 
 nor did she give him his dues out of them, but acted as if she were 
 ignorant who was the donor. 

 (2.) They served and honoured his enemies with them: <I>They prepared 
 them for Baal;</I> they adorned their images with <I>gold and 
 silver</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:4">Jer. x. 4</A>),

 and adorned themselves for the worship of their images,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:17-19">Ezek. xvi. 17-19</A>.

 <I>Wherewith they made Baal</I> (so the margin reads it), that is, the 
 image of Baal. Note, It is a very great dishonour to the God of heaven
 to make those gifts of his providence the food and fuel of our lusts 
 which he gave us for our support in his service, and to be oil to the 
 wheels of our obedience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. How justly their plenty should be taken from them: "<I>Therefore 
 will I return;</I> I will alter my dealings with them, will take 
 another course, <I>and will take away my corn</I> and other good things 
 that I gave her." I will <I>recover</I> them, a law term, as a man by 
 due course of law recovers what is unjustly detained from him, or as, 
 when the tenant has committed waste, the landlord recovers <I>locum 
 vastatum--dilapidations.</I> Observe, God calls their abundance <I>my
 corn</I> and <I>my wine, my wool</I> and <I>my flax.</I> They called it 
 theirs (<I>my bread</I> and <I>my water,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 but God lets them know that it is not theirs; he only allowed them the 
 use of it as tenants, entrusted them with the management of it as 
 stewards, but still reserved the property in himself. "It is <I>my</I> 
 corn and <I>my</I> wine." God will have us to know, not only that we 
 have all our creature-comforts and enjoyments from him, but that he has 
 still an incontestable right and title to them, that they are more his 
 than ours, and therefore are to be used for him, and accounted for to 
 him. He will therefore take their plenty away from them, because they
 have forfeited it by disowning his right, as a tenant by copy of 
 court-roll, who holds at the will of his lord, forfeits his estate if 
 he makes a feoffment of it as though he were a freeholder. He will 
 <I>recover</I> it, will <I>free</I> or <I>deliver</I> it, that it may 
 be no longer abused, as the creature is said to be <I>delivered from 
 the bondage of corruption</I> under which <I>it groans,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:21">Rom. viii. 21</A>.
 
 He will take it away <I>in the time thereof,</I> and <I>in the season
 thereof,</I> just when they expected it, and thought that they were 
 sure of it. It shall suffer shipwreck in the harbour; and <I>the 
 harvest shall be a heap.</I> He will take it away by unseasonable 
 weather or by unreasonable men. Note, Those that abuse the mercies God 
 gives them, to his dishonour, cannot expect to enjoy them long.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They shall lose <I>all their honour,</I> and be exposed to 
 contempt 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "<I>I will discover her lewdness,</I> will bring to light all her 
 secret wickedness, and make it public, to her shame; I will show by the 
 punishment of it how heinous, how odious, how offensive it is. The fact 
 has been denied, but now it shall appear; the fault has been 
 diminished, but now it shall appear exceedingly sinful. And this <I>in
 the sight of her lovers,</I> in the sight of the neighbouring nations, 
 with whom she courted an alliance, and on whom she had a dependence; 
 they shall despise her and be ashamed of her because of her weakness, 
 and poverty, and ill conduct; they shall not think her any longer 
 worthy of their friendship." See this fulfilled, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+1:8">Lam. i. 8</A>,

 <I>All that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her
 nakedness.</I> Or in the sight of <I>the sun and moon,</I> which she 
 worshipped as <I>her lovers;</I> before them shall <I>her lewdness be 
 discovered.</I> Compare this with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:1,2">Jer. vii. 1, 2</A>,

 <I>They shall bring out the bones of their kings and princes, and 
 spread them before the sun and moon, whom they have loved and 
 served.</I> Note, Sin will have shame; let those expect it that have 
 done shamefully. What other lot can this impudent adulteress expect but 
 that of a common harlot, to be carted through the town? And, when God 
 comes to deal thus with her, <I>none shall deliver her out of his 
 hands,</I> neither the gods nor the men they confide in. Note, Those
 who will not deliver themselves into the hand of God's mercy cannot be 
 delivered out of the hand of his justice.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. They shall lose all their pleasure, and shall be left melancholy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>I will cause her mirth to cease.</I> It seems, then, though they had 
 <I>gone a whoring from their God,</I> yet they could find in their 
 hearts to <I>rejoice as other people,</I> which is forbidden,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:1"><I>ch.</I> ix. 1</A>.

 Note, Many who lie under guilt and wrath are yet very jocund and merry,
 and live jovially; but, whether in their laughter their hearts be sad 
 or no, it is certain that the <I>end of their mirth</I> will be 
 <I>heaviness;</I> for God <I>will cause all their mirth to cease.</I> 
 It is as Mr. Burroughs observes here, <I>Sin and mirth can never hold 
 long together;</I> but, <I>if men will not take away sin from their 
 mirth, God will take away mirth from their sin.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God will take away the occasions of their sacred mirth--<I>their
 feast-days, their new moons, their sabbaths, and all their solemn 
 feasts.</I> These God instituted to be observed in a religious manner, 
 and they were to be observed with rejoicing; and, it seems, though they 
 had departed from the pure worship of God, yet they kept up the 
 observance of these, not at God's temple at Jerusalem, for they had 
 long since forsaken that, but probably at Dan and Bethel, where the 
 calves were, or in some other places of meeting that they had. They 
 observed them, not for the honour of God, nor with any true devotion 
 towards him, but only because they were times of mirth and feasting, 
 music and dancing, and meeting of friends, received by tradition from 
 their fathers. Thus, when they had lost the power of godliness, and 
 denied that, yet, for the pleasing of a vain and carnal mind, they kept 
 up the form of it; and by this means their new-moons and their sabbaths 
 became an iniquity which God <I>could not away with,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:13">Isa. i. 13</A>.

 Now observe,

 (1.) God calls them their new-moons and their sabbaths, not his (he 
 disowns them), but theirs. 

 (2.) He will <I>cause them to cease.</I> Note, When men by their sins 
 have caused the life and substance of ordinances to cease it is just 
 with God by his judgments to cause the remaining show and shadow of 
 them to cease.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He will take away the supports of their carnal mind. They loved the 
 new-moons and the sabbaths only for the sake of the good cheer that was 
 stirring then, not for the sake of any religious exercises then 
 performed; these they had dropped long ago; and now God will take away 
 their provisions for these solemnities 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>I will destroy her vines and her fig-trees.</I> Note, If men destroy 
 God's words and ordinances, by which he should be honoured on their 
 feast-days, it is just with him to destroy their vines and fig-trees, 
 with which they regale themselves. While they took the pleasure of 
 these, they gave their lovers the praise of them: "<I>These are my 
 rewards which my lovers have given me;</I> I may thank my stars for 
 these, and my worship of them; I may thank my neighbours for these, and 
 my alliance with them." And therefore God will destroy them, will 
 wither them with a blast, or bring in a foreign enemy that shall lay 
 the country waste, so that their vineyards shall become <I>a 
 forest;</I> the enclosures shall be thrown down, as is usual in war; 
 all shall be laid in common, so that the <I>beasts of the field</I> 
 shall eat their grapes and their figs. Or they shall be so blasted with 
 the east wind that fruit-trees shall be of no more use than 
 forest-trees; but, being withered and good for nothing, what fruit 
 there is shall be left to the <I>beasts of the field.</I> Or it shall 
 be devoured by their enemies, by men as barbarous as wild beasts. Now, 
 
 (1.) This shall be the ruin of their mirth: God will <I>cause all her 
 mirth to cease.</I> How will he do it? Taking away the new-moons and
 the sabbaths will not do it; they can very easily part with them, and 
 find no loss; but "I will <I>destroy her vines and her fig-trees,</I> 
 will take away her sensual pleasures, and then she will think herself 
 undone indeed." Note, The destruction of the vines and the fig-trees 
 causes all the mirth of a carnal heart to cease; it will say, as Micah, 
 You have <I>taken away my gods, and what have I more?</I> 

 (2.) This shall be the punishment of her idolatry

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 "<I>I will visit upon her the days of Baalim;</I> I will reckon with 
 her for all the worship of all the Baals they have made gods of, from 
 the days of their fathers unto this day." We read of their worshipping 
 Baal as long ago as the time of the Judges, and, for aught I know, this 
 may look as far back as those times, those <I>days of Baalim;</I> for 
 it is in the second commandment, which forbids idolatry, that God 
 threatens to <I>visit the iniquities of the fathers upon the 
 children;</I> and justly is that sin so visited, more than any other, 
 because it commonly supports itself by prescription and long usage. Now 
 that the measure of the iniquity of Israel was full all their former 
 sins came into the account, and shall be <I>required of this 
 generation.</I> Or the <I>days of Baalim</I> are the solemn festival 
 days which they kept in honour of their idols. Days of sinful mirth 
 must be visited in days of mourning. These were the days wherein she 
 <I>burnt incense</I> to idols, and, to grace the solemnity, <I>decked 
 herself with her ear-rings and her jewels,</I> that, appearing 
 honourable, the honour she did to Baal might be thought the greater. Or 
 she was as a wife that decks herself with the ear-rings and jewels that 
 her husband gave her, to make herself amiable to her lovers, whom she 
 follows after, and is ever mindful of. But <I>she forgot me, saith the 
 Lord.</I> Note, Our treacherous departures from God are owing to our 
 forgetfulness of him, of his nature and attributes, his relation to us 
 and our obligations to him. Many who plead that they have weak 
 memories, and forget the things of God, can remember other things well 
 enough; nay, it is because they are so mindful of lying vanities that 
 they are so forgetful of their own mercies.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the
 wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.
 &nbsp; 15  And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the
 valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as
 in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out
 of the land of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 16  And it shall be at that day, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>that</I> thou

 mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to

 shall say, <I>Thou art</I> my God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The state of Israel ruined by their own sin did not look so black and 
 dismal in the former part of the chapter, but that the state of Israel, 
 restrained by the divine grace, looks as bright and pleasant here in 
 the latter part of the chapter, and the more surprisingly so as the 
 promises follow thus close upon the threatenings; nay, which is very 
 strange, they are by a note of connexion joined to, and inferred from, 
 that declaration of their sinfulness upon which the threatenings of 
 their ruin are grounded: <I>She went after her lovers, and forgot me, 
 saith the Lord; therefore I will allure her.</I> Fitly therefore is 
 that <I>therefore</I> which is the note of connexion immediately 
 followed with a note of admiration: <I>Behold I will allure her!</I> 
 When it was said, <I>She forgot me,</I> one would think it should have 
 followed, "Therefore I will abandon her, I will forget her, I will 
 never look after her more." No, <I>Therefore I will allure her.</I> 
 Note, God's thoughts and ways of mercy are infinitely above ours; his 
 reasons are all fetched from within himself, and not from any thing in 
 us; nay, his goodness takes occasion from man's badness to appear so 
 much the more illustrious, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:17,18">Isa. lvii. 17, 18</A>.

 <I>Therefore,</I> because she will not be restrained by the
 denunciations of wrath, God will try whether she will be wrought upon 
 by the offers of mercy. Some think it may be translated, 
 <I>Afterwards,</I> or <I>nevertheless,</I> I will allure her. It comes 
 all to one; the design is plainly to magnify free grace to those on 
 whom God will have mercy purely for mercy's sake. Now that which is 
 here promised to Israel is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That though now they were disconsolate, and ready to despair, they 
 should again be revived with comforts and hopes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 This is expressed here with an allusion to God's dealings with that 
 people when he brought them out of Egypt, through the wilderness to 
 Canaan, as their forlorn and deplorable condition in their captivity 
 was compared to their state in <I>Egypt in the day that they were 
 born,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 They shall be new-formed by such miracles of love and mercy as they 
 were first-formed by, and such a transport of joy shall they be in as 
 they were in then. It is hard to say when this had its accomplishment 
 in the kingdom of the ten tribes; but it principally aims, no doubt, at 
 the bringing in both of Jews and Gentiles into the church by the gospel 
 of Christ; and it is applicable, nay, we have reason to think it was 
 designed that it should be applied, to the conversion of particular 
 souls to God. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The gracious methods God will take with them. 

 (1.) He will <I>bring them into the wilderness,</I> as he did at first 
 when he brought them out of Egypt, where he instructed them, and took 
 them into covenant with himself. The land of their captivity shall be 
 to them now, as that wilderness was then, the <I>furnace of 
 affliction,</I> in which God will <I>choose them.</I> See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:35,36">Ezek. xx. 35, 36</A>,

 <I>I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I
 plead with you.</I> God had said that he would <I>make them as a 
 wilderness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 which was a threatening; now, when it is here made part of a promise 
 that he would bring them into the wilderness, the meaning may be that 
 he would by his grace bring their minds to their condition: "They shall 
 have humble hearts under humbling providences; being poor, they shall 
 be poor in spirit, shall <I>accept of the punishment of their 
 iniquity,</I> and then they are prepared to have comfort spoken to 
 them." When God delivered Israel out of Egypt he led them into the 
 wilderness, to <I>humble them and prove them, that he might do them 
 good</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:2,3,15,16">Deut. viii. 2, 3, 15, 16</A>),

 and so he will do again. Note, Those whom God has mercy in store for he
 first <I>brings into a wilderness</I>--into solitude and retirement, 
 that they may the more freely converse with him out of the noise of 
 this world,--into distress of mind, through sense of guilt and dread of 
 wrath, which brings a soul to be quite at a loss in itself and 
 bewildered, and by those convictions he prepares for consolations,--and 
 sometimes into outward distress and trouble, thereby to open the ear to 
 discipline.

 (2.) He will then <I>allure them and speak comfortably to them,</I> 
 will <I>persuade them</I> and <I>speak to their hearts,</I> that is, he 
 will by his word and Spirit incline their hearts to return to him, and 
 encourage them to do so. He will allure them with the promises of his 
 favour, as before he had terrified them with the threatenings of his 
 wrath, will speak friendly to them, both by his prophets and by his 
 providences, as before he had spoken roughly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:1,2">Isa. xl. 1, 2</A>.

 <I>By the hand of my servants the prophets I will speak comfort to her
 heart;</I> so the Chaldee. This refers to the gospel of Christ, and the 
 offers of divine grace in the gospel, by which we are allured to 
 forsake our sins and to turn to God, and which speaks to the heart of a 
 convinced sinner that which is every way suited to his case, speaks 
 abundant consolation to those that sorrow for sin and lament after the 
 Lord. And when by the Spirit it is indeed spoken to the heart 
 effectually, and so as to reach the conscience (which it is God's 
 prerogative to do), O what a blessed change is wrought by it! Note, The 
 best way of reducing wandering souls to God is by fair means. By the 
 promise of rest in Christ we are invited to take his yoke upon us; and 
 the work of conversion may be forwarded by comforts as well as by 
 convictions.

 (3.) <I>He will give her her vineyards thence.</I> From that time and 
 from that place where he has afflicted her, and brought her to see her 
 folly and to humble herself, thenceforward he will <I>do her good;</I> 
 not only speak comfortably to her, but do well for her, and undo what 
 he had done against her. He had <I>destroyed her vines</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 but now he will give her whole <I>vineyards,</I> as if for every vine 
 destroyed she should have a vineyard restored, and so be repaid with 
 interest; she shall not only have corn for necessity, but vineyards for 
 delight. These denote the privileges and comforts of the gospel, which
 are prepared for those that <I>come up out of the wilderness leaning 
 upon</I> Christ as <I>their beloved,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:5">Cant. viii. 5</A>.

 Note, God has vineyards of consolation ready to bestow on those who
 repent and return to him; and he can give vineyards <I>out of a 
 wilderness,</I> which are of all others the most welcome, as rest to 
 the weary.

 (4.) He will give her <I>the valley of Achor for a door of hope. The 
 valley of Achor</I> was that in which Achan was stoned; it signifies 
 <I>the valley of trouble,</I> because he troubled Israel, and there God 
 troubled him. This was the beginning of the wars of Canaan; and their
 putting away the accursed thing in that place gave them ground to hope 
 that God would continue his presence with them and complete their 
 victories. So when God returns to his people in mercy, and they to him 
 in duty, it will be to them as happy an omen as any thing. If they put 
 away the accursed thing from among them, if by mortifying sin they 
 stone the Achan that has troubled their camp, their subduing that enemy 
 within themselves is an earnest to them of victory over all the kings 
 of Canaan. Or, if the allusion be to the name, it intimates that 
 trouble for sin, if it be sincere, opens a door of hope; for that sin 
 which truly troubles us shall not ruin us. The valley of Achor was a 
 very fruitful pleasant valley, some think the same with the valley of 
 Engedi, famous for vineyards, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:14">Cant. i. 14</A>.

 This God gave to Israel as a pattern and pledge of the whole land of
 Canaan; so "God will by his gospel give to all believers such gifts, 
 graces, and comforts in this life, as shall be a taste of those more 
 perfect good things of the kingdom of heaven, and shall give them as 
 assured hope of a full possession of them in due time." So the learned 
 Dr. Pocock expounds it; and, to the same purport, this whole
 context.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The great rejoicing with which they shall receive God's gracious 
 returns towards them: <I>She shall sing there as in the days of her 
 youth.</I> This plainly refers to that triumphant and prophetic song 
 which Moses and the children of Israel sang at the <I>Red Sea,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:1">Exod. xv. 1</A>.

 When they are delivered out of captivity they shall repeat that song,
 and to them it shall be a new song, because sung upon a new occasion, 
 not inferior to the former. God had said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)

 that he would <I>cause all her mirth to cease,</I> but now he would 
 cause it to revive: She shall sing <I>as in the day that she came out 
 of Egypt.</I> Note, When God repeats former mercies we must repeat 
 former praises; we find the song of Moses sung in the New Testament, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+15:3">Rev. xv. 3</A>.

 This promise of Israel's singing has its accomplishment in the gospel 
 of Christ, which furnishes us with abundant matter for joy and praise, 
 and wherever it is received in its power enlarges the heart in joy and 
 praise; and this is that land flowing with milk and honey which <I>the 
 valley of Achor</I> opens <I>a door of hope to.</I> We <I>rejoice in 
 tribulation.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That, though they had been much addicted to the worship of Baal, 
 they should now be perfectly weaned from it, should relinquish and 
 abandon all appearances of idolatry and approaches towards it, and 
 cleave to God only, and worship him as he appoints, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 Note, The surest pledge and token of God's favour to any people is his 
 effectual parting between them and their beloved sins. The worship of 
 Baal was the sin that did most easily beset the people of Israel; it 
 was their own iniquity, the sin that had dominion over them; but now 
 that idolatry shall be quite abolished, and there shall not be the 
 least remains of it among them. 

 1. The idols of Baal shall not be mentioned, not any of the Baals that
 <I>in the days of Baalim</I> had made so great a noise with, <I>O Baal! 
 hear us; O Baal! hear us.</I> The very <I>names of Baalim</I> shall be 
 <I>taken out of their mouths;</I> they shall be so disused that they 
 shall be quite forgotten, as if their names had never been known in 
 Israel; they shall be so detested that people will not bear to mention 
 them themselves, nor to hear others mention them, so that posterity 
 shall scarcely know that ever there were such things. They shall be so 
 ashamed of their former love to Baal that they shall do all they can to 
 blot out the remembrance of it. They shall tie themselves up to the 
 strictest literal meaning of that law against idolatry

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:13">Exod. xxiii. 13</A>),

 <I>Make no mention of the names of other gods, neither let it be heard
 out of thy mouth,</I> as David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:4">Ps. xvi. 4</A>.

 Thus the apostle expresses the abhorrence we ought to have of all
 fleshly lusts: <I>Let them not be once named among you,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:3">Eph. v. 3</A>.

 But how can such a change of the Ethiopian's skin be wrought? It is
 answered, The power of God can do it, and will. <I>I will take away
 the names of Baalim;</I> as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:2">Zech. xiii. 2</A>,

 <I>I will cut off the names of the idols.</I> Note, God's grace in the
 heart will change the language by making that iniquity to be loathed 
 which was beloved.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:9">Zeph. iii. 9</A>,

 <I>I will turn to the people a pure language.</I> One of the rabbin
 says, This promise relates to the Gentiles, by the gospel of Christ, 
 from the idolatries which they had been wedded to,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+1:9">1 Thess. i. 9</A>.

 2. The very word Baal shall be laid aside, even in its innocent
 signification. God says, <I>Thou shalt call me Ishi, and call me no 
 more Baali;</I> both signify <I>my husband,</I> and both had been made 
 use of concerning God. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:5">Isa. liv. 5</A>,

 <I>Thy Maker is thy husband,</I> thy <I>Baal</I> (so the word is), thy
 owner, patron, and protector. It is probable that many good people had, 
 accordingly, made use of the word <I>Baali</I> in worshipping the God 
 of Israel; when their wicked neighbours bowed the knee to Baal they 
 gloried in this, that God was their Baal. "But," says God, "you shall 
 call me so no more, because I will have the very names of Baalim taken 
 away." Note, That which is very innocent in itself should, when it has 
 been abused to idolatry, be abolished, and the very use of it taken 
 away, that nothing may be done to keep idols in remembrance, much less 
 to keep them in reputation. When calling God <I>Ishi</I> will do as
 well, and signify as much, as <I>Baali,</I> let that word be chosen 
 rather, lest, by calling him Baali, others should be put in mind of 
 their <I>quondam</I> Baals. Some think that there is another reason
 intimated why God would be called <I>Ishi</I> and not <I>Baali;</I> 
 they both signify <I>my husband,</I> but <I>Ishi</I> is a compellation 
 of love, and sweetness, and familiarity, <I>Baali</I> of reverence and 
 subjection. Ishi is <I>vir meus--my man;</I> Baali is <I>dominus 
 meus--my lord.</I> In gospel-times God has so revealed himself to us as 
 to encourage us to come boldly to the throne of his grace, and to use a 
 holy humble freedom there; we ought to call God our Master, for so he 
 is, but we are more taught to call him our Father. <I>Ishi</I> is <I>a 
 man the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:1">Gen. iv. 1</A>),

 and intimates that in gospel-times the church's husband shall be <I>the
 man Christ Jesus,</I> made like unto his brethren, and therefore they 
 shall call him <I>Ishi,</I> not <I>Baali.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That though they had been in continual troubles, as if the whole 
 creation had been at war with them, now they shall enjoy perfect peace 
 and tranquillity, as if they were in a league of friendship with the 
 whole creation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>In that day,</I> when they have forsaken their idols, and put 
 themselves under the divine protection, <I>I will make a covenant for 
 them.</I> 

 1. They shall be protected from evil; nothing shall hurt them, nor do
 them any mischief. <I>Tranquillus Deus tranquillat amnia--When God is 
 at peace with us he makes every creature to be so too.</I> The inferior 
 creatures shall do them no harm, as they had done when the <I>beasts of 
 the field</I> ate up their vineyards

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>)

 and when <I>noisome beasts</I> were one of God's <I>sore judgments,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:15">Ezek. xiv. 15</A>.

 The <I>fowl</I> and the <I>creeping things</I> are taken into this
 covenant; for they also, when God makes use of them as the instruments 
 of his justice, may be come very hurtful, but they shall be no more so; 
 nay, by virtue of this covenant, they shall be made serviceable to them 
 and brought into their interests. Note, God has the command of the 
 inferior creatures, and brings them into what covenant he pleases; he 
 can make <I>the beasts of the field</I> to <I>honour</I> him (so he has 
 promised,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:20">Isa. xliii. 20</A>)

 and to contribute to his people's comfort. And, if the inferior
 creatures are thus laid under an engagement to serve us, it is our part 
 of the covenant not to abuse them, but to serve God with them. Some 
 think that this had its accomplishment in the miraculous power Christ 
 gave his disciples to <I>take up serpents,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:17,18">Mark xvi. 17, 18</A>.

 It agrees with the promises made particularly to Israel, in their
 return out of captivity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:25">Ezek. xxxiv. 25</A>,

 <I>I will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land</I>), and the
 more general ones to all the saints. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:22,23">Job v. 22, 23</A>,

 <I>The beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee;</I> and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:13">Ps. xci. 13</A>,

 <I>Thou shalt tread upon the lion and the adder.</I> But this is not
 all; men are more in danger from one another than from the brute beast, 
 and therefore it is further promised that God will <I>make wars to 
 cease,</I> will disarm the enemy: <I>I will break the bow, and sword, 
 and battle.</I> He can do it when he pleases

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:9">Ps. xliv. 9</A>),

 and will do it for those whose <I>ways please him,</I> for he <I>makes
 even their enemies to be at peace with them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+16:7">Prov. xvi. 7</A>.

 This agrees with the promise that in gospel-times <I>swords shall be 
 beaten into plough-shares,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:4">Isa. ii. 4</A>.

 2. They shall be quiet from the fear of evil. God will not only keep
 them safe, but <I>make them to lie down safely,</I> as those that know 
 themselves to be under the protection of Heaven, and therefore are not 
 afraid of the powers of hell.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That, though God had given them a bill of divorce for their 
 whoredoms, yet, upon their repentance, he would again take them into 
 covenant with himself, into a marriage-covenant, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 God's making a covenant for them with the inferior creatures was a 
 great favour; but it was nothing to this, that he took them into 
 covenant with himself and engaged himself to do them good.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The nature of this covenant; it is a <I>marriage-covenant,</I> 
 founded in choice and love, and founding the nearest relation: <I>I 
 will betroth thee unto me;</I> and again, and a third time, <I>I will 
 betroth thee.</I> Note, All that are sincerely devoted to God are 
 betrothed to him; God gives them the most sacred and inviolable 
 security imaginable that he will love them, protect them, and provide 
 for them, that he will do the part of a husband to them, and that he 
 will incline their hearts to join themselves to him and will graciously 
 accept of them in so doing. Believing souls are espoused to Christ, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:2">2 Cor. xi. 2</A>.

 The gospel-church is <I>the bride, the Lamb's wife;</I> and they would
 never come into that relation to him if he did not by the power of his 
 grace betroth them to himself. The separation begins on our side; we 
 alienate ourselves from God. The coalition begins on his side; he 
 betroths us to himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The duration of this covenant: "<I>I will betroth thee for ever.</I> 
 The covenant itself shall be inviolable; God will not break it on his 
 part, and you shall not on yours; and the blessings of it shall be 
 everlasting." One of the Jewish rabbin says, This is a promise that 
 <I>she shall attain to the life of the world to come, which is absolute 
 eternity or perpetuity.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The manner in which this covenant shall be made. 

 (1.) In <I>righteousness and judgment,</I> that is, God will deal 
 sincerely and uprightly in covenant with them; they have broken 
 covenant, and God is righteous. "But," says God, "I will renew the 
 covenant <I>in righteousness.</I>" The matter shall be so ordered that 
 God may receive even these backsliding children into his family again, 
 without any reflection upon his justice, nay, his justice being 
 satisfied by the Mediator of this covenant very much to the honour of 
 it. But what reason can there be why God should take a people into 
 covenant with him that had so often dealt treacherously? Will it not 
 reflect upon his wisdom? "No," says God; "I will do it <I>in 
 judgment,</I> not rashly, but upon due consideration; let me alone to 
 give a reason for it and to justify my own conduct." 

 (2.) <I>In lovingkindness and in mercies.</I> God will deal tenderly 
 and graciously in covenanting with them; and will be not only as good 
 as his word, but better; and, as he will be just in keeping covenant 
 with them, so he will be merciful in keeping them in the covenant. They 
 are subject to many infirmities, and, if he be extreme to mark what 
 they do amiss, they will soon lose the benefit of the covenant. He 
 therefore promises that it shall be a covenant of grace, made in a 
 compassionate consideration of their infirmities, so that every 
 transgression in the covenant shall not throw them out of covenant; he 
 will <I>gather with everlasting lovingkindness.</I> 

 (3.) <I>In faithfulness.</I> Every article of the covenant shall be 
 punctually performed. <I>Faithful is he that has called them, who also 
 will do it;</I> he cannot <I>deny himself.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The means by which they shall be kept tight and faithful to the 
 covenant on their part: <I>Thou shalt know the Lord.</I> This is not 
 only a promise that God will reveal himself to them more fully and 
 clearly than ever, but that he will give them <I>a heart to know 
 him;</I> they shall know more of him, and shall know him in another 
 manner than ever yet. The ground of their apostasy was their not 
 knowing God to be their benefactor 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 therefore, to prevent the like, they shall all be <I>taught of God</I> 
 to know him. Note, God keeps up his interest in men's souls by giving 
 them a good understanding and a right knowledge of things, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:11">Heb. viii. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. That, though the heavens had been to them as brass, and the earth as 
 iron, now the heavens shall yield their dews, and by that means the 
 earth its fruits, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.

 God having betrothed the gospel-church and in it all believers to 
 himself, how shall he not with himself and with his Son freely <I>give 
 them all things,</I> all things pertaining both to life and godliness, 
 all things they need or can desire? <I>All is theirs,</I> for they are 
 <I>Christ's,</I> betrothed to him; and with the righteousness of the 
 kingdom of God, which they <I>seek first,</I> all <I>other things</I> 
 shall be <I>added unto them.</I> And yet this promise of <I>corn and 
 wine</I> is to be taken also in a spiritual sense (so the learned Dr. 
 Pocock thinks): it is an effusion of those blessings and graces which 
 relate to the soul that is here promised under the metaphor of temporal 
 blessings, the dew of heaven, as well as the fatness of the earth, and 
 that put first, as in the blessing of Jacob, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:28">Gen. xxvii. 28</A>.

 God had threatened

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 that he would <I>take away the corn and the wine;</I> but now he 
 promises to restore them, and that in the common course and order of 
 nature. While they lay under the judgment of famine they called to the 
 earth for <I>corn and wine</I> for the support of themselves and their 
 families. Very gladly would the earth have supplied them, but she 
 cannot give unless she receive, cannot produce <I>corn and wine</I> 
 unless she be <I>enriched with the river of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:9">Ps. lxv. 9</A>);

 and therefore she calls to the heavens for rain, the former and latter
 rain in their season, grapes for it, and by her melancholy aspect when 
 rain is denied pleads for it. "But," say the heavens, "we have no rain 
 to give unless he who has the key of the clouds unlock them, and open 
 these bottles; so that, <I>if the Lord do not help you,</I> we cannot." 
 But, when God takes them into covenant with himself, then the wheel of 
 nature shall be set a-going again in favour of them, and the streams of 
 mercy shall flow in the usual channel: Then <I>I will hear, saith the 
 Lord; I will receive your prayers</I> (so the Chaldee interprets the 
 first <I>hearing</I>); God will graciously take notice of their 
 addresses to him. And then <I>I will hear the heavens;</I> I will 
 <I>answer</I> them (so it may be read); and then they shall <I>hear and 
 answer the earth,</I> and pour down seasonable rain upon it; and then 
 the <I>earth</I> shall <I>hear the corn and vines,</I> and supply them 
 with moisture, and <I>they shall hear Jezreel,</I> and be nourishment 
 and refreshment for those that inhabit Jezreel. See here the coherence 
 of second causes with one another, as links in a chain, and the 
 necessary dependence they all have upon God, the first Cause. Note, We 
 must expect all our comforts from God in the usual method and by the 
 appointed means; and, when we are at any time disappointed in them, we 
 must look up to God, <I>above the hills and the mountains,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+121:1,2">Ps. cxxi. 1, 2</A>.

 See how ready the creatures are to serve the people of God, how 
 desirous of the honour: the corn cries to the earth, the earth to the 
 heavens, the heavens to God, and all that they may supply them. And see 
 how ready God is to give relief: <I>I will hear,</I> saith the Lord, 
 <I>yea, I will hear.</I> And, if God will hear the cry of the heavens 
 for his people, much more will he hear the intercession of his Son for 
 them, who is made <I>higher than the heavens.</I> See what a peculiar 
 delight those that are in covenant with God may take in their 
 creature-comforts, as seeing them all come to them from the hand of 
 God; they can trace up all the streams to the fountain, and taste 
 covenant-love in common mercies, which makes them doubly sweet.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. That whereas they were now dispersed, not only, as Simeon and Levi, 
 divided in Jacob and scattered in Israel, but divided and scattered all 
 the world over, God will turn this curse, as he did that, into a 
 blessing: "I will not only water the earth for her, but will <I>sow her 
 unto me in the earth;</I> her dispersion shall be not like that of the 
 chaff in the floor, which <I>the wind drives away,</I> but like that of 
 the seed in the field, in order to its greater increase; wherever they 
 are scattered they shall <I>take root downward and bear fruit upward. 
 The good seed are the children of the kingdom. I will sow her unto 
 me.</I>" This alludes to the name of Jezreel, which signifies <I>sown 
 of God,</I> or <I>for God;</I> as she was scattered of him (which is 
 one signification of the words) so she shall be sown of him; and to 
 what he sows he will give the increase. When in all parts of the world 
 Christianity got footing, and every where there were professors of it, 
 then this promise was fulfilled, <I>I will sow her unto me in the 
 earth.</I> Note, The greatest blessing of this earth is that God has a 
 church in it, and from that arises all the tribute of glory which he 
 has out of it; it is what he has sown to himself, and what he will 
 therefore secure to himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. That, whereas they had been <I>Lo-ammi--not a people,</I> and
 <I>Lo-ruhamah--not finding mercy</I> with God, now they shall be
 restored to his favour and taken again into covenant with him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):
 
 They <I>had not obtained mercy,</I> but seemed to be abandoned; they 
 were <I>not my people,</I> not distinguished, not dealt with, as my 
 people, but left to lie in common with the nations. This was the case 
 with the rejected Jews; and the same, or more deplorable, was that of 
 the Gentile world (to whom the apostle applies this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:24,25">Rom. ix. 24, 25</A>),
 
 that had <I>no hope,</I> and was <I>without God in the world;</I> but
 when great multitudes both of Jews and Gentiles were, upon their 
 believing in Christ, incorporated into a Christian church, then, 

 1. God had mercy on those who <I>had not obtained mercy.</I> Those
 found favour with God, and became the children of his love, who had 
 been long out of favour and the children of his wrath, and, if infinite 
 mercy had not interposed, would have been for ever so. Note, God's 
 mercy must not be despaired of any where on this side hell. 

 2. He took those into a covenant-relation to himself who had been 
 strangers and foreigners. He says to them, "<I>Thou art my people,</I> 
 whom I will own and bless, protect and provide for;" and they shall 
 say, "<I>Thou art my God,</I> whom I will serve and worship, and to 
 whose honour I will be entirely and for ever devoted." Note,

 (1.) The sum total of the happiness of believers is the mutual relation 
 that is between them and God, that he is theirs and they are his; this 
 is the crown of all the promises. 

 (2.) This relation is founded in free grace. We have not chosen him, 
 but he has chosen us. He first says, They are my people, and makes them 
 willing to be so in the day of his power, and then they avouch him to 
 be theirs. 

 (3.) As we need desire no more to make us happy than to be the people 
 of God, so we need desire no more to make us easy and cheerful than to 
 have him to assure us that we are so, to say unto us, by his Spirit 
 witnessing with ours, <I>Thou art my people.</I> 

 (4.) Those that have accepted the Lord for their God must avouch him to 
 be so, must go to him in prayer and tell him so, <I>Thou art my 
 God,</I> and must be ready to make profession before men. 

 (5.) It adds to the comfort of our covenant with God that in it there 
 is a communion of saints, who, though they <I>are many,</I> yet here 
 are one. It is not, I will <I>say to them, You are my people,</I> but, 
 <I>Thou</I> art; for he looks upon them as all <I>one in Christ,</I> 
 and, as such in him, he speaks to them and covenants with them; and 
 they also do not say, Thou art <I>our God,</I> for they look upon 
 themselves as one body, and desire with one mind and one mouth to 
 glorify him, and therefore say, <I>Thou art my God.</I> Or it intimates 
 that such a covenant as God made of old with his people Israel, in 
 general, now under the gospel he makes with particular believers, and 
 says to <I>each of them,</I> even the meanest, with as much pleasure as 
 he did of old to the <I>thousands of Israel, Thou art my people,</I>
 and invites and encourages each of them to say, <I>Thou art my God,</I>
 and to triumph therein, as Moses and all Israel did.

 He is <I>my God,</I> and my <I>father's God.</I></P>
