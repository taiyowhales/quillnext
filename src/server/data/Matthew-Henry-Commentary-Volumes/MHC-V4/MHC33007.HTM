 In this chapter, 

 I. The prophet, in the name of the church, sadly laments the woeful
 decay of religion in the age wherein he lived, and the deluge of 
 impiety and immorality which overwhelmed the nation, which levelled the 
 differences, and bore down the fences, of all that is just and sacred, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. The prophet, for the sake of the church, prescribes comforts, which
 may be of use at such a time, and gives counsel what to do. 

 1. They must have an eye to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:7">ver. 7</A>.

 2. They must courageously bear up against the insolences of the enemy,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:8-10">ver. 8-10</A>.

 3. They must patiently lie down under the rebukes of their God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:9">ver. 9</A>.
 
 4. They must expect no other than that the trouble would continue long, 
 and must endeavour to make the best of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:11-13">ver. 11-13</A>.

 5. They must encourage themselves with God's promises, in answer to
 the prophet's prayers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:14,15">ver. 14, 15</A>.

 6. They must foresee the fall of their enemies, that now triumphed
 over them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:16,17">ver. 16, 17</A>.

 7. They must themselves triumph in the mercy and grace of God, and his 
 faithfulness to his covenant 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:18-20">ver. 18-20</A>),

 and with that comfortable word the prophecy concludes.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer
 fruits, as the grape-gleanings of the vintage: <I>there is</I> no
 cluster to eat: my soul desired the first-ripe fruit.
 &nbsp; 2 The good <I>man</I> is perished out of the earth: and <I>there is</I>
 none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt
 every man his brother with a net.
 &nbsp; 3 That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince
 asketh, and the judge <I>asketh</I> for a reward; and the great <I>man,</I>
 he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.
 &nbsp; 4 The best of them <I>is</I> as a brier: the most upright <I>is
 sharper</I> than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen <I>and</I> thy
 visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity.
 &nbsp; 5 Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide:
 keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.
 &nbsp; 6 For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up
 against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in
 law; a man's enemies <I>are</I> the men of his own house.

 This is such a description of bad times as, some think, could scarcely 
 agree to the times of Hezekiah, when this prophet prophesied; and 
 therefore they rather take it as a prediction of what should be in the 
 reign of Manasseh. But we may rather suppose it to be in the reign of 
 Ahaz (and in that reign he prophesied, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+1:1"><I>ch.</I> i. 1</A>)

 or in the beginning of Hezekiah's time, before the reformation he was
 instrumental in; nay, in the best of his days, and when he had done his 
 best to purge out corruptions, still there was much amiss. The prophet 
 cries out, <I>Woe is me!</I> He bemoans himself that his lot was cast 
 in such a degenerate age, and thinks it his great unhappiness that he 
 lived among a people that were ripening apace for a ruin which many a 
 good man would unavoidably be involved in. Thus David cries out, <I>Woe 
 is me that I sojourn in Mesech!</I> He laments, 

 1. That there were so few good people to be found, even among those
 that were God's people; and this was their reproach: <I>The good man 
 has perished out of the earth,</I> or <I>out of the land,</I> the land 
 of Canaan; it was a <I>good land,</I> and <I>a land of uprightness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:10">Isa. xxvi. 10</A>),

 but there were few good men in it, none upright among them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The <I>good man</I> is a <I>godly man</I> and a <I>merciful man;</I> 
 the word signifies both. Those are completely good men that are devout 
 towards God and compassionate and beneficent towards men, that love 
 mercy and walk with God. "These have perished; those few honest men 
 that some time ago enriched and adorned our country are now dead and 
 gone, and there are none risen up <I>in their stead</I> that tread in 
 their steps; honesty is banished, and there is no such thing as a good 
 man to be met with. Those that were of religious education have 
 degenerated, and become as bad as the worst; <I>the godly man 
 ceases,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:1">Ps. xii. 1</A>.
 
 This is illustrated by a comparison
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 they were <I>as when they have gathered the summer fruits;</I> it was 
 as hard a thing to find a good man as to find any of the summer-fruits 
 (which were the choicest and best, and therefore must carefully be 
 gathered in) when the harvest is over. The prophet is ready to say, as 
 Elijah in his time 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:10">1 Kings xix. 10</A>),

 <I>I, even I only, am left.</I> Good men, who used to hang in clusters,
 are now as the <I>grape-gleanings of the vintage,</I> here and there a
 berry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+17:6">Isa. xvii. 6</A>.

 You can find no societies of them as bunches of grapes, but those that
 are are single persons: <I>There is no cluster to eat;</I> and the best 
 and fullest grapes are those that grow in large clusters. Some think 
 that this intimates not only that good people were few, but that those 
 few who remained, who went for good people, were good for little, like 
 the small withered grapes, the refuse that were left behind, not only 
 by the gatherer, but by the gleaner. When the prophet observed this 
 universal degeneracy it made him <I>desire the first-ripe fruit;</I> he 
 wished to see such worthy good men as were in the former ages, were the 
 ornaments of the primitive times, and as far excelled the best of all 
 the present age as the first and full-ripe fruits do those of the 
 latter growth, that never come to maturity. When we read and hear of 
 the wisdom and zeal, the strictness and conscientiousness, the devotion 
 and charity, of the professors of religion in former ages, and see the 
 reverse of this in those of the present age, we cannot but sit down, 
 and wish, with a sigh, <I>O for primitive Christianity again!</I> Where 
 are the plainness and integrity of those that went before us? Where are 
 the Israelites indeed, without guile? Our souls desire them, but in 
 vain. The golden age is gone, and past recall; we must make the best
 of what is, for we are not likely to see such times as have been. 

 2. That there were so many wicked mischievous people among them, not
 only none that did any good, but multitudes that did all the hurt they 
 could: "<I>They all lie in wait for blood,</I> and <I>hunt every man 
 his brother.</I> To get wealth to themselves, they care not what wrong, 
 what hurt, they do to their neighbours and nearest relations. They act 
 as if mankind were in a state of war, and force were the only right.
 They are as beasts of prey to their neighbours, for <I>they all lie in 
 wait for blood</I> as lions for their prey; they thirst after it, make 
 nothing of taking away any man's life or livelihood to serve a turn for 
 themselves, and lie in wait for an opportunity to do it. Their 
 neighbours are as beasts of prey to them, for they <I>hunt every man 
 his brother with a net;</I> they persecute them as noxious creatures, 
 fit to be taken and destroyed, though they are innocent excellent 
 ones." We say of him that is outlawed, <I>Caput gerit lupinum--He is to 
 be hunted as a wolf.</I> "Or they hunt them as men do the game, to 
 feast upon it; they have a thousand cursed arts of ensnaring men to 
 their ruin, so that they may but get by it. Thus <I>they do mischief 
 with both hands earnestly;</I> their hearts desire it, their heads 
 contrive it, and then <I>both hands</I> are ready to put it in 
 execution." Note, The more eager and intent men are upon any sinful 
 pursuit, and the more pains they take in it, the more provoking it is.
 
 3. That the magistrates, who by their office ought to have been the
 patrons and protectors of right, were the practicers and promoters of 
 wrong: <I>That they may do evil with both hands earnestly,</I> to 
 excite and animate themselves in it, <I>the prince asketh, and the 
 judge asketh, for a reward,</I> for a bribe, with which they well be 
 hired to exert all their power for the supporting and carrying on of 
 any wicked design <I>with both hands. They do evil with both hands 
 well</I> (so some read it); they do evil with a great deal of art and 
 dexterity; they praise themselves for doing it so well. Others read it 
 thus: <I>To do evil they have both hands</I> (they catch at an 
 opportunity of doing mischief), <I>but to do good the prince and the 
 judge ask for a reward;</I> if they do any good offices they are 
 mercenary in them, and must be paid for them. The great man, who has 
 wealth and power to do good, is not ashamed to utter his mischievous 
 desire in conjunction with the prince and the judge, who are ready to 
 support him and stand by him in it. <I>So they wrap it up;</I> they 
 perplex the matter, involve it, and make it intricate (so some 
 understand it), that they may lose equity in a mist, and so make the 
 cause turn which way they please. It is ill with a people when their 
 princes, and judges, and great men are in a confederacy to pervert 
 justice. And it is a sad character that is given of them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 that <I>the best of them is as a brier, and the most upright is sharper 
 than a thorn-hedge;</I> it is a dangerous thing to have any thing to do 
 with them; <I>he that touches them must be fenced with iron</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+23:6,7">2 Sam. xxiii. 6, 7</A>),

 he shall be sure to be scratched, to have his clothes torn, and his
 eyes almost pulled out. And, if this be the character of the best and 
 most upright, what are the worst? And, when things have come to this 
 pass, <I>the day of thy watchmen comes,</I> that is, as it follows, 
 <I>the day of thy visitation,</I> when God will reckon with thee for 
 all this wickedness, which is called <I>the day of the watchmen,</I> 
 because their prophets, whom God set as watchmen over them, had often 
 warned them of that day. When all flesh have corrupted their way, even 
 the best and the most upright, what can be expected but a day of 
 visitation, a deluge of judgments, as that which drowned the old world 
 when <I>the earth was filled with violence?</I> 

 4. That there was no faith in man; people had grown so universally
 treacherous that one knew not whom to repose any confidence in,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 "Those that have any sense of honour, or spark of virtue, remaining in 
 them, have a firm regard to the laws of friendship; they would not 
 discover what passed in private conversation, nor divulge secrets, to 
 the prejudice of a friend. But those things are now made a jest of; you 
 will not meet with a friend that you dare trust, whose word you dare 
 take, or who will have any tenderness or concern for you; so that wise 
 men shall give it and take it for a rule, <I>trust you not in a 
 friend,</I> for you will find him false, you can trust him no further 
 than you can see him; and even him that passes for an honest man you 
 will find to be so only with good looking to. Nay, as for him that 
 undertakes to be <I>your guide,</I> to lead you into any business which 
 he professes to understand better than you, you cannot <I>put a 
 confidence</I> in him, for he will be sure to mislead you if he can get 
 any thing by it." Some by a guide understand a husband, who is called 
 <I>the guide of thy youth;</I> and that agrees well enough with what 
 follows, "<I>Keep the doors of thy lips from her that lieth in thy 
 bosom,</I> from thy own wife; take heed what thou sayest before her, 
 lest she betray thee, as Delilah did Samson, lest she be the <I>bird of 
 the air</I> that <I>carries the voice</I> of that which thou sayest 
 <I>in thy bed-chamber,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:20">Eccl. x. 20</A>.

 It is an evil time indeed when the prudent are obliged even thus far to
 keep silence.

 5. That children were abusive to their parents, and men had no comfort,
 no satisfaction, in their own families and their nearest relations,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 The times are bad indeed when <I>the son dishonours his father,</I> 
 gives him bad language, exposes him, threatens him, and studies to do 
 him a mischief, <I>when the daughter rises up</I> in rebellion against 
 her own mother, having no sense of duty, or natural affection; and no 
 marvel that then the <I>daughter-in-law</I> quarrels with her 
 <I>mother-in-law,</I> and is vexatious to her. Either they cannot agree 
 about their property and interest, or their humours and passions clash, 
 or from a spirit of bigotry and persecution, <I>the brother shall 
 deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:4,Lu+21:16">Matt. x. 4; Luke xxi. 16</A>.

 It is sad when a man's betrayers and worst enemies are the men of his
 own house, his own children and servants, that should be his guard and 
 his best friends. Note, The contempt and violation of the laws of 
 domestic duties are a sad symptom of a universal corruption of manners. 
 Those are never likely to come to good that are undutiful to their 
 parents, and study to be provoking to them and cross them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet, having sadly complained of the wickedness of the times he 
 lived in, here fastens upon some considerations for the comfort of 
 himself and his friends, in reference thereunto. The case is bad, but
 it is not desperate. <I>Yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this 
 thing.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. "Though God be now displeased he shall be reconciled to us, and then 
 all will be well, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:7,9"><I>v.</I> 7, 9</A>.

 We are now under <I>the indignation of the Lord;</I> God is angry with 
 us, and justly, because <I>we have sinned against him.</I>" Note, It is 
 our sin against God that provokes his indignation against us; and we 
 must see it, and own it, whenever we are under divine rebukes, that we 
 may justify God, and may study to answer his end in afflicting us, by 
 repenting of sin and breaking off from it. Now, at such a time,

 1. We must have recourse to God under our troubles

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Therefore I will look unto the Lord.</I> When a child of God has 
 ever so much occasion to cry, <I>Woe is me</I> (as the prophet here, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 yet it may be a comfort to him that he has a God to look to, a God to 
 come to, to fly to, in whom he may rejoice and have satisfaction. All
 may look bright above him when all looks black and dark about him. The
 prophet had been complaining that there was no comfort to be had, no 
 confidence to be put, in friends and relations on earth, and this 
 drives him to his God: <I>Therefore I will look unto the Lord.</I> The 
 less reason we have to delight in any creature the more reason we have 
 to delight in God. If princes are not to be trusted, we may say, 
 <I>Happy is the man that has</I> the God of Jacob for his help, and 
 <I>happy am I,</I> even in the midst of my present woes, if he be my 
 help. If men be false, this is our comfort, that God is faithful; if 
 relations be unkind, he is and will be gracious. Let us therefore look
 above and beyond them, and overlook our disappointment in them, and 
 look unto the Lord. 

 2. We must submit to the will of God in our troubles: "<I>I will bear
 the indignation of the Lord,</I> will bear it patiently, without 
 murmuring and repining, <I>because I have sinned against him.</I>" 
 Note, Those that are truly penitent for sin will see a great deal of 
 reason to be patient under affliction. <I>Wherefore should a man 
 complain for the punishment of his sin?</I> When we complain to God of 
 the badness of the times we ought to complain against ourselves for the 
 badness of our own hearts.

 3. We must depend upon God to work deliverance for us, and put a good
 issue to our troubles in due time; we must not only look to him, but 
 look for him: "I will <I>wait for the God of my salvation,</I> and for 
 his gracious returns to me." In our greatest distresses we shall see no 
 reason to despair of salvation if by faith we eye God as the <I>God of 
 our salvation,</I> who is able to save the weakest upon their humble 
 petition, and willing to save the worst upon their true repentance.
 And, if we depend on God as the God of our salvation, we must wait for 
 him, and for his salvation, in his own way and his own time. Let us now 
 see what the church is here taught to expect and promise herself from 
 God, even when things are brought to the last extremity.

 (1.) <I>My God will hear me;</I> if the Lord be our God, he will hear 
 our prayers, and grant an answer of peace to them. 

 (2.) "<I>When I fall,</I> and am in danger of being dashed in pieces by 
 the fall, yet <I>I shall arise,</I> and recover myself again. <I>I 
 fall,</I> but am not <I>utterly cast down,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:24">Ps. xxxvii. 24</A>.

 (3.) "<I>When I sit in darkness,</I> desolate and disconsolate, 
 melancholy and perplexed, and not knowing what to do, nor which way to 
 look for relief, yet then <I>the Lord shall be a light to me,</I> to 
 comfort and revive me, to instruct and teach me, to direct and guide 
 me, as a light to my eyes, a light to my feet, a light <I>in a dark 
 place.</I>" 

 (4.) <I>He will plead my cause, and execute judgment for me,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 If we heartily espouse the cause of God, the just but injured cause of 
 religion and virtue, and make it our cause, we may hope he will own our 
 cause, and plead it. The church's cause, though it seem for a time to 
 go against her, will at length be pleaded with jealousy, and judgment 
 not only given against, but executed upon, the enemies of it. 

 (5.) "He <I>will bring me forth to the light,</I> make me shine 
 eminently out of obscurity, and become conspicuous, will make my 
 righteousness shine evidently from under the dark cloud of calumny, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:6,Isa+58:10">Ps. xxxvii. 6; Isa. lviii. 10</A>.

 The morning of comfort shall shine forth out of the long and dark night
 of trouble."

 (6.) "<I>I shall behold his righteousness;</I> I shall see the equity 
 of his proceedings concerning me and the performance of his promises to 
 me."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Though enemies triumph and insult, they shall be silenced and put 
 to shame, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:8,10"><I>v.</I> 8, 10</A>.
 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How proudly the enemies of God's people trample upon them in their 
 distress. They said, <I>Where is the Lord their God?</I> As if because 
 they were afflicted God had forsaken them, and they knew not where to 
 find him with their prayers, and he knew not how to help them with his 
 favours. This David's enemies said to him, and it was a sword in his 
 bones, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:10">Ps. xlii. 10</A>,
 
 and see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:2">Ps. cxv. 2</A>.

 Thus, in reproaching Israel as an abandoned people, they reflected on
 the God of Israel as an unkind unfaithful God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How comfortably the people of God by faith bear up themselves under 
 these insults 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>Rejoice not against me, O my enemy!</I> I am now down, but shall 
 not be always so, and when my God appears for me then <I>she that is my 
 enemy shall see it, and be ashamed</I>" (not only being disappointed in 
 her expectations of the church's utter ruin, but having the same cup of 
 trembling put into her hand), "then <I>my eyes shall behold her</I> in 
 the same deplorable condition that I am now in; <I>now shall she be 
 trodden down.</I>" Note, The deliverance of the church will be the 
 confusion of her enemies; and their shame shall be double, when, as 
 they have trampled upon God's people, so they shall themselves be 
 trampled upon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Though the land continue a great while desolate, yet it shall at 
 length be replenished again, when the time, even the set time, of its 
 deliverance comes. 

 1. Its salvation shall not come <I>till after it has been desolate;</I>
 so the margin reads it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 God has a controversy with the land, and it must lie long under his
 rebukes, <I>because of those that dwell therein;</I> it is their 
 iniquity that makes their land desolate 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:34">Ps. cvii. 34</A>);

 it is <I>for the fruit of their doings,</I> their evil doings which
 they have been themselves guilty of, and the evil fruit of them, the 
 sins of others, which they have been accessory to by their bad 
 influence and example. For this they must expect to smart a great
 while; for the world shall know that God hates sin even in his own 
 people. 

 2. When it does come it shall be a complete salvation; and it seems to
 refer to their deliverance out of Babylon by Cyrus, which Isaiah about 
 this time prophesied of, as a type of our redemption by Christ.

 (1.) <I>The decree shall be far removed.</I> God's decree concerning 
 their captivity, and Nebuchadnezzar's decree concerning the perpetuity 
 of it, his resolution never to release them, "these shall be set aside 
 and revoked, and you shall hear no more of them; they shall no more lie 
 as a yoke upon thy neck." 

 (2.) Jerusalem and the cities of Judah shall be again reared: Then 
 <I>thy walls shall be built,</I> walls for habitation, walls for 
 defence, house-walls, town-walls, temple-walls; it is in order to these 
 that the decree is repealed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:28">Isa. xliv. 28</A>.

 Though Zion's walls may lie long in ruins, there will come a day when 
 they shall be repaired.

 (3.) All that belong to the land of Israel, whithersoever dispersed,
 and howsoever distressed, far and wide over the face of the whole 
 earth, shall come flocking to it again

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):
 
 <I>He shall come even to thee,</I> having liberty to return and a heart 
 to return, from Assyria, whither the ten tribes were carried away, 
 though it lay remote, and <I>from the fortified cities,</I> and <I>from 
 the fortress,</I> those strongholds in which they thought they had them 
 fast; for when God's time comes, though Pharaoh will not <I>let the 
 people go,</I> God will fetch them out with a high hand. They shall 
 come from all the remote parts, <I>from sea to sea</I> and <I>from 
 mountain to mountain,</I> not turning back for fear of your 
 discouragements, but they shall go from strength to strength till they 
 come to Zion. Thus in the great day of redemption <I>God will gather 
 his elect from the four winds.</I></P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The prophet's prayer to God to take care of his own people, and of 
 their cause and interest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 When God is about to deliver his people he stirs up their friends to 
 pray for them, and pours out <I>a spirit of grace and supplication,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:10">Zech. xii. 10</A>.

 And when we see God coming towards us in ways of mercy, we must go
 forth to meet him by prayer. It is a prophetic prayer, which amounts to 
 a promise of the good prayed for; what God directed his prophet to ask 
 no doubt he designed to give. Now,

 1. The people of Israel are here called the <I>flock of God's
 heritage,</I> for they are the sheep of his hand, the sheep of his 
 pasture, his little flock in the world; and they are his heritage, his 
 portion in the world. <I>Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.</I>

 2. This flock <I>dwells solitarily in the wood,</I> or <I>forest, in
 the midst of Carmel,</I> a high mountain. Israel was a peculiar people, 
 <I>that dwelt alone, and was not reckoned among the nations,</I> like a 
 flock of sheep in a wood. They were now a desolate people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 were in the land of their captivity as sheep in a forest, in danger of 
 being lost and made a prey of to the beasts of the forest. They are 
 <I>scattered upon the mountains as sheep having no shepherd.</I> 

 3. He prays that God would <I>feed them there with his rod,</I> that
 is, that he would take care of them in their captivity, would protect 
 them, and provide for them, and do the part of a good shepherd to them: 
 "Let <I>thy rod and staff comfort</I> them, even in that darksome 
 valley; and even there let them want nothing that is good for them. Let 
 them be governed by thy rod, not the rod of their enemies, for they are 
 thy people." 

 4. He prays that God would in due time bring them back to feed in the
 plains of Bashan and Gilead, and no longer to be fed in the woods and 
 mountains. <I>Let them feed</I> in their own country again, <I>as in
 the days of old.</I> Some apply this spiritually, and make it either 
 the prophet's prayer to Christ or his Father's charge to him, to take 
 care of his church, as the great Shepherd of the sheep, and to go in 
 and out before them while they are here in this world as in a wood, 
 that they may find pasture as in Carmel, as in Bashan and Gilead.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God's promise, in answer to this prayer; and we may well take God's 
 promises as real answers to the prayers of faith, and embrace them 
 accordingly, for with him saying and doing are not two things. The 
 prophet prayed that God would feed them, and do kind things for them; 
 but God answers that he <I>will show them marvellous things</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 will do for them more than they are able to ask or think, will out-do 
 their hopes and expectations; he will <I>show them his marvellous 
 lovingkindness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:7">Ps. xvii. 7</A>.

 1. He will do that for them which shall be the repetition of the
 wonders and miracles of former ages--<I>according to the days of thy 
 coming out of the land of Egypt.</I> Their deliverance out of Babylon 
 shall be a work of wonder and grace not inferior to their deliverance 
 out of Egypt, nay, it shall eclipse the lustre of that

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:14,15">Jer. xvi. 14, 15</A>),

 much more shall the work of redemption by Christ. Note, God's former
 favours to his church are patterns of future favours, and shall again
 be copied out as there is occasion. 

 2. He will do that for them which shall be matter of wonder and
 amazement to the present age,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 The <I>nations about</I> shall take notice of it, and it shall be said 
 <I>among the heathen, The Lord has done great things for them,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+126:2">Ps. cxxvi. 2</A>.

 The impression which the deliverance of the Jews out of Babylon shall
 make upon the neighbouring nations shall be very much for the honour 
 both of God and his church.

 (1.) Those that had insulted over the people of God in their distress,
 and gloried that when they had them down they would keep them down, 
 <I>shall be confounded,</I> when they see them thus surprisingly rising 
 up; they shall be <I>confounded at all the might</I> with which the 
 captives shall now exert themselves, whom they thought for ever 
 disabled. They shall now <I>lay their hands upon their mouths,</I> as 
 being ashamed of what they have said, and not able to say more, by way 
 of triumph over Israel. Nay, <I>their ears shall be deaf</I> too, so 
 much shall they be ashamed at the wonderful deliverance; they shall 
 stop their ears, as being not willing to hear any more of God's wonders 
 wrought for that people, whom they had so despised and insulted over. 
 
 (2.) Those that had impudently confronted God himself shall now be 
 struck with a fear of him, and thereby brought, in profession at least, 
 to submit to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>They shall lick the dust like a serpent,</I> they shall be so 
 mortified, as if they were sentenced to the same curse the serpent was 
 laid under 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:14">Gen. iii. 14</A>),

 <I>Upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat.</I> They
 shall be brought to the lowest abasements imaginable, and shall be so 
 dispirited that they shall tamely submit to them. <I>His enemies shall 
 lick the dust,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:9">Ps. lxxii. 9</A>.

 Nay, they shall <I>lick the dust</I> of the church's feet,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:23">Isa. xlix. 23</A>.

 Proud oppressors shall now be made sensible how mean, how little, they
 are, before the great God, and they shall with trembling and the lowest 
 submission <I>move out of the holes</I> into which they had crept

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:21">Isa. ii. 21</A>),
 
 <I>like worms of the earth</I> as they are, being ashamed and afraid to
 <I>show their heads;</I> so low shall they be brought, and such abjects 
 shall they be, when they are abased. When God did wonders for his 
 church <I>many of the people of the land became Jews,</I> because 
 <I>the fear of the Jews,</I> and of their God, <I>fell upon them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+8:17">Esth. viii. 17</A>.

 So it is promised here: <I>They shall be afraid of the Lord our God,
 and shall fear because of thee, O Israel!</I> Forced submissions are 
 often but feigned submissions; yet they redound to the glory of God and 
 the church, though not to the benefit of the dissemblers 
 themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The prophet's thankful acknowledgment of God's mercy, in the name 
 of the church, with a believing dependence upon his promise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:18-20"><I>v.</I> 18-20</A>.
 
 We are here taught,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. To give to God the glory of his pardoning mercy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 God having promised to bring back the captivity of his people, the 
 prophet, on that occasion, admires pardoning mercy, as that which was 
 at the bottom of it. As it was their sin that brought them into 
 bondage, so it was God's pardoning their sin that brought them our of 
 it; 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+85:1,2,Isa+33:24,38:17,60:1,2">Ps. lxxxv. 1, 2,
 and Isa. xxxiii. 24; xxxviii. 17; lx. 1, 2</A>.

 The pardon of sin is the foundation of all other covenant-mercies, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:12">Heb. viii. 12</A>.

 This the prophet stands amazed at, while the surrounding nations stood
 amazed only at those deliverances which were but the fruits of this. 
 Note,

 (1.) God's people, who are the <I>remnant of his heritage,</I> stand 
 charged with many transgressions; being but a remnant, a very few, one 
 would hope they should all be very good, but they are not so; God's 
 children have their spots, and often offend their Father. 

 (2.) The gracious God is ready to pass by and pardon the iniquity and 
 transgression of his people, upon their repentance and return to him.
 God's people are a pardoned people, and to this they owe their all.
 When God pardons sin, he passes it by, does not punish it as justly he 
 might, nor deal with the sinner according to the desert of it. 

 (3.) Though God may for a time lay his own people under the tokens of 
 his displeasure, yet he will not <I>retain his anger for ever,</I> but 
 <I>though he cause grief he will have compassion;</I> he is not 
 implacable; yet against those that are not of the remnant of his 
 heritage, that are unpardoned, he will keep his anger for ever. 

 (4.) The reasons why God pardons sin, and keeps not his anger for ever, 
 are all taken from within himself; it is <I>because he delights in 
 mercy,</I> and the salvation of sinners is what he has pleasure in, not 
 their death and damnation.

 (5.) The glory of God in forgiving sin is, as in other things, 
 matchless, and without compare. There is <I>no God like unto him</I>
 for this; no magistrate, no common person, forgives as God does. In 
 this his thoughts and ways are infinitely above ours; in this he is 
 <I>God, and not man.</I> 

 (6.) All those that have experienced pardoning mercy cannot but admire 
 that mercy; it is what we have reason to stand amazed at, if we know 
 what it is. Has God forgiven us our transgressions? We may well say, 
 <I>Who is a God like unto thee?</I> Our holy wonder at pardoning mercy 
 will be a good evidence of our interest in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. To take to ourselves the comfort of that mercy and all the grace and 
 truth that go along with it. God's people here, as they look back with 
 thankfulness upon God's pardoning their sins, so they look forward with 
 assurance upon what he would yet further do for them. His mercy 
 <I>endures for ever,</I> and therefore as he has <I>shown mercy</I> so 
 he will, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 (1.) He will renew his favours to us: <I>He will turn again; he will 
 have compassion;</I> that is, he will again have compassion upon us as 
 formerly he had; his compassions shall be <I>new every morning;</I> he 
 seemed to be departing from us in anger, but he will turn again and 
 pity us. He will turn us to himself, and then will <I>turn to us, and 
 have mercy upon us.</I> 

 (2.) He will renew us, to prepare and qualify us for his favour: <I>He 
 will subdue our iniquities;</I> when he takes away the guilt of sin, 
 that it may not damn us, he will break the power of sin, that it may 
 not have dominion over us, that we may not fear sin, nor be led captive 
 by it. Sin is an enemy that fights against us, a tyrant that oppresses 
 us; nothing less than almighty grace can subdue it, so great is its 
 power in fallen man and so long has it kept possession. But, if God 
 forgive the sin that has been committed by us, he will subdue the sin 
 that dwells in us, and in that there is none like him in forgiving; and 
 all those whose sins are pardoned earnestly desire and hope; to have 
 their corruptions mortified and their iniquities subdued, and please 
 themselves with the hopes of it. If we be left to ourselves, our 
 iniquities will be too hard for us; but God's grace, we trust, shall be 
 sufficient for us to subdue them, so that they shall not rule us, and 
 then they shall not ruin us. 

 (3.) He will confirm this good work, and effectually provide that his 
 act of grace shall never be repealed: <I>Thou wilt cast all their sins 
 into the depth of the sea,</I> as when he brought them out of Egypt (to 
 which he has an eye in the promises here,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 he subdued Pharaoh and the Egyptians, and cast them into the depth of 
 the sea. It intimates that when God forgives sin he <I>remembers it no 
 more,</I> and takes care that it shall never be remembered more against 
 the sinner. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:22">Ezek. xviii. 22</A>,

 <I>His transgressions shall not be mentioned unto him;</I> they are
 <I>blotted out as a cloud</I> which never appears more. He casts them 
 into the sea, not near the shore-side, where they may appear again next 
 low water, but into <I>the depth of the sea,</I> never to rise again.
 <I>All their sins</I> shall be cast there without exception, for when 
 God forgives sin he forgives all.

 (4.) He will perfect that which concerns us, and with this good work
 will do all that for us which our case requires and which he has
 promised

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>Then wilt thou perform thy truth to Jacob and thy mercy to 
 Abraham.</I> It is in pursuance of the covenant that our sins are 
 pardoned and our lusts mortified; from that spring all these streams 
 flow, and with these he shall <I>freely give us all things.</I> The 
 promise is said to be <I>mercy to Abraham,</I> because, as made to him 
 first, it was mere mercy, preventing mercy, considering what state it 
 found him in. But it was <I>truth to Jacob,</I> because the 
 faithfulness of God was engaged to make good to him and his seed, as 
 heirs to Abraham, all that was graciously promised to Abraham. See 
 here, 

 [1.] With what solemnity the covenant of grace is ratified to us; it 
 was not only spoken, written, and sealed, but which is the highest 
 confirmation, it was <I>sworn to our fathers;</I> nor is it a modern 
 project, but is confirmed by antiquity too; it was sworn <I>from the 
 days of old;</I> it is an ancient charter.

 [2.] With what satisfaction it may be applied and relied upon by us; we 
 may say with the highest assurance, <I>Thou wilt perform the truth and 
 mercy;</I> not one iota or tittle of it shall fall to the ground. 
 Faithful is he that has promised, who also will do it.</P>
