 With this chapter begins a new sermon, which is continued in the two 
 following chapters. The subject of this discourse is Judah and 
 Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:1">ver. 1</A>.
 
 In this chapter the prophet speaks,

 I. Of the glory of the Christians, Jerusalem, the gospel-church in the
 latter days, in the accession of many to it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:2,3">ver. 2, 3</A>),

 and the great peace it should introduce into the world

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:4">ver. 4</A>),

 whence he infers the duty of the house of Jacob,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:5">ver. 5</A>.

 II. Of the shame of the Jews, Jerusalem, as it then was, and as it
 would be after its rejection of the gospel and being rejected of God.

 1. Their sin was their shame, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:6-9">ver. 6-9</A>.

 2. God by his judgments would humble them and put them to shame, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:10-17">ver. 10-17</A>.

 3. They should themselves be ashamed of their confidence in their idols 
 and in an arm of flesh, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:18-22">ver. 18-22</A>.

 And now which of these Jerusalems will we be the inhabitants of--that 
 which is full of the knowledge of God, which will be our everlasting 
 honour, or that which is full of horses and chariots, and silver and 
 gold, and such idols, which will in the end be our shame?</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and
 Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 2  And it shall come to pass in the last days, <I>that</I> the
 mountain of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s house shall be established in the top of
 the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all
 nations shall flow unto it.
 &nbsp; 3  And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up
 to the mountain of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to the house of the God of Jacob;
 and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths:
 for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 from Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 4  And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many
 people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and
 their spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up sword
 against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
 &nbsp; 5  O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The particular title of this sermon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)

 is the same with the general title of the book

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:1"><I>ch.</I> i. 1</A>),

 only that what is there called the <I>vision</I> is here called <I>the
 word which Isaiah saw</I> (or the matter, or thing, which he saw), the 
 truth of which he had as full an assurance of in his own mind as if he 
 had seen it with his bodily eyes. Or this word was brought to him in a
 vision; something he saw when he received this message from God. John 
 turned to <I>see the voice</I> that spoke with him.
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:12">Rev. i. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This sermon begins with the prophecy relating to the last days, the 
 days of the Messiah, when his kingdom should be set up in the world, at 
 the latter end of the Mosaic economy. In the last days of the earthly 
 Jerusalem, just before the destruction of it, this heavenly Jerusalem 
 should be erected, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:22,Ga+4:26">Heb. xii. 22; Gal. iv. 26</A>.

 Note, Gospel times are the last days. For

 1. They were long in coming, were a great while waited for by the
 Old-Testament saints, and came at last. 

 2. We are not to look for any dispensation of divine grace but what we
 have in the gospel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:8,9">Gal. i. 8, 9</A>.

 3. We are to look for the second coming of Jesus Christ at the end of
 time, as the Old-Testament saints did for his first coming; <I>this is 
 the last time,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:18">1 John ii. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now the prophet here foretels,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The setting up of the Christian church, and the planting of the 
 Christian religion, in the world. Christianity shall then be the 
 mountain of the Lord's house; where that is professed God will grant 
 his presence, receive his people's homage, and grant instruction and 
 blessing, as he did of old in the temple of Mount Zion. The gospel 
 church, incorporated by Christ's charter, shall then be the rendezvous 
 of all the spiritual seed of Abraham. Now it is here promised, I. That 
 Christianity shall be openly preached and professed; it shall be 
 <I>prepared</I> (so the margin reads it) in the top of the mountains, 
 in the view and hearing of all. Hence Christ's disciples are compared 
 to a city on a hill, which <I>cannot be hid,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:14">Matt. v. 14</A>.

 They had many eyes upon them. Christ himself <I>spoke openly to the
 world,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:20">John xviii. 20</A>.

 What the apostles did was not <I>done in a corner,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:26">Acts xxvi. 26</A>.

 It was the lighting of a beacon, the setting up of a standard. Its
 being every where spoken <I>against</I> supposes that it was every 
 where spoken <I>of.</I>

 2. That is shall be firmly fixed and rooted; it shall be established on
 the top of the everlasting mountains, built upon a <I>rock,</I> so that 
 the <I>gates of hell shall not prevail against it,</I> unless they 
 could pluck up mountains by the roots. He that dwells safely is said to 
 <I>dwell on high,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:16"><I>ch.</I> xxxiii. 16</A>.

 <I>The Lord has founded the gospel Zion.</I> 

 3. That it shall not only overcome all opposition, but overtop all
 competition; it shall be <I>exalted above the hills.</I> This <I>wisdom 
 of God in a mystery</I> shall outshine all the wisdom of this world, 
 all its philosophy and all its politics. The spiritual worship which it 
 shall introduce shall put down the idolatries of the heathen; and all 
 other institutions in religion shall appear mean and despicable in 
 comparison with this. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:16">Ps. lxvi. 16</A>.

 <I>Why leap ye, ye high hills? This is the hill which God desires to
 dwell in.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The bringing of the Gentiles into it. 

 1. The nations shall be admitted into it, even the uncircumcised, who
 were forbidden to come into the courts of the temple at Jerusalem. The 
 partition wall, which kept them out, kept them off, shall be taken 
 down. 

 2. <I>All nations shall flow into it;</I> having liberty of access, 
 they shall improve their liberty, and multitudes shall embrace the 
 Christian faith. They shall flow into it, as streams of water, which 
 denotes the abundance of converts that the gospel should make and their 
 speed and cheerfulness in coming into the church. They shall not be 
 forced into it, but shall naturally flow into it. <I>Thy people shall 
 be willing,</I> all volunteers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:3">Ps. cx. 3</A>.

 To Christ shall the <I>gathering of the people be,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:10">Gen. xlix. 10</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:4,5"><I>ch.</I> lx. 4, 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The mutual assistance and encouragement which this confluence of 
 converts shall give to one another. Their pious affections and 
 resolutions shall be so intermixed that they shall come in in one full 
 stream. As, when the Jews from all parts of the country went up thrice 
 a year to worship at Jerusalem, they called on their friends in the 
 road and excited them to go along with them, so shall many of the 
 Gentiles court their relations, friends, and neighbours, to join with 
 them in embracing the Christian religion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord;</I> though it
 be uphill and against the heart, yet it is <I>the mountain of the 
 Lord,</I> who will assist the assent of our souls towards him." Note, 
 Those that are entering into covenant and communion with God themselves 
 should bring as many as they can along with them; it becomes Christians 
 to provoke one another to good works, and to further the communion of 
 saints by inviting one another into it: not, "Do you <I>go up to the 
 mountain of the Lord,</I> and pray for us, and we will stay at home;" 
 nor, "We will go, and do you do as you will;" but, "<I>Come, and let us 
 go,</I> let us go in concert, that we may strengthen one another's 
 hands and support one another's reputation:" not, "We will consider of 
 it, and advise about it, and go hereafter;" but, <I>Come, and let us go 
 forthwith.</I> See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+122:1">Ps. cxxii. 1</A>.

 Many shall say this. Those that have had it said to them shall say it
 to others. The gospel church is here called, not only <I>the mountain 
 of the Lord,</I> but <I>the house of the God of Jacob;</I> for in it 
 God's covenant with Jacob and his praying seed is kept up and has its 
 accomplishment; for to us now, as unto them, he never said, <I>Seek you 
 me in vain,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:19"><I>ch.</I> xlv. 19</A>.

 Now see here, 

 1. What they promise themselves in going up to the <I>mountain of the
 Lord;</I> There <I>he will teach us of his ways.</I> Note, God's ways 
 are to be learned in his church, in communion with his people, and in 
 the use of instituted ordinances--the ways of duty which he requires us 
 to walk in, the ways of grace in which he walks towards us. It is God 
 that teaches his people, by his word and Spirit. It is worth while to 
 take pains to go up to his holy mountain to be taught his ways, and 
 those who are willing to take that pains shall never find it labour in 
 vain. Then <I>shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord.</I> 

 2. What they <I>promise for themselves</I> and one another: "If he
 will <I>teach us his ways,</I> we will <I>walk in his paths;</I> is he 
 will let us know our duty, we will by his grace make conscience of 
 doing it." Those who attend God's word with this humble resolution 
 shall not be sent away without their lesson.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The means by which this shall be brought about: <I>Out of Zion 
 shall go forth the law,</I> the New-Testament law, the law of Christ, 
 as of old the law of Moses from Mount Sinai, even <I>the word of the 
 Lord from Jerusalem.</I> The gospel is a law, a law of faith; it is the 
 <I>word of the Lord;</I> it <I>went forth from Zion,</I> where the 
 temple was built, and from Jerusalem. Christ himself began in Galilee, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:23,Lu+23:5">Matt. iv. 23; Luke xxiii. 5</A>.

 But, when he commissioned his apostles to preach the gospel to all
 nations, he appointed them to begin in Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:47">Luke xxiv. 47</A>.
 
 See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:19">Rom. xv. 19</A>.

 Though most of them had their homes in Galilee, yet they must stay at
 Jerusalem, there to <I>receive the promise of the Spirit,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:4">Acts i. 4</A>.

 And in the temple on Mount Zion they preached the gospel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:20">Acts v. 20</A>.
 
 This honour was allowed to Jerusalem, even after Christ was crucified
 there, for the sake of what it had been. And it was by this gospel, 
 which took rise from Jerusalem, that the gospel church was 
 <I>established on the top of the mountains.</I> This was the rod of 
 divine strength, that was <I>sent forth out of Zion,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:2">Ps. cx. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The erecting of the kingdom of the Redeemer in the world: <I>He 
 shall judge among the nations.</I> He whose word goes forth out of Zion 
 shall by that word not only subdue souls to himself, but rule in them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 He shall, in wisdom and justice, order and overrule the affairs of the
 world for the good of his church, and rebuke and restrain those that 
 oppose his interest. By his Spirit working on men's consciences he 
 shall judge, and rebuke shall try men and check them; his kingdom is 
 spiritual, <I>and not of this world.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The great peace which should be the effect of the success of the 
 gospel in the world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>They shall beat their swords into ploughshares;</I> their
 instruments of war shall be converted into implements of husbandry; as, 
 on the contrary, when war is proclaimed, <I>ploughshares are beaten 
 into swords,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:10">Joel iii. 10</A>.

 <I>Nations shall then not lift up sword against nation,</I> as they now
 do, <I>neither shall they learn war any more,</I> for they shall have 
 no more occasion for it. This does not make all war absolutely unlawful 
 among Christians, nor is it a prophecy that in the days of the Messiah 
 there shall be no wars. The Jews urge this against the Christians as an 
 argument that Jesus is not the Messiah, because this promise is not 
 fulfilled. But,

 1. It was in part fulfilled in the peaceableness of the time in which
 Christ was born, when wars had in a great measure ceased, witness 
 <I>the taxing,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:1">Luke ii. 1</A>.

 2. The design and tendency of the gospel are to make peace and to slay
 all enmities. It has in it the most powerful obligations and
 inducements to peace; so that one might reasonably have expected it 
 should have this effect, and it would have had it if it had not been 
 for those lusts of men from which come wars and fightings. 

 3. Jew and Gentiles were reconciled and brought together by the gospel,
 and there were no more such wars between them as there had been; for 
 they became <I>one sheepfold under one shepherd.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:15">Eph. ii. 15</A>.

 4. The gospel of Christ, as far as it prevails, disposes men to be
 peaceable, softens men's spirits, and sweetens them; and the love of 
 Christ, shed abroad in the heart, constrains men to love one another.
 
 5. The primitive Christians were famous for brotherly love; their very
 adversaries took notice of it. 

 6. We have reason to hope that this promise shall yet have a more full
 accomplishment in the latter times of the Christian church, when the 
 Spirit shall be poured out more plentifully from on high. Then there 
 shall be on earth peace. <I>Who shall live when God doeth this?</I> But 
 do it he will in due time, for <I>he is not a man that he should 
 lie.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> Here is a practical inference drawn from all this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>O house of Jacob! come you, and let us walk in the light of the
 Lord.</I> By the house of Jacob is meant either,

 1. Israel according to the flesh. Let them be provoked by this <I>to a 
 holy emulation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:14">Rom. xi. 14</A>.

 "Seeing the Gentiles are thus ready and resolved for God, thus forward
 to go up to the house of the Lord, let us stir up ourselves to go too. 
 Let is never be said that the sinners of the Gentiles were better 
 friends to the holy mountain than the house of Jacob." Thus the zeal of 
 some should provoke many. Or,

 2. Spiritual Israel, all that are brought to the God of Jacob. Shall
 there be such great knowledge in gospel times

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 and such great peace 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 and shall we share in these privileges? Come then, and let us live
 accordingly. What ever others do, <I>come, O come!</I> let us <I>walk 
 in the light of the Lord.</I>

 (1.) Let us walk circumspectly in the light of this knowledge. Will God 
 teach us his ways? Will he show us his glory in the face of Christ? Let 
 us then <I>walk as children of the light and of the day,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:8,1Th+5:8,Ro+13:12">Eph. v. 8; 1 Thess. v. 8; Rom. xiii. 12</A>.

 (2.) Let us walk comfortably in the light of this peace. Shall there be
 no more war? Let us then go on our way rejoicing, and let this joy 
 terminate in God, and be our strength, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:10">Neh. viii. 10</A>.

 Thus shall we walk in the beams of the Sun of righteousness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The calling in of the Gentiles was accompanied with the rejection of 
 the Jews; it was their fall, and the <I>diminishing of them, that was 
 the riches of the Gentiles;</I> and the <I>casting off of them</I> was 
 <I>the reconciling of the world</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:12-15">Rom. xi. 12-15</A>);

 and it should seem that these verses have reference to that, and are
 designed to justify God therein, and yet it is probable that they are 
 primarily intended for the convincing and awakening of the men of that 
 generation in which the prophet lived, it being usual with the prophets 
 to speak of the things that then were, both in mercy and judgment, as 
 types of the things that should be hereafter. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Israel's doom. This is set forth in two words, the first and the 
 last of this paragraph; but they are two dreadful words, and which 
 speak, 

 1. Their case sad, very sad 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people.</I> Miserable is the
 condition of that people whom God has forsaken, and great certainly 
 must the provocation be if he forsake those that have been his own 
 people. This was the deplorable case of the Jewish church after they 
 had rejected Christ. <I>Migremus hinc--Let us go hence. Your house is 
 left unto you desolate,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:38">Matt. xxiii. 38</A>.

 Whenever any sore calamity came upon the Jews thus far the Lord might
 be said to forsake them that he withdrew his help and succour from 
 them, else they would not have fallen into the hands of their enemies.
 But God never leaves any till they first leave him.

 2. Their case desperate, wholly desperate
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):
 
 <I>Therefore forgive them not.</I> This prophetical prayer amounts to a
 threatening that they should not be forgiven, and some think it may be 
 read: <I>And thou wilt not forgive them.</I> This refers not to 
 particular persons (many of them repented and were pardoned), but to 
 the body of that nation, against whom an irreversible doom was passed, 
 that they should be wholly cut off and their church quite dismantled, 
 never to be formed into such a body again, nor ever to have their old 
 charter restored to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Israel's desert of this doom, and the reasons upon which it is 
 grounded. In general, it is sin that brings destruction upon them; it 
 is this, and nothing but this, that provokes God to forsake his people. 
 The particular sins which the prophet specifies are such as abounded 
 among them at that time, which he makes mention of for the conviction 
 of those to whom he then preached, rather than that which afterwards 
 proved the measure-filling sin, their crucifying Christ and persecuting 
 his followers; for the sins of every age contributed towards the making 
 up of the dreadful account at last. And there was a partial and 
 temporary rejection of them by the captivity in Babylon hastening on, 
 which was a type of their final destruction by the Romans, and which 
 the sins here mentioned brought upon them. Their sins were such as 
 directly contradicted all God's kind and gracious designs concerning 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God set them apart for himself, as a peculiar people, distinguished 
 from, and dignified above, all other people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:9">Num. xxiii. 9</A>);

 but they were <I>replenished from the east;</I> they <I>naturalized</I>
 foreigners, not <I>proselyted,</I> and encouraged them to settle among 
 them, and mingled with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:8">Hos. vii. 8</A>.

 Their country was peopled with Syrians and Chaldeans, Moabites and
 Ammonites, and other eastern nations, and with them they admitted the 
 fashions and customs of those nations, and <I>pleased themselves in the 
 children of strangers,</I> were fond of them, preferred their country 
 before their own, and thought the more they conformed to them the more 
 polite and refined they were; thus did they profane their crown and 
 their covenant. Note, Those are in danger of being estranged from God 
 who please themselves with those who are strangers to him, for we soon 
 learn the ways of those whose company we love.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. God gave them his oracles, which they might ask counsel of, not only 
 the scriptures and the seers, but the breast-plate of judgment; but 
 they slighted these, and became soothsayers like the Philistines, 
 introduced their arts of divination, and hearkened to those who by the 
 stars, or the clouds, or the flight of birds, or the entrails of 
 beasts, or other magic superstitions, pretended to discover things 
 secret or foretel things to come. The Philistines were noted for 
 diviners, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+6:2">1 Sam. vi. 2</A>.

 Note, Those who slight true divinity are justly given up to lying
 divinations; and those will certainly be forsaken of God who thus 
 forsake him and their own mercies for lying vanities.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. God encouraged them to put their confidence in him, and assured them 
 that he would be their wealth and strength; but, distrusting his power 
 and promise, they made gold their hope, and furnished themselves with 
 horses and chariots, and relied upon them for their safety, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 God had expressly forbidden even their kings to multiply horses to
 themselves and <I>greatly to multiply silver and gold,</I> because he 
 would have them to depend upon himself only; but they did not think 
 their interest in God made them a match for their neighbours unless 
 they had as full treasures of silver and gold, and as formidable hosts 
 of chariots and horses, as they had. It is not having silver and gold, 
 horses and chariots, that is a provocation to God, but,

 (1.) Desiring them insatiably, so that there is no end of the 
 treasures, no end of the chariots, no bounds or limits set to the 
 desire of them. Those shall never have enough in God (who alone is 
 all-sufficient) that never know when they have enough of this world, 
 which at the best is insufficient. 

 (2.) Depending upon them, as if we could not be safe, and easy, and 
 happy, without them, and could not but be so with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. God himself was their God, the sole object of their worship, and he 
 himself instituted ordinances of worship for them; but they slighted 
 both him and his institutions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Their land was full of idols; every city had its god

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:13">Jer. xi. 13</A>);

 and, according to the goodness of their lands, they made goodly images,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:1">Hos. x. 1</A>.

 Those that think one God too little will find two too many, and yet
 hundreds were not sufficient; for those that love idols will multiply 
 them; so sottish were they, and so wretchedly infatuated, that they 
 <I>worshipped the work of their own hands,</I> as if that could be a 
 god to them which was not only a creature, but <I>their</I> creature 
 and that which their own fancies had devised and <I>their own fingers 
 had made.</I> It was an aggravation of their idolatry that God had 
 enriched them with silver and gold, and yet of that silver and gold 
 they made idols; so it was, <I>Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked,</I> see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hos+2:8">Hos. ii. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. God had advanced them, and put honour upon them; but they basely 
 diminished and disparaged themselves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>The mean man boweth down to his idol,</I> a thing below the meanest
 that has any spark of reason left. Sin is a disparagement to the 
 poorest and those of the lowest rank. It becomes the mean man to bow 
 down to his superiors, but it ill becomes him to <I>bow down to the 
 stock of a tree,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:19"><I>ch.</I> xliv. 19</A>.

 Nor is it only the illiterate and poor-spirited that do this, but even
 the <I>great men</I> forgets his grandeur and humbles himself to 
 worship idols, deifies men no better than himself, and consecrates 
 stones so much baser than himself. Idolaters are said to <I>debase 
 themselves even to hell,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:9"><I>ch.</I> lvii. 9</A>.

 What a shame it is that great men think the service of the true God
 below them and will not stoop to it, and yet will humble themselves to 
 bow down to an idol! Some make this a threatening that the mean men
 shall be brought down, and the great men humbled, by the judgments of 
 God, when they come with commission.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and for the glory of his majesty.

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet here goes on to show what a desolation would be brought 
 upon their land when God should have forsaken them. This may refer 
 particularly to their destruction by the Chaldeans first, and 
 afterwards by the Romans, or it may have a general respect to the 
 method God takes to awaken and humble proud sinners, and to put them 
 out of conceit with that which they delighted in and depended on more 
 than God. We are here told that sooner or later God will find out a 
 way,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To startle and awaken secure sinners, who cry peace to themselves, 
 and bid defiance to God and his judgments 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "<I>Enter into the rock;</I> God will attack you with such terrible
 judgments, and strike you with such terrible apprehensions of them, 
 that you shall be forced to <I>enter into the rock, and hide yourself 
 in the dust, for fear of the Lord.</I> You shall lose all your courage, 
 and tremble at the shaking of a leaf; your heart shall <I>fail you for 
 fear</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:26">Luke xxi. 26</A>),
 
 and you shall <I>flee when none pursues,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:1">Prov. xxviii. 1</A>.

 To the same purport, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 <I>They shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the
 earth,</I> the darkest the deepest places; they shall <I>call to the 
 rocks and mountains to fall on them,</I> and rather crush them than not 
 cover them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:8">Hos. x. 8</A>.

 It was so particularly at the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:30">Luke xxiii. 30</A>)

 and of the persecuting pagan powers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:16">Rev. vi. 16</A>.

 And all <I>for fear of the Lord, and of the glory of his majesty,</I>
 looking upon him then to be a consuming fire and themselves as stubble 
 before him, <I>when he arises to shake terribly the earth,</I> to 
 <I>shake the wicked out of it</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:13">Job xxxviii. 13</A>),

 and to shake all those earthly props and supports with which they have
 buoyed themselves up, to shake them from under them. Note,

 1. <I>With God is terrible majesty,</I> and the glory of it is such as 
 sooner or later will oblige us all to flee before him. 

 2. Those that will not fear God and flee to him will be forced to fear
 him and flee from him to a refuge of lies. 

 3. It is folly for those that are pursued by the wrath of God to think
 to escape it, and to hide or shelter themselves from it. 

 4. The things of the earth are things that will be shaken; they are
 subject to concussions, and hastening towards a dissolution. 

 5. The shaking of the earth is, and will be, a terrible thing to those
 who set their affections wholly on things of the earth.

 6. It will be in vain to think of finding refuge in the caves of the
 earth when the earth itself is shaken; there will be no shelter then 
 but in God and in things above.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. To humble and abase proud sinners, that look big, and think highly 
 of themselves, and scornfully of all about them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>The lofty looks of man shall be humbled.</I> The eyes that aim high,
 the countenance in which the pride of the heart shows itself, shall be 
 cast down in shame and despair. And the <I>haughtiness of men shall be 
 bowed down,</I> their spirits shall be broken, and they shall be 
 crest-fallen, and those things which they were proud of they shall be 
 ashamed of. It is repeated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 <I>The loftiness of man shall be bowed down.</I> Note, Pride will, one
 way or other, have a fall. Men's haughtiness will be brought down, 
 either by the grace of God convincing them of the evil of their pride, 
 and clothing them with humility, or by the providence of God depriving 
 them of all those things they were proud of and laying them low. Our 
 Saviour often laid it down for a maxim that <I>he who exalts himself 
 shall be abased;</I> he shall either abase himself in true repentance 
 or God will abase him and pour contempt upon him. Now here we are 
 told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Why this shall be done: because the <I>Lord alone will be 
 exalted.</I> Note, Proud men shall be vilified because the Lord alone 
 will be magnified. It is for the honour of God's power to humble the 
 proud; by this he proves himself to be God, and disproves Job's 
 pretensions to rival with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:11-14">Job xl. 11-14</A>.

 <I>Behold every one that is proud, and abase him; then will I also
 confess unto thee.</I> It is likewise for the honour of his justice. 
 Proud men stand in competition with God, who is jealous for his own 
 glory, and will not suffer men either to take to themselves or give to 
 another that which is due to him only. They likewise stand in 
 opposition to God; they resist him, and therefore he resists them; for 
 he <I>will be exalted among the heathen</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:10">Ps. xlvi. 10</A>),

 and there is a day coming in which he alone will be exalted, when he
 shall have put <I>down all opposing rule, principality, and power,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:24">1 Cor. xv. 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How this shall be done: by humbling judgments, that shall mortify 
 men, and bring them down 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>The day of the Lord of hosts,</I> the day of his wrath and judgment,
 <I>shall be upon every one that is proud.</I> He now laughs at their 
 insolence because he sees that his day is coming, this day, which will 
 be upon them ere they are aware, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:13">Ps. xxxvii. 13</A>.

 This day of the Lord is here said to be upon <I>all the cedars of
 Lebanon, that are high and lifted up.</I> Jerome observes that the 
 cedars are said to praise God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+148:9">Ps. cxlviii. 9</A>)
 
 and are <I>trees of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:16">Ps. civ. 16</A>),

 <I>of his planting</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:19">Isa. xli. 19</A>),

 and yet here God's wrath fastens upon the cedars, which denotes (says
 he) that some of every rank of men, some great men, will be saved, and 
 some perish. It is brought in as an instance of the strength of God's 
 voice that it <I>breaks the cedars</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+29:5">Ps. xxix. 5</A>),

 and here the day of the Lord is said to be <I>upon the cedars,</I>
 those of Lebanon, they were the straightest and statliest,--upon the 
 oaks, those of Bashan, that were the strongest and sturdiest,--upon the 
 natural elevations and fortresses, <I>the highest mountains and the 
 hills that are lifted up</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 that overtop the valleys and seem to push the skies,--and upon the
 artificial fastnesses, <I>every high tower and every fenced wall,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 Understand these,

 (1.) As representing the proud people themselves, that are in their own 
 apprehensions like the cedars and the oaks, firmly rooted, and not to 
 be stirred by any storm, and looking on all around them as shrubs; 
 these are the high mountains and the lofty hills that seem to fill the 
 earth, that are gazed on by all, and think themselves immovable, but 
 lie most obnoxious to God's thunderstrokes. <I>Feriuntique summos 
 fulmina montes--The highest hills are most exposed to lightning.</I> 
 And before the power of God's wrath these mountains are scattered and 
 these hills bow and <I>melt like wax,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:6,Ps+68"8">Hab. iii. 6; Ps. lxvi. 8</A>.

 These vaunting men, who are as high towers in which the noisy bells are
 hung, on which the thundering murdering cannon are planted--these 
 fenced walls, that fortify themselves with their native hardiness, and 
 intrench themselves in their fastnesses--shall be brought down.

 (2.) As particularizing the things they are proud of,in which they 
 trust, and of which they make their boast. The day of the Lord shall be 
 upon those very things in which they put their confidence as their 
 strength and security; he will <I>take from the all their armour 
 wherein they trusted.</I> Did the inhabitants of Lebanon glory in their 
 cedars, and those of Bashan in their oaks, such as no country could 
 equal? The day of the Lord should rend those cedars, those oaks, and 
 the houses built of them. Did Jerusalem glory in the mountains that 
 were round about it, as its impregnable fortifications, or in its walls 
 and bulwarks? These should be levelled and laid low in the day of the 
 Lord. Besides those things that were for their strength and safety they 
 were proud,

 [1.] Of their trade abroad; but the day of the Lord shall be <I>upon 
 all the ships of Tarshish;</I> they shall be broken as Jehoshaphat's 
 were, shall founder at sea or be ship-wrecked in harbour. Zebulun was a 
 haven of ships, but should now no more rejoice in his going out. When 
 God is bringing ruin upon a people he can sink all the branches of 
 their revenue.

 [2.] Of their ornaments at home; but the day of the Lord shall be 
 <I>upon all pleasant pictures,</I> the painting of their ships (so some 
 understand it) or the curious pieces of painting they brought home in 
 their ships from other countries, perhaps from Greece, which afterwards 
 was famous for painters. Upon <I>every thing that is beautiful to 
 behold;</I> so some read it. Perhaps they were the pictures of their 
 relations, and for that reason pleasant, or of their gods, which to the 
 idolaters were delectable things; or they admired them for the fineness 
 of their colours or strokes. There is no harm in making pictures, nor 
 in adorning our rooms with them, provided they transgress not either 
 the second or the seventh commandment. But to place our pictures among 
 our pleasant things, to be fond of them and proud of them, to spend 
 that upon them which should be laid out in charity, and to set out 
 hearts upon them, as it ill becomes those who have so many substantial 
 things to take pleasure in, so it tends to provoke God to strip us of 
 all such vain ornaments.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. To make idolaters ashamed of their idols, and of all the affection 
 they have had for them and the respect they have paid to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):
 
 <I>The idols he shall utterly abolish.</I> When the Lord alone shall be
 exalted 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>)

 he will not only pour contempt upon proud men, who like Pharaoh exalt
 themselves against him, but much more upon all pretended deities, who 
 are rivals with him for divine honours. They shall be abolished, 
 utterly abolished. Their friends shall desert them; their enemies shall 
 destroy them; so that, one way or other, an utter riddance shall be 
 made of them. See here,

 1. The vanity of false gods; they cannot secure themselves, so far are 
 they from being able to secure their worshippers. 

 2. The victory of the true God over them; for <I>great is the truth and
 will prevail.</I> Dagon fell before the ark, and Baal before the Lord 
 God of Elijah. The gods of the heathen shall be famished

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+2:11">Zeph. ii. 11</A>),

 and by degrees shall perish,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:11">Jer. x. 11</A>.

 The rightful Sovereign will triumph over all pretenders. And, as God 
 will abolish idols, so their worshippers shall abandon them, either 
 from a gracious conviction of their vanity and falsehood (as Ephraim 
 when he said, <I>What have I to do any more with idols?</I>) or from a 
 late and sad experience of their inability to help them, and a woeful 
 despair of relief by them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 When men are themselves frightened by the judgments of God into the
 holes of the rocks and caves of the earth, and find that they do thus 
 in vain shift for their own safety, they shall cast their idols, which 
 they have made their gods, and hoped to make their friends in the time 
 of need, to the moles and to the bats, any where out of sight, that, 
 being freed from the incumbrance of them, they may <I>go into the 
 clefts of the rocks, for fear of the Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 
 Note,

 (1.) Those that will not be reasoned out of their sins sooner or later 
 shall be frightened out of them. 

 (2.) God can make men sick of those idols that they have been most fond 
 of, even the idols of silver and the idols of gold, the most precious. 
 Covetous men make silver and gold their idols, money their god; but the 
 time may come when they may feel it as much their burden as ever they 
 made it their confidence, and may find themselves as much exposed by it 
 as ever they hoped they should be guarded by it, when it tempts their 
 enemy, sinks their ship, or retards their flight. There was a time when 
 the mariners threw the wares, and even the <I>wheat into the sea</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:5,Ac+27:38">Jonah i. 5; Acts xxvii. 38</A>),

 and the <I>Syrians cast away their garments for haste,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:15">2 Kings vii. 15</A>.
 
 Or men may cast it away out of indignation at themselves for leaning
 upon such a broken reed. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:19">Ezek. vii. 19</A>.

 The idolaters here throw away their idols because they are ashamed of
 them and of their own folly in trusting to them, or because they are 
 afraid of having them found in their possession when the judgments of 
 God are abroad; as the thief throws away his stolen goods then he is 
 searched for or pursued.

 (3.) The darkest holes, where the moles and the bats lodge, are the 
 fittest places for idols, that have eyes and see not; and God can force 
 men to cast their own idols there

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:22"><I>ch.</I> xxx. 22</A>),

 when they are <I>ashamed of the oaks which they have desired,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:29"><I>ch.</I> i. 29</A>.

 <I>Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed
 of Bethel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:13">Jer. xlviii. 13</A>.

 (4.) It is possible that sin may be both loathed and left and yet not
 truly repented of--loathed because surfeited on, left because there is 
 no opportunity of committing it, yet not repented of out of any love to 
 God, but only from a slavish fear of his wrath.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. To make those that have trusted in an arm of flesh ashamed of their 
 confidence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 "<I>Cease from man.</I> The providences of God concerning you shall
 speak this aloud to you, and therefore take warning beforehand, that 
 you may prevent the uneasiness and shame of disappointment; and 
 consider,

 1. How weak man is: <I>His breath is in his nostrils,</I> puffed out 
 every moment, soon gone for good and all." Man is a dying creature, and 
 may die quickly; our nostrils, in which our breath is, are of the 
 outward parts of the body; what is there is like one standing at the 
 door, ready to depart; nay the doors of the nostrils are always open, 
 the breath in them may slip away ere we are aware, in a moment. Wherein 
 then is man to be accounted of? Alas! no reckoning is to be made of
 him, for he is not what he seems to be, what he pretends to be, what we 
 fancy him to be. Man is like vanity, nay, he is vanity, he is 
 altogether vanity, he is less, he is lighter, than vanity, when weighed 
 in the balance of the sanctuary. 

 "2. How wise therefore those are that cease from man;" it is our duty,
 it is our interest, to do so. "<I>Put not your trust in man,</I> nor 
 make even the greatest and mightiest of men your confidence; cease to 
 do so. Let not your eye be to the power of man, for it is finite and 
 limited, derived and depending; it is not from him that your judgment 
 proceeds. Let not him be your fear, let not him be your hope; but look
 up to the power of God, to which all the powers of men are subject and 
 subordinate; dread his wrath, secure his favour, take him for your 
 help, and let your <I>hope be in the Lord your God.</I>"</P>
