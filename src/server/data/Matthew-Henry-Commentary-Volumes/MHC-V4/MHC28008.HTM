 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter, as that before, divides itself into the sins and 
 punishments of Israel; every verse almost declares both, and all to 
 bring them to repentance. When they saw the malignant nature of their 
 sin, in the descriptions of that, they could not but be convinced now 
 much it was their duty to repent of what was so bad in itself; and when 
 they saw the mischievous consequences of their sin, in the predictions 
 of them, they could not but see how much it was their interest to 
 repent for the preventing of them. 

 I. The sin of Israel is here set forth, 

 1. In many general expressions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:1,3,12,14">ver. 1, 3, 12, 14</A>.

 2. In many particular instances; setting up kings
 without God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:4">ver. 4</A>),

 setting up idols against God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:4-6">ver. 4-6, 11</A>),

 and courting alliances with the neighbouring nations,, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:8-10">ver. 8-10</A>.

 3. In this aggravation of it, that they still kept up a profession of
 religion and relation to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:2,13,14">ver. 2, 13, 14</A>.

 II. The punishment of Israel is here set forth as answering to the sin.
 God would bring an enemy upon them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:1,3">ver. 1, 3</A>.

 All their projects should be blasted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:7">ver. 7</A>.

 Their confidence both in their idols and in their foreign alliances
 should disappoint them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:6,8,10">ver. 6, 8, 10</A>.

 Their strength at home should fail them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:14">ver. 14</A>.

 Their sacrifices should have no reckoning made of them, and their sins
 should have a reckoning made for them,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  <I>Set</I> the trumpet to thy mouth. <I>He shall come</I> as an eagle
 against the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, because they have transgressed my
 covenant, and trespassed against my law.
 &nbsp; 2  Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.
 &nbsp; 3  Israel hath cast off <I>the thing that is</I> good: the enemy
 shall pursue him.
 &nbsp; 4  They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made
 princes, and I knew <I>it</I> not: of their silver and their gold have
 they made them idols, that they may be cut off.
 &nbsp; 5  Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast <I>thee</I> off; mine anger is
 kindled against them: how long <I>will it be</I> ere they attain to
 innocency?
 &nbsp; 6  For from Israel <I>was</I> it also: the workman made it; therefore
 it <I>is</I> not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in
 pieces.
 &nbsp; 7  For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the
 whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so
 be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The reproofs and threatenings here are introduced with an order to the 
 prophet to <I>set the trumpet to his mouth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 thus to call a solemn assembly, that all might take notice of what he 
 had to deliver and take warning by it. He must sound an alarm, must, in 
 God's name, proclaim war with this rebellious nation. An enemy is 
 coming with speed and fury to seize their land, and he must awaken them 
 to expect it. Thus the prophet must do the part of a watchman, that
 was by sound of trumpet to call the besieged to stand to their arms, 
 when he saw the besiegers making their attack, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:3">Ezek. xxxiii. 3</A>.

 The prophet must <I>lift up his voice like a trumpet</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:1">Isa. lviii. 1</A>),

 and the people must hearken to the sound of the trumpet, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:17">Jer. vi. 17</A>.
 
 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is a general charge drawn up against them as sinners, as rebels 
 and traitors against their sovereign Lord. 

 1. They have <I>transgressed my covenant,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 They have not only transgressed the command (every sin does that), but 
 they have <I>transgressed the covenant;</I> they have been guilty of 
 such sins as break the original contract; they have revolted from their 
 allegiance, and violated the marriage-covenant by their spiritual 
 whoredom; they have, in effect, declared that they will be no longer 
 God's people, nor take him for their God; that is <I>transgressing the 
 covenant.</I> They have not only done foolishly, but have dealt 
 deceitfully. 

 2. They have <I>trespassed against my law</I> in many particular 
 instances. God's law is the rule by which we are to walk; and this is 
 the malignity of sin, that it trespasses upon the bounds set us by that 
 law. 

 3. They have <I>cast off the thing that is good.</I> They have <I>put
 away</I> and <I>rejected good,</I> that is, God himself; so some 
 understand it, and very fitly. He is good, and does good, and is our 
 goodness. <I>There is none good but one, that is God,</I> the fountain 
 of all good. They have <I>cast him off,</I> as not desiring to have any 
 thing more to do with him. God was abandoning them to ruin, and here 
 gives the reason for it. Note, God never casts off any till they first 
 cast him off. Or, as we read it, They have cast off <I>the thing that 
 is good;</I> they have cast off the service and worship of God, which 
 is, in effect, <I>casting God off.</I> They have cast off that which 
 denominates men good; they have cast off the fear of God, and the 
 regard of man, and all sense of virtue and honesty. Observe, <I>They
 have transgressed my covenant;</I> it has come to this at last; for 
 <I>they trespassed against my law.</I> Breaking the command made way 
 for breaking the covenant; and they did that, for they <I>cast off that 
 which was good;</I> there it began first. They <I>left off to be wise 
 and to do good,</I> and then they went all to naught, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+36:3">Ps. xxxvi. 3</A>.

 See the method of apostasy; men first cast off that which is good; then
 those omissions make way for commissions; and frequent actual 
 transgressions of God's law bring men at length to an habitual 
 renunciation of his covenant. When men cast off praying, and hearing, 
 and sabbath-sanctification, and other things that are good, they are in 
 the high road to a total forsaking of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here are general threatenings of wrath and ruin for their sin: 
 <I>The enemy shall come as an eagle against the house of the Lord,</I> 
 and 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 <I>shall pursue him.</I> If by <I>the house of the Lord</I> we 
 understand the temple at Jerusalem, by the eagle that comes against it 
 we must suppose to be meant either Sennacherib, who had taken all the 
 fenced cities of Judah, laid siege to Jerusalem (and, no doubt, aimed 
 at the house of the Lord, to lay that waste, as he had done the temples 
 of the gods of other nations), or Nebuchadnezzar, who burnt the temple 
 and made a prey of the vessels of the temple. But, if we make it to 
 point at the destruction of the kingdom of the ten tribes by the king 
 of Assyria, we must reckon it is the body of that people which as 
 Israelites, to whom <I>pertained the adoption, the glory, and the 
 covenants,</I> is here called the <I>house of the Lord.</I> They 
 thought their being so would be their protection; but the prophet is 
 directed to tell them that now they had lost the life and spirit of 
 their religion, though they still retained the name and form of it, 
 they were but as a carcase to which the eagles and other birds of prey 
 should be gathered together. The enemy shall pursue them <I>as an 
 eagle,</I> so swiftly, so strongly, so furiously. Note, Those who break 
 their covenant of friendship with God expose themselves to the enmity 
 of all about them, to whom they make themselves a cheap and easy prey; 
 and their having been <I>the house of the Lord,</I> and his living 
 temples, will be no excuse nor refuge to them. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:2">Amos iii. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is the people's hypocritical claim of relation to God, when 
 they were in trouble and distress 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>Israel shall cry unto me;</I> when either they are threatened with
 these judgments, and would plead an exemption, or when the judgments 
 are inflicted on them and they apply to God for relief, <I>pouring out 
 a prayer when God's chastening is upon them,</I> they will plead that 
 among them <I>God is known</I> and his <I>name is great</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:1">Ps. lxxvi. 1</A>)

 and in their distress will pretend to that knowledge of God's ways 
 which in their prosperity they <I>desired not,</I> but <I>despised.</I> 
 They will then cry unto God, will call him their God, and (as impudent 
 beggars) will tell him they are well acquainted with him, and have 
 known him long. Note, There are many who in works deny God, and disown 
 him, yet, to serve a turn, will profess that they <I>know him,</I> that 
 they know more of him than some of their neighbours do. But what stead 
 will it stand a man in to be able to say, <I>My God, I know thee,</I> 
 when he cannot say, "My God, I love thee," and "My God, I serve thee, 
 and cleave to thee only?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Here is the prophet's expostulation with them, in God's name 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>How long will it be ere they attain to innocency?</I> It is not 
 meant of absolute innocency (that is what the guilty can never attain 
 to); but how long will it be ere they repent and reform, ere they 
 become innocent in this matter, and free from the sin of idolatry? They 
 are wedded to their idols; how long will it be ere they are weaned from 
 them, ere <I>they are able to get clear of them?</I> so it might be 
 rendered. This intimates that custom in sin makes it very difficult for 
 men to part with it. It is hard to cleanse from that filthiness, either 
 of flesh or spirit, which has been long wallowed in. But God speaks as 
 if he thought the time long till sinners cast away their iniquities and 
 come to live a new life. He complains of their obstinacy; it is that 
 which keeps his anger against them burning, which would soon be turned 
 away if they did but <I>attain to innocency</I> from those sins that 
 kindled it. They in trouble cry, <I>How long</I> will it be ere God 
 return to us in a way of mercy? but they do not hear him ask, <I>How 
 long</I> will it be ere they return to God in a way of duty?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Here are some particular sins which they are charged with, are 
 convicted of the folly of, and warned of the fatal consequences of, and 
 for which God's <I>anger is kindled against them.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In their civil affairs. They set <I>up kings without God,</I> and in 
 contempt of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 So they did when they rejected Samuel, in whom the Lord was their king, 
 and chose Saul, that they might be <I>like the nations.</I> So they did 
 when they revolted from their allegiance to the house of David, and set 
 up Jeroboam, wherein, though they fulfilled God's secret counsel, yet 
 they aimed not at his glory, nor consulted his oracle, nor applied to 
 him by prayer for direction, nor had any regard to his providence, but 
 were led by their own humour and hurried on by the impetus of their own 
 passions. So they did now about the time when Hosea prophesied, when it 
 seems to have grown fashionable to <I>set up kings,</I> and depose them 
 again, according as the contenders for the crown could make an 
 interest,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:8">2 Kings xv. 8</A>,

 &c. Note, We cannot expect comfort and success in our affairs when we
 go about them, and go on in them, without consulting God and 
 acknowledge not him in all our ways: "They <I>set up kings,</I> and 
 <I>I knew it not,</I> that is, I did not know it from them, they did 
 not ask <I>counsel at my mouth,</I> whether they might lawfully do it 
 or whether it would be best for them to do it, though they had prophets 
 and oracles with whom they might have advised." They <I>looked not to 
 the Holy One of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+31:1">Isa. xxxi. 1</A>.

 Nor did the princes do as Jephthah, who, before he took upon him the
 government, <I>uttered all his words before the Lord in Mizpeh,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+11:11">Judg. xi. 11</A>.

 Note, Those that are entrusted with public concerns, and particularly
 with the election and nomination of magistrates, ought to take God 
 along with them therein, by desiring his direction and designing his 
 honour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In their religious matters they did much worse; for they <I>set up 
 calves against God,</I> in competition with him and contradiction to 
 him. "Of <I>their silver and their gold</I> which God <I>gave them,</I> 
 and <I>multiplied</I> to them, that they might serve and honour him 
 with them, they have <I>made them idols.</I>" They called them 
 <I>gods</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:28">1 Kings xii. 28</A>,

 <I>Behold thy gods, O Israel!</I>) but God calls them <I>idols;</I> the 
 word signifies <I>griefs,</I> or <I>troubles,</I> because they are 
 offensive to God and will be ruining to those that worship them. 
 <I>Their silver and their gold they have made to them idols;</I> so the 
 words are, referring primarily to the images of their gods, which they 
 made of gold and silver, especially the golden calves at Dan and 
 Bethel. Idolaters spare no cost in worshipping their idols. But they 
 are very applicable to the spiritual idolatry of the covetous: <I>Their 
 silver and their gold</I> are the gods they place their happiness in, 
 set their hearts upon, to which they pay their homage, and in which 
 they put their confidence. Now, to show them the folly of their 
 idolatry, he tells them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Whence their gods came. Trace them to their original, and they 
 will be found the creatures of their own fancies and the work of their 
 own hands, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 The calf they worshipped is here called <I>the calf of Samaria,</I> 
 because it is probable that when Samaria, in Ahab's time, became the 
 metropolis of the kingdom, a calf was set up there to be near the 
 court, besides those at Dan and Bethel, or perhaps one of those was 
 removed thither; for those that are for new gods will still be for 
 newer. Now let them consider what this god of theirs owed its rise and 
 being to.

 [1.] To their own invention and institution: <I>From Israel was it 
 also,</I> not from the God of Israel (he expressly forbade it), but 
 from Israel; it was a device of their own (some think), not borrowed 
 from any of their neighbours, no, not from the Egyptians, for, though 
 they worshipped Apis in a living cow, they never worshipped a <I>golden 
 calf;</I> that was from Israel; it was <I>their own iniquity.</I> Now 
 could that be worthy of their worship which was a contrivance of their 
 own? It was <I>from Israel,</I> that is, the gold and silver of which 
 it was made were collected from the people of Israel by a brief: it was 
 a poor god that was framed by contribution.

 [2.] It was owing to the skill and labour of the craftsman, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:15">Deut. xxvii. 15</A>.
 
 <I>The workmen made it, therefore it is not God,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 This is a very cogent conclusive argument, and the inference so very 
 plain that one would think their own thoughts should have suggested it 
 to them, so as to make them ashamed of their idolatry. What can be more 
 absurd than for men to worship that as a god, giving being and good to 
 them, which they themselves gave being to (both matter and form), but 
 could not give life to? A made god is no God. This is a self-evident
 truth; and yet St. Paul was accused as a criminal for preaching that 
 <I>those are no gods which are made with hands,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:26">Acts xix. 26</A>.

 And, here, this which should have turned them from their idols comes in
 as a reason why they were inseparably wedded to them; therefore they 
 could not attain to innocency because it was <I>from themselves;</I> 
 they were willing to have gods of their own to do what they pleased 
 with, that they themselves might do what they pleased.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What their gods would come to. If they are not gods, they will not
 last; nay, if they pretend to be gods, they will be reckoned with: 
 <I>The calf of Samaria shall be broken to pieces,</I> and those that 
 would not yield to the force of the former argument shall be convinced 
 by this that it is not God, but an <I>unprofitable idol,</I> as the 
 Chaldee calls it. It shall be <I>broken to shivers,</I> like a potter's 
 vessel, though it be a golden calf. It shall be <I>chips</I> or 
 <I>saw-dust;</I> it shall be a <I>spider's web;</I> so St. Jerome. It 
 seems to allude to Moses's grinding to powder the golden calf that was 
 in his time. This shall be served as that was. Sennacherib boasted what 
 he had done to <I>Samaria and her idols,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:11">Isa. x. 11</A>.

 Note, Deifying any creature makes way for the destruction of it. If
 they had made vessels and ornaments for themselves of their silver and 
 gold, they might have remained; but, if they make gods of them, they 
 shall be <I>broken to pieces.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) What their gods would bring them to. The breaking of them to 
 pieces would be a disappointment to those who trusted in them. But that 
 was not all: <I>They have</I> made to themselves idols, <I>that they 
 may be cut off</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 that their gold and silver, which they so abused, may be cut off (so 
 some take it), nay, that they may themselves be cut off from God, from 
 their own land, from the land of the living. Their idolatry will as
 certainly end in their extirpation as if they had purposely designed 
 it. And, when this proves to be the effect of their sin, what relief 
 will they have from the gods wherein they trusted? None at all: "<I>Thy 
 calf, O Samaria! has cast thee off;</I> it cannot give thee any help in 
 thy distress, and the pleasure thou now takest in it will vanish, and 
 be no pleasure to thee." Those that were justly sent to the gods whom 
 they had chosen found them <I>miserable comforters,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:14">Judg. x. 14</A>.

 If men will not quit the love and service of sin, yet they shall
 certainly lose all the delights and profits of it. If Samaria had 
 continued firm and faithful to the God of Israel, he would have been a 
 present powerful help to her; but the calf she preferred before him was 
 a broken reed. The case will be the same with those that make their 
 silver and their gold their god. It will <I>cast them off,</I> and not 
 <I>profit them in the day of wrath,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:12">Ezek. vii. 12</A>.

 Note, Those that suffer themselves to be deceived into any idolatries
 will certainly find themselves deceived in them. Cardinal Wolsey owned 
 that if he had served his God as faithfully as he had served his prince 
 he would not have <I>cast him off,</I> as his prince did, in his old 
 age. Their disappointment in their idols is illustrated

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>)

 by a similitude which intimates both that and the destruction which God 
 brought upon them for their idolatry.

 [1.] They got no good to themselves by worshipping idols: <I>They have 
 sown the wind.</I> They have put themselves to a great deal of trouble 
 and expense to make and worship their idols, have made a business of it 
 as much as the husbandman does of sowing his corn, in expectation of 
 reaping some mighty advantage from it, and that they should be as 
 prosperous and victorious as the neighbouring nations were, that 
 worshipped idols. But it is all a cheat; it is like <I>sowing the 
 wind,</I> which can yield no increase; they <I>labour in vain, labour 
 for the wind,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:16">Eccl. v. 16</A>.

 They take great pains to no purpose, and <I>weary themselves for very
 vanity,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:13">Hab. ii. 13</A>.

 Those that make an idol of this world do so; they <I>set their eyes on
 that which is not,</I> which, like the wind, makes a great noise, but 
 has nothing substantial in it.

 [2.] They brought ruin upon themselves by it: They shall <I>reap the 
 whirlwind,</I> a <I>great whirlwind</I> (so the word signifies), which 
 shall hurry them away and dash them to pieces. They not only have not 
 their false gods for them but they set the true God against them; their 
 favour will stand them in no more stead than the wind, but his wrath 
 will do them more mischief than a whirlwind. As a man sows, so shall he 
 reap. "If it may be supposed that a man should sow the wind, and cover 
 it with earth, or keep it there for a while penned up, what could he 
 expect but that it should be forced by its being shut up, and the 
 accession of what might increase its strength, to break forth again in 
 greater quantities with greater violence?" So Dr. Pocock. They promise 
 themselves plenty, peace, and victory, by worshipping idols, but their 
 expectations come to nothing. What they sow never comes up; it has 
 <I>no stalk,</I> no blade, or, if it have, <I>the bud shall yield no 
 meal;</I> it shall be as the thin ears in Pharaoh's dream, that were 
 blasted with the <I>east wind,</I> and there was nothing in them. Or 
 <I>if it yield,</I> if they do prosper for a while in their idolatrous 
 courses, <I>the strangers shall swallow it up;</I> it shall be so far 
 from doing them any service that it shall be but as a bait to invite 
 strangers to invade them, and as a spoil to enrich those strangers and 
 enable them to do so much the more mischief. Note, The service of idols 
 is an unprofitable service, and the works of darkness are unfruitful; 
 nay, in the end they will be pernicious. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:21">Rom. vi. 21</A>,

 <I>The end of those things is death.</I> Those that <I>sow iniquity</I>
 reap <I>vanity:</I> nay, those that <I>sow to the flesh, reap

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles
 as a vessel wherein <I>is</I> no pleasure.
 &nbsp; 9  For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself:
 Ephraim hath hired lovers.
 &nbsp; 10  Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I
 gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the
 king of princes.
 &nbsp; 11  Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall
 be unto him to sin.
 &nbsp; 12  I have written to him the great things of my law, <I>but</I> they
 were counted as a strange thing.
 &nbsp; 13  They sacrifice flesh <I>for</I> the sacrifices of mine offerings,
 and eat <I>it; but</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> accepteth them not; now will he
 remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return
 to Egypt.
 &nbsp; 14  For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples;
 and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire
 upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It was the honour and happiness of Israel that they had but one God to 
 trust to and he all-sufficient in every strait, and but one God to 
 serve, and he well worthy of all their devotions. But it was their sin, 
 and folly, and shame, that they knew not when they were well off, that 
 they forsook their own mercies for lying vanities; for,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They multiplied their alliances 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>They have hired lovers,</I> or (as the margin reads it) <I>they have 
 hired loves.</I> They were at great expense to purchase the friendship 
 of the nations about them, that otherwise had no value nor affection at 
 all for them, nor cared for having any thing to do with them but only 
 upon the Shechemites' principles--<I>Shall not their cattle and their 
 substance be ours?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+34:23">Gen. xxxiv. 23</A>.

 Had Israel maintained the honour of their peculiarity, the surrounding
 nations would have continued to admire them <I>as a wise and 
 understanding people;</I> but, when they profaned their own crown, 
 their neighbours despised them, and they had no interest in them 
 further than they paid dearly for it. But those surely have behaved ill 
 among their neighbours who have no loves, no lovers, but what they 
 hire. See here,

 1. The contempt that Israel lay under among the nations

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Israel is swallowed up,</I> devoured by strangers, their land eaten 
 up 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 and themselves too, and, being impoverished, they have quite lost their 
 credit and reputation, like a merchant that has become a bankrupt, so 
 that they are <I>among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein is no 
 pleasure,</I> a vessel of <I>dishonour</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:20">2 Tim. ii. 20</A>),

 a <I>despised broken vessel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:28">Jer. xxii. 28</A>.

 None of their neighbours have any value for them, nor care to have any
 thing to do with them. Note, Those that have professed religion, if
 they degenerate and grow profane, are of all men the most contemptible. 
 <I>If the salt have lost its savour,</I> it is fit for nothing but to 
 be <I>trodden under foot of men.</I> Or it denotes their dispersion and 
 captivity <I>among the Gentiles;</I> they shall be among them poor and 
 prisoners; and who has pleasure in such?

 2. The court that Israel made to the nations notwithstanding 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):
 
 They have <I>gone to Assyria,</I> to engage the king of Assyria to help 
 them; and herein they are as a <I>wild ass alone by himself,</I> 
 foolish, headstrong, and unruly; they will have their way, and nothing 
 shall <I>hold them in,</I> no, not the bridle of God's laws, nothing 
 shall <I>turn them back,</I> no, not the sword of God's wrath. They 
 take a course by themselves, and the effect will be that, like a 
 <I>wild ass by himself,</I> they will be the easier and surer prey to 
 the lion. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:12,Jer+2:24">Job xi. 12; Jer. ii. 24</A>.

 Note, Man is in nothing more like the wild ass's colt than in seeking
 for that succour and that satisfaction in the creature which are to be 
 had in God only.

 3. The crosses that they were likely to meet with in their alliances
 with the neighbouring nations

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>Though they have hired among the nations,</I> and hoped thereby to 
 prevent their own ruin, yet <I>now will I gather them,</I> as <I>the 
 sheaves in the floor</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+4:12">Mic. iv. 12</A>);

 so that what they provided for their own safety shall but make them the
 easier prey to their enemies. Note, There is no fence against the
 judgments of God, when they come with commission; nay, that which men 
 hire for their own preservation often contributes to their own 
 destruction. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:20">Isa. vii. 20</A>.

 The king of Assyria, whose friendship they courted, called himself a
 <I>king of princes,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:8">Isa. x. 8</A>.

 <I>Are not my princes altogether kings?</I> He laid <I>burdens</I> upon
 Israel, levied taxes upon them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:19,20">2 Kings xv. 19, 20</A>.

 And for these <I>they shall sorrow a little;</I> this shall be but a
 little burden to them in comparison of what they may further expect; or 
 they will be but little sensible of this grievance, will not lay it to 
 heart, and therefore may expect heavier judgments. <I>They have begun
 to be diminished</I> (so some read it), <I>by the burden of the king of 
 princes;</I> but this is only the <I>beginning of sorrows</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:8">Matt. xxiv. 8</A>),

 <I>the beginning of revenges,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:42">Deut. xxxii. 42</A>.

 Note, God often comes gradually with his judgments upon a provoking
 people, that he may show how slow he is to wrath, and may awaken them 
 to repentance; but those that are made to <I>sorrow a little,</I> if 
 they are not thereby brought to sorrow after a godly sort, will, 
 another day, be made to sorrow a great deal, to sorrow 
 everlastingly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They multiplied their altars and temples. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How they denied <I>the power of godliness,</I> and wholly cast that 
 off 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>I have written to him the great things of my law;</I> this intimates 
 the privilege they enjoyed, as having God's statutes and judgments made 
 known to them, and being entrusted with the lively oracles. Note, 

 (1.) The things of God's law are <I>magnalia Dei--the great things of 
 God.</I> They are things that proclaim the greatness of the Law-maker, 
 and things of great use and great importance to us; they are our life, 
 and our eternal welfare depends upon our observance of them and 
 obedience to them; they will make us great if we make a right use of 
 them; and they are things which God will magnify and make honourable.
 
 (2.) It is a great privilege to have the things of God's law written; 
 thus they are reduced to a greater certainty, spread the further, and 
 last the longer, with much less danger of being embezzled and corrupted 
 than if they were transmitted by word of mouth only. 

 (3.) The things of God's law are of his own writing; for Moses and the 
 prophets were his amanuenses, and holy men wrote as they were moved by 
 the Holy Ghost.

 (4.) It is the advantage of those that are members of the visible 
 church that these great things are written <I>to them,</I> are intended 
 for their direction, and so they must receive them; what things were 
 written in former ages <I>were written for our learning,</I> and are 
 profitable for us. And, if those were happy who had the <I>great things 
 of God's law</I> written to them, how much happier are we who have the 
 gospel written to us! But see how this privilege was slighted; these 
 great things of the law were <I>counted as a strange thing,</I> as 
 unintelligible and unreasonable (which might <I>therefore</I> be 
 slighted, because not to be fathomed, not to be accounted for), or as
 foreign, and things of no concernment to them, things that they had 
 nothing to do with nor were to be governed by; they used those things 
 as strangers, which they were shy of, and knew not how to bid welcome.
 <I>We desire not the knowledge of thy ways.</I> Note,

 [1.] God having written to us the great things of his law, we ought to 
 make them familiar to us, as our nearest relations 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+7:3,4">Prov. vii. 3, 4</A>);

 for <I>therefore</I> we have them written, that they may <I>talk with 
 us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:22">Prov. vi. 22</A>.

 [2.] We make nothing of the things of God's law if we make strange of 
 them, as if they did not affect us and therefore we need not be 
 affected with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How they kept up the form of godliness notwithstanding, and to what 
 little purpose they did so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They multiplied their altars 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>Ephraim made many altars to sin.</I> God appointed that there should 
 be but one altar for sacrifice 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:3,5">Deut. xii. 3, 5</A>);

 but the ten tribes, having forsaken that, would still be thought very
 devout, and zealous for the honour of God, and, as if they would make 
 amends for the affront they put on God's altar, they made <I>many 
 altars,</I> dedicated to the God of Israel, whom hereby they intended, 
 or at least pretended, to give glory to; but that would not justify 
 their violation of God's express command, nor would the example of the 
 patriarchs, who before the law of Moses had many altars. No, they 
 <I>made many altars to sin</I> (that is, they did that which turned 
 into sin to them), and therefore these <I>altars shall be unto</I> them 
 <I>to sin,</I> that is, God will charge it upon them as a heinous sin, 
 and put that upon the score of their crimes which they designed to be 
 for the expiation of their crimes. Or they shall be to them an occasion 
 of further sin. Their multiplying of altars dedicated to the God of
 Israel would introduce altars dedicated to other gods. Note, It is a 
 great sin to corrupt the worship of God, and it will be charged as sin 
 upon those that do it, how plausible soever their pretensions may be. 
 And the way of this, as other sins, is down-hill; those that once 
 deviate from the fixed rule of God's commands will wander 
 endlessly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They multiplied their sacrifices, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Their altars were smoking altars: They <I>sacrificed flesh for the 
 sacrifices of God's offerings,</I> and they celebrated their feasts 
 upon their sacrifices; they were at a great expense upon their 
 devotions, and (as those commonly are who set up their own inventions 
 in the room of divine institutions) were very zealous in their way; as 
 if they hoped by their impositions on themselves to atone for the 
 contempt of the great atonement, and by their observing a ceremonial 
 law of their own to excuse themselves from the obligation of all God's 
 moral precepts. But how did they speed?

 [1.] God makes no reckoning of their services: <I>The Lord accepts them 
 not.</I> How should he, when they did not offer their sacrifice upon 
 that altar which alone <I>sanctified the gift,</I> and when they only 
 sacrificed flesh, but not the spiritual sacrifice of a penitent 
 believing heart? Note, Those services only are acceptable to God which 
 are performed according to the rule of his word, and <I>through Jesus 
 Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:5">1 Pet. ii. 5</A>.

 [2.] He takes that occasion to reckon with them for their sins; now 
 will he, instead of pardoning their iniquity and blotting out their 
 sins, as they expected, <I>remember their iniquity</I> and <I>visit 
 their sins.</I> Such an <I>abomination to the Lord</I> are the 
 <I>sacrifices of the wicked</I> that they provoke him to call them to 
 an account for all their other abominations. When they think by their 
 sacrifices to bribe the Judge of heaven and earth into a connivance at 
 their wickedness he will resent that as the highest affront they can 
 put upon him, and it shall be the measure-filling sin. Note, A petition 
 for leave to sin amounts to an imprecation of the curse for sin, and so 
 it shall be answered, <I>according to the multitude of the idols.</I> 
 "I will punish their sins, <I>for they shall return to Egypt;</I>" they 
 shall be carried captive into Assyria, which shall be to them a house 
 of bondage, as Egypt was to their fathers. Or it refers to 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:68">Deut. xxviii. 68</A>,

 where returning to Egypt is made to close and complete the miseries of 
 that sinful nation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) They multiplied their temples, and these also in honour of the 
 true God, as they pretended, but really in contempt of the choice he 
 had made of Jerusalem to <I>put his name there. Israel has forgotten 
 his Maker,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 They pretended to know him, and yet forgot him, for they <I>liked not 
 to retain God in their knowledge,</I> when the remembrance of him would 
 give check to their lusts. It was an aggravation of their sin in 
 forgetting God that he was <I>their Maker</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:15,18,Job+35:10">Deut. xxxii. 15, 18; Job xxxv. 10</A>),

 as nothing obliges us more to remember him than that he is <I>our
 Creator,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:1">Eccl. xii. 1</A>.

 "He has <I>forgotten his Maker, and builds temples;</I> he seems by the
 temples he builds to me mindful of his Maker, and to be desirous still 
 to keep him in mind, and yet really he has forgotten him, because he 
 has cast off the fear of him." Some by temples here understand 
 <I>palaces,</I> for so the word sometimes signifies. "<I>He has 
 forgotten his Maker,</I> and yet is so secure and haughty that he sets 
 his judgments at defiance, as Nebuchadnezzar did when he said, <I>Is 
 not this great Babylon that I have built?</I>" Judah is likewise 
 charged with <I>multiplying fenced cities,</I> and trusting in them for 
 safety, when the judgments of God were abroad. To fortify their cities 
 in subjection and subordination to God was well enough; but to fortify 
 them in opposition to God, and without any regard to him or his 
 providence

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:11">Isa. xxii. 11</A>),

 shows their hearts to be desperately <I>hardened through the
 deceitfulness of sin.</I> But <I>none ever hardened his heart against 
 God and prospered,</I> nor shall they. <I>God will send a fire upon his 
 cities,</I> upon the cities both of Judah and Israel, not only the 
 head-cities of Jerusalem and Samaria, but all the other cities of those 
 two kingdoms, and it shall devour not only the cottages, but <I>the 
 palaces thereof;</I> though ever so strong, the fire shall master them; 
 though ever so stately and sumptuous, the fire shall not spare them. 
 This was fulfilled when all the cities of Israel were laid in ashes by 
 the king of Assyria, and all the cities of Judah by the king of 
 Babylon. The fires they both kindled were of his sending; and when he 
 judges he will overcome.</P>
