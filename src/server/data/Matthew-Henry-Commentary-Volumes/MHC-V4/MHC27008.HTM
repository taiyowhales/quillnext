 The visions and prophecies of this chapter look only and entirely at 
 the events that were then shortly to come to pass in the monarchies of 
 Persia and Greece, and seem not to have any further reference at all. 
 Nothing is here said of the Chaldean monarchy, for that was now just at 
 its period; and therefore this chapter is written not in Chaldee, as 
 the six foregoing chapters were, for the benefit of the Chaldeans, but 
 in Hebrew, and so are the rest of the chapters to the end of the book, 
 for the service of the Jews, that they might know what troubles were 
 before them and what the issue of them would be, and might provide 
 accordingly. In this chapter we have, 

 I. The vision itself of the ram, and the he-goat, and the little horn
 that should fight and prevail against the people of God, for a certain
 limited time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:1-14">ver. 1-14</A>.

 II. The interpretation of this vision by an angel, showing that the
 ram signified the Persian empire, the he-goat the Grecian, and the
 little horn a king of the Grecian monarchy, that should set himself
 against the Jews and religion, which was Antiochus Epiphanes, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:15-27">ver. 15-27</A>.

 The Jewish church, from its beginning, had been all along, more or 
 less, blessed with prophets, men divinely inspired to explain God's 
 mind to them in his providences and give them some prospect of what was 
 coming upon them; but, soon after Ezra's time, divine inspiration 
 ceased, and there was no more any prophet till the gospel day dawned.
 And therefore the events of that time were here foretold by Daniel, and 
 left upon record, that even then God might not leave himself without 
 witness, nor them without a guide.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision
 appeared unto me, <I>even unto</I> me Daniel, after that which
 appeared unto me at the first.
 &nbsp; 2  And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that
 I <I>was</I> at Shushan <I>in</I> the palace, which <I>is</I> in the province of
 Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.
 &nbsp; 3  Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood
 before the river a ram which had <I>two</I> horns: and the <I>two</I> horns
 <I>were</I> high; but one <I>was</I> higher than the other, and the higher
 came up last.
 &nbsp; 4  I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward;
 so that no beasts might stand before him, neither <I>was there any</I>
 that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his
 will, and became great.
 &nbsp; 5  And as I was considering, behold, a he goat came from the
 west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground:
 and the goat <I>had</I> a notable horn between his eyes.
 &nbsp; 6  And he came to the ram that had <I>two</I> horns, which I had seen
 standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his
 power.
 &nbsp; 7  And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with
 choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns:
 and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he
 cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was
 none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.
 &nbsp; 8  Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was
 strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four
 notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.
 &nbsp; 9  And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed
 exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and
 toward the pleasant <I>land.</I>
 &nbsp; 10  And it waxed great, <I>even</I> to the host of heaven; and it
 cast down <I>some</I> of the host and of the stars to the ground, and
 stamped upon them.
 &nbsp; 11  Yea, he magnified <I>himself</I> even to the prince of the host,
 and by him the daily <I>sacrifice</I> was taken away, and the place of
 his sanctuary was cast down.
 &nbsp; 12  And a host was given <I>him</I> against the daily <I>sacrifice</I> by
 reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the
 ground; and it practised, and prospered.
 &nbsp; 13  Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto
 that certain <I>saint</I> which spake, How long <I>shall be</I> the vision
 <I>concerning</I> the daily <I>sacrifice,</I> and the transgression of
 desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden
 under foot?
 &nbsp; 14  And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred
 days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The date of this vision, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 It was <I>in the third year of the reign of Belshazzar,</I> which 
 proved to be his last year, as many reckon; so that this chapter also 
 should be, in order of time, before the fifth. That Daniel might not be 
 surprised at the destruction of Babylon, now at hand, God gives him a 
 foresight of the destruction of other kingdoms hereafter, which in 
 their day had been as potent as that of Babylon. Could we foresee the 
 changes that shall be hereafter, when we are gone, we should the less 
 admire, and be less affected with, the changes in our own day; for 
 <I>that which is done</I> is <I>that which shall be done,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:9">Eccl. i. 9</A>.

 Then it was that a <I>vision appeared to me, even to me, Daniel.</I>
 Here he solemnly attests the truth of it: it was to him, even to him, 
 that the vision was shown; he was the eye-witness of it. And this
 vision puts him in mind of a former vision which <I>appeared to him at 
 the first,</I> in the first year of this reign, which he makes mention 
 of because this vision was an explication and confirmation of that, and 
 points at many of the same events. That seems to have been a dream, a 
 vision in his sleep; this seems to have been when he was awake.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The scene of this vision. The place where that was laid was in 
 <I>Shushan the palace,</I> one of the royal seats of the kings of 
 Persia, situated on the banks of the river Ulai, which surrounded the 
 city; it was in the province of Elam, that part of Persia which lay 
 next to Babylon. Daniel was not there in person, for he was now in 
 Babylon, a captive, in some employment under Belshazzar, and might not 
 go to such a distant country, especially being now an enemy's country. 
 But he was there in vision; as Ezekiel, when a captive in Babylon, was 
 often brought, in the spirit, to the land of Israel. Note, The soul may 
 be a liberty when the body is in captivity; for, when we are bound, the 
 Spirit of the Lord is not bound. The vision related to that country, 
 and therefore there he was made to fancy himself to be as strongly as 
 if he had really been there.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The vision itself and the process of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He saw a <I>ram</I> with <I>two horns,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 This was the second monarchy, of which the kingdoms of Media and Persia 
 were the two horns. The horns were <I>very high;</I> but that which
 came up last was the higher, and got the start of the former. So the 
 last shall be first, and the first last. The kingdom of Persia, which 
 rose last, in Cyrus, became more eminent than that of the Medes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He saw this <I>ram pushing</I> all about him with his horns 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),
 
 <I>westward</I> (towards Babylon, Syria, Greece, and Asia the less), 
 <I>northward</I> (towards the Lydians, Armenians, and Scythians), and 
 <I>southward</I> (towards Arabia, Ethiopia, and Egypt), for all these 
 nations did the Persian empire, one time or other, make attempts upon 
 for the enlarging of their dominion. And at last he became so powerful 
 that <I>no beasts might stand before him.</I> This <I>ram,</I> though 
 of a species of animal often preyed upon, became formidable even to the 
 beasts of prey themselves, so that there was <I>no standing</I> before 
 him, no escaping him, none that <I>could deliver out of his hand,</I> 
 but all must yield to him: the kings of Persia did according <I>to 
 their will,</I> prospered in all their ways abroad, had an 
 uncontrollable power at home, and <I>became great.</I> He thought 
 himself great because he did what he would; but to do good is that 
 which makes men truly great.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He saw this ram overcome by a he-goat. He was considering the 
 <I>ram</I> (wondering that so weak an animal should come to be so 
 prevalent) and thinking what would be the issue; and, <I>behold, a 
 he-goat came,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 This was Alexander the Great, the son of Philip king of Macedonia. He 
 <I>came from the west,</I> from Greece, which lay west from Persia. He 
 fetched a great compass with his army: he came <I>upon the face of the 
 whole earth;</I> he did in effect conquer the world, and then sat down 
 and wept because there was not another world to be conquered. <I>Unus 
 Pell&aelig;o juveni non sufficit orbis--One world was too little for 
 the youth of Pell&aelig;.</I> This he-goat (a creature famed for 
 comeliness in going, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:31">Prov. xxx. 31</A>)

 went on with incredible swiftness, so that he <I>touched not the 
 ground,</I> so lightly did he move; he rather seemed to fly above the 
 ground than to go upon the ground; or <I>none touched him in the 
 earth,</I> that is, he met with little or no opposition. This he-goat, 
 or buck, had a <I>notable horn between his eyes,</I> like a unicorn. He 
 had strength, and knew his own strength; he saw himself a match for all 
 his neighbours. Alexander pushed his conquests on so fast, and with so 
 much fury, that none of the kingdoms he attacked had courage to make a 
 stand, or give check to the progress of his victorious arms. In six 
 years he made himself master of the greatest part of the then known 
 world. Well might he be called a <I>notable horn,</I> for his name 
 still lives in history as the name of one of the most celebrated 
 commanders in war that ever the world knew. Alexander's victories and
 achievements are still the entertainment of the ingenious. This 
 <I>he-goat</I> came to the <I>ram that had two horns,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 Alexander with his victorious army attacked the kingdom of Persia, an 
 army consisting of no more than 30,000 foot and 5000 horse. He <I>ran 
 unto him,</I> to surprise him ere he could get intelligence of his 
 motions, <I>in the fury of his power.</I> He came <I>close to the 
 ram.</I> Alexander with his army came up with Darius Codomannus, then 
 emperor of Persia, being <I>moved with choler against him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 It was with the greatest violence that Alexander pushed on his war 
 against Darius, who, though he brought vast numbers into the field, 
 yet, for want of skill, was an unequal match for him, so that Alexander 
 was too hard for him whenever he engaged him, <I>smote him, cast him 
 down to the ground,</I> and <I>stamped upon him,</I> which three 
 expressions, some think, refer to the three famous victories that 
 Alexander obtained over Darius, at Granicus, at Issus, and at Arbela, 
 by which he was at length totally routed, having, in the last battle, 
 had 600,000 men killed, so that Alexander became absolute master of all 
 the Persian empire, <I>broke his two horns,</I> the kingdoms of Media 
 and Persia. The ram that had destroyed <I>all before him</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)
 
 now is himself destroyed; Darius has <I>no power to stand</I> before 
 Alexander, not has he any friends or allies to help to <I>deliver him 
 out of his hand.</I> Note, Those kingdoms which, when they had power, 
 abused it, and, because none could oppose them, withheld not themselves 
 from the doing of any wrong, may expect to have their power at length 
 taken from them, and to be served in their own kind, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:1">Isa. xxxiii. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He saw the he-goat made hereby very considerable; but the <I>great 
 horn,</I> that had done all this execution, <I>was broken,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 Alexander was about twenty years old when he began his wars. When he 
 was about twenty-six he conquered Darius, and became master of the 
 whole Persian empire; but when he was about thirty-two or thirty-three 
 <I>years of age,</I> when he was <I>strong,</I> in his full strength, 
 he was <I>broken.</I> He was not killed in war, in the bed of honour, 
 but died of a drunken surfeit, or, as some suspect, by poison and left 
 no child living behind him to enjoy that which he had endlessly 
 laboured for, but left a lasting monument of the vanity of worldly pomp 
 and power, and their insufficiency to make a man happy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He saw this kingdom divided into four parts, and that instead of 
 that one great horn there came up <I>four notable ones,</I> Alexander's 
 four captains, to whom he bequeathed his conquests; and he had so much 
 that, when it was divided among four, they had each of them enough for 
 any one man. These <I>four notable horns</I> were towards the <I>four 
 winds of heaven,</I> the same with the <I>four heads</I> of the leopard 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:6"><I>ch.</I> vii. 6</A>),

 the kingdoms of Syria and Egypt, Asia and Greece-Syria lying to the
 <I>east,</I> Greece to the <I>west,</I> Asia Minor to the <I>north,</I> 
 and Egypt to the <I>south.</I> Note, Those that heap up riches know not 
 who shall gather them, nor whose all those things shall be which they 
 have provided.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. He saw a <I>little horn</I> which became a great persecutor of the 
 church and people of God; and this was the principal thing that was 
 intended to be shown to him in this vision, as afterwards, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:30"><I>ch.</I> xi. 30</A>,

 &c. All agree that this was <I>Antiochus Epiphanes</I> (so he called 
 himself)--<I>the illustrious,</I> but others called him <I>Antiochus
 Epimanes</I>--<I>Antiochus the furious.</I> He is called here (as
 before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:8"><I>ch.</I> vii. 8</A>),

 a <I>little horn,</I> because he was in his original contemptible;
 there were others between him and the kingdom, and he was of a base 
 servile disposition, had nothing in him of princely qualities, and had 
 been for some time a hostage and prisoner at Rome, whence he made his 
 escape, and, though, the youngest brother, and his elder living, got 
 the kingdom. He waxed exceedingly great <I>towards the south,</I> for 
 he seized upon Egypt, and towards <I>the east,</I> for he invaded 
 Persia and Armenia. But that which is here especially taken notice of 
 is the mischief that he did to the people of the Jews. They are not
 expressly named, or prophecies must not be too plain; but they are here 
 so described that it would be easy for those who understood 
 scripture-language to know who were meant; and the Jews, having notice 
 of this before, might be awakened to prepare themselves and their 
 children beforehand for these suffering trying times. 

 (1.) He set himself against <I>the pleasant land,</I> the land of
 Israel, so called because it was the <I>glory of all lands,</I> for 
 fruitfulness and all the delights of human life, but especially for the 
 tokens of God's presence in it, and its being blessed with divine 
 revelations and institutions; it was Mount Zion that was <I>beautiful 
 for situation,</I> the <I>joy of the whole earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:2">Ps. xlviii. 2</A>.

 The pleasantness of that land was that there the Messiah was to be
 born, who would be both the consolation and <I>the glory of his people 
 Israel.</I> Note, We have reason to reckon that a pleasant place which 
 is a holy place, in which God dwells, and where we may have opportunity 
 of communing with him. Surely, <I>It is good to be here.</I>

 (2.) He fought against the <I>host of heaven,</I> that is, the people 
 of God, the church, which is the kingdom of heaven, the church-militant 
 here on earth. The saints, being born from above, and citizens of 
 heaven, and doing the will of God, by his grace, in some measure, as 
 the angels of heaven do it, may be well called a <I>heavenly host.</I> 
 Or the priests and Levites, who were employed in the service of the 
 tabernacle, and there <I>warred a good warfare,</I> were this <I>host 
 of heaven.</I> These Antiochus set himself against; he <I>waxed great 
 to the host of heaven,</I> in opposition to them and in defiance of 
 them.

 (3.) He <I>cast down some of the host</I> (that is, <I>of the
 stars,</I> for they are called the host of heaven) <I>to the ground, 
 and stamped upon them.</I> Some of those that were most eminent both in 
 church and state, that were burning and shining lights in their 
 generation, he either forced to comply with his idolatries or put them 
 to death; he got them into his hands, and then trampled upon them and 
 triumphed over them; as good old Eleazar, and the <I>seven 
 brethren,</I> whom he put to death with cruel tortures, because they 
 would not eat swine's flesh, 
 
 <U>2 Mac. vi. 7</U>.

 He gloried in it that herein he insulted Heaven itself and <I>exalted
 his throne above the stars of God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:13">Isa. xiv. 13</A>.

 (4.) He <I>magnified himself even to the prince of the host.</I> He set
 himself against the high priest, Onias, whom he deprived of his 
 dignity, or rather against God himself, who was Israel's <I>King of 
 old,</I> who <I>reigns for ever</I> Zion's King, who himself heads his 
 own host that fight his battles. Against him Antiochus magnified 
 himself; as Pharaoh, when he said, <I>Who is the Lord</I>? Note, Those 
 who persecute the people of God persecute God himself.

 (5.) He <I>took away the daily sacrifice.</I> The morning and evening 
 lamb, which God appointed to be offered every day upon his altar to his 
 honour, Antiochus forbade and restrained the offering of. No doubt he 
 took away all other sacrifices, but only the <I>daily sacrifice</I> is 
 mentioned, because that was the greatest loss of all, for in that they 
 kept up their constant communion with God, which they preferred before 
 that which is only occasional. God's people reckon their daily
 sacrifices, their morning and evening exercises of devotion, the most 
 needful of their daily business and the most delightful of their daily 
 comforts, and would not for all the world part with them.

 (6.) He <I>cast down the place of his sanctuary.</I> He did not burn
 and demolish the temple, but he cast it down, when he profaned it, made 
 it the temple of Jupiter Olympius, and set up his image in it. He also 
 <I>cast down the truth to the ground,</I> trampled upon the book of the 
 law, that word of truth, tore it, and burnt it, and did what he could 
 to destroy it quite, that it might be lost and forgotten for ever. 
 These were the projects of that wicked prince. In these he practised. 
 And (would you think it?) in these he prospered. He carried the matter 
 very far, seemed to have gained his point, and went near to extirpate 
 that holy religion which God's right hand had planted. But lest he or 
 any other should triumph, as if herein he had prevailed against God 
 himself and been too hard for him, the matter is here explained and set 
 in a true light.

 [1.] He could not have done this if God had not permitted him to do it, 
 could have had no power against Israel unless it had been given him 
 from above. God put this power into his hand, and <I>gave him a host 
 against the daily sacrifice.</I> God's providence put that sword into 
 his hand by which he was enabled thus to bear down all before him. 
 Note, We ought to eye and own the hand of God in all the enterprises 
 and all the successes of the church's enemies against the church. They 
 are but the rod in God's hand. 

 [2.] God would not have permitted it if his people had not provoked him 
 to do so. It is <I>by reason of transgression,</I> the transgression of 
 Israel, to correct them for that, that Antiochus is employed to give 
 them all this trouble. Note, When the pleasant land and all its 
 pleasant things are laid waste, it must be acknowledged that sin is the 
 procuring cause of all the desolation. <I>Who gave Jacob to the spoil? 
 Did not the Lord, he against whom we have sinned?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:24">Isa. xlii. 24</A>.

 The great transgression of the Jews after the captivity (when they were
 cured of idolatry) was a contempt and profanation of the holy things, 
 <I>snuffing</I> at the service of God, <I>bringing the torn and the 
 lame for sacrifice,</I> as if the <I>table of the Lord</I> were a 
 <I>contemptible</I> thing (so we find

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:7,8">Mal. i. 7, 8</A>,

 &c., and that the priests were guilty of this 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:1,8">Mal. ii. 1, 8</A>),

 and therefore God sent Antiochus to <I>take away the daily
 sacrifice</I> and <I>cast down the place of his sanctuary.</I> Note, It 
 is just with God to deprive those of the privileges of his house who 
 despise and profane them, and to make those know the worth of 
 ordinances by the want of them who would not know it by the enjoyment 
 of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. He heard the time of this calamity limited and determined, not the 
 time <I>when it should come</I> (that is not here fixed, because God 
 would have his people always prepared for it), but <I>how long it 
 should last,</I> that, when they had no more any <I>prophets to tell 
 them how long</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:9">Ps. lxxiv. 9</A>,

 which psalm seems to have been calculated for this dark and doleful 
 day), they might have this prophecy to give them a prospect of 
 deliverance in due time. Now concerning this we have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The question asked concerning it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 Observe 

 [1.] By whom the question was put: <I>I heard one saint speaking</I> to 
 this purport, and then <I>another saint</I> seconded him. "O that we 
 knew how long this trouble will last!" The angels here are called 
 <I>saints,</I> for they are <I>holy ones</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:13"><I>ch.</I> iv. 13</A>),

 the <I>holy myriads,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:14">Jude 14</A>.

 The angels concern themselves in the affairs of the church, and enquire
 concerning them, if, as here, concerning its temporal salvations, much 
 more do they desire to <I>look into the great salvation,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:12">1 Pet. i. 12</A>.

 One saint <I>spoke</I> of the thing, and another <I>enquired</I>
 concerning it. Thus John, who lay in Christ's bosom, was beckoned to by 
 Peter to ask Christ a question, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:23,24">John xiii. 23, 24</A>.

 [2.] To whom the question was put. He said <I>unto Palmoni that 
 spoke.</I> Some make this <I>certain saint</I> to be a superior angel 
 who understood more than the rest, to whom therefore they came with 
 their enquiries. Others make it to be the <I>eternal Word,</I> the 
 <I>Son of God.</I> He is the <I>unknown One. Palmoni</I> seems to be
 compounded of <I>Peloni Almoni,</I> which is used 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+4:1">Ruth iv. 1</A>)

 for <I>Ho, such a one,</I> and

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+6:8">2 Kings vi. 8</A>)

 for <I>such a place.</I> Christ was yet the <I>nameless One. Wherefore
 asked thou after my name, seeing it is secret?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:18">Judg. xiii. 18</A>.

 He is the <I>numberer of secrets</I> (as some translate it), for from
 him there is nothing hidden--<I>the wonderful numberer,</I> so others; 
 his name is called <I>Wonderful.</I> Note, If we would know the mind of 
 God, we must apply to Jesus Christ, who lay in the bosom of the Father, 
 and <I>in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and 
 knowledge,</I> not hidden from us, but hidden for us.

 [3.] The question itself that was asked: "<I>How long shall be the 
 vision concerning the daily sacrifice?</I> How long shall the 
 prohibition of it continue? How long shall the pleasant land be made 
 unpleasant by that severe interdict? How long shall <I>the
 transgression of desolation</I> (the image of Jupiter), that great 
 transgression which makes all our sacred things desolate, how long 
 shall that stand in the temple? How long shall <I>the sanctuary and the 
 host,</I> the holy place and the holy persons that minister in it, be 
 <I>trodden under foot</I> by the oppressor?" Note, Angels are concerned 
 for the prosperity of the church on earth and desirous to see an end of 
 its desolations. The angels asked, for the satisfaction of Daniel, not 
 doubting but he was desirous to know, how long these calamities should 
 last? The question takes it for granted that they should not last 
 always. <I>The rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the 
 righteous,</I> though it may come upon their lot. Christ comforted 
 himself in his sufferings with this, <I>The things concerning me have 
 an end</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:37">Luke xxii. 37</A>),

 and so may the church in hers. But it is desirable to know how long
 they shall last, that we may provide accordingly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The answer given to this question, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Christ gives instruction to the holy angels, for they are our 
 fellow-servants; but here the answer was given to Daniel, because for 
 his sake the question was asked: <I>He said unto me.</I> God sometimes 
 gives in great favours to his people, in answer to the enquiries and 
 requests of their friends for them. Now, 

 [1.] Christ assures him that the trouble shall end; it shall continue 
 <I>2300 days and no longer,</I> so many <I>evenings and mornings</I> 
 (so the word is), so many <B><I>nychthemerai</I></B>, so many 
 <I>natural days,</I> reckoned, as in the beginning of Genesis, by the 
 evenings and mornings, because it was the evening and the morning 
 sacrifice that they most lamented the loss of, and thought the time 
 passed very slowly while they were deprived of them. Some make the 
 morning and the evening, in this number, to stand for two, and then 
 2300 evenings and as many mornings will make but 1150 days; and about 
 so many days it was that the daily sacrifice was interrupted: and this 
 comes nearer to the computation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:25"><I>ch.</I> vii. 25</A>)

 of a <I>time, times,</I> and the <I>dividing of a time.</I> But it is
 less forced to understand them of so many natural days; 2300 days make 
 <I>six years</I> and <I>three months,</I> and about eighteen days; and 
 just so long they reckon from the defection of the people, procured by 
 Menelaus the high priest in the 142nd year of the kingdom of the 
 Seleucid&aelig;, the sixth month of that year, and the 6th day of the 
 month (so Josephus dates it), to the cleansing of the sanctuary, and 
 the reestablishment of religion among them, which was in the 148th 
 year, the 9th month, and the 25th <I>day of the month,</I> 
 
 <U>1 Mac. iv. 52.</U>

 God reckons the time of his people's afflictions he is afflicted.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:10">Rev. ii. 10</A>,

 Thou shalt have <I>tribulation ten days.</I> 

 [2.] He assures him that they shall see better days afterwards: <I>Then 
 shall the sanctuary be cleansed.</I> Note, The cleansing of the 
 sanctuary is a happy token for good to any people; when they begin to 
 be reformed they will soon be relieved. Though the righteous God may, 
 for the correction of his people, suffer his sanctuary to be profaned 
 for a while, yet the jealous God will, for his own glory, see to the 
 cleansing of it in due time. Christ died to cleanse his church, and he 
 will so cleanse it as at length to present it blameless to himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  And it came to pass, when I, <I>even</I> I Daniel, had seen the
 vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood
 before me as the appearance of a man.
 &nbsp; 16  And I heard a man's voice between <I>the banks of</I> Ulai, which
 called, and said, Gabriel, make this <I>man</I> to understand the
 vision.
 &nbsp; 17  So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was
 afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O
 son of man: for at the time of the end <I>shall be</I> the vision.
 &nbsp; 18  Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my
 face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.
 &nbsp; 19  And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in
 the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the
 end <I>shall be.</I>
 &nbsp; 20  The ram which thou sawest having <I>two</I> horns <I>are</I> the kings
 of Media and Persia.
 &nbsp; 21  And the rough goat <I>is</I> the king of Grecia: and the great
 horn that <I>is</I> between his eyes <I>is</I> the first king.
 &nbsp; 22  Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four
 kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.
 &nbsp; 23  And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the
 transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance,
 and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.
 &nbsp; 24  And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and
 he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise,
 and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.
 &nbsp; 25  And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper
 in his hand; and he shall magnify <I>himself</I> in his heart, and by
 peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the
 Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.
 &nbsp; 26  And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told
 <I>is</I> true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it <I>shall be</I>
 for many days.
 &nbsp; 27  And I Daniel fainted, and was sick <I>certain</I> days; afterward
 I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at
 the vision, but none understood <I>it.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Daniel's earnest desire to have this vision explained to him 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>I sought the meaning.</I> Note, Those that rightly know the things 
 of God cannot but desire to know more and more of them, and to be led 
 further into the mystery of them; and those that would find the meaning 
 of what they have seen or heard from God must seek it, and seek it 
 diligently. <I>Seek and you shall find.</I> Daniel considered the 
 thing, compared it with the former discoveries, to try if he could 
 understand it; but especially he sought by prayer (as he had done

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:18"><I>ch.</I> ii. 18</A>),

 and he did not seek in vain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Orders given to the angel Gabriel to inform him concerning this 
 vision. One <I>in the appearance of a man</I> (who, some think, was 
 Christ himself, for who besides could command angels?) orders Gabriel 
 to <I>make Daniel understand this vision.</I> Sometimes God is pleased 
 to make use of the ministration of angels, not only to protect his 
 children, but to instruct them, to serve the kind intentions, not only 
 of his providence, but of his grace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The consternation that Daniel was in upon the approach of his 
 instructor 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>When he came near I was afraid.</I> Though Daniel was a man of great 
 prudence and courage, and had been conversant with the visions of the 
 Almighty, yet the approach of an extraordinary messenger from heaven 
 put him into this fright. He <I>fell upon his face,</I> not to worship 
 the angel, but because he could no longer bear the dazzling lustre of 
 his glory. Nay, being prostrate upon the ground, he <I>fell into a deep 
 sleep,</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 which came not from any neglect of the vision, or indifference towards 
 it, but was an effect of his faintness and the oppression of spirit he 
 was under, through the abundance of revelations. The disciples in the 
 garden slept for sorrow; and, as there, so here, <I>the spirit was 
 willing, but the flesh was weak.</I> Daniel would have kept awake, and 
 could not.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The relief which the angel gave to Daniel, with great encouragement 
 to him to expect a satisfactory discovery of the meaning of this 
 vision. 
 
 1. He <I>touched him,</I> and <I>set him upon his feet,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Thus when John, in a similar case, was in similar consternation, Christ
 <I>laid his right hand upon him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:17">Rev. i. 17</A>.

 It was a gentle touch that the angel here gave to Daniel, to show that 
 he came not to hurt him, not to <I>plead against him with his great 
 power,</I> or with a hand <I>heavy upon him,</I> but to help him, to 
 <I>put strength into him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:6">Job xxiii. 6</A>),

 which God can do with a touch. When we are slumbering and grovelling
 on this earth we are very unfit to hear from God, and to converse with 
 him. But, if God design instruction for us, he will be his grace awaken 
 us out of our slumber, raise us from things below, and <I>set us 
 upright.</I> 

 2. He promised to inform him: "<I>Understand, O son of man!</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Thou shalt understand, if thou wilt but apply thy mind to understand." 
 He calls him <I>son of man</I> to intimate that he would consider his 
 frame, and would deal tenderly with him, accommodating himself to his 
 capacity as a man. Or thus he preaches humility to him; though he be 
 admitted to converse with angels, he must not be puffed up with it, but 
 must remember that he is a son of man. Or perhaps this title puts 
 honour upon him: the Messiah was lately called the <I>Son of man</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:13"><I>ch.</I> vii. 13</A>),

 and Daniel is akin to him, and is a figure of him as a prophet and one
 <I>greatly beloved.</I> He assures him that he shall be made to know 
 <I>what shall be in the last end of the indignation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Let it be laid up for a comfort to those who shall live to see these 
 calamitous times that there shall be an end of them; <I>the indignation 
 shall cease</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:25">Isa. x. 25</A>);

 it <I>shall be overpast,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:20">Isa. xxvi. 20</A>.

 It may intermit and return again, but the <I>last end</I> shall be
 glorious; good will follow it, nay, and good will be brought out of it.
 He tells him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 "<I>At the time of the end shall be the vision;</I> when the last end 
 of the indignation comes, when the course of this providence is 
 completed, then the vision shall be made plain and intelligible by the 
 event, as the event shall be made plain and intelligible by the 
 vision." Or, "<I>At the time of the end</I> of the Jewish church, in 
 the latter days of it, <I>shall this vision</I> be accomplished, 300 or 
 400 years hence; understand it therefore, that thou mayest leave it on 
 record for the generations to come." But is he ask more particularly, 
 "When is the time of the end? And how long will it be before it 
 arrive?" let this answer suffice 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>At the time appointed the end shall be;</I> it is fixed in the 
 divine counsel, which cannot be altered and which must not be pried 
 into.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The exposition which he gave him of the vision.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Concerning the two monarchies of Persia and Greece, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:20-22"><I>v.</I> 20-22</A>.

 The <I>ram</I> signified the succession of the kings of Media and 
 Persia; the <I>rough goat</I> signified the kings of Greece; the 
 <I>great horn</I> was Alexander; the <I>four horns</I> that rose in his 
 room were the four kingdoms into which his conquests were cantoned, of 
 which before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 They are said to <I>stand up out of the nations,</I> but <I>not in his 
 power;</I> none of them ever made the figure that Alexander did. 
 Josephus relates that when Alexander had taken Tyre, and subdued 
 Palestine, and was upon his march to Jerusalem, Jaddas, who was them 
 high priest (Nehemiah mentions one of his name,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+12:11"><I>ch.</I> xii. 11</A>),

 fearing his rage, had recourse to God by prayer and sacrifice for the 
 common safety, and was by him warned in a dream that upon Alexander's 
 approach he should throw open the gates of the city, and that he and 
 the rest of the priests should go forth to meet him in their habits, 
 and all the people in white. Alexander, seeing this company at a 
 distance, went himself alone to the high priest, and, having prostrated 
 himself before that God whose name was engraven in the golden plate of 
 his mitre, he first saluted him; and, being asked by one of his own 
 captains why he did so, he said that while he was yet in Macedon, 
 musing on the conquest of Asia, there appeared to him a man like unto 
 this, and thus attired, who invited him into Asia, and assured him of 
 success in the conquest of it. The priests led him to the temple, where 
 he offered sacrifice to the God of Israel as they directed him; and 
 there they showed him this book of the prophet Daniel, that it was 
 there foretold that a Grecian should come and destroy the Persians, 
 which animated him very much in the expedition he was now meditating 
 against Darius. Hereupon he took the Jews and their religion under his 
 protection, promised to be kind to those of their religion in Babylon 
 and Media, whither he was now marching, and in honour of him all the 
 priests that had sons born that year called them <I>Alexander. Joseph. 
 lib.</I> 11.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Concerning Antiochus, and his oppression of the Jews. This is said 
 to be in the <I>latter time of the</I> kingdom of the Greeks, <I>when 
 the transgressors are come to the full</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>);

 that is, when the degenerate Jews have filled up the measure of their 
 iniquity, and are ripe for this destruction, so that God cannot in 
 honour bear with them any longer then shall <I>stand up</I> this king, 
 to be <I>flagellum Dei--the rod in God's hand</I> for the chastising of 
 the Jews. Now observe here, 

 (1.) His character: He shall be a <I>king of fierce countenance,</I>
 insolent and furious, neither fearing God nor regarding man, 
 <I>understanding dark sentences,</I> or (rather) <I>versed in dark 
 practices,</I> the <I>hidden things of dishonesty;</I> he was master of 
 all the arts of dissimulation and deceit, and knew the <I>depths of 
 Satan</I> as well as any man. He was <I>wise to do evil.</I>

 (2.) His success. He shall make dreadful havoc of the nations about
 him: <I>His power shall be mighty,</I> bear down all before it, but not 
 <I>by his own power</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 but partly by the assistance of his allies, Eumenes and Attalus, partly 
 by the baseness and treachery of many of the Jews, even of the priests 
 that came into his interests, and especially by the divine permission. 
 it was not by his own power, but by a power given him from above, that 
 he <I>destroyed wonderfully,</I> and thought he made himself a great 
 man by being a great destroyer. He destroys wonderfully indeed, for he 
 destroys, 

 [1.] The <I>mighty people,</I> and they cannot resist him by their 
 power. The princes of Egypt cannot stand before him with all their 
 forces, but he practises against them and prospers. Note, The mighty 
 ones of the earth commonly meet with those at length that are too hard 
 for them, that are more mighty than they. Let not the strong man then 
 glory in his strength, be it ever so great, unless he could be sure 
 that there were none stronger than he. 

 [2.] He destroys the <I>holy people,</I> or <I>the people of the holy 
 ones;</I> and their sacred character does neither deter him from 
 destroying them nor defend them from being destroyed. <I>All things 
 come alike to all,</I> and there is one event to the mighty and to the 
 holy in this world. 

 [3.] The methods by which he will gain this success, not by true 
 courage, wisdom, or justice, but by his <I>policy</I> and <I>craft</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),
 
 by fraud and deceit, and serpentine subtlety: He shall <I>cause craft 
 to prosper;</I> so cunningly shall he carry on his projects that he 
 shall gain his point by the art of wheedling. <I>By peace he shall 
 destroy many,</I> as others do by war; under the pretence of treaties, 
 leagues, and alliances, with them, he shall encroach on their rights, 
 and trick them into a subjection to him. Thus sometimes what a nation 
 truly brave has gained in a righteous war a nation truly base has 
 regained in a treacherous peace, and craft has been caused to prosper.
 
 [4.] The mischief that he shall do to religion: <I>He shall magnify 
 himself in his heart,</I> and think himself fit to prescribe and give 
 law to every body, so that he shall <I>stand up against the Prince of 
 princes,</I> that is, against God himself. He will profane his temple 
 and altar, prohibit his worship, and persecute his worshippers. See 
 what a height of impudence some men's impiety brings them to; they 
 openly bid defiance to God himself though he is the Kings of kings.
 
 [5.] The ruin that he shall be brought to at last: <I>He shall be 
 broken without hand,</I> that is, without the hand of man. He shall not 
 be slain in war, nor shall he be assassinated, as tyrants commonly 
 were, but he shall fall into the hand of the living God and die by an 
 immediate stroke of his vengeance. He, hearing that the Jews had cast 
 the image of Jupiter Olympius out of the temple, where he had placed 
 it, was so enraged at the Jews that he vowed he would make Jerusalem 
 <I>a common burial-place,</I> and determined to march thither 
 immediately; but no sooner had he spoken these proud words than he was 
 struck with an incurable plague in his bowels; worms bred so fast in 
 his body that whole flakes of flesh sometimes dropped from him; his 
 torments were violent, and the stench of his disease such that none 
 could endure to come near him. He continued in this misery very long.
 At first he persisted in his menaces against the Jews; but at length, 
 despairing of his recovery, he called his friends together, and 
 acknowledged all those miseries to have fallen upon him for the 
 injuries he had done to the Jews and his profaning the temple at 
 Jerusalem. Then he wrote courteous letters to the Jews, and vowed that 
 if he recovered he would let them have the free exercise of their 
 religion. But, finding his disease grow upon him, when he could no 
 longer endure his own smell, he said, <I>It is meet to submit to God, 
 and for man who is mortal not to set himself in competition with 
 God,</I> and so died miserably in a strange land, on the mountains of 
 Pacata near Babylon: so Ussher's Annals, <I>A.M.</I> 3840, about 160 
 years before the birth of Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. As to the time fixed for the continuance of the cessation of the 
 daily sacrifice, it is not explained here, but only confirmed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>).
 
 That <I>vision of the evening and morning is true,</I> in the proper 
 sense of the words, and needs no explication. How unlikely soever it 
 might be that God should suffer his own sanctuary to be thus profaned, 
 yet it is true, it is too true, so it shall be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Here is the conclusion of this vision, and here, 

 1. The charge given to Daniel to keep it private for the present:
 <I>Shut thou up the vision;</I> let it not be publicly know among the 
 Chaldeans, lest the Persians, who were now shortly to possess the 
 kingdom, should be incensed against the Jews by it, because the 
 downfall of their kingdom was foretold by it, which would be 
 unseasonable now that the edict for their release was expected from the 
 king of Persia. <I>Shut it up, for it shall be for many days.</I> It 
 was about 300 years from the time of this vision to the time of the 
 accomplishment of it; therefore he must <I>shut it up</I> for the 
 present, even from the people of the Jews, lest it should amaze and 
 perplex them, but let it be kept safely for the generations to come, 
 that should live about the time of the accomplishment of it, for to 
 them it would be both most intelligible and most serviceable. Note, 
 What we know of the things of God should be carefully laid up, that 
 hereafter, when there is occasion, it may be faithfully laid out; and 
 what we have not now any use for, yet we may have another time. Divine 
 truths should be sealed up among our treasures, that we may find them 
 again after many days. 

 2. The care he took to keep it private, having received such a charge,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 He <I>fainted, and was sick,</I> with the multitude of his thoughts 
 within him occasioned by this vision, which oppressed and overwhelmed 
 him the more because he was forbidden to publish what he had seen, so 
 that <I>his belly was as wine which has no vent,</I> he was <I>ready to 
 burst like new bottles,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:19">Job xxxii. 19</A>.

 However, he kept it to himself, stifled and smothered the concern he
 was in; so that those he conversed with could not perceive it, but he 
 <I>did the king's business</I> according to the duty of his place, 
 whatever it was. Note, As long as we live in this world we must have 
 something to do in it; and even those whom God has most dignified with 
 his favours must not think themselves above their business; nor must 
 the pleasure of communion with God take us off from the duties of our 
 particular callings, but still we must in them <I>abide with God.</I> 
 Those especially that are entrusted with public business must see to it 
 that they conscientiously discharge their trust.</P>
