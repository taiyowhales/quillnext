 It was said 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:17"><I>ch.</I> i. 17</A>)

 that Daniel had understanding in dreams; and here we have an early and
 eminent instance of it, which soon made him famous in the court of 
 Babylon, as Joseph by the same means came to be so in the court of 
 Egypt. This chapter is a history, but it is the history of a prophecy, 
 by a dream and the interpretation of it. Pharaoh's dream, and Joseph's 
 interpretation of it, related only to the years of plenty and famine 
 and the interest of God's Israel in them; but Nebuchadnezzar's dream 
 here, and Daniel's interpretation of that, look much higher, to the 
 four monarchies, and the concerns of Israel in them, and the kingdom of 
 the Messiah, which should be set up in the world upon the ruins of 
 them. In this chapter we have, 

 I. The great perplexity that Nebuchadnezzar was put into by a dream 
 which he had forgotten, and his command to the magicians to tell him 
 what it was, which they could not pretend to do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:1-11">ver. 1-11</A>.

 II. Orders given for the destroying of all the wise men of Babylon, and
 of Daniel among the rest, with his fellows, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:12-15">ver. 12-15</A>.

 III. The discovery of this secret to him, in answer to prayer, and the
 thanksgiving he offered up to God thereupon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:16-23">ver. 16-23</A>.

 IV. His admission to the king, and the discovery he made to him both of
 his dream and of the interpretation of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:24-45">ver. 24-45</A>.

 V. The great honour which Nebuchadnezzar put upon Daniel, in recompence
 for this service, and the preferment of his companions with him,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar
 Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled,
 and his sleep brake from him.
 &nbsp; 2  Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the
 astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to show
 the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.
 &nbsp; 3  And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my
 spirit was troubled to know the dream.
 &nbsp; 4  Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriac, O king, live
 for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will show the
 interpretation.
 &nbsp; 5  The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is
 gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with
 the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your
 houses shall be made a dunghill.
 &nbsp; 6  But if ye show the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye
 shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore
 show me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.
 &nbsp; 7  They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants
 the dream, and we will show the interpretation of it.
 &nbsp; 8  The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would
 gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.
 &nbsp; 9  But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, <I>there is
 but</I> one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt
 words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore
 tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can show me the
 interpretation thereof.
 &nbsp; 10  The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is
 not a man upon the earth that can show the king's matter:
 therefore <I>there is</I> no king, lord, nor ruler, <I>that</I> asked such
 things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.
 &nbsp; 11  And <I>it is</I> a rare thing that the king requireth, and there
 is none other that can show it before the king, except the gods,
 whose dwelling is not with flesh.
 &nbsp; 12  For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and
 commanded to destroy all the wise <I>men</I> of Babylon.
 &nbsp; 13  And the decree went forth that the wise <I>men</I> should be
 slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We meet with a great difficulty in the date of this story; it is said 
 to be in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Now Daniel was carried to Babylon in his first year, and, it should 
 seem, he was three years under tutors and governors before he was 
 presented to the king,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:5"><I>ch.</I> i. 5</A>.

 How then could this happen in <I>the second year?</I> Perhaps, though
 three years were appointed for the education of other children, yet 
 Daniel was so forward that he was taken into business when he had been 
 but one year at school, and so in the second year he became thus 
 considerable. Some make it to be the second year after he began to 
 reign alone, but the fifth or sixth year since he began to reign in 
 partnership with his <I>father.</I> Some read it, <I>and in the second 
 year,</I> (the second after Daniel and his fellows stood before the 
 king), <I>in the kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar,</I> or <I>in his reign,</I> 
 this happened; as Joseph, in the second year after his skill in dreams, 
 showed and expounded Pharaoh's, so Daniel, in the second year after he 
 commenced master in that art, did this service. I would much rather 
 take it some of these ways than suppose, as some do, that it was in the 
 second year after he had conquered Egypt, which was the thirty-sixth 
 year of his reign, because it appears by what we meet with in Ezekiel, 
 that Daniel was famous both for wisdom and prevalence in prayer long 
 before that; and therefore this passage, or story, which shows how he 
 came to be so eminent for both these must be laid early in 
 Nebuchadnezzar's reign. Now here we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The perplexity that Nebuchadnezzar was in by reason of a dream which 
 he had dreamed but had forgotten 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>He dreamed dreams,</I> that is, a dream consisting of divers 
 distinct parts, or which filled his head as much as if it had been many 
 dreams. Solomon speaks of a <I>multitude of dreams,</I> strangely 
 incoherent, in which <I>there are divers vanities,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:7">Eccl. v. 7</A>.

 This dream of Nebuchadnezzar's had nothing in the thing itself but what
 might be paralleled in many a common dream, in which are often 
 represented to men things as foreign as are here mentioned; but there 
 was something in the impression it made upon him which carried with it 
 an incontestable evidence of its divine original and its prophetic 
 significancy. Note, The greatest of men are not exempt from, nay, they 
 lie most open to, those cares and troubles of mind which disturb their 
 repose in the night, while <I>the sleep of the labouring man is 
 sweet</I> and sound, and the sleep of the sober temperate man free from 
 confused dreams. The abundance of the rich will not suffer them to 
 sleep at all for care, and the excesses of gluttons and drunkards will 
 not suffer them to sleep quietly for dreaming. But this recorded here 
 was not from natural causes. Nebuchadnezzar was a troubler of God's
 Israel, but God here troubled him; for he that made the soul can 
 <I>make his sword to approach to it.</I> He had his guards about him, 
 but they could not keep trouble from his spirit. We know not the 
 uneasiness of many that live in great pomp, and, one would think, in 
 pleasure, too. We look into their houses, and are tempted to envy them; 
 but, could we look into their hearts, we should pity them rather. All 
 the treasures and all the delights of the children of men, which this 
 mighty monarch had command of, could not procure him a little repose, 
 when by reason of the trouble of his mind his <I>sleep broke from 
 him.</I> But God <I>gives his beloved sleep,</I> who return to him as 
 their rest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The trial that he made of his magicians and astrologers whether 
 they could tell him what his dream was, which he had forgotten. They 
 were immediately sent for, to <I>show the king his dreams,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 There are many things which we retain the impressions of, and yet have 
 lost the images of the things; though we cannot tell what the matter 
 was, we know how we were affected with it; so it was with this king. 
 His dream had slipped out of his mind, and he could not possibly 
 recollect it, but he was confident he should know it if he heard it 
 again. God ordered it so that Daniel might have the more honour, and, 
 in him, the God of Daniel. Note, God sometimes serves his own purposes 
 by putting things out of men's minds as well as by putting things into 
 their minds. The magicians, it is likely, were proud of their being 
 sent for into the king's bed-chamber, to give him a taste of their 
 office, not doubting but it would be for their honour. He tells them 
 that he had <I>dreamed a dream,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 They speak to him in the Syriac tongue, which was then the same with 
 the Chaldee, but now they differ much. And henceforward Daniel uses 
 that language, or dialect of the Hebrew, for the same reason that those 
 words, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:11">Jer. x. 11</A>,

 are in that language because designed to convince the Chaldeans of the
 folly of their idolatry and to bring them to the knowledge and worship 
 of the true and living God, which the stories of these chapters have a 
 direct tendency to. But

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:1-27"><I>ch.</I> viii.</A>

 and forward, being intended for the comfort of the Jews, is written in
 their peculiar language. They, in their answer, complimented the king 
 with their good wishes, desired him to tell his dream, and undertook 
 with all possible assurance to interpret it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 But the king insisted upon it that they must tell him the dream itself, 
 because he had forgotten it and could not tell it to them. And, if they 
 could not do this, they should all be put to death as deceivers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),
 
 themselves <I>cut to pieces</I> and <I>their houses made a 
 dunghill.</I> If they could, they should be rewarded and preferred, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 And they knew, as Balaam did concerning Balak, that he was able to 
 <I>promote them to great honour,</I> and give them that <I>wages of 
 unrighteousness</I> which, like him, <I>they loved</I> so dearly. No 
 question therefore that they will do their utmost to gratify the king; 
 if they do not, it is not for want of good-will, but for want of power, 
 Providence so ordering it that the magicians of Babylon might now be as 
 much confounded and put to shame as of old the magicians of Egypt had 
 been, that, how much soever his people were both in Egypt and Babylon 
 vilified and made contemptible, his oracles might in both be magnified 
 and made honourable, by the silencing of those that set up in 
 competition with them. The magicians, having reason on their side,
 insist upon it that the king must tell them the dream, and then, if 
 they do not tell him the interpretation of it, it is their fault, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 But arbitrary power is deaf to reason. The king falls into a passion, 
 gives them hard words, and, without any colour of reason, suspects that 
 they could tell him but would not; and instead of upbraiding them with 
 impotency, and the deficiency of their art, as he might justly have 
 done, he charges them with a combination to affront him: <I>You have 
 prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me.</I> How 
 unreasonable and absurd is this imputation! If they had undertaken to 
 tell him what his dream was, and had imposed upon him with a sham, he 
 might have charged them with lying and corrupt words; but to say this 
 of them when they honestly confessed their own weakness only shows what 
 senseless things indulged passions are, and how apt great men are to 
 think it is their prerogative to pursue their humour in defiance of 
 reason and equity, and all the dictates of both. When the magicians 
 begged of him to tell them the dream, though the request was highly 
 rational and just, he tells them that they did but dally with him, to 
 gain time 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 <I>till the time be changed</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 either till the king's desire to know his dream be over, and he grown 
 indifferent whether he be told it or no, though now he is so hot upon 
 it, or till they may hope he has so perfectly forgotten his dream (the 
 remaining shades of which are slipping from him apace as he catches at 
 them) that they may tell him what they please and make him believe it 
 was his dream, and, when the thing which is going, is quite <I>gone 
 from him,</I> as it will be in a little time, he will not be able to 
 disprove them. And therefore, without delay, they must tell him the
 dream. In vain do they plead, 

 1. That there is <I>no man on earth</I> that can retrieve the king's
 dream,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 There are settled rules by which to discover what the meaning of the 
 dream was; whether they will hold or no is the question. But never
 were any rules offered to be given by which to discover what the dream 
 was; they cannot work unless they have something to work upon. They 
 acknowledge that the gods may indeed <I>declare unto man what is his 
 thought</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+4:13">Amos iv. 13</A>),

 for God <I>understands our thoughts afar off</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:2">Ps. cxxxix. 2</A>),

 what they will be before we think them, what they are when we do not
 regard them, what they have been when we have forgotten them. But those 
 who can do this are gods, that <I>have not their dwelling with 
 flesh</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 and it is they alone that can do this. As for men, their <I>dwelling is 
 with flesh;</I> the wisest and greatest of men are clouded with a veil 
 of flesh, which quite obstructs and confounds all their acquaintance 
 with spirit, and their powers and operations; but the gods, that are 
 themselves pure spirit, know what is in man. See here an instance of 
 the ignorance of these magicians, that they speak of many gods, whereas 
 there is but one and can be but one infinite; yet see their knowledge 
 of that which even the light of nature teaches and the works of nature 
 prove, that there is a God, who is a Spirit, and perfectly knows the 
 spirits of men and all their thoughts, so as it is not possible that 
 any man should. This confession of the divine omniscience is here 
 extorted from these idolaters, to the honour of God and their own 
 condemnation, who though they knew there is a God in heaven, <I>to whom 
 all hearts are open, all desires known, and from whom no secret is 
 hid,</I> yet offered up their prayers and praises to dumb idols, that 
 have <I>eyes and see not, ears and hear not.</I> 

 2. That there is no king on earth that would expect or require such a 
 thing,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 This intimates that they were <I>kings, lords,</I> and 
 <I>potentates,</I> not ordinary people, that the magicians had most 
 dealings with, and at whose devotion they were, while the oracles of 
 God and the gospel of Christ are dispensed <I>to the poor.</I> Kings 
 and potentates have often required unreasonable things of their 
 subjects, but they think that never any required so unreasonable a 
 thing as this, and therefore hope his imperial majesty will not insist 
 upon it. But it is all in vain; when passion is in the throne reason is 
 under foot: He was <I>angry and very furious,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Note, It is very common for those that will not be convinced by reason 
 to be provoked and exasperated by it, and to push on with fury what 
 they cannot support with equity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The doom passed upon all the magicians of Babylon. There is but 
 <I>one decree for them all</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 they all stand condemned without exception or distinction. The decree 
 has gone forth, they must every man of them be slain 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 Daniel and his fellows (though they knew nothing of the matter) not 
 excepted. See here,

 1. What are commonly the unjust proceedings of arbitrary power.
 Nebuchadnezzar is here a tyrant in true colours, speaking death when he 
 cannot speak sense, and treating those as traitors whose only fault is 
 that they would serve him, but cannot. 

 2. What is commonly the just punishment of pretenders. How
 unrighteous soever Nebuchadnezzar was in this sentence, as to the 
 ringleaders in the imposture, God was righteous. Those that imposed 
 upon men, in pretending to do what they could not do, are now sentenced 
 to death for not being able to do what they did not pretend to.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the
 captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the
 wise <I>men</I> of Babylon:
 &nbsp; 15  He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why <I>is</I>
 the decree <I>so</I> hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing
 known to Daniel.
 &nbsp; 16  Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would
 give him time, and that he would show the king the
 interpretation.
 &nbsp; 17  Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to
 Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:
 &nbsp; 18  That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven
 concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not
 perish with the rest of the wise <I>men</I> of Babylon.
 &nbsp; 19  Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision.
 Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
 &nbsp; 20  Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for
 ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:
 &nbsp; 21  And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth
 kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and
 knowledge to them that know understanding:
 &nbsp; 22  He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what
 <I>is</I> in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.
 &nbsp; 23  I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who
 hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now
 what we desired of thee: for thou hast <I>now</I> made known unto us
 the king's matter.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When the king sent for his wise men to tell them his dream, and the 
 interpretation of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 Daniel, it seems, was not summoned to appear among them; the king, 
 though he was highly pleased with him when he examined him, and thought 
 him <I>ten times</I> wiser than the rest of his wise men, yet forgot 
 him when he had most occasion for him; and no wonder, when all was done 
 in a heat, and nothing with a cool and deliberate thought. But 
 Providence so ordered it; that the magicians being nonplussed might be 
 the more taken notice of, and so the more glory might redound to the 
 God of Daniel. But, though Daniel had not the honour to be consulted 
 with the rest of the wise men, contrary to all law and justice, by an 
 undistinguishing sentence, he stands condemned with them, and till he 
 has notice brought him to prepare for execution he knows nothing of the 
 matter. How miserable is the case of those who live under arbitrary 
 government, as this of Nebuchadnezzar's! How happy are we, whose lives
 are under the protection of the law and methods of justice, and lie not 
 thus at the mercy of a peevish and capricious prince!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have found already, in Ezekiel, that Daniel was famous both for 
 prudence and prayer; as a prince he had power with God and by man; by 
 prayer he had power with God, by prudence he had power with man, and in 
 both he prevailed. Thus did he <I>find favour and good 
 understanding</I> in the sight of both, and in these verses we have a 
 remarkable instance of both.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Daniel by prudence knew how to deal with men, and he prevailed with 
 them. When <I>Arioch, the captain of the guard,</I> that was appointed 
 to slay all the wise men of Babylon, the whole college of them, seized 
 Daniel (for the sword of tyranny, like the sword of war, <I>devours one 
 as well as another</I>), he <I>answered with counsel and wisdom</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);

 he did not fall into a passion, and reproach the king as unjust and 
 barbarous, much less did he contrive how to make resistance, but mildly 
 asked, <I>Why is the decree so hasty?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 And whereas the rest of the wise men had insisted upon it that it was 
 utterly impossible for him ever to have his demand gratified, which did 
 but make him more outrageous, Daniel undertakes, if he may but have a 
 little time allowed him, to give the king all the satisfaction he 
 desired, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 The king, being now sensible of his error in not sending for Daniel 
 sooner, whose character he began to recollect, was soon prevailed upon 
 to respite the judgment, and make trial of Daniel. Note, The likeliest
 method to turn away wrath, even the wrath of a king, which is as the 
 messenger of death, is by a <I>soft answer,</I> by that yielding which 
 <I>pacifies great offences;</I> thus, though <I>where the word of a 
 king is there is power,</I> yet even that word may be repelled, and 
 that so as to be repealed; and so some read it here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>Then Daniel returned,</I> and stayed <I>the counsel and edict, 
 through Arioch, the king's provost-marshal.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Daniel knew how by prayer to converse with God, and he found favour 
 with him, both in petition and in thanksgiving, which are the two 
 principal parts of prayer. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His humble petition for this mercy, that God would discover to him 
 what was the king's dream, and the interpretation of it. When he had 
 gained time he did not go to consult with the rest of the wise men 
 whether there was anything in their art, in their books, that might be 
 of use in this matter, but <I>went to his house,</I> there to be alone 
 with God, for from him alone, who is the Father of lights, he expected 
 this great gift. Observe, 

 (1.) He did not only pray for this discovery himself, but he engaged 
 his companions to pray for it too. He <I>made the thing known</I> to 
 those who had been all along his bosom-friends and associates, 
 requesting <I>that they would desire mercy of God concerning this 
 secret,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.

 Though Daniel was probably their senior, and every way excelled them, 
 yet he engaged them as partners with him in this matter, <I>Vis unita 
 fortior--The union of forces produces greater force.</I> See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+4:16">Esth. iv. 16</A>.

 Note, Praying friends are valuable friends; it is good to have an
 intimacy with and an interest in those that have fellowship with God 
 and an interest at the throne of grace; and it well becomes the 
 greatest and best of men to desire the assistance of the prayers of 
 others for them. St. Paul often entreats his friends to pray for him.
 Thus we must show that we put a value upon our friends, upon prayer, 
 upon their prayers.

 (2.) He was particular in this prayer, but had an eye to, and a 
 dependence upon, the general mercy of God: <I>That they would desire 
 the mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 We ought in prayer to look up to God as the <I>God of heaven,</I> a God 
 above us, and who has dominion over us, to whom we owe adoration and 
 allegiance, a God of power, who can do everything. Our savior has
 taught us to pray to God as <I>our Father in heaven.</I> And, whatever 
 good we pray for, our dependence must be upon the <I>mercies of God</I> 
 for it, and an interest in those mercies we must desire; we can expect 
 nothing by way of recompence for our merits, but all as the gift of 
 God's mercies. They desired mercy <I>concerning this secret.</I> Note,
 Whatever is the matter of our care must be the matter of our prayer; we 
 must desire mercy of God concerning this thing and the other thing that 
 occasions us trouble and fear. God gives us leave to be humbly free 
 with him, and in prayer to enter into the detail of our wants and 
 burdens. <I>Secret things belong to the Lord our God,</I> and 
 therefore, if there be any mercy we stand in need of that concerns a 
 secret, to him we must apply; and, though we cannot in faith pray for 
 miracles, yet we may in faith pray to him who has all hearts in his 
 hand, and who in his providence does wonders without miracles, for the 
 discovery of that which is out of our view and the obtaining of that 
 which is out of our reach, as far as is for his glory and our good, 
 believing that to him nothing is hidden, nothing is hard.

 (3.) Their plea with God was the imminent peril they were in; they 
 desired mercy of God in this matter, that so Daniel and his <I>fellows 
 might not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon,</I> that the 
 righteous might not be destroyed with the wicked. Note, When the lives 
 of good and useful men are in danger it is time to be earnest with God 
 for mercy for them, as for Peter in prison, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:5">Acts xii. 5</A>.

 (4.) The mercy which Daniel and his fellows prayed for was bestowed. 
 The <I>secret was revealed unto Daniel</I> in a <I>night-vision,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Some think he dreamed the same dream, when he was asleep, that 
 Nebuchadnezzar had dreamed; it should rather seem that when he was 
 awake, and continuing <I>instant in prayer,</I> and <I>watching in the 
 same,</I> the dream itself, and the interpretation of it, were 
 communicated to him by the ministry of an angel, abundantly to his 
 satisfaction. Note, The <I>effectual fervent prayer of righteous men 
 avails much.</I> There are mysteries and secrets which by prayer we are 
 let into; with that key the cabinets of heaven are unlocked, for Christ 
 has said, Thus <I>knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His grateful thanksgiving for this mercy when he had received it: 
 <I>Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 He did not stay till he had told it to the king, and seen whether he 
 would own it to be his dream or no, but was confident that it was so, 
 and that he had gained his point, and therefore he immediately turned 
 his prayers into praises. As he had prayed in a full assurance that God 
 would do this for him, so he gave thanks in a full assurance that he 
 had done it; and in both he had an eye to God as the <I>God of 
 heaven.</I> His prayer was not recorded, but his thanksgiving is.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The honour he gives to God in this thanksgiving, which he studies 
 to do in a great variety and copiousness of expression: <I>Blessed be 
 the name of God for ever and ever.</I> There is that <I>for ever</I> in 
 God which is to be blessed and praised; it is unchangeably and 
 eternally in him. And it is to be blessed <I>for ever and ever;</I> as 
 the matter of praise is God's eternal perfection, so the work of praise 
 shall be everlastingly in the doing. 

 [1.] He gives to God the glory of what he is in himself: <I>Wisdom and 
 might are his, wisdom and courage</I> (so some); whatever is fit to be 
 done he will do; whatever he will do he can do, he dares do, and he 
 will be sure to do it in the best manner, for he has infinite wisdom to 
 design and contrive and infinite power to execute and accomplish. 
 <I>With him are strength and wisdom,</I> which in men are often parted.

 [2.] He gives him the glory of what he is to the world of mankind. He 
 has a universal influence and agency upon all the children of men, and 
 all their actions and affairs. Are the times changed? Is the posture
 of affairs altered? Does every thing lie open to mutability? It is God 
 that <I>changes the times and the seasons,</I> and the face of them. No 
 change comes to pass by chance, but according to the will and counsel 
 of God. Are those that were kings removed and deposed? Do they 
 abdicate? Are they laid aside? It is God that <I>removes kings.</I>
 Are the <I>poor raised out of the dust,</I> to be <I>set among 
 princes?</I> It is God that <I>sets up kings;</I> and the making and 
 unmaking of kings is a flower of his crown who is the fountain of all 
 power, <I>King of kings and Lord of lords.</I> Are there men that excel 
 others in wisdom, philosophers and statesmen, that think above the 
 common rate, contemplative penetrating men? It is <I>God that gives 
 wisdom to the wise,</I> whether they be so wise as to acknowledge it or 
 no; they have it not of themselves, but it is he that <I>gives 
 knowledge to those that know understanding,</I> which is a good reason 
 why we should not be proud of our knowledge, and why we should serve 
 and honour God with it and make it our business to know him.

 [3.] He gives him the glory of this particular discovery. He praises 
 him, <I>First,</I> For that he could make such a discovery

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>He reveals the deep and secret things</I> which are hidden from the 
 eyes of all living. It was he that revealed to man what is true wisdom 
 when none else could 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+27:27,28">Job xxvii. 27, 28</A>);

 it is he that reveals things to come to his servants and prophets. He
 does himself perfectly discern and distinguish that which is most 
 closely and most industriously concealed, for he will <I>bring into 
 judgment every secret thing;</I> the truth will be evident in the great 
 day. He <I>knows what is in the darkness,</I> and what is done in the 
 darkness, for that <I>hides not from him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:11,12">Ps. cxxxix. 11, 12</A>.

 <I>The light dwells with him,</I> and he <I>dwells in the light</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:16">1 Tim. vi. 16</A>),

 and yet, as to us, he <I>makes darkness his pavilion.</I> Some
 understand it of the light of prophecy and divine revelation, which 
 dwells with God and is derived from him; for he is the <I>Father of 
 lights,</I> of all lights; they are all at home in him. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> For that he had made this discovery to him. Here he 
 has an eye to God as the <I>God of his fathers;</I> for, though the 
 Jews were now captives in Babylon, yet they were <I>beloved for their 
 father's sake.</I> He praises God, who is the fountain of wisdom and 
 might, for the wisdom and might he had given him, wisdom to know this 
 great secret and might to bear the discovery. Note, What wisdom and 
 might we have we must acknowledge to be God's gift. <I>Thou hast made 
 this known to me,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 What was hidden from the celebrated Chaldeans, who made the 
 interpreting of dreams their profession, is revealed to Daniel, a 
 captive-Jew, a babe, much their junior. God would hereby put honour 
 upon the <I>Spirit of prophecy</I> just when he was putting contempt 
 upon the <I>spirit of divination.</I> Was Daniel thus thankful to God 
 for making known that to him which was the saving of the lives of him 
 and his fellows? Much more reason have we to be thankful to him for 
 making known to us the great salvation of the soul, to us and <I>not to 
 the world,</I> to us and <I>not to the wise and prudent.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The respect he puts upon his companions in this thanksgiving. 
 Though it was by his prayers principally that this discovery was 
 obtained, and to him that it was made, yet he owns their partnership 
 with him, both in praying for it (it is what <I>we desired of thee</I>) 
 and in enjoying it--Thou hast <I>made known unto us the king's
 matter.</I> Either they were present with Daniel when the discovery was 
 made to him, or as soon as he knew it he told it them (<B><I>heureka, 
 heureka</I></B>--<I>I have found it, I have found it</I>), that those
 who had assisted him with their prayers might assist him in their 
 praises; his joining them with him is an instance of his humility and 
 modesty, which well become those that are taken into communion with 
 God. Thus St. Paul sometimes joins Sylvanus, Timotheus, or some other 
 minister, with himself in the inscriptions to many of his epistles. 
 Note, What honour God puts upon us we should be willing that our 
 brethren may share with us in.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>24  Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had
 ordained to destroy the wise <I>men</I> of Babylon: he went and said
 thus unto him; Destroy not the wise <I>men</I> of Babylon: bring me in
 before the king, and I will show unto the king the
 interpretation.
 &nbsp; 25  Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and
 said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah,
 that will make known unto the king the interpretation.
 &nbsp; 26  The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name <I>was</I>
 Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which
 I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?
 &nbsp; 27  Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The
 secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise <I>men,</I> the
 astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, show unto the king;
 &nbsp; 28  But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and
 maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the
 latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed,
 are these;
 &nbsp; 29  As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came <I>into thy mind</I> upon
 thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that
 revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.
 &nbsp; 30  But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for <I>any</I>
 wisdom that I have more than any living, but for <I>their</I> sakes
 that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that
 thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the introduction to Daniel's declaring the dream, and the 
 interpretation of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He immediately bespoke the reversing of the sentence against the 
 wise men of Babylon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 He went with all speed to Arioch, to tell him that his commission was 
 now superseded: <I>Destroy not the wise men of Babylon.</I> Though 
 there were those of them perhaps that deserved to die, as magicians, by 
 the law of God, yet here that which they stood condemned for was not a 
 crime worth of death or of bonds, and therefore let them not die, and 
 be <I>unjustly destroyed,</I> but let them live, and be justly shamed, 
 as having been nonplussed and unable to do that which a prophet of the 
 Lord could do. Note, Since God shows common kindness to the evil and 
 good, we should do so too, and be ready to save the lives of even bad 
 men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:45">Matt. v. 45</A>.

 A good man is a common good. To Paul in the ship God gave the souls of
 all that sailed with him; they were saved for his sake. To Daniel was 
 owing the preservation of all the wise men, who yet rendered not 
 according to the benefit done to them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:8"><I>ch.</I> iii. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He offered his service, with great assurance, to go to the king, 
 and tell him his dream and the interpretation of it, and was admitted 
 accordingly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>.

 Arioch brought him in haste to the king, hoping to ingratiate himself 
 by introducing Daniel; he pretends he had sought him to interpret the 
 king's dream, whereas really it was to execute upon him the king's 
 sentence that he sought him. But courtiers' business is every way to 
 humour the prince and make their own services acceptable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He contrived as much as might be to reflect shame upon the 
 magicians, and to give honour to God, upon this occasion. The king 
 owned that it was a bold undertaking, and questioned whether he could 
 make it good 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>Art thou able to make known unto me the dream?</I> What! Such a babe 
 in this knowledge, such a stripling as thou are, wilt thou undertake 
 that which thy seniors despair of doing? The less likely it appeared
 to the king that Daniel should do this the more God was glorified in 
 enabling him to do it. Note, In transmitting divine revelation to the 
 children of men it has been God's usual way to make use of the <I>weak 
 and foolish things</I> and persons <I>of the world,</I> and such as 
 were <I>despised</I> and despaired of, <I>to confound the wise and 
 mighty,</I> that the excellency of the power might be of him, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:27,28">1 Cor. i. 27, 28</A>.
 
 Daniel from this takes occasion,

 1. To put the king out of conceit with his magicians and soothsayers,
 whom he had such great expectations from

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 "<I>This secret they cannot show to the king;</I> it is out of their 
 power; the rules of their art will not reach to it. Therefore let not 
 the king be angry with them for not doing that which they cannot do; 
 but rather despise them, and cast them off, because they cannot do it." 
 Broughton reads it generally: "This secret <I>no sages, astrologers, 
 enchanters, or entrail-cookers, can show unto the king;</I> let not the 
 king therefore consult them any more." Note, The experience we have of 
 the inability of all creatures to give us satisfaction should lessen 
 our esteem of them, and lower our expectations from them. They are 
 baffled in their pretensions; we are baffled in our hopes from them. 
 Hitherto they come, and no further; let us therefore say to them, as 
 Job to his friends, <I>Now you are nothing; miserable comforters are 
 you all.</I> 

 2. To bring him to the knowledge of the one only living and true God, 
 the God whom Daniel worshipped: "Though they cannot find out the 
 secret, let not the king despair of having it found out, for <I>there 
 is a God in heaven that reveals secrets,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 Note, The insufficiency of creatures should drive us to the 
 all-sufficiency of the Creator. <I>There is a God in heaven</I> (and it 
 is well for us there is) who can do that for us, and make known that to 
 us, which none on earth can, particularly the secret history of the 
 work of redemption and the secret designs of God's love to us therein, 
 the mystery which was <I>hidden from ages and generations;</I> divine 
 revelation helps us out where human reason leaves us quite at a loss, 
 and makes known that, not only to kings, but to the poor of this world, 
 which none of the philosophers or politicians of the heathens, with all 
 their oracles and arts of divination to help them, could ever pretend 
 to give us any light into, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:25,26">Rom. xvi. 25, 26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He confirmed the king in his opinion that the dream he was thus 
 solicitous to recover the idea of was really well worth enquiring 
 after, that it was of great value and of vast consequence, not a common 
 dream, the idle disport of a ludicrous and luxuriant fancy, which was 
 not worth remembering or telling again, but that it was a divine 
 discovery, a ray of light darted into his mind from the upper world, 
 relating to the great affairs and revolutions of this lower world. God 
 in it <I>made known to the king what should be in the latter days</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 that is, in the times that were to come, reaching as far as the setting 
 up of Christ's kingdom in the world, which was to be <I>in the latter 
 days,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:1">Heb. i. 1</A>.
 
 And again
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 of what had been before, as our dreams usually are"--</P>

 "But they were predictions of <I>what should come to pass 
 hereafter,</I> which he that <I>reveals secrets makes known unto 
 thee;</I> and therefore thou art in the right in taking the hint and 
 pursuing it thus." Note, Things that are to come to pass hereafter are 
 secret things, which God only can reveal; and what he has revealed of 
 those things, especially with reference to the last days of all, to the 
 end of time, ought to be very seriously and diligently enquired into 
 and considered by every one of us. Some think that the <I>thoughts</I> 
 which are said to have come into the king's mind upon his bed, what 
 should come to pass hereafter, were his own thoughts when he was awake. 
 Just before he fell asleep, and dreamed this dream, he was musing in 
 his own mind what would be the issue of his growing greatness, what his 
 kingdom would hereafter come to; and so the dream was an answer to 
 those thoughts. What discoveries God intends to make he thus prepares 
 men for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He solemnly professes that he could not pretend to have merited from 
 God the favour of this discovery, or to have obtained it by any 
 sagacity of his own 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 "<I>But, as for me,</I> this secret is not found out by me, but is 
 <I>revealed to me,</I> and that <I>not for any wisdom that I have more 
 than any living,</I> to qualify me for the receiving of such a 
 discovery." Note, It well becomes those whom God has highly favoured 
 and honoured to be very humble and low in their own eyes, to lay aside 
 all opinion of their own wisdom and worthiness, that God alone may have 
 all the praise of the good they are, and have, and do, and that all may 
 be attributed to the freeness of his good-will towards them and the 
 fulness of his good work in them. The secret was made known to him not 
 for his own sake, but, 

 1. For the sake of his people, for <I>their sakes that shall make known
 the interpretation to the king,</I> that is, for the sake of his 
 brethren and companions in tribulation, who had by their prayers helped 
 him to obtain this discovery, and so might be said to make known the 
 interpretation--that their lives might be spared, that they might come 
 into favour and be preferred, and all the people of the Jews might fare 
 the better, in their captivity, for their sakes. Note, Humble men will 
 be always ready to think that what God does for them and by them is 
 more for the sake of others than for their own. 

 2. For the sake of <I>his prince;</I> and some read the former clause 
 in this sense, "Not for any wisdom of mine, <I>but that the king may 
 know the interpretation, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of 
 thy heart,</I> that thou mightest have satisfaction given thee as to 
 what thou wast before considering, and thereby instruction given thee 
 how to behave towards the church of God." God revealed this thing to 
 Daniel that he might make it known to the king. Prophets receive that 
 they may give, that the discoveries made to them may not be lodged with 
 themselves, but communicated to the persons that are concerned.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>31  Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great
 image, whose brightness <I>was</I> excellent, stood before thee; and
 the form thereof <I>was</I> terrible.
 &nbsp; 32  This image's head <I>was</I> of fine gold, his breast and his
 arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,
 &nbsp; 33  His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.
 &nbsp; 34  Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands,
 which smote the image upon his feet <I>that were</I> of iron and clay,
 and brake them to pieces.
 &nbsp; 35  Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the
 gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the
 summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, that no
 place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image
 became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.
 &nbsp; 36  This <I>is</I> the dream; and we will tell the interpretation
 thereof before the king.
 &nbsp; 37  Thou, O king, <I>art</I> a king of kings: for the God of heaven
 hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.
 &nbsp; 38  And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the
 field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand,
 and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou <I>art</I> this head of
 gold.
 &nbsp; 39  And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee,
 and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over
 all the earth.
 &nbsp; 40  And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as
 iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all <I>things:</I> and as iron
 that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.
 &nbsp; 41  And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters'
 clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there
 shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou
 sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.
 &nbsp; 42  And <I>as</I> the toes of the feet <I>were</I> part of iron, and part
 of clay, <I>so</I> the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly
 broken.
 &nbsp; 43  And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they
 shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not
 cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.
 &nbsp; 44  And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set
 up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom
 shall not be left to other people, <I>but</I> it shall break in pieces
 and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.
 &nbsp; 45  Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the
 mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the
 brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath
 made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the
 dream <I>is</I> certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Daniel here gives full satisfaction to Nebuchadnezzar concerning his 
 dream and the interpretation of it. That great prince had been kind to 
 this poor prophet in his maintenance and education; he had been brought 
 up at the king's cost, preferred at court, and the land of his 
 captivity had hereby been made much easier to him than to others of his 
 brethren. And now the king is abundantly repaid for all the expense he 
 had been at upon him; and for receiving this prophet, though not in the 
 name of a prophet, he had a prophet's reward, such a reward as a 
 prophet only could give, and for which that wealthy mighty prince was 
 now glad to be beholden to him. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The dream itself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:31,45"><I>v.</I> 31, 45</A>.

 Nebuchadnezzar perhaps was an admirer of statues, and had his palace 
 and gardens adorned with them; however, he was a worshipper of images, 
 and now behold a <I>great image</I> is set before him in a dream, which 
 might intimate to him what the images were which he bestowed so much 
 cost upon, and paid such respect to; they were mere dreams. The 
 creatures of fancy might do as well to please the fancy. By the power 
 of imagination he might shut his eyes, and represent to himself what 
 forms he thought fit, and beautify them at his pleasure, without the 
 expense and trouble of sculpture. This was the image of a man erect: 
 <I>It stood before him,</I> as a living man; and, because those 
 monarchies which were designed to be represented by it were admirable 
 in the eyes of their friends, the <I>brightness</I> of this image 
 <I>was excellent;</I> and because they were formidable to their 
 enemies, and dreaded by all about them, the <I>form</I> of this image 
 is said to be <I>terrible;</I> both the features of the face and the 
 postures of the body made it so. But that which was most remarkable in 
 this image was the different metals of which it was composed--the 
 <I>head of gold</I> (the richest and most durable metal), the <I>breast 
 and arms of silver</I> (the next to it in worth), the <I>belly and 
 sides (or thighs) of brass,</I> the <I>legs of iron</I> (still baser 
 metals), and lastly the feet <I>part of iron and part of clay.</I> See
 what the things of this world are; the further we go in them the less 
 valuable they appear. In the life of a man youth is a head of gold, but 
 it grows less and less worthy of our esteem; and old age is half clay; 
 a man is then <I>as good as dead.</I> It is so with the world; later 
 ages degenerate. The first age of the Christian church, of the 
 reformation, was a head of gold; but we live in an age that is iron and 
 clay. Some allude to this in the description of a hypocrite, whose 
 practice is not agreeable to his knowledge. He has a head of gold, but 
 feet of iron and clay: he knows his duty, but does it not. Some observe 
 that in Daniel's visions the monarchies were represented by four beasts

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:1-28"><I>ch.</I> vii.</A>),

 for he looked upon that wisdom from beneath, by which they were turned
 to be earthly and sensual, and a tyrannical power, to have more in it 
 of the beast than of the man, and so the vision agreed with his notions 
 of the thing. But to Nebuchadnezzar, a heathen prince, they were 
 represented by a gay and pompous image of a man, for he was an admirer 
 of the <I>kingdoms of this world and the glory of them.</I> To him the 
 sight was so charming that he was impatient to see it again. But what
 became of this image? The next part of the dream shows it to us 
 calcined, and brought to nothing. He saw a stone cut out of the quarry 
 by an unseen power, without hands, and this stone fell upon the <I>feet 
 of the image,</I> that were of <I>iron and clay,</I> and <I>broke them 
 to pieces;</I> and then the image must fall of course, and so the gold, 
 and silver, and brass, and iron, were all broken to pieces together, 
 and beaten so small that they became like the <I>chaff of the summer 
 threshing-floors,</I> and there were not to be found any the least 
 remains of them; but the stone <I>cut out of the mountain</I> became 
 itself a <I>great mountain, and filled the earth.</I> See how God can 
 bring about great effects by weak and unlikely causes; when he pleases 
 a <I>little one shall become a thousand.</I> Perhaps the destruction of 
 this image of gold, and silver, and brass, and iron, might be intended 
 to signify the abolishing of idolatry out of the world in due time. The 
 <I>idols of the heathen are silver and gold,</I> as this image was, and 
 <I>they shall perish from off the earth and from under these 
 heavens,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:11,Isa+2:18">Jer. x. 11; Isa. ii. 18</A>.

 And whatever power destroys idolatry is in the ready way to magnify and
 exalt itself, as this stone, when it had broken the image to pieces, 
 became a great mountain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The interpretation of this dream. Let us now see what is the 
 meaning of this. It was from God, and therefore from him it is fit that 
 we take the explication of it. It should seem, Daniel had his fellows 
 with him, and speaks for them as well as for himself, when he says, 
 <I>We will tell the interpretation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.
 
 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. This image represented the kingdoms of the earth that should 
 successively bear rule among the nations and have influence on the 
 affairs of the Jewish church. The four monarchies were not represented 
 by four distinct statues, but by one image, because they were all of 
 one and the same spirit and genius, and all more or less against the 
 church. It was the same power, only lodged in four different nations, 
 the two former lying eastward of Judea, the two latter westward. 

 (1.) The <I>head of gold</I> signified the Chaldean monarchy, which was 
 now in being

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:37,38"><I>v.</I> 37, 38</A>):

 <I>Thou, O king! art</I> (or rather, <I>shalt be</I>) <I>a king of 
 kings,</I> a universal monarch, to whom many kings and kingdoms shall 
 be tributaries; or, Thou art the <I>highest of kings</I> on earth at 
 this time (as a <I>servant of servants</I> is the meanest servant); 
 thou dost outshine all other kings. But let him not attribute his 
 elevation to his own politics or fortitude. No; it is <I>the God of 
 heaven</I> that has <I>given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and 
 glory,</I> a kingdom that exercises great authority, stands firmly, and 
 shines brightly, acts by a puissant army with an arbitrary power. Note, 
 The greatest of princes have no power but what is given them from 
 above. The extent of his dominion is set forth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>),

 that <I>wheresoever the children of men dwell,</I> in all the nations 
 of that part of the world, he was <I>ruler over them all,</I> over them 
 and all that belonged to them, all their cattle, not only those which 
 they had a property in, but those that were <I>fer&aelig; 
 natur&aelig;</I>--<I>wild,</I> the <I>beasts of the field</I> and 
 <I>the fowls of the heaven.</I> He was lord of all the woods, forests, 
 and chases, and none were allowed to hunt or fowl without his leave.
 Thus "<I>thou art the head of gold;</I> thou, and thy son, and thy 
 son's son, for seventy years." Compare this with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:9,11">Jer. xxv. 9, 11</A>,

 especially 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:5-7">Jer. xxvii. 5-7</A>.

 There were other powerful kingdoms in the world at this time, as that
 of the Scythians; but it was the kingdom of Babylon that reigned over 
 the Jews, and that began the government which continued in the 
 succession here described till Christ's time. It is called a 
 <I>head,</I> for its wisdom, eminency, and absolute power, a head of 
 <I>gold</I> for its wealth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:4">Isa. xiv. 4</A>);

 it was a golden city. Some make this monarchy to begin in Nimrod, and
 so bring into it all the Assyrian kings, about fifty monarchs in all, 
 and compute that it lasted above 1600 years. But it had not been so 
 long a monarchy of such vast extent and power as is here described, nor 
 any thing like it; therefore others make only Nebuchadnezzar, 
 Evil-merodach, and Belshazzar, to belong to this <I>head of gold;</I> 
 and a glorious high throne they had, and perhaps exercised a more 
 despotic power than any of the kings that went before them. 
 Nebuchadnezzar reigned forty-five years current, Evil-merodach 
 twenty-three years current, and Belshazzar three. Babylon was their 
 metropolis, and Daniel was with them upon the spot during the seventy 
 years.

 (2.) The <I>breast and arms of silver</I> signified the monarchy of the 
 Medes and Persians, of which the king is told no more than this, 
 <I>There shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>),

 not so rich, powerful, or victorious. This kingdom was founded by 
 Darius the Mede and Cyrus the Persian, in alliance with each other, and 
 therefore represented by two arms, meeting in the breast. Cyrus was 
 himself a Persian by his father, a Mede by his mother. Some reckon that 
 this second monarchy lasted 130 years, others 204 years. The former 
 computation agrees best with the scripture chronology. 

 (3.) The <I>belly and thighs of brass</I> signified the monarchy of the 
 Grecians, founded by Alexander, who conquered Darius Codomannus, the 
 last of the Persian emperors. This is the <I>third kingdom, of 
 brass,</I> inferior in wealth and extent of dominion to the Persian 
 monarchy, but in Alexander himself it shall by the power of the sword 
 <I>bear rule over all the earth;</I> for Alexander boasted that he had 
 conquered the world, and then sat down and wept because he had not 
 another world to conquer. 

 (4.) The <I>legs and feet of iron</I> signified the Roman monarchy. 
 Some make this to signify the latter part of the Grecian monarchy, the 
 two empires of Syria and Egypt, the former governed by the family of 
 the Seleucid&aelig;, from Seleucus, the latter by that of the 
 Lagid&aelig;, from Ptolem&aelig;us Lagus; these they make the two legs 
 and feet of this image: Grotius, and Junius, and Broughton, go this 
 way. But it has been the more received opinion that it is the Roman 
 monarchy that is here intended, because it was in the time of that 
 monarchy, and when it was at its height, that the kingdom of Christ was 
 set up in the world by the preaching of the everlasting gospel. The 
 Roman kingdom was strong as iron

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>),

 witness the prevalency of that kingdom against all that contended with 
 it for many ages. That kingdom <I>broke in pieces</I> the Grecian 
 empire and afterwards quite destroyed the nation of the Jews. Towards 
 the latter end of the Roman monarchy it grew very weak, and branched 
 into ten kingdoms, which were as the toes of these feet. Some of these 
 were weak as clay, others strong as iron, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.

 Endeavours were used to unite and cement them for the strengthening of 
 the empire, but in vain: <I>They shall not cleave one to another,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>.

 This empire divided the government for a long time between the senate 
 and the people, the nobles and the commons, but they did not entirely 
 coalesce. There were civil wars between Marius and Sylla, C&aelig;sar
 and Pompey, whose parties were as iron and clay. Some refer this to the 
 declining times of that empire, when, for the strengthening of the 
 empire against the irruptions of the barbarous nations, the branches of 
 the royal family intermarried; but the politics had not the desired 
 effect, when the day of the fall of that empire came.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The stone <I>cut out without hands</I> represented the kingdom of 
 Jesus Christ, which should be set up in the world in the time of the 
 Roman empire, and upon the ruins of Satan's kingdom in the <I>kingdoms 
 of the world.</I> This is <I>the stone cut out of the mountain without 
 hands,</I> for it should be neither raised nor supported by human power 
 or policy; no visible hand should act in the setting of it up, but it 
 should be done invisibly the <I>Spirit of the Lord of hosts.</I> This 
 was <I>the stone which the builders refused,</I> because it was not cut 
 out by their hands, but it has now become the <I>head-stone of the 
 corner.</I> 

 (1.) The gospel-church is a kingdom, which Christ is the sole and 
 sovereign monarch of, in which he rules by his word and Spirit, to 
 which he gives protection and law, and from which he receives homage 
 and tribute. It is a kingdom <I>not of this world,</I> and yet set up 
 in it; it is the kingdom of God among men. 

 (2.) The <I>God of heaven</I> was to set up this kingdom, to give 
 authority to Christ to execute judgment, to set him as <I>King upon his 
 holy hill of Zion,</I> and to bring into obedience to him a willing 
 people. Being set up by the God of heaven, it is often in the <I>New 
 Testament</I> called the <I>kingdom of heaven,</I> for its original is 
 from above and its tendency is upwards. 

 (3.) It was to be set up <I>in the days of these kings,</I> the kings 
 of the fourth monarchy, of which particular notice is taken 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:1">Luke ii. 1</A>),
 
 That Christ was born when, by the decree of the emperor of Rome, <I>all
 the world was taxed,</I> which was a plain indication that that empire 
 had become as universal as any earthly empire ever was. When these 
 kings are contesting with each other, and in all the struggles each of 
 the contending parties hopes to find its own account, God will do his 
 own work and fulfil his own counsels. <I>These kings</I> are all
 enemies to Christ's kingdom, and yet it shall be set up in defiance of 
 them. 

 (4.) It is a kingdom that knows no decay, is in no danger of 
 destruction, and will not admit any succession or revolution. It shall 
 <I>never be destroyed</I> by any foreign force invading it, as many 
 other kingdoms are; fire and sword cannot waste it; the combined powers 
 of earth and hell cannot deprive either the subjects of their prince or 
 the prince of his subjects; nor shall this <I>kingdom be left to other 
 people,</I> as the kingdoms of the earth are. As Christ is a monarch 
 that has no successor (for he himself shall reign for ever), so his 
 kingdom is a monarchy that has no revolution. The kingdom of God was 
 indeed taken from the Jews and given to the Gentiles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:43">Matt. xxi. 43</A>),

 but still it was Christianity that ruled, the kingdom of the Messiah.
 The Christian church is still the same; it is fixed on a rock, much 
 fought against, but never to be prevailed against, by the gates of 
 hell.

 (5.) It is a kingdom that shall be victorious over all opposition. It 
 shall <I>break in pieces and consume all those kingdoms,</I> as the 
 <I>stone cut out of the mountain without hands</I> broke in pieces the 
 image,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:44,45"><I>v.</I> 44, 45</A>.

 The kingdom of Christ shall <I>wear out</I> all other kingdoms, shall 
 outlive them, and flourish when they are sunk with their own weight, 
 and so wasted that their place <I>knows them no more.</I> All the 
 kingdoms that appear against the kingdom of Christ shall be broken with 
 a <I>rod of iron,</I> as a <I>potter's vessel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:9">Ps. ii. 9</A>.

 And in the kingdoms that submit to the kingdom of Christ tyranny, and
 idolatry, and every thing that is their reproach, shall, as far as the 
 gospel of Christ gets ground, be broken. The day is coming when Jesus 
 Christ shall have <I>put down all rule, principality, and power,</I> 
 and have made <I>all his enemies his footstool;</I> and then this 
 prophecy will have its full accomplishment, and not till then,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:24,25">1 Cor. xv. 24, 25</A>.

 Our savior seems to refer to this

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:44">Matt. xxi. 44</A>),

 when, speaking of himself as the stone set at nought by the Jewish
 builders, he says, <I>On whomsoever</I> this stone <I>shall fall, it 
 will grind him to powder.</I>

 (6.) It shall be an everlasting kingdom. Those kingdoms of the earth 
 that had <I>broken in pieces</I> all about them at length came, in 
 their turn, to be in like manner broken; but the kingdom of Christ 
 shall break other kingdoms in pieces and shall itself <I>stand for 
 ever.</I> His throne shall be as the days of heaven, his seed, his 
 subjects, as the stars of heaven, not only so innumerable, but so 
 immutable. Of the <I>increase</I> of Christ's <I>government and 
 peace</I> there shall be <I>no end. The Lord shall reign for ever,</I> 
 not only to the end of time, but when time and days shall be no more, 
 and God <I>shall be all in all</I> to eternity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Daniel having thus interpreted the dream, to the satisfaction of 
 Nebuchadnezzar, who gave him no interruption, so full was the 
 interpretation that he had no question to ask, and so plain that he had 
 no objection to make, he closes all with a solemn assertion, 

 1. Of the divine original of this dream: <I>The great God</I> (so he
 calls him, to express his own high thoughts of him, and to beget the 
 like in the mind of this great king) has <I>made known to the king what 
 shall come to pass hereafter,</I> which the gods of the magicians could 
 not do. And thus a full confirmation was given to that great argument
 which Isaiah had long before urged against idolaters, and particularly 
 the idolaters of Babylon, when he challenged the gods they worshipped 
 to <I>show things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that you 
 are gods</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:23">Isa. xli. 23</A>),

 and by <I>this</I> proved the God of Israel to be the true God, that he
 <I>declares the end from the beginning,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:10">Isa. xlvi. 10</A>.

 2. Of the undoubted certainty of the things foretold by this dream. He
 who makes known these things is the same that has himself designed and 
 determined them, and will by his providence effect them; and we are 
 sure that <I>his counsel shall stand,</I> and cannot be altered, and 
 therefore <I>the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof 
 sure.</I> Note, Whatever God has made known we may depend upon.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>46  Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and
 worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an
 oblation and sweet odours unto him.
 &nbsp; 47  The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth <I>it is,</I>
 that your God <I>is</I> a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a
 revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.
 &nbsp; 48  Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many
 great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of
 Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise <I>men</I> of
 Babylon.
 &nbsp; 49  Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach,
 Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of
 Babylon: but Daniel <I>sat</I> in the gate of the king.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 One might have expected that when Nebuchadnezzar was contriving to make 
 his own kingdom everlasting he would be enraged at Daniel, who foretold 
 the fall of it and that another kingdom of another nature should be the 
 everlasting kingdom; but, instead of resenting it as an affront, he 
 received it as an oracle, and here we are told what the expressions 
 were of the impressions it made upon him. 

 1. He was ready to look upon Daniel as a little god. Though he saw him
 to be a man, yet from this wonderful discovery which he had made both 
 of his secret thoughts, in telling him the dream, and of things to 
 come, in telling him the interpretation of it, he concluded that he had 
 certainly a divinity lodged in him, worthy his adoration; and therefore 
 he <I>fell upon his face and worshipped Daniel,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>.

 It was the custom of the country by prostration to give honour to 
 kings, because they have something of a divine power in them (<I>I have 
 said, You are gods</I>); and therefore this king, who had often 
 received such veneration from others, now paid the like to Daniel, whom 
 he supposed to have in him a divine knowledge, which he was so struck 
 with an admiration of that he could not contain himself, but forgot 
 both that Daniel was a man and that himself was a king. Thus did God
 magnify divine revelation <I>and make it honourable,</I> extorting from 
 a proud potentate such a veneration but for one glimpse of it. He 
 <I>worshipped Daniel,</I> and <I>commanded that they should offer an 
 oblation to him,</I> and burn incense. Herein he cannot be justified, 
 but may in some measure be excused, when Cornelius was thus ready to 
 worship Peter, and John the angel, who both knew better. But, though it 
 is not here mentioned, yet we have reason to think that Daniel refused 
 these honours that he paid him, and said, as Peter to Cornelius, 
 <I>Stand up, I myself also am a man,</I> or, as the angel to St. John, 
 <I>See thou do it not;</I> for it is not said that the oblation was 
 offered unto him, though the king commanded it, or rather <I>said 
 it,</I> for so the word is. He said, in his haste, <I>Let an oblation 
 be offered to him.</I> And that Daniel did say something to him which 
 turned his eyes and thoughts another way is intimated in what follows 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>),

 <I>The king answered Daniel.</I> Note, It is possible for those to 
 express a great honour for the ministers of God's word who yet have no 
 true love for the word. <I>Herod feared John,</I> and <I>heard him
 gladly,</I> and yet went on in his sins, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:20">Mark vi. 20</A>.

 2. He readily acknowledged the God of Daniel to be the great God, the 
 true God, the only living and true God. If Daniel will not suffer 
 himself to be worshipped, he will (as Daniel, it is likely, directed 
 him) <I>worship God,</I> by confessing

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>),

 <I>Of a truth your God is a God of gods,</I> such a God as there is no 
 other, above all gods in dignity, over all gods in dominion. He is a 
 Lord <I>of kings,</I> from whom they derive their power and to whom 
 they are accountable; and he is both a discoverer and a <I>revealer of 
 secrets;</I> what is most secret he sees and can reveal, and what he 
 has revealed is what was secret and which none but himself could 
 reveal, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:10">1 Cor. ii. 10</A>.

 3. He preferred Daniel, made him a great man,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>.

 God made him a great man indeed when he took him into communion with 
 himself, a greater man than Nebuchadnezzar could make him; but, because 
 God had magnified him, therefore the king magnified him. Does wealth 
 make men great? The king <I>gave him many great gifts;</I> and he had 
 no reason to refuse them, when they all put him into so much the 
 greater capacity of doing good to his brethren in captivity. These 
 gifts were grateful returns for the good services he had done, and not 
 aimed at, nor bargained for, by him, as the rewards of divination were 
 by Balaam. Does power make a man great? He made him <I>ruler over the 
 whole province of Babylon,</I> which no doubt had great influence upon 
 the other provinces; he made him likewise chancellor of the university, 
 <I>chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon,</I> to 
 instruct those whom he had thus outdone; and, since they could not do 
 what the king would have them do, they shall be obliged to do what 
 Daniel would have them do. Thus it is fit that the <I>fool should be
 servant to the wise in heart.</I> Seeing Daniel <I>could reveal this 
 secret</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>),

 the king thus advanced him. Note, It is the wisdom of princes to 
 advance and employ those who receive divine revelation, and are much 
 conversant with it, who, as Daniel here, show themselves to be well 
 acquainted with the kingdom of heaven. Joseph, like Daniel here, was 
 advanced in the court of the king of Egypt for his interpreting his 
 dreams; and he called him <I>Zaphnath-paaneah--a revealer of 
 secrets,</I> as the king of Babylon here calls Daniel; so that the

 Daniel himself <I>sat in the gate of the king,</I> as president of the 
 council, chief-justice, or prime-minister of state, or perhaps 
 chamberlain of the household; but he used his interest for his friends 
 as became a good man, and procured places in the government for 
 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Those that helped him with their 
 prayers shall share with him in his honours, such a grateful sense had 
 he even of that service. The preferring of them would be a great stay 
 and help to Daniel in his place and business. And these pious Jews, 
 being thus preferred in Babylon, had great opportunity of serving their 
 brethren in captivity, and of doing them many good offices, which no 
 doubt they were ready to do. Thus, sometimes, before God brings his 
 people into trouble, he prepares it, that it may be easy to them.</P>
