 What the apostle says of another of the prophets is true of this, who
 was also his contemporary--"Esaias is very bold," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:20">Rom. x. 20</A>.

 So, in this chapter, Micah is very bold in reproving and threatening
 the great men that were the ringleaders in sin; and he gives the reason

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+3:8">ver. 8</A>)

 why he was so bold, because he had commission and instruction from God
 to say what he said, and was carried out in it by a higher spirit and
 power than his own. Magistracy and ministry are two great ordinances of
 God, for good to his church, but these were both corrupted and the
 intentions of them perverted; and upon those that abused them, and so
 abused the church with them, the prophet is very severe, and justly so.

 I. He gives them their lesson severally, reproving and threatening
 princes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+3:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>)

 and false flattering prophets,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+3:5-7">ver. 5-7</A>.

 II. He gives them their lesson jointly, putting them together, as 
 acting in conjunction for the ruin of the kingdom, which they should 
 see the ruins of,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye
 princes of the house of Israel; <I>Is it</I> not for you to know
 judgment?
 &nbsp; 2 Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their
 skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;
 &nbsp; 3 Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from
 off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as
 for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.
 &nbsp; 4 Then shall they cry unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, but he will not hear them:
 he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have
 behaved themselves ill in their doings.
 &nbsp; 5 Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> concerning the prophets that make my
 people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he
 that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against
 him.
 &nbsp; 6 Therefore night <I>shall be</I> unto you, that ye shall not have a
 vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine;
 and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be
 dark over them.
 &nbsp; 7 Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded:
 yea, they shall all cover their lips; for <I>there is</I> no answer of
 God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Princes and prophets, when they faithfully discharge the duty of their 
 office, are to be highly honoured above other men; but when they betray 
 their trust, and act contrary to it, they should hear of their faults 
 as well as others, and shall be made to know that there is a God above 
 them, to whom they are accountable; at his bar the prophet here, in his 
 name, arraigns them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Let the princes hear their charge and their doom. The <I>heads of 
 Jacob, and</I> the <I>princes of the house of Israel,</I> are called 
 upon to <I>hear</I> what the prophet has to say to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 The word of God has reproofs for the greatest of men, which the 
 ministers of that word ought to apply as there is occasion. The prophet 
 here has comfort in the reflection upon it, that, whatever the success 
 was, he had faithfully discharged his trust: <I>And I said, Hear, O 
 princes!</I> He had the testimony of his conscience for him that he had 
 not shrunk from his duty for fear of the face of men. He tells 
 them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What was expected from them: <I>Is it not for you to know 
 judgment?</I> He means to <I>do</I> judgment, for otherwise the 
 knowledge of it is of no avail. "Is it not your business to administer 
 justice impartially, and not to <I>know faces</I>" (as the Hebrew 
 phrase for partiality and respect of persons is), "but to <I>know 
 judgment,</I> and the merits of every cause?" Or it may be taken for 
 granted that the heads and rulers are well acquainted with the rules of 
 justice, whatever others are; for they have those means of knowledge, 
 and have not those excuses for ignorance, which some others have, that 
 are poor and foolish 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:4">Jer. v. 4</A>);

 and, if so, their transgression of the laws of justice is the more
 provoking to God, for they sin against knowledge. "Is it not for you
 to know judgment? Yes, it is; therefore stand still, and hear your own 
 judgment, and judge if it be not right, whether any thing can be 
 objected against it."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How wretchedly they had transgressed the rules of judgment, though 
 they knew what they were. Their principle and disposition are bad: They 
 <I>hate the good and love the evil;</I> they hate good in others, and 
 hate it should have any influence on themselves; they hate to do good, 
 hate to have any good done, and hate those that are good and do good; 
 and they <I>love the evil,</I> delight in mischief. This being their 
 principle, their practice is according to it; they are very cruel and 
 severe towards those that are under their power, and whoever lies at 
 their mercy will find that they have none. They barbarously devour 
 those whom they should protect, and, as unfaithful shepherds, fleece 
 the flock they should feed; nay, instead of feeding it, they feed upon 
 it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:2">Ezek. xxxiv. 2</A>.

 It is fit indeed that he who feeds a flock should <I>eat of the milk of
 the flock</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:7">1 Cor. ix. 7</A>),

 but that will not content them: They <I>eat the flesh of my people.</I>
 It is fit that they should be clothed with the wool, but that will not 
 serve: They <I>flay the skin from off them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 By imposing heavier taxes upon them than they can bear, and exacting 
 them with rigour, by mulcts, and fines, and corporal punishments, for 
 pretended crimes, they ruined the estates and families of their 
 subjects, took away from some their lives, from others their 
 livelihoods, and were to their subjects as beasts of prey, rather than 
 shepherds. "They <I>break their bones</I> to come at the marrow, and 
 <I>chop</I> the flesh <I>in pieces as for the pot.</I>" This intimates 
 that they were,

 (1.) Very ravenous and greedy for themselves, indulging themselves in 
 luxury and sensuality.

 (2.) Very barbarous and cruel to those that were under them, not caring 
 whom they beggared, so they could but enrich themselves; such evil is 
 the love of money the root of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. How they might expect that God should deal with them, since they had 
 been thus cruel to his subjects. The rule is fixed, Those shall have 
 judgment without mercy that have shown no mercy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>They shall cry to the Lord, but he will not hear them,</I> in the 
 day of their distress, as the poor cried to them in the day of their 
 prosperity and they would not hear them." There will come a time when 
 the most proud and scornful sinners will <I>cry to the Lord,</I> and 
 sue for that mercy which they once neither valued nor copied out. But 
 it will then be in vain; God will even hide his face from them at that 
 time, that time when they need his favour, and see themselves undone 
 without it. At another time they would have turned their back upon
 him; but at that time he will turn his back upon them, <I>as they have 
 behaved themselves ill in their doings.</I> Note, Men cannot expect to 
 do ill and fare well, but may expect to find, as Adoni-bezek did, that 
 done to them which they did to others; for <I>he is righteous who takes 
 vengeance. With the froward God will show himself froward,</I> and he 
 often gives up cruel and unmerciful men into the hands of those who are 
 cruel and unmerciful to them, as they themselves have formerly been to 
 others. This agrees with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+21:13">Prov. xxi. 13</A>,

 <I>Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he shall cry himself 
 and shall not be heard;</I> but the merciful have reason to hope that 
 they shall obtain mercy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Let the prophets hear their charge too, and their doom; they were 
 such as prophesied falsely, and the princes bore rule by their means.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What was their sin. 

 (1.) They made it their business to flatter and deceive the people: 
 <I>They make my people err,</I> lead them into mistakes, both 
 concerning what they should do and concerning what God would do with 
 them. It is ill with a people when their leaders cause them to err, and 
 those draw them out of the way that should guide them and go before 
 them in it. "They make them to err by crying peace, by telling them 
 that they do well, and that all shall be well with them; whereas they 
 are in the paths of sin, and within a step of ruin. They <I>cry 
 peace,</I> but they <I>bite with their teeth,</I>" which perhaps is 
 meant of their biting their own lips, as we are apt to do when we would 
 suppress something which we are ready to speak. When they cried 
 <I>peace</I> their own hearts gave them the lie, and they were just 
 ready to eat their own words and to contradict themselves, but they bit 
 with their teeth, and kept it in. They were not blind leaders of the 
 blind, for they saw the ditch before them, and yet led their followers 
 into it. 

 (2.) They made it all their aim to glut themselves, and serve their own 
 belly, as the seducers in St. Paul's time 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:18">Rom. xvi. 18</A>),

 for <I>their god is their belly,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:19">Phil. iii. 19</A>.

 They <I>bite with their teeth, and cry peace;</I> that is, they will
 flatter and compliment those that will feed them with good bits, will 
 give them something to eat; but as for those that <I>put not into their 
 mouths,</I> that are not continually cramming them, they look upon them 
 as their enemies; to them they do not <I>cry peace,</I> as they do to 
 those whom they look upon as their benefactors, but they <I>even 
 prepare war against them;</I> against them they denounce the judgments 
 of God, but as they are to them, as the crafty priests of the church of 
 Rome, in some places, make their image either to smile or frown upon 
 the offerer according as his offering is. Justly is it insisted on as a 
 necessary qualification of a minister

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:3,Tit+1:7">1 Tim. iii. 3, and again Tit. i. 7</A>)

 that he be not <I>greedy of filthy lucre.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What is the sentence passed upon them for this sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+3:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 It is threatened,

 (1.) That they shall be involved in troubles and miseries with those to 
 whom they had cried peace: <I>Night shall be upon them,</I> a dark cold 
 night of calamity, such as they, in their flattery, led the people to 
 hope would never come. <I>It shall be dark unto you,</I> darker to you 
 than to others; <I>the sun shall go down over the prophets,</I> shall 
 go down at noon; all comfort shall depart from them, and they shall be 
 deprived of all hope of it. The <I>day shall be dark over them,</I> in 
 which they promised themselves light. Nor shall they be surrounded
 with outward troubles only, but their mind shall be full of confusion, 
 and they shall be brought to their wits' end; their heads shall be 
 clouded, and their own thoughts shall trouble them; and that is trouble 
 enough. They kept others in the dark, and now God will bring them into 
 the dark. 

 (2.) That thereby they shall be silenced, and all their pretensions to 
 prophecy for ever shamed. They never had any true vision; and now, the 
 event disproving their predictions of peace, it shall be made to appear 
 that they never had any, that there never was an answer of God to them, 
 but it was all a sham, and they were cheats and impostors. Their 
 reputation being thus quite sunk, their confidence would of course fail 
 them. And, their spirits being ruffled and confused, their invention 
 would fail them too; and by reason of this darkness, both without and 
 within too, <I>they shall not divine,</I> they shall not have so much 
 as a counterfeit vision to produce, they shall be <I>ashamed,</I> and 
 <I>confounded,</I> and <I>cover their lips,</I> as men that are quite 
 baffled and have nothing to say for themselves. Note, Those who deceive 
 others are but preparing confusion for their own faces.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8 But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and
 of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his
 transgression, and to Israel his sin.
 &nbsp; 9 Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and
 princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert
 all equity.
 &nbsp; 10 They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.
 &nbsp; 11 The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof
 teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet
 will they lean upon the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and say, <I>Is</I> not the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> among
 us? none evil can come upon us.
 &nbsp; 12 Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed <I>as</I> a field,
 and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house
 as the high places of the forest.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. The prophet experiences a divine power going along with him in his 
 work, and he makes a solemn profession and protestation of it, as that 
 which would justify him, and bear him out, in his plain dealing with 
 the princes and rulers. He would not, he durst not, make thus bold with 
 the great men, but that he was carried out to do it by a prophetical 
 impulse and impression. It was not he that said it, but God by him, and 
 he could not but speak the word that God put into his mouth. It comes 
 in likewise by way of opposition to the false prophets, who were full 
 of shame when they lived to see themselves proved liars, and who never 
 had courage to deal faithfully with the people, but flattered them in 
 their sins; they were <I>sensual, not having the Spirit,</I> but truly 
 (says Micah) <I>I am full of power by the Spirit of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 Having in himself an assurance of the truth of what he said, he said it 
 with assurance. Compare him with those false prophets, and you will 
 say, There is no comparison between them. <I>What is the chaff to the 
 wheat?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:28">Jer. xxiii. 28</A>.
 
 What is painted fire to real fire? Observe here,
 
 1. What the qualifications were with which this prophet was endured: He
 was <I>full of power, and of judgment, and of might;</I> he had an 
 ardent love to God and to the souls of men, a deep concern for his 
 glory and their salvation, and a flaming zeal against sin. He had 
 likewise courage to reprove it and witness against it, not fearing the 
 wrath either of great men or of great multitudes; whatever difficulties 
 or discouragements he met with, they did not deter him nor drive him 
 from his work; <I>none of these things moved him.</I> And all this was 
 guided by judgment and discretion; he was a man of wisdom as well as 
 courage; in all his preaching there was light as well as heat, and a 
 spirit of wisdom as well as of zeal. Thus was this man of God 
 <I>thoroughly furnished</I> for every good word he had to say, and 
 every good work he had to do. Those he preached to could not but 
 perceive him to be full both of <I>power</I> and <I>judgment,</I> for 
 they found both their <I>understandings opened</I> and their 
 <I>hearts</I> made <I>to burn within them,</I> with such evidence and 
 demonstration, and with such power, did the word come from him. 

 2. Whence he had these qualifications, not from and of himself, but he
 was <I>full of power by the Spirit of the Lord.</I> Knowing that it was 
 indeed the <I>Spirit of the Lord</I> that was in him, and spoke by him, 
 that it was a divine revelation that he delivered, he spoke it boldly, 
 and as one having authority, <I>set his face as a flint,</I> knowing he 
 should be justified and borne out in what he said, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:7,8">Isa. l. 7, 8</A>.

 Note, Those who act honestly may act boldly; and those who are sure
 that they have a commission from God need not be afraid of opposition 
 from men. Nay, he had not only a Spirit of prophecy, which was the
 ground of his boldness, but the Spirit of sanctification endued him 
 with the boldness and wisdom which were requisite for him. It was not 
 in any strength of his own that he was strong; <I>for who is sufficient 
 for these things?</I> but in <I>the Lord, and in the power of his 
 might;</I> for <I>from him</I> all <I>our sufficiency</I> is. Are we 
 full of power at any time, for that which is good? It is purely by
 <I>the Spirit of the Lord,</I> for of ourselves we are weak as water; 
 it is the God of Israel that gives strength and power both to his 
 people and to his ministers.

 3. What use he made of these qualifications--this judgment and this
 power; he <I>declared to Jacob his transgression and to Israel his 
 sin.</I> If transgression be found in Jacob and Israel, they must be 
 told of it, and it is the business of God's prophets to tell them of 
 it, to <I>cry aloud</I> and <I>not to spare,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:1">Isa. lviii. 1</A>.

 Those who come to hear the word of God must be willing to be told of
 their faults, and must not only give their ministers leave to deal 
 plainly and faithfully with them, but take it kindly, and be thankful; 
 but, since few have meekness enough to receive reproof, those have need 
 of a great deal of boldness who are to give reproofs, and must pray for 
 a spirit both of wisdom and might.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The prophet exerts this power in dealing with the <I>heads of the 
 house of Jacob,</I> both the princes and the prophets, whom he had 
 drawn up a high charge against in the former part of the chapter. He 
 repeats the summons of their attendance and attention 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 the same that we had 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>,

 directing himself to <I>the princes of the house of Israel,</I> yet he 
 means those of <I>Judah;</I> for it appears 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+26:18,19">Jer. xxvi. 18, 19</A>,
 
 where

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>

 is quoted) that this was spoken in Hezekiah's kingdom; but, the ten 
 tribes being gone into captivity, Judah is all that is now left of 
 Jacob and Israel. The prophet speaks respectfully to them (<I>hear, I 
 pray you</I>) and gives them their titles of <I>heads</I> and 
 <I>princes.</I> Ministers must be faithful to great men in reproving 
 them for their sins, but they must not be rude and uncivil to them. Now 
 observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The great wickedness that these heads of the house of Jacob were 
 guilty of, <I>princes, priest,</I> and <I>prophets;</I> in short, they 
 were covetous and prostituted their offices to their love of money. 
 
 (1.) The <I>princes abhorred all judgment;</I> they would not be 
 governed by any of its laws, either in their own practice or in passing 
 sentence upon appeals made to them; they <I>perverted all equity,</I> 
 and scorned to be under the direction or correction of justice, when it 
 could not be made pliable to their secular interests. When, under 
 pretence of doing right, they did the most palpable wrongs, then they 
 perverted equity, and made it serve a purpose contrary to the intention 
 of the founder of magistracy and fountain of power. It is laid to their 
 charge 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>)

 that <I>they build up Zion with blood.</I> "They pretend, in 
 justification of their extortion and oppressions, that they build up 
 Zion and Jerusalem; they add new streets and squares to the holy 
 cities, and adorn them; they establish and advance the public interests 
 both in church and state, and think that therein they do God and Israel 
 good service. But it is <I>with blood</I> and <I>with iniquity,</I> and 
 therefore it cannot prosper; nor will their intentions of good to the 
 city of God justify their contradictions to the law of God." Those 
 mistake who think that a burning zeal for holy church, and the 
 propagating of the faith, will serve to consecrate robberies and 
 murders, massacres and depredations; no, Zion's walls owe those no 
 thanks that build them up with blood and iniquity. The sin of man works 
 not the righteousness of God. "The office of the princes is to judge 
 upon appeals made to them; but <I>they judge for reward</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);

 they give judgment on the side of those that give the bribe; the most 
 righteous cause shall not be carried without a fee, and for a fee the 
 most unrighteous cause shall be carried." Miserable is the people's 
 case when the judge's enquiry upon a cause is not, "What is to be done 
 in it?" but, "What is to be got by it?"

 (2.) The priests' work was to teach the people, and for that the law 
 had provided them a very honourable comfortable maintenance; but that 
 will not content them, they <I>teach for hire</I> over and above, and 
 will be hired to teach anything, as an oracle of God, which they know 
 will please and gain them an interest. 

 (3.) The prophets, it should seem, had honorary fees given them by way 
 of gratuity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:7,8">1 Sam. ix. 7, 8</A>);

 but these prophets governed themselves in their prophesying by the
 prospect of temporal advantage and that was the main thing they had in 
 their eye: They <I>divine for money.</I> Their tongues were mercenary; 
 they would either prophesy or let it alone, according as they found it 
 most for their advantage; and a man might have what oracle he would 
 from them if he would but pay them for it. Thus they were fit 
 successors of Balaam, who <I>loved the wages of unrighteousness.</I> 
 Note, Though that which is wicked can never be consecrated by a zeal 
 for the church, yet that which is sacred may be, and often is, 
 desecrated, by the love of the world. When men do that which in itself 
 is good, but do it for filthy lucre, it loses its excellency, and 
 becomes an abomination both to God and man.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Their vain presumption and carnal confidence, notwithstanding: They 
 <I>lean upon the Lord,</I> and because they are, in profession, his 
 people, they think there is neither harm nor danger in these their 
 wicked practices. Faith builds upon the Lord, rests in him, and relies 
 upon him, as the soul's foundation; presumption only <I>leans upon the 
 Lord</I> as a prop, makes use of him to serve a turn, while still the 
 world is the foundation that is built upon. They speak with a great 
 deal of confidence, 

 (1.) Of their honour: "<I>Is not the Lord among us?</I> Have we not the 
 tokens of his presence with us, his temple, his ark, his lively 
 oracles?" They are <I>haughty because of the holy mountain</I> and its 
 dignities 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:11">Zeph. iii. 11</A>),

 as if their church-privileges would palliate the worst of practices, or
 as if God's presence with them were intended to make the priests and 
 people rich with the sale of their performances. It was true that the
 Lord was among them by his ordinances, and this puffed them up with 
 pride; but, if they imagined that he was among them by his favour and 
 love, they were mistaken: but it is a cheat the children of men often 
 put upon themselves to think they have God with them, when they have by 
 their sin provoked him to depart from them.

 (2.) They are confident of their own safety: <I>No evil can come upon 
 us.</I> Many are rocked asleep; in a fatal security by their 
 church-privileges, as if those would protect them in sin, and shelter 
 them from punishment, which are really, and will be, the greatest 
 aggravations both of their sin and of their punishment. If men's having 
 the Lord among them will not restrain them from doing evil, it can 
 never secure them from suffering evil for so doing; and it is very 
 absurd for sinners to think that their impudence will be their 
 impunity.</P>

 3. The doom passed upon them for their real wickedness, notwithstanding 
 their imaginary protection 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>Therefore shall Zion for your sake be ploughed as a field.</I> This 
 is that passage which is quoted as a bold word spoken by Micah 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+26:18">Jer. xxvi. 18</A>),

 which yet Hezekiah and his princes took well, though in another reign
 it might have gone near to cost him his head; nay, they repented and 
 reformed, and so the execution of this threatening was prevented, and 
 did not come in those days.

 (1.) It is the ruin of holy places that is here foretold, places that 
 had been highly honoured with the tokens of God's presence and the 
 performances of his worship; it is Zion that shall be ploughed as a 
 field, the building burnt to the ground and levelled with it. Some
 observe that this was literally fulfilled in the destruction of 
 Jerusalem by the Romans, when the ground on which the city stood was 
 ploughed up in token of its utter desolation, and that no city should 
 be built upon that ground without the emperor's leave. Even 
 <I>Jerusalem,</I> the holy city, shall <I>become heaps</I> of ruins, 
 and the <I>mountain of the house,</I> on which the temple is built, 
 shall be overgrown with briars and thorns, <I>as the high places of the 
 forest.</I> If sacred places be polluted by sin, they must expect to be 
 wasted and ruined by the judgments of God. 

 (2.) It is the wickedness of those who preside in them that brings the 
 ruin: "It is <I>for your sake</I> that <I>Zion shall be ploughed as a 
 field;</I> you pretend to build up Zion, but, doing it by blood and 
 iniquity, you pull it down." Note, The sin of priests and princes is 
 often the ruin of states and churches. <I>Delirant reges, plectuntur 
 Achivi</I>--<I>The kings act foolishly and the people suffer for 
 it.</I></P>
