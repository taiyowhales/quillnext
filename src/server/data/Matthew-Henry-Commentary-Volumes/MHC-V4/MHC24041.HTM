 It is a very tragical story that is related in this chapter, and shows 
 that evil pursues sinners. The black cloud that was gathering in the 
 foregoing chapter here bursts in a dreadful storm. Those few Jews that 
 escaped the captivity were proud to think that they were still in their 
 own land, when their brethren had gone they knew not whither, were fond 
 of the wine and summer-fruits they had gathered, and were very secure 
 under Gedaliah's protectorship, when, on a sudden, even these remains 
 prove ruins too. 

 I. Gedaliah is barbarously slain by Ishmael, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+41:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. All the Jews that were with him were slain likewise 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+41:3">ver. 3</A>)

 and a pit filled with their dead bodies,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+41:9">ver. 9</A>.

 III. Some devout men, to the number of fourscore, that were going
 towards Jerusalem, were drawn in by Ishmael, and murdered likewise, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+41:4-7">ver. 4-7</A>.

 Only ten of them escaped, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+41:8">ver. 8</A>.

 IV. Those that escaped the sword were taken prisoners by Ishmael, and
 carried off towards the country of the Ammonites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+41:10">ver. 10</A>.

 V. By the conduct and courage of Johanan, though the death of the slain 
 is not revenged, yet the prisoners are recovered, and he now becomes 
 their commander-in-chief, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+41:11-16">ver. 11-16</A>.

 VI. His project is to carry them into the land of Egypt 
 
 (ver. 17, 18</A>),

 which we shall hear more of in the next chapter.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now it came to pass in the seventh month, <I>that</I> Ishmael the
 son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the
 princes of the king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah
 the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread
 together in Mizpah.
 &nbsp; 2  Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that
 were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of
 Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon
 had made governor over the land.
 &nbsp; 3  Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, <I>even</I>
 with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found
 there, <I>and</I> the men of war.
 &nbsp; 4  And it came to pass the second day after he had slain
 Gedaliah, and no man knew <I>it,</I>
 &nbsp; 5  That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from
 Samaria, <I>even</I> fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and
 their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and
 incense in their hand, to bring <I>them</I> to the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 6  And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to
 meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as
 he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of
 Ahikam.
 &nbsp; 7  And it was <I>so,</I> when they came into the midst of the city,
 that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, <I>and cast them</I> into
 the midst of the pit, he, and the men that <I>were</I> with him.
 &nbsp; 8  But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael,
 Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of
 barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them
 not among their brethren.
 &nbsp; 9  Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of
 the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, <I>was</I> it which
 Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: <I>and</I>
 Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with <I>them that were</I>
 slain.
 &nbsp; 10  Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the
 people that <I>were</I> in Mizpah, <I>even</I> the king's daughters, and
 all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the
 captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam:
 and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and
 departed to go over to the Ammonites.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is hard to say which is more astonishing, God's permitting or men's 
 perpetrating such villanies as here we find committed. Such base, 
 barbarous, bloody work is here done by men who by their birth should 
 have been men of honour, by their religion just men, and this done upon 
 those of their own nature, their own nation, their own religion, and 
 now their brethren in affliction, when they were all brought under the 
 power of the victorious Chaldeans, and smarting under the judgments of 
 God, upon no provocation, nor with any prospect of advantage--all done,
 not only in cold blood, but with art and management. We have scarcely 
 such an instance of perfidious cruelty in all the scripture; so that 
 with John, when he saw the <I>woman drunk with the blood of the 
 saints,</I> we may well <I>wonder with great admiration.</I> But God 
 permitted it for the completing of the ruin of an unhumbled people, and 
 the filling up of the measure of their judgments, who had filled up the 
 measure of their iniquities. Let it inspire us with an indignation at 
 the wickedness of men and an awe of God's righteousness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Ishmael and his party treacherously killed Gedaliah himself in the 
 first place. Though the king of Babylon had made him a great man, had 
 given him a commission to be <I>governor of the land</I> which he had 
 conquered, though God had made him a good man and a great blessing to 
 his country, and his agency for its welfare was as life from the dead, 
 yet neither could secure him. Ishmael was of <I>the seed royal</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+41:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)

 and therefore jealous of Gedaliah's growing greatness, and enraged that
 he should merit and accept a commission under the king of Babylon. He
 had <I>ten men</I> with him that were <I>princes of the king</I> too, 
 guided by the same peevish resentments that he was; these had been with 
 Gedaliah before, to put themselves under his protection

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+40:8"><I>ch.</I> xl. 8</A>),

 and now came again to make him a visit; <I>and they did eat bread
 together in Mizpah.</I> he entertained them generously, and entertained 
 no jealousy of them, notwithstanding the information given him by 
 Johanan. They pretended friendship to him, and gave him no warning to 
 stand on his guard; he was in sincerity friendly to them, and did all 
 he could to oblige them. But those that did <I>eat bread</I> with him 
 <I>lifted up the heel</I> against him. They did not pick a quarrel with 
 him, but watched an opportunity, when they had him alone, and 
 assassinated him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+41:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They likewise put all to the sword that they found in arms there, 
 both Jews and Chaldeans, all that were employed under Gedaliah or were 
 in any capacity to revenge his death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+41:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 As if enough of the blood of Israelites had not been shed by the 
 Chaldeans, their own princes here mingle it with the blood of the 
 Chaldeans. The vine-dressers and the husbandmen were busy in the 
 fields, and knew nothing of this bloody massacre; so artfully was it 
 carried on and concealed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Some good honest men, that were going all in tears to lament the 
 desolations of Jerusalem, were drawn in by Ishmael, and murdered with 
 the rest. Observe, 
 
 1. Whence they came
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+41:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)--

 <I>from Shechem, Samaria,</I> and <I>Shiloh,</I> places that had been 
 famous, but wee now reduced; they belonged to the ten tribes, but there 
 were some in those countries that retained an affection for the worship 
 of the God of Israel. 

 2. Whither they were going--<I>to the house of the Lord,</I> the temple
 at Jerusalem, which, no doubt, they had heard of the destruction of, 
 and were going to pay their respects to its ashes, to see its ruins, 
 that their eye might affect their heart with sorrow for them. They 
 <I>favour the dust thereof,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:14">Ps. cii. 14</A>.

 They took <I>offerings and incense in their hand,</I> that if they
 should find any altar there, though it were but an altar of earth, and 
 any priest ready to officiate, they might not be without something to 
 offer; if not, yet they showed their good-will, as Abraham, when he 
 came to <I>the place of the altar,</I> though the altar was gone. The 
 people of God used to go rejoicing to the <I>house of the Lord,</I> but 
 these went in the habit of mourners, with <I>their clothes rent</I> and 
 <I>their heads shaven;</I> for the providence of God loudly called to 
 weeping and mourning, because it was not with the faithful worshippers 
 of God as in months past.

 3. How they were decoyed into a fatal snare by Ishmael's malice.
 Hearing of their approach, he resolved to be the death of them too, so 
 bloodthirsty was he. He seemed as if he hated every one that had the 
 name of an Israelite or the face of an honest man. These pilgrims 
 towards Jerusalem he had a spite to, for the sake of their errand. 
 Ishmael went out to meet them with crocodiles' tears, pretending to 
 bewail the desolations of Jerusalem as much as they; and, to try how 
 they stood affected to Gedaliah and his government, he courted them 
 into the town and found them to have a respect for him, which confirmed 
 him in his resolution to murder them. <I>He said, Come to Gedaliah,</I> 
 pretending he would have them come and live with him, when really he 
 intended that they should come and die with him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+41:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 They had heard such a character of Gedaliah that they were willing 
 enough to be acquainted with him; but Ishmael, when he had them <I>in 
 the midst of the</I> town, fell upon them and <I>slew them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+41:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),
 
 and no doubt took the offerings they had and converted them to his own 
 use; for he that would not stick at such a murder would not stick at 
 sacrilege. Notice is taken of his disposing of the dead bodies of these 
 and the rest that he had slain; he tumbled them all into a great 
 <I>pit</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+41:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 the same pit that Asa king of Judah had digged long before, either in 
 the city or adjoining to it, when he built or fortified Mizpah 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:22">1 Kings xv. 22</A>),

 to be a frontier-garrison against <I>Baasha king of Israel</I> and
 <I>for fear of</I> him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+41:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Note, Those that dig pits with a good intention know not what bad use 
 they may be put to, one time or other. He slew so many that he could
 not afford them each a grave, or would not do them so much honour, but 
 threw them all promiscuously into one pit. Among these last that were 
 doomed to the slaughter there were ten that obtained a pardon, by 
 working, not on the compassion, but the covetousness, of those that had 
 them at their mercy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+41:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 They <I>said to Ishmael,</I> when he was about to suck their blood, 
 like an insatiable horseleech, after that of the companions, <I>Slay us 
 not, for we have treasurers in the field,</I> country treasures, large 
 stocks upon the ground, abundance of such commodities as the country 
 affords, <I>wheat and barley, and oil and honey,</I> intimating that 
 they would discover it to him and put him in possession of it all, if 
 he would spare them. <I>Skin for skin, and all that a man has, will he 
 give for his life.</I> This bait prevailed. Ishmael saved them, not for 
 the love of mercy, but for the love of money. Here were riches kept for 
 the owners thereof, not <I>to their hurt</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:13">Eccl. v. 13</A>)

 and to cause them to <I>lose their lives</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:39">Job xxxi. 39</A>),

 but to their good and the preserving of their lives. Solomon observes
 that sometimes <I>the ransom of a man's life is his riches.</I> But 
 those who think thus to bribe death, when it comes with commission, and 
 plead with it, saying, <I>Slay us not, for we have treasures in the 
 field,</I> will find death inexorable and themselves wretchedly 
 deceived.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He carried off the people prisoners. <I>The king's daughters</I> 
 (whom the Chaldeans cared not for troubling themselves with when they 
 had the king's sons) and the poor of the land, the vine-dressers and 
 husband-men, that were committed to Gedaliah's charge, were all led 
 away prisoners towards the country of <I>the Ammonites</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+41:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),
 
 Ishmael probably intending to make a present of them, as the trophies 
 of his barbarous victory, to the king of that country, that set him on. 
 This melancholy story is a warning to us never to be secure in this 
 world. Worse may be yet to come when we think the worst is over; and 
 that end of one trouble, which we fancy to be the end of all trouble, 
 may prove to be the beginning of another, of a greater. These prisoners 
 thought, <I>Surely the bitterness of death,</I> and of captivity, <I>is 
 past;</I> and yet some died by the sword and others went into 
 captivity. When we think ourselves safe, and begin to be easy, 
 destruction may come that way that we little expect it. There is many
 a ship wrecked in the harbour. We can never be sure of peace on this 
 side heaven.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of
 the forces that <I>were</I> with him, heard of all the evil that
 Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,
 &nbsp; 12  Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael
 the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that
 <I>are</I> in Gibeon.
 &nbsp; 13  Now it came to pass, <I>that</I> when all the people which <I>were</I>
 with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains
 of the forces that <I>were</I> with him, then they were glad.
 &nbsp; 14  So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from
 Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of
 Kareah.
 &nbsp; 15  But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with
 eight men, and went to the Ammonites.
 &nbsp; 16  Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of
 the forces that <I>were</I> with him, all the remnant of the people
 whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from
 Mizpah, after <I>that</I> he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam,
 <I>even</I> mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and
 the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon:
 &nbsp; 17  And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham,
 which is by Beth-lehem, to go to enter into Egypt,
 &nbsp; 18  Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them,
 because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son
 of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It would have been well if Johanan, when he gave information to 
 Gedaliah of Ishmael's treasonable design, though he could not obtain 
 leave to kill Ishmael and to prevent it that way, yet had staid with 
 Gedaliah; for he, and his captains, and their forces, might have been a 
 life-guard to Gedaliah and a terror to Ishmael, and so have prevented 
 the mischief without the effusion of blood: but, it seems they were out 
 upon some expedition, perhaps no good one, and so were out of the way 
 when they should have been upon the best service. Those that affect to 
 ramble are many times out of their place when they are most needed. 
 However, at length they <I>hear of all the evil that Ishmael had 
 done</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+41:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 and are resolved to try an after-game, which we have an account of in 
 these verses.

 1. We heartily wish Johanan could have taken revenge upon the
 murderers, but he prevailed only to rescue the captives. Those that had 
 shed so much blood, it was a pity but their blood should have been 
 shed; and it is strange that vengeance suffered them to live; yet it 
 did. Johanan gathered what forces he could <I>and went to fight with 
 Ishmael</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+41:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 upon notice of the murders he had committed (for though he concealed it 
 for a time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+41:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>,

 yet murder will out) and which way he was gone; he pursued him, and 
 overtook him by the great <I>pool of Gibeon,</I> which we read of, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+2:13">2 Sam. ii. 13</A>.

 And, upon his appearing with such a force, Ishmael's heart failed him,
 his guilty conscience flew in his face, and he durst not stand his 
 ground against an enemy that was something like a match for him. The 
 most cruel are often the most cowardly. The poor captives <I>were glad 
 when they saw Johanan</I> and <I>the captains that were with him,</I> 
 looking upon them as their deliverers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+41:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 and they immediately found a way to wheel about and come over to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+41:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 Ishmael not offering to detain them when he saw Johanan. Note, Those 
 that would be helped must help themselves. These captives staid not
 till their conquerors were beaten, but took the first opportunity to 
 make their escape, as soon as they saw their friends appear and their 
 enemies thereby disheartened. Ishmael quitted his pray to save his 
 life, and <I>escaped with eight men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+41:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 It seems, two of his ten men, that were his banditti or assassins
 (spoken of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+41:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 either deserted him or were killed in the engagement; but he made the
 best of his way to the Ammonites, as a perfect renegado, that had quite 
 abandoned all relation to the commonwealth of Israel, though he was of 
 the seed royal, and we hear no more of him. 

 2. We heartily wish that Johanan, when he had rescued the captives,
 would have sat down quietly with them, and governed them peaceably, as 
 Gedaliah did; but, instead of that, he is for leading them into the 
 land of Egypt, as Ishmael would have led them into the land of the 
 Ammonites; so that though he got the command over them in a better way 
 than Ishmael did, and honestly enough, yet he did not use it much 
 better. Gedaliah, who was of a meek and quiet spirit, was a great 
 blessing to them; but Johanan, who was of a fierce and restless spirit, 
 was set over them for their hurt, and to complete their ruin, even 
 after they were, as they thought, redeemed. Thus did God still walk
 contrary to them.

 (1.) The resolution of Johanan and the captains was very rash; nothing
 would serve them but they would <I>go to enter into Egypt</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+41:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 and, in order to that, they encamped for a time <I>in the habitation of
 Chimham, by Bethlehem,</I> David's city. Probably it was some land
 which David gave to Chimham, the son of Barzillai, which, though it 
 returned to David's family at the year of the Jubilee, yet still bore 
 the name of <I>Chimham.</I> Here Johanan made his headquarters, 
 steering his course towards Egypt, either from a personal affection to 
 that country or an ancient national confidence in the Egyptians for 
 help in distress. Some of the <I>mighty men of war,</I> it seems had 
 escaped; those he took with him, <I>and the women and children, whom he 
 had recovered from Ishmael,</I> who were thus emptied from vessel to 
 vessel, because they were yet unchanged. 

 (2.) The reason for this resolution was very frivolous. They pretended 
 that <I>they were afraid of the Chaldeans,</I> that they would come and 
 do I know not what with them, <I>because Ishmael had</I> killed 
 <I>Gedaliah,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+41:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 I cannot think they really had any apprehensions of danger upon this
 account; for, though it is true that the Chaldeans had cause enough to 
 resent the murder of their viceroy, yet they were not so unreasonable, 
 or unjust, as to revenge it upon those who appeared so vigorously 
 against the murderers. But they only make use of this as a sham to 
 cover that corrupt inclination of their unbelieving ancestors, which 
 was so strong in them, <I>to return into Egypt.</I> Those will justly 
 lose their comfort in real fears that excuse themselves in sin with 
 pretended fears.</P>
