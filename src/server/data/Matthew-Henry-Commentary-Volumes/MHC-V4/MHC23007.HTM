 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter is an occasional sermon, in which the prophet sings both 
 of mercy and judgment to those that did not perceive or understand 
 either; he piped unto them, but they danced not, mourned unto them, but 
 they wept not. Here is, 

 I. The consternation that Ahaz was in upon an attempt of the
 confederate forces of Syria and Israel against Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. The assurance which God, by the prophet, sent him for his
 encouragement, that the attempt should be defeated and Jerusalem should 
 be preserved, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:3-9">ver. 3-9</A>.

 III. The confirmation of this by a sign which God gave to Ahaz, when he
 refused to ask one, referring to Christ, and our redemption by him, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:10-16">ver. 10-16</A>.

 IV. A threatening of the great desolation that God would bring upon
 Ahaz and his kingdom by the Assyrians, notwithstanding their escape
 from this present storm, because they went on still in their wickedness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:17-25">ver. 17-25</A>.

 And this is written both for our comfort and for our admonition.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham,
 the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, <I>that</I> Rezin the king of Syria,
 and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward
 Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.
 &nbsp; 2  And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is
 confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart
 of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.
 &nbsp; 3  Then said the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz,
 thou, and Shear-jashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the
 upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field;
 &nbsp; 4  And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither
 be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands,
 for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of
 Remaliah.
 &nbsp; 5  Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken
 evil counsel against thee, saying,
 &nbsp; 6  Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a
 breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, <I>even</I>
 the son of Tabeal:
 &nbsp; 7  Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, It shall not stand, neither shall it
 come to pass.
 &nbsp; 8  For the head of Syria <I>is</I> Damascus, and the head of Damascus
 <I>is</I> Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be
 broken, that it be not a people.
 &nbsp; 9  And the head of Ephraim <I>is</I> Samaria, and the head of Samaria
 <I>is</I> Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not
 be established.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet Isaiah had his commission renewed in the year that king 
 Uzziah died, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:1"><I>ch.</I> vi. 1</A>.

 Jotham his son reigned, and reigned well, sixteen years. All that time,
 no doubt, Isaiah prophesied as he was commanded, and yet we have not in 
 this book any of his prophecies dated in the reign of Jotham; but this, 
 which is put first, was in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham. Many 
 excellent useful sermons he preached which were not published and left 
 upon record; for, if all that was memorable had been written, <I>the 
 world could not have contained the books,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:25">John xxi. 25</A>.

 Perhaps in the reign of Ahaz, a wicked king, he had not opportunity to
 preach so much at court as in Jotham's time, and therefore then he 
 wrote the more, for a testimony against them. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A very formidable design laid against Jerusalem by Rezin king of 
 Syria and Pekah king of Israel, two neighbouring potentates, who had of 
 late made descents upon Judah severally. At the end of the reign of 
 Jotham, <I>the Lord began to send against Judah Rezin and Pekah,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:37">2 Kings xv. 37</A>.

 But now, in the second or third year of the reign of Ahaz, encouraged
 by their former successes, they entered into an alliance against Judah. 
 Because Ahaz, though he found the sword over his head, began his reign 
 with idolatry, <I>God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria 
 and of the king of Israel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:5">2 Chron. xxviii. 5</A>),

 and a great slaughter they made in his kingdom,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 Flushed with this victory, they went up towards Jerusalem, the royal
 city, to war against it, to besiege it, and make themselves masters of 
 it; but it proved in the issue that they could not gain their point. 
 Note, The sin of a land brings foreign invasions upon it and betrays 
 the most advantageous posts and passes to the enemy; and God sometimes 
 makes one wicked nation a scourge to another; but judgment, ordinarily, 
 begins at the house of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The great distress that Ahaz and his court were in when they 
 received advice of this design: <I>It was told the house of David</I> 
 that Syria and Ephraim had signed a league against Judah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 This degenerate royal family is called the <I>house of David,</I> to
 put us in mind of that article of God's covenant with David 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:30-33">Ps. lxxxix. 30-33</A>),

 <I>If his children forsake my law, I will chasten their transgression
 with the rod; but my loving-kindness will I not utterly take away,</I> 
 which is remarkably fulfilled in this chapter. News being brought that
 the two armies of Syria and Israel were joined, and had taken the 
 field, the court, the city, and the country, were thrown into 
 consternation; <I>The heart of Ahaz was moved with fear,</I> and then 
 no wonder that <I>the heart of his people was so, as the trees of the 
 wood are moved with the wind.</I> They were tossed and shaken, and put 
 into a great disorder and confusion, were wavering and uncertain in 
 their counsels, hurried hither and thither, and could not fix in any 
 steady resolution. They yielded to the storm, and gave up all for gone, 
 concluding it in vain to make any resistance. Now that which caused 
 this fright was the sense of guilt and the weakness of their faith.
 They had made God their enemy, and knew not how to make him their 
 friend, and therefore their fears tyrannised over them; while those 
 whose consciences are kept <I>void of offence, and whose hearts are 
 fixed, trusting in God, need not be afraid of evil tidings; though the 
 earth be removed, yet will not they fear; but the wicked flee at the 
 shaking of a leaf,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:36">Lev. xxvi. 36</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The orders and directions given to Isaiah to go and encourage Ahaz 
 in his distress; not for his own sake (he deserved to hear nothing from 
 God but words of terror, which might add affliction to his grief), but 
 because he was a son of David and king of Judah. God had kindness for 
 him for his father's sake, who must not be forgotten, and for his 
 people's sake, who must not be abandoned, but would be encouraged if 
 Ahaz were. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God appointed the prophet to meet Ahaz, though he did not send to 
 the prophet to speak with him, nor desire him to enquire of the Lord 
 for him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Go to meet Ahaz.</I> Note, God is often found of those who seek him
 not, much more will he be found of those who seek him diligently. He 
 speaks comfort to many who not only are not worthy of it, but do not so 
 much as enquire after it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He ordered him to take his little son with him, because he carried a 
 sermon in his name, <I>Shear-jashub--A remnant shall return.</I> The
 prophets sometimes recorded what they preached in the significant names 
 of their children (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:4,6,9">Hos. i. 4, 6, 9</A>);

 therefore Isaiah's children are said to be <I>for signs,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:18"><I>ch.</I> viii. 18</A>.

 This son was so called for the encouragement of those of God's people
 who were carried captive, assuring them that they should return, at 
 least a remnant of them, which was more than they could pretend to 
 merit; yet at this time God was better than his word; for he took care 
 not only that a remnant should return, but the whole number of those 
 whom the confederate forces of Syria and Israel had taken prisoners, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:15">2 Chron. xxviii. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He directed him where he should find Ahaz. He was to meet with him 
 not in the temple, or the synagogue, or royal chapel, but <I>at the end 
 of the conduit of the upper pool,</I> where he was, probably with many 
 of his servants about him, contriving how to order the water-works, so 
 as to secure them to the city, or deprive the enemy of the benefits of 
 them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:9-11,2Ch+32:3,4"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 9-11; 2 Chron. xxxii. 3, 4</A>),

 or giving some necessary directions for the fortifying of the city as
 well as they could; and perhaps finding every thing in a bad posture or 
 defence, the conduit out of repair, as well as other things gone to 
 decay, his fears increased, and he was now in greater perplexity than 
 ever; therefore, <I>Go, meet him there.</I> Note, God sometimes sends 
 comforts to his people very seasonably, and, what time they are most 
 afraid, encourages them to trust in him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He put words in his mouth, else the prophet would not have known how 
 to bring a message of good to such a bad man, a sinner in Zion, that 
 ought to be afraid; but God intended it for the support of faithful 
 Israelites.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The prophet must rebuke their fears, and advise them by no means 
 to yield to them, but keep their temper, and preserve the possession of 
 their own souls 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Take heed, and be quiet.</I> Note, In order to comfort there is need
 of caution; that we may be quiet, it is necessary that we take heed and 
 watch against those things that threaten to disquiet us. "Fear not with 
 this amazement, this fear, that weakens, and has torment; neither 
 <I>let thy heart be tender,</I> so as to melt and fail within thee; but 
 pluck up thy spirits, have a good heart on it, and be courageous; let 
 not fear betray the succours which reason and religion offer for thy 
 support." Note, Those who expect God should help them must help 
 themselves,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:14">Ps. xxvii. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He must teach them to despise their enemies, not in pride, or 
 security, or incogitancy (nothing more dangerous than so to despise an 
 enemy), but in faith and dependence upon God. Ahaz's fear called them 
 two powerful politic princes, for either of whom he was an unequal 
 match, but, if united, he durst not look them in the face, nor make 
 head against them. "No," says the prophet, "they are <I>two tails of 
 smoking firebrands;</I> they are angry, they are fierce, they are 
 furious, as firebrands, as fireballs; and they make one another worse 
 by being in a confederacy, as sticks of fire put together burn the more 
 violently. But they are only smoking firebrands: and where there is 
 smoke there is some fire, but it may be not so much as was feared. 
 Their threatenings will vanish into smoke. <I>Pharaoh king of Egypt is 
 but a noise</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:17">Jer. xlvi. 17</A>),

 and Rezin king of Syria but a smoke; and such are all the enemies of
 God's church, <I>smoking flax,</I> that will soon be quenched. Nay, 
 they are but <I>tails</I> of smoking firebrands, in a manner burnt out 
 already; their force is spent; they have consumed themselves with the 
 heat of their own anger; you may put your foot on them, and tread them 
 out." The two kingdoms of Syria and Israel were now near expiring. 
 Note, The more we have an eye to God as a consuming fire the less 
 reason we shall have to fear men, though they are ever so furious, nay, 
 we shall be able to despise them as smoking firebrands.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He must assure them that the present design of these high allies 
 (so they thought themselves) against Jerusalem should certainly be 
 defeated and come to nothing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:5-7"><I>v.</I> 5-7</A>.

 [1.] That very thing which Ahaz thought most formidable is made the 
 ground of their defeat--and that was the depth of their designs and the 
 height of their hopes: "<I>Therefore</I> they shall be baffled and sent 
 back with shame, <I>because they have taken evil counsel against 
 thee,</I> which is an offence to God. These firebrands are a <I>smoke 
 in his nose</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:5"><I>ch.</I> lxv. 5</A>),

 and therefore must be extinguished." <I>First,</I> They are very
 spiteful and malicious, and, therefore they shall not prosper. Judah 
 had done them no wrong; they had no pretence to quarrel with Ahaz; but, 
 without any reason, they said, <I>Let us go up against Judah, and vex 
 it.</I> Note, Those that are vexatious cannot expect to be prosperous, 
 those that love to do mischief cannot expect to do well.
 <I>Secondly,</I> They are very secure, and confident of success. They 
 will vex Judah by going up against it; yet that is not all: they do not 
 doubt but to make a breach in the wall of Jerusalem wide enough for 
 them to march their army in at; or they count upon dissecting or 
 dividing the kingdom into two parts, one for the king of Israel, the 
 other for the king of Syria, who had agreed in one viceroy--<I>a 
 king</I> to be <I>set in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal,</I> 
 some obscure person, it is uncertain whether a Syrian or an Israelite.
 So sure were they of gaining their point that they divided the prey 
 before they had caught it. Note, Those that are most scornful are 
 commonly least successful, for surely God scorns the scorners. 

 [2.] God himself gives them his word that the attempt should not take 
 effect 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "<I>Thus saith the Lord God,</I> the sovereign Lord of all, who
 <I>brings the counsel of the heathen to naught</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+33:10">Ps. xxxiii. 10</A>),

 <I>It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass;</I> their
 measures shall all be broken, and they shall not be able to bring to 
 pass their enterprise." Note, Whatever stands against God, or thinks to 
 stand without him, cannot stand long. Man purposes, but God disposes; 
 and <I>who is he that saith and it cometh to pass if the Lord commands 
 it not or countermands it?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:37">Lam. iii. 37</A>.
 
 See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+19:21">Prov. xix. 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) He must give them a prospect of the destruction of these enemies,
 at last, that were now such a terror to them. 

 [1.] They should neither of them enlarge their dominions, nor push 
 their conquests any further; <I>The head city of Syria is Damascus, and 
 the head man of Damascus is Rezin;</I> this he glories in, and this let 
 him be content with, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 <I>The head city of Ephraim</I> has long been <I>Samaria, and the head
 man in Samaria is</I> now Pekah <I>the son of Remaliah.</I> These shall 
 be made to know their own, their bounds are fixed, and they shall not 
 pass them, to make themselves masters of the cities of Judah, much less 
 to make Jerusalem their prey. Note, As God has appointed men the
 bounds of their habitation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:26">Acts xvii. 26</A>),

 so he has appointed princes the bounds of their dominion, within which
 they ought to confine themselves, and not encroach upon their 
 neighbours' rights.

 [2.] Ephraim, which perhaps was the more malicious and forward enemy of 
 the two, should shortly be quite rooted out, and should be so far from 
 seizing other people's lands that they should not be able to hold their 
 own. Interpreters are much at a loss how to compute the sixty-five 
 years within which <I>Ephraim shall cease to be a people;</I> for the 
 captivity of the ten tribes was but eleven years after this: and some 
 make it a mistake of the transcriber, and think it should be read 
 <I>within six and five years,</I> just eleven. But it is hard to allow
 that. Others make it to be sixty-five years from the time that the 
 prophet Amos first foretold the ruin of the kingdom of the ten tribes; 
 and some late interpreters make it to look as far forward as the last 
 desolation of that country by Esarhaddon, which was about sixty-five 
 years after this; then Ephraim was so broken that it was no more a 
 people. Now it was the greatest folly in the world for those to be 
 ruining their neighbours who were themselves marked for ruin, and so 
 near to it. See what a prophet told them at this time, when they were 
 triumphing over Judah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:10">2 Chron. xxviii. 10</A>.

 <I>Are there not with you, even with you, sins against the Lord your
 God?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) He must urge them to mix faith with those assurances which he had 
 given them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>If you will not believe</I> what is said to you, <I>surely you
 shall not be established;</I> your shaken and disordered state shall 
 not be established, your unquiet unsettled spirit shall not; though the 
 things told you are very encouraging, yet they will not be so to you, 
 unless you believe them, and be willing to take God's word." Note, The 
 grace of faith is absolutely necessary to the quieting and composing of 
 the mind in the midst of all the tosses of this present time,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Moreover the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake again unto Ahaz, saying,

 depth, or in the height above.
 &nbsp; 12  But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 13  And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; <I>Is it</I> a small
 thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?

 virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name
 Immanuel.
 &nbsp; 15  Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse
 the evil, and choose the good.
 &nbsp; 16  For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and
 choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken
 of both her kings.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. God, by the prophet, makes a gracious offer to Ahaz, to confirm the 
 foregoing predictions, and his faith in them, by such sign or miracle 
 as he should choose 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>):

 <I>Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God;</I> See here the divine
 faithfulness and veracity. God tells us nothing but what he is able and 
 ready to prove. See his wonderful condescension to the children of men, 
 in that he is so <I>willing to show to the heirs of promise the 
 immutability of his counsel,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:17">Heb. vi. 17</A>.

 He considers our frame, and that, living in a world of sense, we are
 apt to require sensible proofs, which therefore he has favoured us with 
 in sacramental signs and seals. Ahaz was a bad man, yet God is called 
 the Lord his God, because he was a child of Abraham and David, and of 
 the covenants made with them. See how gracious God is even to the evil 
 and unthankful; Ahaz is bidden to choose his sign, as Gideon about the 
 fleece 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:37">Judg. vi. 37</A>);

 let him ask for a sign in the air, or earth, or water, for God's power
 is the same in all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Ahaz rudely refuses this gracious offer, and (which is not mannerly 
 towards any superior) kicks at the courtesy, and puts a slight upon it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>I will not ask.</I> The true reason why he would not ask for a sign
 was because, having a dependence upon the Assyrians, their forces, and 
 their gods, for help, he would not thus far be beholden to the God of 
 Israel, or lay himself under obligations to him. He would not ask a 
 sign for the confirming of his faith because he resolved to persist in 
 his unbelief, and would indulge his doubts and distrusts; yet he 
 pretends a pious reason: <I>I will not tempt the Lord;</I> as if it 
 would be a tempting of God to do that which God himself invited and 
 directed him to do. Note, A secret disaffection to God is often 
 disguised with the specious colours of respect to him; and those who 
 are resolved that they will not trust God yet pretend that they will 
 not tempt him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The prophet reproves him and his court, him and the house of 
 David, the whole royal family, for their contempt of prophecy, and the 
 little value they had for divine revelation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)

 "<I>Is it a small thing for you to weary men</I> by your oppression and
 tyranny, with which you make yourselves burdensome and odious to all 
 mankind? But <I>will you weary my God also</I> with the affronts you 
 put upon him?" As the unjust judge that neither <I>feared God nor 
 regarded man,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:2">Luke xviii. 2</A>.

 <I>You have wearied the Lord with your words,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:17">Mal. ii. 17</A>.

 Nothing is more grievous to the God of heaven than to be distrusted.
 "<I>Will you weary my God?</I> Will you suppose him to be tired and 
 unable to help you, or to be weary of doing you good? Whereas <I>the 
 youths may faint and be weary,</I> you may have tired all your friends, 
 <I>the Creator of the ends of the earth faints not, neither is 
 weary.</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:28-31"><I>ch.</I> xl. 28-31</A>.

 Or this: "In affronting the prophets, you think you put a slight only
 upon men like yourselves, and consider not that you affront God 
 himself, whose messengers they are, and put a slight upon him, who will 
 resent it accordingly." The prophet here calls God his God with a great 
 deal of pleasure: Ahaz would not say, He is my God, though the prophet 
 had invited him to say so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>The Lord thy God;</I> but Isaiah will say, "He is mine." Note,
 Whatever others do, we must avouch the Lord for ours and abide by 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The prophet, in God's name, gives them a sign: "You will not ask a 
 sign, but the unbelief of man shall not make the promise of God of no 
 effect: <I>The Lord himself shall give you a sign</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 a double sign."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. "A sign in general of his good-will to Israel and to the house of 
 David. You may conclude it that he has mercy in store for you, and that 
 you are not forsaken of your God, how great soever your present 
 distress and danger are; for of your nation, of your family, the 
 Messiah is to be born, and you cannot be destroyed while that blessing 
 is in you, which shall be introduced," 

 (1.) "In a glorious manner; for, whereas you have been often told that 
 he should be born among you, I am now further to tell you that he shall 
 be born of a virgin, which will signify both the divine power and the 
 divine purity with which he shall be brought into the world,--that he 
 shall be a extraordinary person, for he shall not be born by ordinary 
 generation,--and that he shall be a holy thing, not stained with the 
 common pollutions of the human nature, therefore incontestably fit to 
 have the throne of his father David given him." Now this, though it was 
 to be accomplished above 500 years after, was a most encouraging sign 
 to the house of David (and to them, under that title, this prophecy is 
 directed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)

 and an assurance that God would not cast them off. Ephraim did indeed
 envy Judah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:13"><I>ch.</I> xi. 13</A>)

 and sought the ruin of that kingdom, but could not prevail; for the
 sceptre should never depart from Judah till the coming of Shiloh, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:10">Gen. xlix. 10</A>.

 Those whom God designs for the great salvation may take that for a sign
 to them that they shall not be swallowed up by any trouble they meet 
 with in the way.

 (2.) The Messiah shall be introduced on a glorious errand, wrapped up 
 in his glorious name: They <I>shall call his name Immanuel--God with 
 us,</I> God in our nature, God at peace with us, in covenant with us. 
 This was fulfilled in their calling him <I>Jesus--a Saviour</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:21-25">Matt. i. 21-25</A>),

 for, if he had not been <I>Immanuel--God with us,</I> he could not have
 been <I>Jesus--a Saviour.</I> Now this was a further sign of God's 
 favour to the house of David and the tribe of Judah; for he that 
 intended to work this great salvation among them no doubt would work 
 out for them all those other salvations which were to be the types and 
 figures of this, and as it were preludes to this. "Here is a sign for
 you, not in the depth nor in the height, but in the prophecy, in the 
 promise, in the covenant made with David, which you are no strangers 
 to. The promised seed shall be Immanuel, <I>God with us;</I> let that 
 word comfort you

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:10"><I>ch.</I> viii. 10</A>),

 that <I>God is with us,</I> and 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>)

 that your land is Immanuel's land. Let not <I>the heart of the house of
 David</I> be moved thus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),
 
 nor let Judah fear the setting up of the son of Tabeal

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 for nothing can cut off the entail on the Son of David that shall be
 Immanuel." Note, The strongest consolations, in time of trouble, are 
 those which are borrowed from Christ, our relation to him, our interest 
 in him, and our expectations of him and from him. Of this child it is 
 further foretold

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 that though he shall not be born like other children, but of a virgin,
 yet he shall be really and truly man, and shall be nursed and brought 
 up like other children: <I>Butter and honey shall he eat,</I> as other 
 children do, particularly the children of that land which <I>flowed 
 with milk and honey.</I> Though he be conceived by the power of the 
 Holy Ghost, yet he shall not therefore be fed with angels' food, but, 
 as it becomes him, shall be <I>in all things made like unto his 
 brethren,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:17">Heb. ii. 17</A>.

 Nor shall he, though born thus by extraordinary generation, be a man
 immediately, but, as other children, shall advance gradually through 
 the several states of infancy, childhood, and youth, to that of 
 manhood, and growing in wisdom and stature, shall at length wax strong 
 in spirit, and come to maturity, so as to know how <I>to refuse the 
 evil and choose the good.</I> See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:40,52">Luke ii. 40, 52</A>.

 Note, Children are fed when they are little that they may be taught and
 instructed when they have grown up; they have their maintenance in 
 order to their education.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here is another sign in particular of the speedy destruction of 
 these potent princes that were now a terror to Judah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 "Before <I>this</I> child (so it should be read), this child which I
 have now in my arms" (he means not Immanuel, but Shear-jashub his own 
 son, whom he was ordered to take with him for a sign, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 "before this <I>child shall know how to refuse the evil and choose the
 good</I>" (and those who saw what his present stature and forwardness 
 were would easily conjecture how long that would be), "before this 
 child be three or four years older, <I>the land that thou 
 abhorrest,</I> these confederate forces of Israelites and Syrians, 
 which thou hast such an enmity to and standest in such dread of, 
 <I>shall be forsaken of both their kings,</I> both Pekah and Rezin," 
 who were in so close an alliance that they seemed as if they were the 
 kings of but one kingdom. This was fully accomplished; for within two
 or three years after this, Hoshea conspired against Pekah, and slew him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:30">2 Kings xv. 30</A>),

 and, before that, the king of Assyria took Damascus, and slew Rezin,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:9">2 Kings xvi. 9</A>.

 Nay, there was a present event, which happened immediately, and when
 this child carried the prediction of in his name, which was a pledge 
 and earnest of this future event. <I>Shear-jashub</I> signifies <I>The
 remnant shall return,</I> which doubtless points at the wonderful 
 return of those 200,000 captives whom Pekah and Rezin had carried away, 
 who were brought back, not by might or power, but by the Spirit of the 
 Lord of hosts. Read the story,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:8-15">2 Chron. xxviii. 8-15</A>.

 The prophetical naming of this child having thus had its
 accomplishment, no doubt this, which was further added concerning him, 
 should have its accomplishment likewise, that Syria and Israel should 
 be deprived of both their kings. One mercy from God encourages us to 
 hope for another, if it engages us to prepare for another.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and
 upon thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day
 that Ephraim departed from Judah; <I>even</I> the king of Assyria.
 &nbsp; 18  And it shall come to pass in that day, <I>that</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall
 hiss for the fly that <I>is</I> in the uttermost part of the rivers of
 Egypt, and for the bee that <I>is</I> in the land of Assyria.
 &nbsp; 19  And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the
 desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all
 thorns, and upon all bushes.
 &nbsp; 20  In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is
 hired, <I>namely,</I> by them beyond the river, by the king of

 consume the beard.

 there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but
 it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading
 of lesser cattle.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 After the comfortable promises made to Ahaz as a branch of the house of 
 David, here follow terrible threatenings against him, as a degenerate 
 branch of that house; for though the loving-kindness of God shall not 
 be utterly taken away, for the sake of David and the covenant made with 
 him, yet his iniquity shall be <I>chastened with the rod,</I> and his 
 sin with stripes. Let those that will not mix faith with the promises 
 of God expect to hear the alarms of his threatenings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The judgment threatened is very great, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 It is very great, for it is general; it shall be brought upon the
 prince himself (high as he is, he shall not be out of the reach of it), 
 and upon the people, the whole body of the nation, and upon the royal 
 family, <I>upon</I> all <I>thy father's house;</I> it shall be a 
 judgment entailed on posterity, and shall go along with the royal 
 blood. It is very great, for it shall be unprecedented--<I>days that 
 have not come;</I> so dark, so gloomy, so melancholy, as never were the 
 like since the revolt of the ten tribes, when Ephraim departed from 
 Judah, which was indeed a sad time to the house of David. Note, The 
 longer men continue in sin the sorer punishments they have reason to 
 expect. It is the Lord that will bring these days upon them, for our 
 times are in his hand, and who can resist or escape the judgments he 
 brings?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The enemy that should be employed as the instrument of this 
 judgment is the king of Assyria. Ahaz reposed great confidence in that 
 prince for help against the confederate powers of Israel and Syria, and 
 minded the less what God said to him by his prophet for his 
 encouragement because he built much upon his interest in the king of 
 Assyria, and had meanly promised to be his servant if he would send him 
 some succours; he had also, made him a present of gold and silver, for 
 which he drained the treasures both of church and state, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:7,8">2 Kings xvi. 7, 8</A>.
 
 Now God threatens that that king of Assyria whom he made his stay
 instead of God should become a scourge to him. He was so speedily; for, 
 when he <I>came to him, he distressed him, but strengthened him not</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:20">2 Chron. xxviii. 20</A>),

 the reed not only broke under him, but ran into his hand, and pierced
 it, and thenceforward the kings of Assyria were, for a long time, 
 grieving thorns to Judah, and gave them a great deal of trouble. Note, 
 The creature that we make our hope commonly proves our hurt. The king 
 of Assyria, not long after this, made himself master of the ten tribes, 
 carried them captive, and laid their country waste, so as fully to 
 answer the prediction here; and perhaps it may refer to that, as an 
 explication of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>, 

 where it is foretold that Ephraim shall be broken, that it shall not be
 a people; and it is easy to suppose that the prophet (at

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>)

 turns his speech to the king of Israel, denouncing God's judgments
 against him for invading Judah. But the expositors universally 
 understand it of Ahaz and his kingdom. Now observe,

 1. Summons given to the invaders 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>The Lord shall whistle for the fly and the bee.</I> See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:26"><I>ch.</I> v. 26</A>.

 Enemies that seem as contemptible as a fly or a bee, and are as easily
 crushed, shall yet, when God pleases, do his work as effectually as 
 lions and young lions. Though they are as far distant from one another
 as the rivers of Egypt and the land of Assyria, yet they shall 
 punctually meet to join in this work when God commands their 
 attendance; for, when God has work to do, he will not be at a loss for 
 instruments to do it with. 

 2. Possession taken by them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 It should seem as if the country were in no condition to make
 resistance. They find no difficulties in forcing their way, but
 <I>come and rest all of them in the desolate valleys,</I> which the 
 inhabitants had deserted upon the first alarm, and left them a cheap 
 and easy prey to the invaders. They shall come and rest in the low 
 grounds like swarms of flies and bees, and shall render themselves 
 impregnable by taking shelter in the holes of the rocks, as bees often 
 do, and showing themselves formidable by appearing openly upon all 
 thorns and all bushes; so generally shall the land be overspread with 
 them. These bees shall knit upon the thorns and bushes, and there rest 
 undisturbed.

 3. Great desolations made, and the country generally depopulated

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>The Lord shall shave the hair of the head, and beard, and feet;</I>
 he shall sweep all away, as the leper, when he was cleansed, <I>shaved 
 off all his hair,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+14:8,9">Lev. xiv. 8, 9</A>.

 This is done with a razor which is hired, either which God has hired
 (as if he had none of his own; but what he hires, and whom he employs 
 in any service for him, he will pay for. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:18,19">Ezek. xxix. 18, 19</A>),

 or which Ahaz has hired for his assistance. God will make that to be
 an instrument of his destruction which he hired into his service. Note, 
 Many are beaten with that arm of flesh which they trusted to rather 
 than to the arm of the Lord, and which they were at a great expense 
 upon, when by faith and prayer they might have found cheap and easy 
 succour in God.

 4. The consequences of this general depopulation.

 (1.) The flocks of cattle shall be all destroyed, so that a man who had 
 herds and flocks in abundance shall be stripped of them all by the 
 enemy, and shall with much ado save for his own use a young cow and two 
 sheep--a poor stock 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 yet he shall think himself happy in having any left.

 (2.) The few cattle that are left shall have such a large compass of 
 ground to feed in that <I>they shall give abundance of milk,</I> and 
 very good milk, such as shall produce butter enough, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 There shall also be such want of men that the milk of one cow and two
 sheep shall serve a whole family, which used to keep abundance of 
 servants and consume a great deal, but is now reduced.

 (3.) The breed of cattle shall be destroyed; so that those who used to 
 eat flesh ( as the Jews commonly did) shall be necessitated to confine 
 themselves to butter and honey, for there shall be no flesh for them; 
 and the country shall be so depopulated that there shall be butter and 
 honey enough for the few that are left in it. 

 (4.) Good land, that used to be let well, shall be all overrun with 
 briers and thorns 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>);

 where there used to be a thousand vines planted, for which the tenants
 used to pay a thousand shekels, or pieces of silver, yearly rent, there 
 shall be nothing now but briers and thorns, no profit either for 
 landlord or tenant, all being laid waste by the army of the invaders.
 Note, God can soon turn a fruitful land into barrenness; and it is just 
 with him to turn vines into briers if we, instead of bringing forth 
 grapes to him, bring forth wild grapes,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:4"><I>ch.</I> v. 4</A>.

 (5.) The implements of husbandry shall be turned into instruments of
 war, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 The whole land having become briers and thorns, the grounds that men
 used to come to with sickles and pruning-hooks to gather in the fruits 
 they shall now come to with arrows and bows, to hunt for wild beasts in 
 the thickets, or to defend themselves from the robbers that lurk in the 
 bushes, seeking for prey, or to kill the serpents and venomous beasts 
 that are hid there. This denotes a very sad change of the face of that
 pleasant land. But what melancholy change is there which sin will not 
 make with a people?

 (6.) Where briers and thorns were wont to be of use and to do good
 service, even in the hedges, for the defence of the enclosed grounds, 
 they shall be plucked up, and all laid in common. There shall be
 briers and thorns in abundance where they should not be, but none where 
 they should be,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 <I>The hills that shall be digged with the mattock,</I> for special
 use, from which the cattle used to be kept off with the fear of briers 
 and thorns, shall now be thrown open, the <I>hedges broken down for the 
 boar out of the wood</I> to waste it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:12,13">Ps. lxxx. 12, 13</A>.

 It shall be left at large for oxen to run in and less cattle. See the
 effect of sin and the curse; it has made the earth a forest of thorns 
 and thistles, except as it is forced into some order by the constant 
 care and labour of man. And see what folly it is to set our hearts upon 
 possessions of lands, be they every so fruitful, ever so pleasant; if 
 they lie ever so little neglected and uncultivated, or if they be 
 abused by a wasteful careless heir or tenant, or the country be laid 
 waste by war, they will soon become frightful deserts. Heaven is a 
 paradise not subject to such changes.</P>
