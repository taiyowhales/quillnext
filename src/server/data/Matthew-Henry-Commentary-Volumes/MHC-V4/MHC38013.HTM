 In this chapter we have, 

 I. Some further promises relating to gospel-times. Here is a promise of
 the remission of sins 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:1">ver. 1</A>),

 of the reformation of manners

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:2">ver. 2</A>),

 and particularly of the convicting and silencing of false prophets, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:2-6">ver. 2-6</A>.

 II. A clear prediction of the sufferings of Christ and the dispersion
 of his disciples thereupon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:7">ver. 7</A>),

 of the destruction of the greater part of the Jewish nation not long 
 after 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:8">ver. 8</A>),

 and of the purifying of a remnant of them, a peculiar people to God, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:9">ver. 9</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of
 David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for
 uncleanness.
 &nbsp; 2 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of
 hosts, <I>that</I> I will cut off the names of the idols out of the
 land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will cause
 the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.
 &nbsp; 3 And it shall come to pass, <I>that</I> when any shall yet
 prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say
 unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and his father and his mother that begat him shall
 thrust him through when he prophesieth.
 &nbsp; 4 And it shall come to pass in that day, <I>that</I> the prophets
 shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath
 prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive:
 &nbsp; 5 But he shall say, I <I>am</I> no prophet, I <I>am</I> a husbandman;
 for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth.
 &nbsp; 6 And <I>one</I> shall say unto him, What <I>are</I> these wounds in
 thine hands? Then he shall answer, <I>Those</I> with which I was
 wounded <I>in</I> the house of my friends.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Behold the Lamb of God <I>taking away the sin of the world,</I> the sin 
 of the church; for <I>therefore</I> was the Son of God manifested, to 
 <I>take away our sin,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:5">1 John iii. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He takes away the guilt of sin by the blood of his cross 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):
 
 <I>In that day,</I> in the gospel-day, <I>there shall be a fountain 
 opened,</I> that is, provision made for the cleansing of all those from 
 the pollutions of sin who truly repent and are sorry for them. <I>In 
 that day,</I> when the Spirit of grace is poured out to set them a 
 mourning for their sins, they shall not mourn as those who have no 
 hope, but they shall have their sins pardoned, and the comfort of their 
 pardon in their bosoms. Their consciences shall be purified and
 pacified by the <I>blood of Christ, which cleanses from all sin,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:7">1 John i. 7</A>.

 For Christ is exalted to give both repentance and remission of sins;
 and where he gives the one no doubt he gives the other. This 
 <I>fountain opened</I> is the pierced side of Jesus Christ, spoken of 
 just before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:10"><I>ch.</I> xii. 10</A>),

 for thence came there out <I>blood and water,</I> and both for
 cleansing. And those who <I>look upon Christ pierced,</I> and mourn for 
 their sins that pierced him, and are therefore in bitterness for him, 
 may look again upon Christ pierced and rejoice in him, because it 
 pleased the Lord thus to smite this rock, that it might be to us a 
 <I>fountain of living waters.</I> See here, 

 1. How we are polluted; we are all so; we have sinned, and sin is
 uncleanness; it defiles the mind and conscience, renders us odious to 
 God and uneasy in ourselves, unfit to be employed in the service of God 
 and admitted into communion with him, as those who were ceremonially 
 unclean were shut out of the sanctuary. The <I>house of David</I> and 
 the <I>inhabitants of Jerusalem</I> are under <I>sin,</I> which is 
 uncleanness. The truth is, we are all <I>as an unclean thing,</I> and 
 deserve to have our portion with the unclean. 

 2. How we may be purged. Behold, there is fountain opened for us to
 wash in, and there are streams flowing to us from that fountain, so 
 that, if we be not made clean, it is our own fault. The blood of 
 Christ, and God's pardoning mercy in that blood, revealed in the new 
 covenant, are,

 (1.) A fountain; for there is in them an inexhaustible fulness. There 
 is mercy enough in God, and merit enough in Christ, for the forgiving 
 of the greatest sins and sinners, upon gospel-terms. <I>Such were some 
 of you, but you are washed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:11">1 Cor. vi. 11</A>.

 Under the law there were a brazen laver and a brazen sea to wash in; 
 those were but vessels, but we have a fountain to ourselves, 
 overflowing, ever-flowing.

 (2.) <I>A fountain opened;</I> for, whoever will, may come and take the
 benefit of it; it is opened, not only to <I>the house of David,</I> but 
 to <I>the inhabitants of Jerusalem,</I> to the poor and mean as well as 
 to the rich and great; or it is opened for all believers, who, as the 
 spiritual seed of Christ, are of the house of David, and, as living 
 members of the church, are inhabitants of Jerusalem. Through Christ all 
 that believe are justified, are <I>washed from their sins in his 
 blood,</I> that they may be <I>made to our God kings and priests,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:5,6">Rev. i. 5, 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He takes away the dominion of sin by the power of his grace, even 
 of beloved sins. This evermore accompanies the former; those that are 
 washed in the fountain opened, as they are justified, so they are 
 sanctified; the water came with the blood out of the pierced side of 
 Christ. It is here promised that in that day, 

 1. Idolatry shall be quite abolished and the people of the Jews shall
 be effectually cured of their inclination to it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land.</I> The 
 worship of the idols of their fathers shall be so perfectly rooted out 
 that in one generation or two it shall be forgotten that ever there 
 were such idols among them; they shall either not be named at all or 
 not with any respect; <I>they shall no more be remembered,</I> as was 
 promised, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:17">Hos. ii. 17</A>.

 This was fulfilled in the rooted aversion which the Jews had, after the
 captivity, to idols and idolatry, and still retain to this day; it was 
 fulfilled also in the ready conversion of many to the faith of Christ, 
 by which they were taken off from making an idol of the ceremonial law, 
 as the unbelieving Jews did; and it is still in the fulfilling when 
 souls are brought off from the world and the flesh, those two great 
 idols, that they may cleave to God only.

 2. False prophecy shall also be brought to an end: <I>I will cause the
 prophets and the unclean spirit,</I> the prophets that are under the 
 influence of the unclean spirit, to <I>pass out of the land.</I> The 
 devil is an <I>unclean</I> spirit; sin and uncleanness are from him; he 
 has his prophets, that serve his interests and receive their 
 instructions from him. Take away the unclean spirit, and the prophets 
 would not deceive as they do; take away the false prophets that produce 
 sham commissions, and the unclean spirit could not do the mischief he 
 does. When God designs the silencing of the false prophets he banishes 
 the unclean spirit out of the land, that wrought in them, and was a 
 rival with him for the throne in the heart. The church of the Jews,
 when they were addicted to idols, did also dote much upon false 
 prophets, who flattered them in their sins with promises of impunity 
 and peace; but here it is promised, as a blessed effect of the promised 
 reformation, that they should be very much set against false prophets, 
 and zealous to clear the land of them; they were so after the 
 captivity, till, through the blindness of their zeal against false 
 prophets, they had put Christ to death under that character, and, after 
 that, there arose many <I>false Christs and false prophets, and 
 deceived many,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:11">Matt. xxiv. 11</A>.
 
 It is here foretold,

 (1.) That false prophets, instead of being indulged and favoured, 
 should be brought to condign punishment even by their nearest 
 relations, which would be as great an instance as any of flagrant zeal 
 against those deceivers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>When any shall</I> set up for a prophet, and shall <I>speak lies in
 the name of the Lord,</I> shall preach that which tends to draw people
 from God and to confirm them in sin, his own parents shall be the first
 and most forward to prosecute him for it, according to the law. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:6-11">Deut. xiii. 6-11</A>,

 "<I>If thy son entice thee secretly</I> from God, <I>thou shalt surely
 kill him.</I> Show thy indignation against him, and prevent any further 
 temptation from him." His <I>father and his mother shall thrust him 
 through when he prophesies.</I> Note, We ought to conceive, and always 
 to retain, a very great detestation and dread of every thing that would 
 draw us out of the way of our duty into by-paths, as those who cannot 
 <I>bear that which is evil,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:22">Rev. ii. 2</A>.
 
 And holy zeal for God and godliness will make us hate sin, and dread 
 temptation, most in those whom naturally we love best, and who are 
 nearest to us; there our danger is greatest, as Adam's from Eve, Job's 
 from his wife; and there it will be the most praiseworthy to show our 
 zeal, as Levi, who, in the cause of God, did not <I>acknowledge his 
 brethren,</I> nor <I>know his own children,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:9">Deut. xxxiii. 9</A>.

 Thus we must hate and forsake our nearest relations when they come in
 competition with our duty to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:26">Luke xiv. 26</A>.

 Natural affections, even the strongest, must be over-ruled by gracious 
 affections. 

 (2.) That false prophets should be themselves convinced of their sin
 and folly, and let fall their pretensions

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>The prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision;</I> they
 shall not repeat it, or insist upon it, but desire that it may be 
 forgotten and no more said of it, being ready themselves to own it was 
 a sham, because God has by his grace awakened their consciences and 
 shown them their error, or because the event disproves their 
 predictions, and gives them the lie, or because their prophecies do not 
 meet with such a favourable reception as they used to meet with, but 
 are generally despised and distasted; they perceive the people ashamed 
 of them, which makes them begin to be ashamed of themselves. And 
 therefore they shall no longer <I>wear a rough garment,</I> or 
 <I>garment of hair,</I> as the true prophets used to do, in imitation 
 of Elijah, and in token of their being mortified to the pleasures and 
 delights of sense." The pretenders had appeared in the habit of true 
 prophets; but, their folly being now made manifest, they shall lay it 
 aside, no more to deceive and impose upon unthinking unwary people by 
 it. A modest dress is a very good thing, if it be the genuine 
 indication of a humble heart, and is to instruct; but it is a bad thing 
 if it be the hypocritical disguise of a proud ambitious heart, and is 
 to deceive. Let men be really as good as they seem to be, but not seem 
 to be better than really they are. This pretender, as a true penitent, 
 
 [1.] Shall undeceive those whom he had imposed upon: <I>He shall say, 
 "I am no prophet,</I> as I have pretended to be, was never designed nor 
 set apart to the office, never educated nor brought up for it, never 
 conversant among the sons of the prophets. <I>I am a husbandman,</I> 
 and was bred to that business; I was never taught of God to prophesy, 
 but <I>taught of man to keep cattle</I>" Amos was originally such a one 
 too, and yet was afterwards called to be a prophet, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:14,15">Amos vii. 14, 15</A>.

 But this deceiver never had any such call. Note, Those who sorrow
 after a godly sort for their having deceived others will be forward to 
 confess their sin, and will be so just as to rectify the mistakes which 
 they have been the cause of. Thus those who had <I>used curious 
 arts,</I> when they were converted <I>showed their deeds,</I> and by 
 what fallacies they had cheated the people,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:18">Acts xix. 18</A>.

 [2.] He shall return to his own proper employment, which is the fittest
 for him: <I>I will be a husbandman</I> (so it may be read); "I will 
 apply myself to my calling again, and meddle no more with things that 
 belong not to me; for <I>man taught me to keep cattle from my 
 youth,</I> and cattle I will again keep, and never set up for a 
 preacher any more." Note, When we are convinced that we have gone out 
 of the way of our duty we must evince the truth of our repentance by 
 returning to it again, though it be the severest mortification to us.

 [3.] He shall acknowledge those to be his friends who by a severe 
 discipline were instrumental to bring him to a sight of his error,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 When he who with the greatest assurance had asserted himself so lately 
 to be a prophet suddenly drops his claims, and says, I am no prophet, 
 every body will be surprised at it, and some will ask, "<I>What are 
 these wounds,</I> or marks of stripes, <I>in thy hands?</I> how camest 
 thou by them? Hast thou not been <I>examined by scourging?</I> And is 
 not that it that has brought thee to thyself?" (<I>Vexatio dat 
 intellectum--Vexation sharpens the intellect.</I>) "Hast thou not been 
 beaten into this acknowledgment? Was it not the rod and reproof that
 gave thee this wisdom?" And he shall own, "Yes, it was; these are the 
 <I>wounds with which I was wounded in the house of my friends,</I> who 
 bound me, and used me hardly and severely, as a distracted man, and so 
 brought me to my senses." By this it appears that those parents of the 
 false prophet that <I>thrust him through</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 did not do it till they had first tried to reclaim him by correction, 
 and he would not be reclaimed; for so was the law concerning a 
 disobedient son--his parents must first have chastened him in vain 
 before they were allowed to bring him forth to be stoned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:18,19">Deut. xxi. 18, 19</A>.

 But here is another who was reduced by stripes, and so prevented the
 capital punishment; and he had the sense and honesty to own that they 
 were his friends, his real friends, who thus wounded him, that they 
 might reclaim him; for <I>faithful are the wounds of a friend,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:6">Prov. xxvii. 6</A>.

 Some good interpreters, observing how soon this comes after the mention 
 of Christ's being pierced, think that these are the words of that great 
 prophet, not of the false prophet spoken of before. Christ was wounded
 in his hands, when they were nailed to the cross, and, after his 
 resurrection, he had the marks of these wounds; and here he tells how 
 he came by them; he received them as a false prophet, for the chief 
 priests called him a deceiver, and upon that account would have him 
 crucified; but he received them in the house of his friends--the Jews, 
 who should have been his friends; for <I>he came to his own,</I> and, 
 though they were his bitter enemies, yet he was pleased to call them 
 his <I>friends,</I> as he did Judas (<I>Friend, wherefore hast thou 
 come?</I>) because they forwarded his sufferings for him; as he called 
 Peter <I>Satan--an adversary,</I> because he dissuaded him from 
 them.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is a prophecy,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Of the sufferings of Christ, of him who was to be pierced, and was 
 to be the fountain opened. <I>Awake, O sword! against my Shepherd,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 These are the words of God the Father, giving order and commission to 
 the sword of his justice to awake against his Son, when he had 
 voluntarily made his soul an offering for sin; for <I>it pleased the 
 Lord to bruise him</I> and <I>put him to grief;</I> and <I>he was 
 stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:4,10">Isa. liii. 4, 10</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. How he calls him. "As God, he is <I>my fellow;</I>" for he thought
 it <I>no robbery to be equal with God.</I> He and <I>the Father</I> are 
 <I>one.</I> He was from eternity by him, as one brought up with him, 
 and, in the work of man's redemption, he was his elect, in whom his 
 soul delighted, and the counsel of peace was between them both. "As 
 Mediator, he is <I>my Shepherd,</I> that great and good Shepherd that 
 undertook to feed the flock,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:7"><I>ch.</I> xi. 7</A>.

 He is the Shepherd that was to lay down his life for the sheep. 

 2. How he uses him: <I>Awake, O sword! against him.</I> If he will be
 a sacrifice, he must be slain, for without the shedding of blood, the
 life-blood, there was no remission. Men thrust him through as the good
 Shepherd (compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 that he might <I>purchase the flock of God</I> with <I>his own
 blood,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:28">Acts xx. 28</A>.

 It is not a charge given to a rod to correct him, but to a sword to 
 slay him; for <I>Messiah the prince must be cut off, but not for 
 himself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:26">Dan. ix. 26</A>.

 It is not the sword of war that receives this charge, that he may die 
 in the bed of honour, but the sword of justice, that he may die as a 
 criminal, upon an ignominious tree. This sword must awake against him; 
 he having no sin of his own to answer for, the sword of justice had 
 nothing to say to him of itself, till, by particular order from the 
 Judge of all, it was warranted to brandish itself against him. He was
 the Lamb <I>slain from the foundation of the world,</I> in the decree 
 and counsel of God; but the sword designed against him had long 
 slumbered, till now at length it is called upon to awake, not, "Awake, 
 and smite him; strike home; not with a drowsy blow, but an awakened 
 one;" for God <I>spared not his own Son.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Of the dispersion of the disciples thereupon: <I>Smite the 
 Shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.</I> This our Lord Jesus 
 himself declares to have been fulfilled when <I>all his disciples were 
 offended because of him</I> in the night wherein he was betrayed, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:31,Mk+14:27">Matt. xxvi. 31; Mark xiv. 27</A>.

 They all <I>forsook him and fled.</I> The smiting of the Shepherd is
 the scattering of the sheep. They were <I>scattered every one to his 
 own, and left him alone,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:32">John xvi. 32</A>.

 Herein they were like timorous sheep; yet the Shepherd thus provided
 for their safety, for he said, <I>If you seek me, let these go their 
 way.</I> Some make another application of this; Christ was the 
 <I>Shepherd</I> of the Jewish nation; he was smitten; they themselves 
 smote him, and therefore they were justly scattered abroad, and 
 dispersed among the nations, and remain so at this day. These words, 
 <I>I will turn my hand upon the little ones,</I> may be understood 
 either as a threatening (as Christ suffered, so shall his disciples, 
 they shall <I>drink of the cup that he drank of</I> and be <I>baptized 
 with the baptism that he was baptized</I> with) or as a promise that 
 God would gather Christ's scattered disciples together again, and he 
 should give them the meeting in Galilee. Though the little ones among 
 Christ's soldiers may be dispersed, they shall rally again; the lambs 
 of his flock, though frightened by the beasts of prey, shall recover 
 themselves, shall be gathered in his arms and laid in his bosom. 
 Sometimes, when the sheep are scattered and lost in the wilderness, yet 
 the little ones, which, it was feared, would be a prey

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:31">Num. xiv. 31</A>),

 are brought in, are brought home, and God turns his hand upon them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Of the rejection and ruin of the unbelieving Jews 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 and this word has, and shall have, its accomplishment, in the 
 destruction of the corrupt and hypocritical part of the church. <I>It 
 shall come to pass that in all the land of Israel two parts shall be 
 cut off and die.</I> The Roman army laid the country waste, and slew at 
 least two-thirds of the Jews. Some understand by the <I>cutting 
 off,</I> and <I>dying,</I> or <I>two parts</I> in all <I>the earth,</I> 
 the abolishing of heathenism and Judaism, that Christianity, the third 
 part, might be left to reign alone. The Jewish worship was quite taken 
 away by the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple. And, some time 
 after, Pagan idolatry was in a manner extirpated, when the empire 
 became Christian.</P>

 IV. Of the reformation and preservation of the chosen remnant, those of 
 them that believed, and the Christian church in general 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>The third part shall be left.</I> When Jerusalem and Judea were 
 destroyed, all the Christians in that country, having among them the 
 warning Christ gave them to <I>flee to the mountains,</I> shifted for 
 their own safety, and were sheltered in a city called <I>Pella,</I> on 
 the other side Jordan. We have here first the trials and then the 
 triumphs of the Christian church, and of all the faithful members of 
 it. 

 1. Their trials: <I>I will bring</I> that <I>third part through the 
 fire</I> of affliction. <I>and will refine</I> and <I>try them</I> as 
 <I>silver and gold are refined and tried.</I> This was fulfilled in the 
 persecutions of the primitive church, the <I>fiery trial</I> which 
 tried the people of God then, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:12">1 Pet. iv. 12</A>.

 Those whom God sets apart for himself must pass through a probation and
 purification in this world; they must be <I>tried</I> that <I>their 
 faith</I> may be <I>found to praise and honour</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:6,7">1 Pet. i. 6, 7</A>),

 as Abraham's faith was when it was tried by the command given him to
 offer up Isaac, <I>Now know I that thou fearest me.</I> They must be 
 tried, that both those that are perfect and those that are not may be 
 <I>made manifest.</I> They must be refined from their dross; their 
 corruption must be purged out; they must be brightened and bettered. 

 2. Their triumphs.

 (1.) Their communion with God is their triumph: <I>They shall call on 
 my name, and I will hear them.</I> They write to God by prayer, and 
 receive from him answers of peace, and thus keep up a comfortable 
 communion with him. <I>This honour have all his saints.</I>

 (2.) Their covenant with God is their triumph: "<I>I will say, It is my 
 people,</I> whom I have chosen and loved, and will own; <I>and they 
 shall say, the Lord is my God,</I> and a God all-sufficient to me; and 
 in me they shall boast every day and all the day long. <I>This God is 
 our God for ever and ever.</I>"</P>
