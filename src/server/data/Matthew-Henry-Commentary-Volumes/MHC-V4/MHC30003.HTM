 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 A stupid, senseless, heedless people, are, in this chapter, called upon 
 to take notice, 

 I. Of the judgments of God denounced against them and the warnings he
 gave them of those judgments, and to be hereby awakened out of their 
 security, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>.

 II. Of the sins that were found among them, by which God was provoked
 thus to threaten, thus to punish, that they might justify God in his 
 controversy with them, and, unless they repented and reformed, might 
 expect no other than that God should proceed in his controversy,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Hear this word that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath spoken against you, O
 children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up
 from the land of Egypt, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 You only have I known of all the families of the earth:
 therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.
 &nbsp; 3 Can two walk together, except they be agreed?
 &nbsp; 4 Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a
 young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?
 &nbsp; 5 Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no gin <I>is</I>
 for him? shall <I>one</I> take up a snare from the earth, and have
 taken nothing at all?
 &nbsp; 6 Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be
 afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath not done
 <I>it?</I>
 &nbsp; 7 Surely the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> will do nothing, but he revealeth his
 secret unto his servants the prophets.
 &nbsp; 8 The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> hath
 spoken, who can but prophesy?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The scope of these verses is to convince the people of Israel that God
 had a controversy with them. That which the prophet has to say to them 
 is to let them know that the Lord has something to say against them, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 They were his peculiar people above others, knew his name, and were 
 called by it; <I>nevertheless he had something against them,</I> and 
 they were called to hear what it was, that they might consider what 
 answer they should make, as the prisoner at the bar is told to hearken 
 to his indictment. The <I>children of Israel</I> would not regard the 
 words of counsel and comfort that God had many a time spoken to them, 
 and now they shall be made to hear the word of reproof and threatening 
 that the Lord has spoken against them; for he will act as he has 
 spoken.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Let them know that the gracious cognizance God has taken of them, 
 and the favours he has bestowed upon them, should not exempt them from 
 the punishment due to them for their sins. Israel is a <I>family</I> 
 that <I>God brought up out of the land of Egypt,</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 and it was no more than a family when it went down thither; thence God 
 delivered it; thence he fetched it to be a family to himself. It is not 
 only the ten tribes, the kingdom of Israel, that must take notice of 
 this, but that of Judah also, for it is spoken against the whole 
 <I>family</I> that God <I>brought up out of Egypt.</I> It is a family 
 that God has bestowed distinguishing favours upon, has owned in a 
 peculiar manner. <I>You only have I known of all the families of the
 earth.</I> Note, God's church in the world is a family dignified above 
 all the families of the earth. Those that know God are known of him. 
 <I>In Judah is God known,</I> and therefore Judah is more than any 
 people known of God. God has <I>known</I> them, that is, he has chosen
 them, covenanted with them, and conversed with them as his 
 acquaintance. Now, one would think, it should follow, "Therefore I will 
 spare you, will connive at your faults, and excuse you." No: 
 <I>Therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.</I> Note, The 
 distinguishing favours of God to us, if they do not serve to restrain 
 us from sin, shall not serve to exempt us from punishment; nay, the 
 nearer any are to God in profession, and the kinder notice he has taken 
 of them, the more surely, the more quickly, and the more severely will 
 he reckon with them, if they by a course of wilful sin profane their 
 character, disgrace their relation to him, violate their engagements, 
 and put a slight upon the favours and honours with which they have been 
 distinguished. <I>Therefore</I> they shall be punished, because their 
 sins dishonour him, affront him, and grieve him, more than the sins of 
 others, and because it is necessary that God should vindicate his own 
 honour by making it appear that he hates sin and hates it most in those 
 that are nearest to him; if they be but as bad as others, they shall be 
 punished worse than others, because it is justly expected that they 
 should be so much better than others. <I>Judgment begins at the house 
 of God,</I> begins at the sanctuary; for God will be sanctified either 
 by or upon those that <I>come nigh unto him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+10:3">Lev. x. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Let them know that they could not expect any comfortable communion 
 with God unless they first made their peace with him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Can two walk together except they be agreed?</I> No; how should 
 they? Where there is not friendship there can be no fellowship; if two 
 persons be at variance, they must first accommodate the matters in 
 difference between them before there can be any interchanging of good 
 offices. Israel has affronted God, had broken their covenant with him,
 and ill-requited his favours to them; and yet they expected that he 
 should continue to walk with them, should take their part, act for 
 them, and give them assurances of his presence with them, though they 
 took no care by repentance and reformation to <I>agree with their 
 adversary</I> and to turn away his wrath. "But how can that be?" says 
 God. "While you continue to <I>walk contrary to God</I> you can look 
 for no other than that he should <I>walk contrary to you,</I>" 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:23,24">Lev. xxvi. 23, 24</A>.

 Note, We cannot expect that God should be present with us, or act for 
 us, unless we be reconciled to him. God and man cannot <I>walk together 
 except they be agreed.</I> Unless we agree with God in our end, which 
 is his glory, we cannot walk with him by the way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Let them know that the warnings God gave them of judgments 
 approaching were not causeless and groundless, merely to amuse them, 
 but certain declarations of the wrath of God against them, which (if 
 they did not speedily repent) they would infallibly feel the effects of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>Will a lion roar in the forest when he has no prey</I> in view? No: 
 he roars upon his prey. Nor will a <I>young lion cry out of his den</I> 
 if the old lion <I>have taken nothing</I> to bring home to him; nor 
 would God thus give you warning both by the threatenings of his word, 
 and by less judgments, if you had not by your sins made yourselves a 
 prey to his wrath, nor if he were not really about to fall upon you 
 with desolating destroying judgments." Note, The threatenings of the 
 word and providence of God are not bugbears, to frighten children and 
 fools, but are certain inferences from the sin of man and certain 
 presages of the judgments of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Let them know that, as their own wickedness was the procuring cause 
 of these judgments, so they shall not be removed till they have done 
 their work, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 When God has come forth to contend with a sinful people it is necessary 
 that they should understand, 

 1. That it is their own sin that has entangled them; for <I>can a bird
 fall in a snare upon the earth where no gin is for him?</I> No, nature 
 does not lay snares for the creatures, but the art of men; a bird is 
 not taken in a snare by chance, but with the fowler's design; so the 
 providence of God prepares trouble for sinners, and it is <I>in the 
 work of their own hands</I> that they <I>are snared.</I> Affliction 
 does not <I>spring out of the dust,</I> but it is God's justice, and 
 <I>our own wickedness,</I> that <I>correct us.</I> 

 2. It is nothing but their own repentance that can disentangle them;
 for <I>shall one take up a snare from the earth,</I> which he laid with 
 design, except he have <I>taken something</I> as he designed? So 
 neither will God remove the affliction he has sent till it have done 
 its work and accomplished that for which he sent it. If our hearts be 
 duly humbled, and we are brought by our afflictions to confess and 
 forsake our sins, then the snare has taken something, then the point is 
 gained, the end is answered, and then, and not till then, the <I>snare 
 is broken,</I> is taken up from the earth, and <I>we are delivered</I> 
 in love and mercy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Let them know that all their troubles came from the hand of God's 
 providence and from the counsel of his will 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Shall there be evil in a city,</I> in a family, in a nation, <I>and 
 the Lord has not done it,</I> appointed it, and performed what he 
 appointed? The evil of sin is from ourselves; it is our own doing. But 
 the evil of trouble, personal or public, is from God, and is his doing; 
 whoever are the instruments, God is the principal agent. <I>Out of his 
 mouth both evil and good proceed.</I> This consideration, that, 
 whatever evil is in the city, the Lord has done it, should engage us 
 patiently to bear our share in public calamities and to study to answer 
 God's intention in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Let them know that their prophets, who give them warning of 
 judgments approaching, deliver nothing to them but what they have 
 <I>received from the Lord</I> to be delivered to his people. 

 1. God makes it known beforehand to the prophets

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Surely the Lord Jehovah will do nothing,</I> none of that evil in 
 the city spoken of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 <I>but he reveals it to his servants the prophets,</I> though to others 
 it is a secret. Therefore those know not what they do who make light of 
 the warnings which the prophets give them, in God's name. Observe,
 God's prophets are <I>his servants,</I> whom he employs to go on his 
 errands to the children of men. The <I>secret</I> of God is with them; 
 it is in some sense with all <I>the righteous</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:32">Prov. iii. 32</A>),

 with <I>all that fear God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+25:14">Ps. xxv. 14</A>),

 but in a peculiar manner with the prophets, to whom the Spirit of
 prophecy is a Spirit of revelation. It would have put honour enough 
 upon prophets if it had been only said that sometimes God is pleased to 
 reveal to his prophets what he designs to do, but it speaks something 
 very great to say that he <I>does nothing</I> but what he <I>reveals to 
 them,</I> as if they were <I>the men of his counsel. Shall I hide from 
 Abraham,</I> who is a prophet, <I>the thing which I do?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:17">Gen. xviii. 17</A>.
 
 God will therefore be sure to reckon with those that put contempt on
 the prophets, whom he puts this honour upon. 

 2. The prophets cannot but make that known to the people which God has
 made known to them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>The Lord God has spoken; who can but prophesy?</I> His prophets, to 
 whom he has spoken in secret by dreams and visions, cannot but speak in 
 public to the people what they have heard from God. They are so full of 
 those things themselves, so well assured concerning them, and so much 
 affected with them, that they cannot but speak of them; for <I>out of 
 the abundance of the heart</I> the mouth will speak. <I>I believed; 
 therefore have I spoken,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:20">Acts iv. 20</A>.

 Nay, and besides the prophetic impulse which went along with the
 inspiration, and made the word <I>like a fire in their bones</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+20:9">Jer. xx. 9</A>),

 they received a command from God to deliver what they had been charged
 with; and they would have been false to their trust if they had not
 done it. <I>Necessity was laid upon them,</I> as upon the preachers of
 the gospel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:16">1 Cor. ix. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. Let them know that they ought to tremble before God upon the fair 
 warning he had given them, as they would, 

 1. Upon the sounding of a trumpet, to give notice of the approach of
 the enemy, that all may stand upon their guard and stand to their arms: 
 <I>Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people be not 
 afraid,</I> or <I>run together?</I> so some read it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Will they not immediately come together in a fright, to consider what 
 is best to be done for the common safety? Yet when God by his prophets 
 gives them notice of their danger, and summons them to come and enlist 
 themselves under his banner, it makes no impression; they will sooner 
 give credit to a watchman on their walls than to a prophet sent of God, 
 will sooner obey the summons of the governor of their city than the 
 orders given them by the Governor of the world. God says, <I>Hearken to 
 the voice of the trumpet;</I> but <I>they will not hearken,</I> nay, 
 and they tell him plainly that they will not, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:17">Jer. vi. 17</A>.

 2. Upon the roaring of a lion. God is sometimes <I>as a lion, and a
 young lion, to the house of Judah,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:14">Hos. v. 14</A>.

 The lion roars before he tears; thus God warns before he wounds. If
 therefore the lion roars upon a poor traveller (as he did against 
 Samson,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+14:5">Judg. xiv. 5</A>),

 he cannot but be put into great consternation; yet the <I>Lord roars
 out of Zion</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+1:2"><I>ch.</I> i. 2</A>),

 and none are afraid, but they go on securely as if they were in no
 danger. Note, The fair warning given to a careless world, if it be not
 taken, will aggravate its condemnation another day. The lion roared, 
 and they were not moved with fear to prepare an ark. O the amazing 
 stupidity of an unbelieving world, that will not be wrought upon, no, 
 not by the <I>terrors of the Lord!</I></P>

 of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the children
 of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a

 G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, the God of hosts,
 &nbsp; 14 That in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of
 Israel upon him I will also visit the altars of Bethel: and the
 horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground.

 the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The Israelites are here again convicted and condemned, and particular 
 notice given of the crimes they are convicted of and the punishment 
 they are condemned to.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Notice is given of it to their neighbours. The prophet is ordered to 
 <I>publish it in the palaces of Ashdod,</I> one of the chief cities of 
 the Philistines; nay, the summons must go further, even to <I>the 
 palaces in the land of Egypt.</I> "The great men of both those nations, 
 that dwell in the palaces, that are inquisitive concerning the affairs 
 of the neighboring nations, and are conversant with the public 
 intelligence, let them <I>assemble themselves upon the mountains of 
 Samaria,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 There, upon <I>a throne high and lifted up,</I> the judgment is set. 
 Samaria is the criminal that is to be tried; let them be present at the 
 trial, for it shall be (as other trials are) public, in the face of the 
 country; let them make an appointment to meet there from all parts, to 
 judge between God and his vineyard. God appeals to all impartial 
 righteous men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:45">Ezek. xxiii. 45</A>.

 They will all subscribe to the equity of his proceedings when they see
 how the case stands. Note, God's controversies with sinners do not fear 
 a scrutiny; even Philistines and Egyptians will be made to see, and 
 say, that <I>the ways of the Lord are equal,</I> but <I>our ways are 
 unequal.</I> They are likewise summoned to attend, not only that they 
 may justify God and be witness for him that he deals fairly, but that 
 they may themselves take warning; for, if <I>judgment begin at the 
 house of God,</I> as they see it does, what shall be the end of those 
 that are strangers to him? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:17">1 Pet. iv. 17</A>.

 <I>If this be done in a green tree, what shall be done in a dry?</I> Or
 this intimates that the sin of Israel had been so notorious that the 
 neighboring nations could come in witnesses against them, and therefore 
 it was fit that their punishment should be so. "If it could have been 
 concealed, we would have said, <I>Tell it not in Gath; publish it not 
 in the streets of Ashkelon;</I>" but why should their friends consult 
 their reputation, when they themselves do not consult it? If they have 
 grown impudent in sin, let them bear the shame: "<I>Publish</I> it in 
 <I>Ashdod,</I> in <I>Egypt.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Let them see how black the charge is, and how well proved. Let them 
 observe the behaviour of the inhabitants of Samaria; let them look off 
 from the adjacent hills, and they may see how rude and boisterous they 
 are, and hear how loud they cry of their sin is, as was that of Sodom. 
 
 (1.) Look into their streets and you will see nothing but riot and 
 disorder, <I>great tumults in the midst thereof;</I> reason and justice 
 are upon all occasions run down by the noise and fury of an outrageous 
 mob, the dominion of which is the sin and shame of any people, and is 
 likely to be their ruin. 

 (2.) Look into their prisons, and you will see them filled with injured 
 innocents: <I>The oppressed are in the midst thereof,</I> thrown down 
 and crushed by their oppressors, overpowered and overwhelmed, and 
 <I>they had no comforter,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+4:1">Eccl. iv. 1</A>.

 (3.) Look into their courts of justice, and you will see that those who 
 preside in those courts <I>know not to do right,</I> because they have 
 always been accustomed to do wrong; they act as if they had no notion 
 at all of the thing called justice, are in no care to do justice 
 themselves nor to see that others do justice. 

 (4.) Look into their treasures and stores, and you will see them 
 replenished with <I>violence and robbery,</I> with that which was 
 unjustly got and is still unjustly kept. Thus <I>they have heaped 
 treasures together for the last days,</I> but it will prove a 
 <I>treasure of wrath against the day of wrath.</I> It may well be said, 
 Those <I>know not to do right</I> who think to enrich themselves by 
 doing wrong.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Let them see how heavy the doom is, and how well executed, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Their country shall be invaded and ruined; and observe how the 
 punishment answers to the sin. 

 [1.] <I>Great tumults</I> are <I>in the midst of the land,</I> and 
 therefore <I>an adversary shall be even round about the land;</I> the 
 Assyrian forces shall surround it and break in upon it on every side. 
 Note, When sin is harboured and indulged in the midst of a people they 
 can expect no other than that adversaries should be round about them, 
 so that, go which way they will, they go into the mouth of danger, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:43">Luke xix. 43</A>.

 [2.] They strengthened themselves in their wickedness, but the enemy 
 shall <I>bring down their strength</I> from them, that strength which 
 they abused in oppressing the poor, and doing violence to all about 
 them. Note, That power which is made an instrument of unrighteousness
 will justly be brought down and broken.

 [3.] They <I>stored up robbery in their palaces,</I> and therefore 
 their <I>palaces shall be spoiled;</I> for what is got and kept 
 wrongfully will not be kept long. Even palaces will be no protection to 
 fraud and oppression; but the greatest of men, if they have spoiled 
 others, shall themselves be spoiled, for <I>the Lord is the avenger of 
 all such.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Their countrymen shall not escape, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 They shall be in the hands of the enemy, as a lamb in the mouth of a 
 lion, all devoured and eaten up, and they shall be utterly unable to 
 make an resistance; and if any do make their escape, so as neither to 
 fall by the sword or go into captivity, yet they shall be very few, and 
 those of the meanest and least considerable, like <I>two legs,</I> or 
 <I>shanks,</I> of a lamb, <I>or,</I> it may be, <I>a piece of an 
 ear,</I> which the lion drops, or <I>the shepherd</I> takes from him, 
 when he has eaten the whole body; so, perhaps, here and there one may 
 escape from Samaria and from Damascus, when the king of Assyria shall 
 fall upon them both, but none to make any account of; and those that do 
 escape shall do so with the utmost difficult and hazard, by hiding 
 themselves in the <I>corner of a bed</I> or under the <I>bed's 
 feet,</I> which intimates that their spirits shall sneak shamefully in 
 the time of danger. They shall not hide themselves in dens and caves, 
 but in the <I>corner of a bed,</I> or the <I>piece of a bed,</I> such 
 as poor people must be content with. They shall very narrowly escape,
 as it is foretold concerning the last destruction of Jerusalem that 
 there shall be <I>two in a bed together, one taken and the other 
 left.</I> Note, When God's judgments come forth against a people with 
 commission it will be in vain to think of escaping them. Some make 
 their <I>dwelling in the corner of a bed,</I> and <I>in a couch,</I> to 
 denote their present security and sensuality; they are at ease, as 
 <I>in a bed,</I> or <I>on a couch,</I> but, when God comes to contend 
 with them, he shall make them uneasy, shall take them away out of the 
 bed of their sloth and slumber. Those that stretch themselves lazily 
 upon their couches when God's judgments are abroad shall <I>go captive 
 with the first that go captive.</I></P>

 II. Notice is given of it to themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Let this be <I>testified,</I> and <I>heard, in the house of Jacob,</I> 
 among all the seed of Israel, for it is spoken by <I>the Lord God, the 
 God of hosts,</I> who has authority to pass this sentence and ability 
 to execute it; let them know from him that the day is at hand when God 
 will <I>visit the transgressions of Israel upon him,</I> when he will 
 enquire into them and reckon for them: there will come <I>a day of 
 visitation,</I> a day of punishment, and in that day all those things 
 they are proud of, and put confidence in, shall fail them, and so they 
 shall smart for the sins they have been guilty of about them. 

 1. Woe to <I>their altars,</I> for God will <I>visit</I> them. He will
 enquire into the sins they have been guilty of at their altars, and 
 bring into the account all their superstition and idolatry, all their 
 expenses on their false gods, and all their expectations from them; and 
 he will lay the altars themselves under the marks of his displeasure, 
 for <I>the horns of the altar shall be cut off,</I> and <I>fall to the 
 ground,</I> and with them the altar itself demolished and broken to 
 pieces. We find the altar at Bethel prophesied against

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:2">1 Kings xiii. 2</A>),

 and immediately <I>rent</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and that prophecy fulfilled with <I>Josiah burnt men's bones upon 
 it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:15,16">2 Kings xxiii. 15, 16</A>.

 This seconds that prophecy, and seems to point at the same event. Note,
 If men will not destroy idolatrous altars, God will, and those with 
 them that had them in veneration. Some make <I>the horns of the 
 altar</I> to signify all those things which they flee to for refuge, 
 and trust in, and which they make their sanctuary: they shall all be 
 cut off, so that they shall have nothing to take hold of.

 2. Woe to their houses, for God will visit them too. He will enquire
 into the sins they have been guilty of in their houses, the robbery 
 that have stored up in their houses, and the luxury in which they 
 lived: <I>and I will smite the winter-house with the summer-house,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Their nobility, and gentry, and rich merchants, had their winter-houses 
 in the city and their summer-houses in the country, so nice were they 
 in guarding against the inconveniences of the winter when the country 
 was thought too cold, and of the summer when the city was thought too 
 hot, though the climate of that good land was so temperate, like that 
 of ours, that neither the cold nor heat was ever in extremity. They 
 indulged a foolish affectation of change and variety; but God will, 
 either by war or by the earthquake, smite both the winter-house and the 
 summer-house; neither shall serve to shelter them from his judgments. 
 <I>The houses of ivory</I> (so called because the ceiling, or wainscot, 
 or some of the ornaments of them, were edged or inlaid with ivory) 
 <I>shall perish,</I> shall be burnt or pulled down; <I>and the great 
 houses shall have an end;</I> the most splendid and spacious houses, 
 the houses of their great men, shall no longer be, or at least be no 
 longer theirs. Note, The pomp or pleasantness of men's houses will be 
 so far from fortifying them against God's judgments that it will make 
 them the more grievous and vexatious, as their extravagance about them 
 will be put to the score of their sins and follies.</P>
