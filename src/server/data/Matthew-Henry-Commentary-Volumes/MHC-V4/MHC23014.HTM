 In this chapter, 

 I. More weight is added to the burden of Babylon, enough to sink it
 like a mill-stone; 

 I. It is Israel's cause that is to be pleaded in this quarrel with
 Babylon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 2. The king of Babylon, for the time being, shall be remarkably brought
 down and triumphed over, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:4-20">ver.  4-20</A>.

 3. The whole race of the Babylonians shall be cut off and extirpated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:21-23">ver. 21-23</A>.

 II.  A confirmation of the prophecy of the destruction of Babylon,
 which was a thing at a distance, is here given in the prophecy of the
 destruction of the Assyrian army that invaded the land, which happened
 not long after,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:24-27">ver. 24-27</A>.

 III. The success of Hezekiah against the Philistines is here foretold,
 and the advantages which his people would gain thereby,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:28-32">ver.  28-32</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose
 Israel, and set them in their own land: and the strangers shall
 be joined with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob.
 &nbsp; 2  And the people shall take them, and bring them to their
 place: and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> for servants and handmaids: and they shall take them
 captives, whose captives they were; and they shall rule over
 their oppressors.
 &nbsp; 3  And it shall come to pass in the day that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall give
 thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard
 bondage wherein thou wast made to serve,
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This comes in here as the reason why Babylon must be overthrown and 
 ruined, because God has mercy in store for his people, and therefore, 

 1. The injuries done to them must be reckoned for and revenged upon
 their persecutors. Mercy to Jacob will be wrath and ruin to Jacob's 
 impenitent implacable adversaries, such as Babylon was. 

 2. The yoke of oppression which Babylon had long laid on their necks
 must be broken off, and they must be set at liberty; and, in order to 
 this, the destruction of Babylon is as necessary as the destruction of 
 Egypt and Pharaoh was to their deliverance out of that house of 
 bondage. The same prediction is a promise to God's people and a 
 threatening to their enemies, as the same providence has a bright side 
 towards Israel and a black or dark side towards the Egyptians.  
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The ground of these favours to Jacob and Israel--the kindness God had
 for them and the choice he had made of them 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 "<I>The Lord will have mercy on Jacob,</I> the seed of Jacob now 
 captives in Babylon; he will make it to appear that he has compassion 
 on them and has mercy in store for them, and that he will not contend 
 for ever with them, but <I>will yet choose them,</I> will yet again 
 return to them; though he has seemed for a time to refuse and reject 
 them, he will show that they are his chosen people and that the 
 election stands sure." However it may seem to us, God's mercy is not 
 gone, nor does his promise fail, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+77:8">Ps.  lxxvii. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The particular favours he designed them. 

 1. He would bring them back to their native soil and air again: The 
 <I>Lord will set them in their own land,</I> out of which they were 
 driven. A settlement in the holy land, the land of promise, is a fruit 
 of God's mercy, distinguishing mercy. 

 2. Many should be proselyted to their holy religion, and should return
 with them, induced to do so by the manifest tokens of God's favourable 
 presence with them, the operations of God's grace in them, the 
 operations of God's grace in them, and his providence for them: 
 <I>Strangers shall be joined with them,</I> saying, <I>We will go with 
 you, for we have heard that God is with you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:23">Zech. viii. 23</A>.

 It adds much to the honour and strength of Israel when strangers are
 joined with them and there are added to the church many from without, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:47">Acts ii. 47</A>.

 Let not the church's children be shy of strangers, but receive those 
 whom God receives, and own those who cleave to the house of Jacob.

 3. These proselytes should not only be a credit to their cause, but 
 very helpful and serviceable to them in their return home: <I>The 
 people</I> among whom they live <I>shall take them,</I> take care of 
 them, take pity on them, and shall <I>bring them to their place</I>--as 
 friends, loth to part with such good company--as servants, willing to 
 do them all the good offices they could. God's people, wherever their 
 lot is cast, should endeavour thus, by all the instances of an 
 exemplary and winning conversation, to gain an interest in the 
 affections of those about them, and recommend religion to their good 
 opinion. This was fulfilled in the return of the captives from Babylon, 
 when all that were about them, pursuant to Cyrus's proclamation, 
 contributed to their removal 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:4,6">Ezra i. 4, 6</A>),

 not as the Egyptians, because they were sick of them, but because they 
 loved them.

 4. They should have the benefit of their service when they had returned
 home, for many would of choice go with them in the meanest post, rather 
 than not go with them: They <I>shall possess them in the land of the 
 Lord for servants and handmaids;</I> and as the laws of that land saved 
 it from being the purgatory of servants, providing that they should not 
 be oppressed, so the advantages of that land made it the paradise of 
 those servants that had been strangers to the covenants of promise, for 
 there was <I>one law to the stranger and to those that were born in the 
 land.</I> Those whose lot is cast in the land of the Lord, a land of 
 light, should take care that their servants and handmaids may share in 
 the benefit of it, who will then find it better to be possessed in the 
 Lord's land than possessors in any other. 

 5. They should triumph over their enemies, and those that would not be 
 reconciled to them should be reduced and humbled by them: <I>They shall 
 take those captives whose captives they were and shall rule over their 
 oppressors,</I> righteously, but not revengefully. The Jews perhaps 
 bought Babylonian prisoners out of the hands of the Medes and Persians 
 and made slaves of them. Or this might have its accomplishment in their 
 victories over their enemies in the times of the Maccabees. It is 
 applicable to the success of the gospel (when those were brought into 
 obedience to it who had made the greatest opposition to it, as Paul) 
 and to the interest believers have in Christ's victories over their 
 spiritual enemies, when he led captivity captive, to the power they 
 gain over their own corruptions, and to the dominion the upright shall 
 have in the morning, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:14">Ps. xlix. 14</A>.

 6. They should see a happy termination of all their grievances

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>The Lord shall give thee rest from thy sorrow and thy fear, and from
 thy hard bondage.</I> God himself undertakes to work a blessed change, 
 
 (1.) In their state. They shall have rest from their bondage; the days
 of their affliction, though many, shall have an end; and the rod of the 
 wicked, though it lie long, shall not always lie on their lot. 

 (2.) In their spirit. They shall have rest from their sorrow and fear, 
 sense of their present burdens and dread of worse. Sometimes fear puts 
 the soul into a ferment as much as sorrow does, and those must needs 
 feel themselves very easy to whom God has given rest from both. Those 
 who are freed from the bondage of sin have a foundation laid for true 
 rest from sorrow and fear.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of
 Babylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city
 ceased!
 &nbsp; 5  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath broken the staff of the wicked, <I>and</I> the
 sceptre of the rulers.
 &nbsp; 6  He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he
 that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, <I>and</I> none
 hindereth.
 &nbsp; 7  The whole earth is at rest, <I>and</I> is quiet: they break forth
 into singing.
 &nbsp; 8  Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, <I>and</I> the cedars of
 Lebanon, <I>saying,</I> Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up
 against us.
 &nbsp; 9  Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet <I>thee</I> at thy
 coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, <I>even</I> all the chief
 ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the
 kings of the nations.
 &nbsp; 10  All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become
 weak as we? art thou become like unto us?
 &nbsp; 11  Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, <I>and</I> the noise of
 thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover
 thee.
 &nbsp; 12  How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the
 morning! <I>how</I> art thou cut down to the ground, which didst
 weaken the nations!
 &nbsp; 13  For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into
 heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit
 also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the
 north:
 &nbsp; 14  I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be
 like the most High.
 &nbsp; 15  Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the
 pit.
 &nbsp; 16  They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, <I>and</I>
 consider thee, <I>saying, Is</I> this the man that made the earth to
 tremble, that did shake kingdoms;
 &nbsp; 17  <I>That</I> made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the
 cities thereof; <I>that</I> opened not the house of his prisoners?
 &nbsp; 18  All the kings of the nations, <I>even</I> all of them, lie in
 glory, every one in his own house.
 &nbsp; 19  But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable
 branch, <I>and as</I> the raiment of those that are slain, thrust
 through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a
 carcase trodden under feet.
 &nbsp; 20  Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou
 hast destroyed thy land, <I>and</I> slain thy people: the seed of
 evildoers shall never be renowned.
 &nbsp; 21  Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their
 fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill
 the face of the world with cities.
 &nbsp; 22  For I will rise up against them, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts,
 and cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and
 nephew, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 23  I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools
 of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction,
 saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The kings of Babylon, successively, were the great enemies and 
 oppressors of God's people, and therefore the destruction of Babylon, 
 the fall of the king, and the ruin of his family, are here particularly 
 taken notice of and triumphed in. In the day that God has given Israel 
 rest they shall <I>take up this proverb against the king of 
 Babylon.</I> We must not rejoice when our enemy falls, as ours; but 
 when Babylon, the common enemy of God and his Israel, sinks, then 
 <I>rejoice over her, thou heaven, and you holy apostles and 
 prophets,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:20">Rev. xviii. 20</A>.

 The Babylonian monarchy bade fair to be an absolute, universal, and 
 perpetual one, and, in these pretensions, vied with the Almighty; it is 
 therefore very justly, not only brought down, but insulted over when it 
 is down; and it is not only the last monarch, Belshazzar, who <I>was 
 slain on that night</I> that Babylon was taken 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:30">Dan. v. 30</A>),

 who is here triumphed over, but the whole monarchy, which sunk in him; 
 not without special reference to Nebuchadnezzar, in whom that monarchy 
 was at its height. Now here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The fall of the king of Babylon is rejoiced in; and a most curious 
 and elegant composition is here prepared, not to adorn his hearse or 
 monument, but to expose his memory and fix a lasting brand of infamy 
 upon it. It gives us an account of the life and death of this mighty 
 monarch, how he <I>went down slain to the pit,</I> though he had been 
 <I>the terror of the mighty in the land of the living,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:27">Ezek. xxxii. 27</A>.

 In this parable we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The prodigious height of wealth and power at which this monarch and 
 monarchy arrived. Babylon was a <I>golden city,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>

 (it is a Chaldee word in the original, which intimates that she used to 
 call herself so), so much did she abound in riches and excel all other 
 cities, as gold does all other metals. She is <I>gold-thirsty,</I> or 
 an exactress of gold (so some read it); for how do men get wealth to 
 themselves but by squeezing it out of others? The New Jerusalem is the 
 only truly golden city, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:18,21">Rev. xxi. 18, 21</A>.

 The king of Babylon, having so much wealth in his dominions and the 
 absolute command of it, by the help of that <I>ruled the nations</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 gave them law, read them their doom, and at his pleasure <I>weakened 
 the nations</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 that they might not be able to make head against him. Such vast and 
 victorious armies did he bring into the field, that, which way soever 
 he looked, he <I>made the earth to tremble, and shook kingdoms</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:16"><I>v.</I>  16</A>);

 all his neighbours were afraid of him, and were forced to submit to 
 him. No one man could do this by his own personal strength, but by the 
 numbers he has at his beck. Great tyrants, by making some do what they 
 will, make others suffer what they will. How piteous is the case of 
 mankind, which thus seems to be in a combination against itself, and 
 its own rights and liberties, which could not be ruined but by its own 
 strength!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The wretched abuse of all this wealth and power, which the king of 
 Babylon was guilty of, in two instances:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Great oppression and cruelty. He is known by the name of the 
 <I>oppressor</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 he has <I>the sceptre of the rulers</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:5"><I>v.</I>  5</A>),

 has the command of all the princes about him; but it is <I>the staff of 
 the wicked,</I> a staff with which he supports himself in his 
 wickedness and wickedly strikes all about him. <I>He smote the 
 people,</I> not in justice, for their correction and reformation, but 
 <I>in wrath</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 to gratify his own peevish resentments, and that <I>with a continual 
 stroke,</I> pursued them with his forces, and gave them no respite, no 
 breathing time, no cessation of arms. He ruled the nations, but he 
 ruled them <I>in anger,</I> every thing he said and did was in a 
 passion; so that he who had the government of all about him had no 
 government of himself. He <I>made the world as a wilderness,</I> as if 
 he had taken a pride in being the plague of his generation and a curse 
 to mankind, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Great princes usually glory in building cities, but he gloried in 
 destroying them; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:6">Ps. ix. 6</A>.

 Two particular instances, worse than all the rest, are here given of 
 his tyranny:--
 
 [1.] That he was severe to his captives

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 He <I>opened not the house of his prisoners;</I> he <I>did not let them 
 loose homeward</I> (so the margin reads it); he kept them in close 
 confinement, and never would suffer any to return to their own land.  
 This refers especially to the people of the Jews, and it is that which 
 fills up the measure of the king of Babylon's iniquity, that he had 
 detained the people of God in captivity and would by no means release 
 them; nay, and by profaning the vessels of God's temple at Jerusalem, 
 did in effect say that they should never return to their former use, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:3">Dan. v. 3</A>.

 For this he was quickly and justly turned out by one whose first act 
 was to open the house of God's prisoners and send home the temple 
 vessels. 
 
 [2.] That he was oppressive to his own subjects

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>Thou hast destroyed thy land, and slain thy people;</I> and what did 
 he get by that, when the wealth of the land and the multitude of the 
 people are the strength and honour of the prince, who never rules so 
 safely, so gloriously, as in the hearts and affections of the people? 
 But tyrants sacrifice their interests to their lusts and passions; and 
 God will reckon with them for their barbarous usage of those who are 
 under their power, whom they think they may use as they please.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Great pride and haughtiness. Notice is here taken of his 
 <I>pomp,</I> the extravagancy of his retinue, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 He affected to appear in the utmost magnificence. But that was not the 
 worst: it was the temper of his mind, and the elevation of that, that 
 ripened him for ruin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>):

 <I>Thou has said in thy heart,</I> like Lucifer, <I>I will ascend into 
 heaven.</I> Here is the language of his vainglory, borrowed perhaps 
 from that of the angels who fell, who not content with their first 
 estate, the post assigned them, would vie with God, and become not only 
 independent of him, but equal with him. Or perhaps it refers to the 
 story of Nebuchadnezzar, who, when he would be more than a man, was 
 justly turned into a brute, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:30">Dan. iv. 30</A>.

 The king of Babylon here promises himself,

 [1.] That in pomp and power he shall surpass all his neighbours, and 
 shall arrive at the very height of earthly glory and felicity, that he 
 shall be as great and happy as this world can make him; that is the 
 heaven of a carnal heart, and to that he hopes to ascend, and to be as 
 far above those about him as the heaven is above the earth. Princes are 
 the stars of God, which give some light to this dark world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:29">Matt. xxiv. 29</A>);
 
 but he will exalt his throne above them all.  

 [2.] That he shall particularly insult over God's Mount Zion, which 
 Belshazzar, in his last drunken frolic, seems to have had a particular 
 spite against when he called for the vessels of the temple at 
 Jerusalem, to profane them; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:2">Dan. v. 2</A>.

 In the same humour he here said, <I>I will sit upon the mount of the 
 congregation</I> (it is the same word that is used for the holy 
 <I>convocations), in the sides of the north;</I> so Mount Zion is said 
 to be situated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:2">Ps. xlviii. 2</A>.

 Perhaps Belshazzar was projecting an expedition to Jerusalem, to 
 triumph in the ruins of it, at the time when God cut him off. 

 [3.] That he shall vie with the God of Israel, of whom he had indeed 
 heard glorious things, that he had his residence <I>above the heights 
 of the clouds.</I> "But thither," says he, "<I>will I ascend,</I> and 
 be as great as he; I will be like him whom they call <I>the Most 
 High.</I>" It is a gracious ambition to covet to be like the Most Holy, 
 for he has said, <I>Be you holy, for I am holy;</I> but it is a sinful 
 ambition to aim to be like the Most High, for he has said, <I>He that 
 exalteth himself shall be abased,</I> and the devil drew our first 
 parents in to eat forbidden fruit by promising them that they should be 
 as gods. 

 [4.] That he shall himself be deified after his death, as some of the 
 first founders of the Assyrian monarchy were, and stars had even their 
 names from them.  "But," says he, "<I>I will exalt my throne above 
 them</I> all." Such as this was his pride, which was the undoubted omen 
 of his destruction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The utter ruin that should be brought upon him. It is foretold, 

 (1.) That his wealth and power should be broken, and a final period put 
 to his pomp and pleasure. He has been long an oppressor, but he shall 
 cease to be so,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Had he ceased to be so by true repentance and reformation, according to 
 the advice Daniel gave to Nebuchadnezzar, it might have been a 
 lengthening of his life and tranquillity. But those that will not cease 
 to sin God will make to cease. "<I>The golden city,</I> which one would 
 have thought might continue for ever, <I>has ceased;</I> there is an 
 end of that Babylon. <I>The Lord,</I> the righteous God, <I>has broken 
 the staff of that wicked prince,</I> broken it over his head, in token 
 of the divesting him of his office.  God has taken his power from him, 
 and rendered him incapable of doing any more mischief: he has broken 
 the sceptres; for even these are brittle things, soon broken and often 
 justly." 
 
 (2.) That he himself should be seized: <I>He is persecuted</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 violent hands are laid upon him, and none hinders. It is the common 
 fate of tyrants, when they fall into the power of their enemies, to be 
 deserted by their flatterers, whom they took for their friends. We read 
 of another enemy like this, of whom it is foretold that <I>he shall 
 come to his end and none shall help him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:45">Dan. xi. 45</A>.

 Tiberius and Nero thus saw themselves abandoned.

 (3.) That he should be slain, and <I>go down to the congregation of the 
 dead,</I> to be <I>free among them, as the slain that are no more 
 remembered,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+88:5">Ps. lxxxviii. 5</A>.

 He shall be <I>weak as the dead</I> are, and <I>like unto them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 His <I>pomp is brought down to the grave</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 that is, it perishes with him; the pomp of his life shall not, as 
 usual, end in a funeral pomp. True glory (that is, true grace) will go 
 up with the soul to heaven, but vain pomp will go down with the body to 
 the grave: there is an end of it. <I>The noise of his viols</I> is now 
 heard no more. Death is a farewell to the pleasures, as well as to the 
 pomps, of this world.  This mighty prince, that used to lie on a bed of 
 down, to tread upon rich carpets, and to have coverings and canopies 
 exquisitely fine, now shall have the <I>worms spread under him and the 
 worms covering him,</I> worms bred out of his own putrefied body, 
 which, though he fancied himself a god, proved him to be made of the 
 same mould with other men.  When we are pampering and decking our 
 bodies it is good to remember they will be worms'-meat shortly. 

 (4.) That he should not have the honour of a burial, much less of a 
 decent one and in the sepulchres of his ancestors. <I>The kings of the 
 nations lie in glory</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 either their dead bodies themselves so embalmed as to be preserved from 
 putrefaction, as of old among the Egyptians, or their effigies (as with 
 us) erected over their graves.  Thus, as if they would defy the 
 ignominy of death, they lay in a poor faint sort of glory, <I>every one 
 in his own house,</I> that is, his own burying-place (for the grave is 
 the house appointed for all living), a sleeping house, where the busy 
 and troublesome will lie quiet and the troubled and weary lie at rest. 
 But this king of Babylon is <I>cast out</I> and has no grave 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);
 
 his dead body is thrown, like that of a beast, into the next ditch or 
 upon the next dunghill, <I>like an abominable branch</I> of some 
 noxious poisonous plant, which nobody will touch, or as the clothes of 
 malefactors put to death and by the hand of justice <I>thrust through 
 with a sword,</I> on whose dead bodies heaps of stones are raised, or 
 they are thrown into some deep quarry among <I>the stones of the 
 pit.</I> Nay, the king of Babylon's dead body shall be as the carcases 
 of those who are slain in a battle, which are <I>trodden under feet</I> 
 by the horses and soldiers and crushed to pieces. Thus he <I>shall not 
 be joined with his ancestors in burial,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 To be denied decent burial is a disgrace, which, if it be inflicted for 
 righteousness' sake (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:2">Ps. lxxix. 2</A>),

 may, as other similar reproaches, be rejoiced in 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:12">Matt.  v. 12</A>);

 it is the lot of the two witnesses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:9">Rev. xi. 9</A>.

 But if, as here, it be the just punishment of iniquity, it is an 
 intimation that evil pursues impenitent sinners beyond death, greater 
 evil than that, and that they shall <I>rise to everlasting shame and 
 contempt.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The many triumphs that should be in his fall.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Those whom he had been a great tyrant and terror to will be glad 
 that they are rid of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 Now that he is gone <I>the whole earth is at rest and is quiet,</I> for 
 he was the great disturber of the peace; now they all <I>break forth 
 into singing,</I> for <I>when the wicked perish there is shouting</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+11:10">Prov. xi. 10</A>);

 the fir-trees and cedars of Lebanon now think themselves safe; there is 
 no danger now of their being cut down, to make way for his vast armies 
 or to furnish him with timber.  The neighbouring princes and great men, 
 who are compared to fir-trees and cedars 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:2">Zech.  xi. 2</A>),

 may now be easy, and out of fear of being dispossessed of their rights, 
 for <I>the hammer of the whole earth is cut asunder and broken</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:23">Jer. l. 23</A>),

 the axe that <I>boasted itself against him that hewed with it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:15"><I>ch.</I>  x. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The congregation of the dead will bid him welcome to them, 
 especially those whom he had barbarously hastened thither 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>):
 
 "<I>Hell from beneath is moved for thee, to meet thee at thy 
 coming,</I> and to compliment thee upon thy arrival at their dark and 
 dreadful regions." <I>The chief ones of the earth,</I> who when they 
 were alive were kept in awe by him and durst not come near him, but 
 rose from their thrones, to resign them to him, shall upbraid him with 
 it when he comes into the state of the dead. They shall go forth to 
 meet him, as they used to do when he made his public entry into cities 
 he had become master of; with such a parade shall he be introduced into 
 those regions of horror, to make his disgrace and torment the more 
 grievous to him. They shall scoffingly rise from their thrones and 
 seats there, and ask him if he will please to sit down in them, as he 
 used to do in their thrones on earth? The confusion that will then 
 cover him they shall make a jest of: "<I>Hast thou also become weak as 
 we?</I> Who would have thought it? It is what thou thyself didst not 
 expect it would ever come to when thou wast in every thing too hard for 
 us. Thou that didst rank thyself among the immortal gods, art thou come 
 to take thy fate among us poor mortal men? Where is thy pomp now, and 
 where thy mirth? <I>How hast thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer! son of 
 the morning!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 The king of Babylon shone as brightly as the morning star, and fancied 
 that wherever he came he brought day along with him; and has such an 
 illustrious prince as this fallen, such a star become a clod of clay? 
 Did ever any man fall from such a height of honour and power into such 
 an abyss of shame and misery?" This has been commonly alluded to (and 
 it is a mere allusion) to illustrate the fall of the angels, who were 
 as morning stars 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:7">Job xxxviii. 7</A>),

 but <I>how have they fallen! How art thou cut down to the ground,</I> 
 and levelled with it, that <I>didst weaken the nations!</I> God will 
 reckon with those that invade the rights and disturb the peace of 
 mankind, for he is King of nations as well as of saints. Now this 
 reception of the king of Babylon into the regions of the dead, which is 
 here described, surely is something more than a flight of fancy, and is 
 designed to teach these solid truths:--

 [1.] That there is an invisible world, a world of spirits, to which the 
 souls of men remove at death and in which they exist and act in a state 
 of separation from the body.  

 [2.] That separate souls have acquaintance and converse with each 
 other, though we have none with them: the parable of the rich man and 
 Lazarus intimates this. 

 [3.] That death and hell will be death and hell indeed to those that 
 fall unsanctified from the height of this world's pomps and the fulness 
 of its pleasures.  <I>Son, remember,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:25">Luke  xvi. 25</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Spectators will stand amazed at his fall. When he shall be 
 <I>brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit,</I> and be lodged 
 there, <I>those that see him shall narrowly look upon him, and consider 
 him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>);

 they shall scarcely believe their own eyes. "Never was death so great a 
 change to any man as it is to him. Is it possible that a man, who a few 
 hours ago looked so great, so pleasant, and was so splendidly adorned 
 and attended, should now look so ghastly, so despicable, and lie thus 
 naked and neglected? <I>Is this the man that made the earth to tremble 
 and shook kingdoms?</I> Who could have thought he should ever come to 
 this?" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:7">Ps.  lxxxii. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Here is an inference drawn from all this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>The seed of evil-doers shall never be renowned.</I> The princes of 
 the Babylonian monarchy were all a seed of evil-doers, oppressors of 
 the people of God, and therefore they had this infamy entailed upon 
 them. <I>They shall not be renowned for ever</I> (so some read it); 
 they may look big for a time, but all their pomp will only render their 
 disgrace at last the more shameful. There is no credit in a sinful 
 way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The utter ruin of the royal family is here foretold, together with 
 the desolation of The royal city.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The royal family is to be wholly extirpated. The Medes and Persians, 
 that are to be employed in this destroying work, are ordered, when they 
 have slain Belshazzar, to <I>prepare slaughter for his children</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:21"><I>v.</I>  21</A>)

 and not to spare them. The little ones of Babylon must be <I>dashed 
 against the stones,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:9">Ps. cxxxvii. 9</A>.

 These orders sound very harshly; but,

 (1.) They must suffer <I>for the iniquity of their fathers,</I> which 
 is often <I>visited upon the children,</I> to show how much God hates 
 sin and is displeased at it, and to deter sinners from it, which is the 
 end of punishment. Nebuchadnezzar had slain Zedekiah's sons 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:10">Jer.  lii. 10</A>),

 and, for that iniquity of his, his seed are paid in the same coin.

 (2.) They must be cut off now, that they <I>may not rise up to possess 
 the land</I> and do as much mischief in their day as their fathers had 
 done in theirs--that they may not be as vexatious to the world by 
 building cities for the support of their tyranny (which was Nimrod's 
 policy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:10,11">Gen. x. 10, 11</A>)

 as their ancestors had been by destroying cities. Pharaoh oppressed 
 Israel in Egypt by setting them to build cities, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+1:11">Exod. i. 11</A>.

 The providence of God consults the welfare of nations more than we are 
 aware of by cutting off some who, if they had lived, would have done 
 mischief. Justly may the enemies cut off the children: <I>For I will 
 rise up against them, saith the Lord of hosts</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 and if God reveal it as his mind that he will have it done, as none can 
 hinder it, so none need scruple to further it.  Babylon perhaps was 
 proud of the numbers of her royal family, but God had determined to 
 <I>cut off the name and remnant</I> of it, so that none should be left, 
 to have both the sons and grandsons of the king slain; and yet we are 
 sure he never did, nor ever will do, any wrong to any of his 
 creatures.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The royal city is to be demolished and deserted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 It shall be a possession for solitary frightful birds, particularly 
 <I>the bittern,</I> joined with the cormorant and the owl,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:11"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 11</A>.

 And thus the utter destruction of the New-Testament Babylon is
 illustrated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:2">Rev.  xviii. 2</A>.

 It <I>has become a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.</I> Babylon 
 lay low, so that when it was deserted, and no care taken to drain the 
 land, it soon became <I>pools of water,</I> standing noisome puddles, 
 as unhealthful as they were unpleasant: and thus God <I>will sweep it 
 with the besom of destruction.</I> When a people have nothing among 
 them but dirt and filth, and will not be made clean with the besom of 
 reformation, what can they expect but to be swept off the face of the 
 earth with the besom of destruction?</P>

 The destruction of Babylon and the Chaldean empire was a thing at a 
 great distance; the empire had not risen to any considerable height 
 when its fall was here foretold: it was almost 200 years from this 
 prediction of Babylon's fall to the accomplishment of it. Now the 
 people to whom Isaiah prophesied might ask, "What is this to us, or 
 what shall we be the better for it, and what assurance shall we have of 
 it?" To both questions he answers in these verses, by a prediction of
 the ruin both of the Assyrians and of the Philistines, the present 
 enemies that infested them, which they should shortly be eye-witnesses 
 of and have benefit by. These would be a present comfort to them, and a 
 pledge of future deliverance, for the confirming of the faith of their 
 posterity. God is to his people the same to day that he was yesterday 
 and will be hereafter; and he will for ever be the same that he has 
 been and is. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Assurance given of the destruction of the Assyrians 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>I will break the Assyrian in my land.</I> Sennacherib brought a very 
 formidable army into the land of Judah, but there God broke it, broke 
 all his regiments by the sword of a destroying angel. Note, Those who 
 wrongfully invade God's land shall find that it is at their peril: and 
 those who with unhallowed feet trample upon his holy mountains shall 
 themselves there be trodden under foot. God undertakes to do this 
 himself, his people having no might against the great company that came 
 against them: "<I>I will break the Assyrian;</I> let me alone to do it 
 who have angels, hosts of angels, at command." Now the breaking of the 
 power of the Assyrian would be the breaking of the yoke from off the 
 neck of God's people: <I>His burden shall depart from off their 
 shoulders,</I> the burden of quartering that vast army and paying 
 contribution; <I>therefore</I> the Assyrian must be broken, that Judah 
 and Jerusalem may be eased. Let those that make themselves a yoke and a 
 burden to God's people see what they are to expect. Now, 

 1. This prophecy is here ratified and confirmed by an oath

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>The Lord of hosts hath sworn,</I> that he might show the 
 immutability of his counsel, and that his people may have strong 
 consolation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:17,18">Heb. vi. 17, 18</A>.

 What is here said of this particular intention is true of all God's 
 purposes: <I>As I have thought, so shall it come to pass;</I> for <I>he
 is in one mind, and who can turn him?</I> Nor is he ever put upon new 
 counsels, or obliged to take new measures, as men often are when things 
 occur which they did not foresee. Let those who are <I>the called 
 according to God's purpose</I> comfort themselves with this, that, 
 <I>as God has purposed, so shall it stand,</I> and on that their 
 stability depends.

 2. The breaking of the Assyrian power is made a specimen of what God
 would do with all the powers of the nations that were engaged against 
 him and his church

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:26"><I>v.</I>  26</A>):

 <I>This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth</I> 
 (<I>the whole world,</I> so the LXX.), <I>all the inhabitants of the 
 earth</I> (so the Chaldee), not only upon the Assyrian empire (which 
 was then reckoned to be in a manner all the world, as afterwards the 
 Roman empire was, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:1">Luke  ii. 1</A>,

 and with it many nations fell that had dependence upon it), but upon 
 all those states and potentates that should at any time attack his 
 land, his mountains. The fate of the Assyrian shall be theirs; they 
 shall soon find that they meddle to their own hurt.  Jerusalem, as it 
 was to the Assyrians, will be <I>to all people a burdensome stone; all 
 that burden themselves with it shall infallibly be cut to pieces by 
 it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:3,6">Zech. xii. 3, 6</A>.

 The same hand of power and justice that is now to be stretched out
 against the Assyrian for invading the people of God shall be 
 <I>stretched out upon all the nations</I> that do likewise. It is still 
 true, and will ever be so, <I>Cursed is he that curses God's 
 Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+24:9">Num. xxiv. 9</A>.
 
 God will be an enemy to his people's enemies,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:22">Exod.  xxiii. 22</A>.

 3. All the powers on earth are defied to change God's counsel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 "<I>The Lord of hosts has purposed</I> to break the Assyrian's yoke, 
 and every rod of the wicked laid upon the lot of the righteous; <I>and 
 who shall disannul this purpose?</I> Who can persuade him to recall it, 
 or find out a plea to evade it? <I>His hand is stretched out</I> to 
 execute this purpose; <I>and who has power</I> enough <I>to turn it 
 back</I> or to stay the course of his judgments?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Assurance is likewise given of the destruction of the Philistines 
 and their power. This burden, this prophecy, that lay as a load upon 
 them, to sink their state, came <I>in the year that king Ahaz died,</I> 
 which was the first year of Hezekiah's reign, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 When a good king came in the room of a bad one then this acceptable 
 message was sent among them. When we reform, then, and not till then, 
 we may look for good news from heaven. Now here we have, 

 1. A rebuke to the Philistines for triumphing in the death of king 
 Uzziah. He had been as a serpent to them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 had bitten them, had smitten them, had brought them very low,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+26:6">2 Chron. xxvi. 6</A>.

 He <I>warred against the Philistines, broke down their walls, and built 
 cities among them.</I> But when Uzziah died, or rather abdicated, it 
 was told with joy in Gath and <I>published in the streets of 
 Ashkelon.</I> It is inhuman thus to rejoice in our neighbour's fall. 
 But let them not be secure; for though when Uzziah was dead they made 
 reprisals upon Ahaz, and took many of the cities of Judah 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:18">2 Chron.  xxviii. 18</A>),

 yet <I>out of the root</I> of Uzziah <I>should come a cockatrice,</I> a 
 more formidable enemy than Uzziah was, even Hezekiah, the fruit of 
 whose government should be to them <I>a fiery flying serpent,</I> for 
 he should fall upon them with incredible swiftness and fury: we find he 
 did so. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:8">2 Kings xviii. 8</A>,

 <I>He smote the Philistines even to Gaza.</I> Note, If God remove one 
 useful instrument in the midst of his usefulness, he can, and will, 
 raise up others to carry on and complete the same work that they were 
 employed in and left unfinished.

 2. A prophecy of the destruction of the Philistines by famine and war.

 (1.) By famine,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 "When the people of God, whom the Philistines has wasted, and
 distressed, and impoverished, shall enjoy plenty again," and <I>the 
 first-born of their poor shall feed</I> (the poorest among them shall 
 have food convenient), then, as for the Philistines, God will kill 
 <I>their root with famine.</I> That which was their strength, and with 
 which they thought themselves established as the tree is by the root, 
 shall be starved and dried up by degrees, as those die that die by 
 famine; and thus <I>he shall slay the remnant:</I> those that escape 
 from one destruction are but reserved for another; and, when there are 
 but a few left, those few shall at length be cut off, for God will make 
 a full end. 

 (2.) By war. When <I>the needy</I> of God's people <I>shall lie down in 
 safety,</I> not terrified with the alarms of war, but delighting in the 
 songs of peace, then every gate and every city of the Philistines shall 
 be howling and crying

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),
 
 and there shall be a total dissolution of their state; for from Judea, 
 which lay north of the Philistines, <I>there shall come a smoke</I> (a 
 vast army raising a great dust, a smoke that shall be the indication of 
 a devouring fire at hand), <I>and none</I> of all that army <I>shall be 
 alone in his appointed times;</I> none shall straggle or be missing 
 when they are to engage; but they shall all be vigorous and unanimous 
 in attacking the common enemy, when the time appointed for the doing of 
 it comes. None of them shall decline the public service, as, in 
 Deborah's time, Reuben abode among the sheepfolds and Asher on the 
 sea-shore, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:16,17">Judg. v. 16, 17</A>.

 When God has work to do he will wonderfully endow and dispose men for 
 it.</P>

 III. The good use that should be made of all these events for the 
 encouragement of the people of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):

 <I>What shall one then answer the messengers of the nations?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. This implies, 

 (1.) That the great things God does for his people are, and cannot but 
 be, taken notice of by their neighbours; those among the heathen make 
 remarks upon them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+126:2">Ps. cxxvi. 2</A>.

 (2.) That messengers will be sent to enquire concerning them.  Jacob
 and Israel had long been a people distinguished from all others and 
 dignified with uncommon favours; and therefore some for good-will, 
 others for ill-will, and all for curiosity, are inquisitive concerning 
 them. 

 (3.) That it concerns us always to be ready to give a reason of the 
 hope that we have in the providence of God, as well as in his grace, in 
 answer to every one that asks it, <I>with meekness and fear,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:15">1 Pet.  iii. 15</A>.

 And we need go no further than the sacred truths of God's word for a 
 reason; for God, in all he does, is fulfilling the scripture.

 (4.) The issue of God's dealings with his people shall be so clearly 
 and manifestly glorious that any one, every one, shall be able to give 
 an account of them to those that enquire concerning them.  Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The answer which is to be given to the messengers of the nations is, 
 
 (1.) That God is and will be a faithful friend to his church and 
 people, and will secure and advance their interests. Tell them that 
 <I>the Lord has founded Zion.</I> This gives an account both of the 
 work itself that is done and of the reason of it. What is God doing in 
 the world, and what is he designing in all the revolutions of states 
 and kingdoms, in the ruin of some nations and the rise of others? He 
 is, in all this, founding Zion; he is aiming at the advancement of his 
 church's interests; and what he aims at he will accomplish. The 
 messengers of the nations, when they sent to enquire concerning 
 Hezekiah's successes against the Philistines, expected to learn by what 
 politics, counsels, and arts of war he carried his point; but they are 
 told that these successes were not owing to any thing of that nature, 
 but to the care God took of his church and the interest he had in it. 
 The Lord has founded Zion, and therefore the Philistines must fall. 
 
 (2.) That his church has and will have a dependence upon him: <I>The 
 poor of his people shall trust in it,</I> his poor people who have 
 lately been brought very low, even the poorest of them; they more than 
 others, for they have nothing else to trust to, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:12,13">Zeph. iii. 12, 13</A>.

 The <I>poor receive the gospel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:5">Matt. xi. 5</A>.

 They shall trust to this, to this great truth, that the Lord has 
 founded Zion; on this they shall build their hopes, and not on an arm 
 of flesh. This ought to give us abundant satisfaction as to public 
 affairs, that however it may go with particular persons, parties, and 
 interests, the church, having God himself for its founder and Christ 
 the rock for its foundation, cannot but stand firm. <I>The poor of his 
 people shall betake themselves to it</I> (so some read it), shall join 
 themselves to his church and embark in its interests; they shall concur 
 with God in his designs to establish his people, and shall wind up all 
 on the same plan, and make all their little concerns and projects bend 
 to that. Those that take God's people for their people must be willing 
 to take their lot with them and cast in their lot among them. Let the 
 messengers of the nations know that the poor Israelites, who trust in 
 God, having, like Zion, their foundation in the holy mountains 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+87:1">Ps.  lxxxvii. 1</A>),

 are like Zion, which <I>cannot be removed, but abides for ever</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+125:1">Ps.  cxxv. 1</A>),

 and therefore they will not fear what man can do unto them.</P>
