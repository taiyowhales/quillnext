 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter the prophet goes on faithfully to reprove sin and to 
 threaten God's judgments for it, and yet bitterly to lament both, as 
 one that neither rejoiced at iniquity nor was glad at calamities. 

 I. He here expresses his great grief for the miseries of Judah and
 Jerusalem, and his detestation of their sins, which brought those 
 miseries upon them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:1-11">ver. 1-11</A>.

 II. He justifies God in the greatness of the destruction brought upon
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:9-16">ver. 9-16</A>.

 III. He calls upon others to bewail the woeful case of Judah and
 Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:17-22">ver. 17-22</A>.

 IV. He shows them the folly and vanity of trusting in their own 
 strength or wisdom, or the privileges of their circumcision, or any 
 thing but God only,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of
 tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the
 daughter of my people!
 &nbsp; 2  Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring
 men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they
 <I>be</I> all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.
 &nbsp; 3  And they bend their tongues <I>like</I> their bow <I>for</I> lies: but
 they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they
 proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 4  Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in
 any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every
 neighbour will walk with slanders.
 &nbsp; 5  And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not
 speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies,
 <I>and</I> weary themselves to commit iniquity.
 &nbsp; 6  Thine habitation <I>is</I> in the midst of deceit; through deceit
 they refuse to know me, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 7  Therefore thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, Behold, I will melt
 them, and try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my
 people?
 &nbsp; 8  Their tongue <I>is as</I> an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit:
 <I>one</I> speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in
 heart he layeth his wait.
 &nbsp; 9  Shall I not visit them for these <I>things?</I> saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
 &nbsp; 10  For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and
 for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they
 are burned up, so that none can pass through <I>them;</I> neither can
 <I>men</I> hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens
 and the beast are fled; they are gone.
 &nbsp; 11  And I will make Jerusalem heaps, <I>and</I> a den of dragons; and
 I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet, being commissioned both to foretel the destruction coming 
 upon Judah and Jerusalem and to point out the sin for which that 
 destruction was brought upon them, here, as elsewhere, speaks of both 
 very feelingly: what he said of both came from the heart, and therefore 
 one would have thought it would reach to the heart.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He abandons himself to sorrow in consideration of the calamitous 
 condition of his people, which he sadly laments, a one that preferred 
 Jerusalem before his chief joy and her grievances before his chief 
 sorrows.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He laments the slaughter of the persons, the blood shed and the 
 lives lost 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 "<I>O that my head were waters,</I> quite melted and dissolved with
 grief, that so <I>my eyes</I> might be <I>fountains of tears,</I> 
 weeping abundantly, continually, and without intermission, still 
 sending forth fresh floods of tears as there still occur fresh 
 occasions for them!" The same word in Hebrew signifies both <I>the 
 eye</I> and <I>a fountain,</I> as if in this land of sorrows our eyes 
 were designed rather for weeping than seeing. Jeremiah wept much, and 
 yet wished he could weep more, that he might affect a stupid people and 
 rouse them to a due sense of the hand of God gone out against them.
 Note, It becomes us, while we are here in this vale of tears, to 
 conform to the temper of the climate and to sow in tears. <I>Blessed 
 are those that mourn, for they shall be comforted</I> hereafter; but 
 let them expect that while they are here the <I>clouds will still 
 return after the rain.</I> While we find our hearts such fountains of 
 sin, it is fit that our eyes should be fountains of tears. But 
 Jeremiah's grief here is upon the public account: he would <I>weep day 
 and night,</I> not so much for the death of his own near relations, but 
 <I>for the slain of the daughter of his people,</I> the multitudes of 
 his countrymen that fell by the sword of war. Note, When we hear of the 
 numbers of the slain in great battles and sieges we ought to be much 
 affected with the intelligence, and not to make a light matter of it; 
 yea, though they be not of the daughter of our people, for, whatever 
 people they are of, they are of the same human nature with us, and 
 there are so many precious lives lost, as dear to them as ours to us, 
 and so many precious souls gone into eternity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He laments the desolations of the country. This he brings in 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 for impassioned mourners are not often very methodical in their 
 discourses: "Not only for the towns and cities, but <I>for the 
 mountains, will I take up a weeping and wailing"</I> (not barren 
 mountains, but the fruitful hills with which Judea abounded), and for 
 <I>the habitations of the wilderness,</I> or rather <I>the pastures of 
 the plain,</I> that used to be <I>clothed with flocks</I> or <I>covered 
 over with corn,</I> and a goodly sight it was; but now <I>they are 
 burnt up</I> by the Chaldean army (which, according to the custom of 
 war, destroyed to the custom of war, destroyed the forage and carried 
 off all the cattle), so that no one dares to pass through them, for 
 fear of meeting with some parties of the enemy, no one cares to pass 
 through them, every thing looks so melancholy and frightful, no one has 
 any business to pass through them, for they <I>hear not the voice of 
 the cattle</I> there as usual, the bleating of the sheep and the lowing 
 of the oxen, that grateful music to the owners; nay, <I>both the fowl 
 of the heavens</I> and the <I>beasts have fled.</I> either frightened 
 away by the rude noises and terrible fires which the enemies make, or 
 forced away because there is no subsistence for them. Note, God has 
 many ways of turning <I>a fruitful land into barrenness for the 
 wickedness of those that dwell therein;</I> and the havoc war makes in 
 a country cannot but be for a lamentation to all tender spirits, for it 
 is a tragedy which destroys the stage it is acted on.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He abandons himself to solitude, in consideration of the scandalous 
 character and conduct of his people. Though he dwells in Judah where 
 God is known, in Salem where his tabernacle is, yet he is ready to cry 
 out, <I>Woe is me that I sojourn in Mesech!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+120:5">Ps. cxx. 5</A>.

 While all his neighbours are fleeing to the defenced cities, and
 Jerusalem especially, in dread of the enemies' rage

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:5,6"><I>ch.</I> iv. 5, 6</A>)

 he is contriving to retire into some desert, in detestation of his
 people's sin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>O that I had in the wilderness a lodging-place of wayfaring 
 men,</I> such a lonely cottage to dwell in as they have in the deserts 
 of Arabia, which are uninhabited, for travellers to repose themselves 
 in, <I>that I might leave my people and go from them!</I>" Not only 
 because of the ill usage they gave him (he would rather venture himself 
 among the wild beasts of the desert than among such treacherous 
 barbarous people), but principally because his <I>righteous soul was 
 vexed from day to day,</I> as Lot's was in Sodom, with the 
 <I>wickedness of their conversation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:7,8">2 Pet. ii. 7, 8</A>.

 This does not imply any intention or resolution that he had thus to
 retire. God had cut him out work among them, which he must not quit for 
 his own ease. We must not <I>go out of the world,</I> bad as it is,
 before our time. If he could not reform them, he could bear a
 testimony against them; if he could not do good to many, yet he might 
 to some. but it intimates the temptation he was in to leave them, 
 involves a threatening that they should be deprived of his ministry, 
 and especially expresses the holy indignation he had against their 
 abominable wickedness, which continued notwithstanding all the pains he 
 had taken with them to reclaim them. It made him even weary of his life 
 to see them dishonouring God as they did and destroying themselves. 
 Time was when the place which God had chosen to put his name there was 
 the desire and delight of good men. David, in a wilderness, longed to 
 be again in the courts of God's house; but now Jeremiah, in the courts 
 of God's house (for there he was when he said this), wishes himself in 
 a wilderness. Those have made themselves very miserable that have made
 God's people and ministers weary of them and willing to get from them. 
 Now, to justify his willingness to leave them, he shows,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What he himself had observed among them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He would not think of leaving them because they were poor and in 
 distress, but because they were wicked. 

 [1.] They were filthy: <I>They are all adulterers,</I> that is, the 
 generality of them are,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:8"><I>ch.</I> v. 8</A>.

 They all either practised this sin or connived at those that did.
 Lewdness and uncleanness constituted that crying sin of Sodom at which 
 righteous Lot was vexed in soul, and it is a sin that renders men 
 loathsome in the eyes of God and all good men; it makes men an 
 abomination. 

 [2.] They were false. This is the sin that is most enlarged upon here. 
 Those that had been unfaithful to their God were so to one another, and 
 it was a part of their punishment as well as their sin, for even those 
 that love to cheat, yet hate to be cheated. <I>First,</I> Go into
 their solemn meetings for the exercises of religion, for the 
 administration of justice, or for commerce--to church, to court, or to 
 the exchange--and they are <I>an assembly of treacherous men;</I> they 
 are so by consent, they strengthen one another's hands in doing any 
 thing that is perfidious. There they will cheat deliberately and 
 industriously, with design, with a malicious design, for

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)
 
 <I>they bend their tongues, like their bow, for lies,</I> with a great 
 deal of craft; their tongues are fitted for lying, as a bow that is 
 bent is for shooting, and are as constantly used for that purpose. 
 Their tongue turns as naturally to a lie as the bow to the strong. 
 <I>But they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth.</I> Their 
 tongues are like a bow strung, with which they might do good service if 
 they would use the art and resolution which they are so much masters of 
 in the cause of truth; but they will not do so. They appear not in 
 defence of the truths of God, which were delivered to them by the 
 prophets; but even those that could not deny them to be truths were 
 content to see them run down. In the administration of justice they 
 have not courage to stand by an honest cause that has truth on its 
 side, if greatness and power be on the other side. Those that will be 
 faithful to the truth must be valiant for it, and not be daunted by the 
 opposition given to it, nor fear the face of man. <I>They are not 
 valiant for the truth in the land,</I> the land which has truth for the 
 glory of it. Truth has fallen in the land, and they dare not lend a 
 hand to help it up, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:14,15">Isa. lix. 14, 15</A>.

 We must answer, another day, not only for our enmity in opposing truth,
 but for our cowardice in defending it. <I>Secondly,</I> Go into their 
 families, and you will find they will cheat their own brethren 
 (<I>every brother will utterly supplant</I>); they will trip up one 
 another's heels if they can, for they lie at the catch to seek all 
 advantages against those they hope to make a hand of. Jacob had his 
 name from <I>supplanting;</I> it is the word here used; they followed 
 him in his name, but not in his true character, <I>without guile.</I> 
 So very false are they that you cannot <I>trust in a brother,</I> but 
 must stand as much upon your guard as if you were dealing with a 
 stranger, with a Canaanite that has <I>balances of deceit in his 
 hand.</I> Things have come to an ill pass indeed when a man cannot put 
 confidence in his own brother. <I>Thirdly,</I> Go into company and 
 observe both their commerce and their conversation, and you will find 
 there is nothing of sincerity or common honesty among them. <I>Nec
 hospes ab hospite tutus--The host and the guest are in danger from each 
 other.</I> The best advice a wise man can give you is <I>to take heed 
 every one of his neighbour,</I> nay, of his <I>friend</I> (so some read 
 it), of him whom he has befriended and who pretends friendship to him. 
 No man thinks himself bound to be either grateful or sincere. Take them 
 in their conversation and <I>every neighbour will walk with 
 slander;</I> they care not what ill they say one of another, though 
 ever so false; that way that the slander goes they will go; they will 
 <I>walk with</I> it. They will walk about from house to house too, 
 carrying slanders along with them, all the ill-natured stories they can 
 pick up or invent to make mischief. Take them in their trading and 
 bargaining, and <I>they will deceive every one his neighbour,</I> will 
 say any thing, though they know it to be false, for their own 
 advantage. Nay, they will lie for lying sake, to keep their tongues in 
 use to it, for <I>they will not speak the truth,</I> but will tell a 
 deliberate lie and laugh at it when they have done.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That which aggravates the sin on this false and lying generation 
 is, 

 [1.] That they are ingenious to sin: <I>They have taught their tongue 
 to speak lies,</I> implying that through the reluctances of natural 
 conscience they found it difficult to bring themselves to it. Their
 tongue would have spoken truth, but they <I>taught it to speak 
 lies,</I> and by degrees have made themselves masters of the art of 
 lying, and have got such a habit of it that use has made it a second 
 nature to them. They learnt it when they were young (for <I>the wicked 
 are estranged from the womb, speaking lies,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:3">Ps. lviii. 3</A>),

 and now they have grown dexterous at it.

 [2.] That they are industrious to sin: <I>They weary themselves to 
 commit iniquity;</I> they put a force upon their consciences to bring 
 themselves to it; they tire out their convictions by offering them 
 continual violence, and they take a great deal of pains, till they have 
 even spent themselves in bringing about their malicious designs. They 
 are wearied with their sinful pursuits and yet not weary of them. The 
 service of sin is a perfect drudgery; men run themselves out of breath 
 in it, and put themselves to a great deal of toil to damn their own 
 souls.

 [3.] That they grow worse and worse

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>They proceed from evil to evil,</I> from one sin to another, from 
 one degree of sin to another. They began with less sins. <I>Nemo
 repente fit turpissimus--No one reaches the height of vice at once.</I> 
 They began with equivocating and bantering, but at last came to 
 downright lying. And they are now proceeding to greater sins yet, for 
 <I>they know not me, saith the Lord;</I> and where men have no 
 knowledge of God, or no consideration of what they have known of him, 
 what good can be expected from them? Men's ignorance of God is the 
 cause of all their ill conduct one towards another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The prophet shows what God had informed him of their wickedness, and 
 what he had determined against them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) God had marked their sin. He could tell the prophet (and he speaks 
 of it with compassion) what sort of people they were that he had to 
 deal with. <I>I know thy works, and where thou dwellest,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:13">Rev. ii. 13</A>.
 
 So here
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>Thy habitation is in the midst of deceit,</I> all about thee are 
 addicted to it; therefore stand upon thy guard." If <I>all men are 
 liars,</I> it concerns us to <I>beware of men,.</I> and to be <I>wise 
 as serpents.</I> They are deceitful men; therefore there is little hope 
 of thy doing any good among them; for, make things ever so plain, they 
 have some trick or other wherewith to shuffle off their convictions. 
 This charge is enlarged upon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Their tongue was a <I>bow bent</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 plotting and preparing mischief; here it is <I>an arrow shot out,</I> 
 putting in execution what they had projected. It is as a <I>slaying
 arrow</I> (so some readings of the original have it); their tongue has 
 been to many an instrument of death. They <I>speak peaceably to their 
 neighbours,</I> against whom they are at the same time <I>lying in 
 wait;</I> as Joab kissed Abner when he was about to kill him, and Cain, 
 that he might not be suspected of any ill design, <I>talked with his 
 brother,</I> freely and familiarly. Note, Fair words, when they are not 
 attended with good intentions, are despicable, but, when they are 
 intended as a cloak and cover for wicked intentions they are 
 abominable. While they did all this injury to one another they put a 
 great contempt upon God: "Not only they <I>know not me,</I> but 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)
 
 <I>through deceit,</I> through the delusions of the false prophets, 
 <I>they refuse to know me;</I> they are so cheated into a good opinion 
 of their own ways, the ways of their own heart, that they desire not 
 the knowledge of my ways." Or, "They are so wedded to this sinful 
 course which they are in, and so bewitched with that, and its gains, 
 that they will by no means admit the <I>knowledge of God,</I> because 
 that would be a check upon them in their sins." This is the ruin of 
 sinners: they might be taught the good knowledge of the Lord and they 
 will not learn it; and where no knowledge of God is, what good can be 
 expected? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:1">Hos. iv. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He had marked them for ruin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:7,9,11"><I>v.</I> 7, 9, 11</A>.

 Those that will not know God as their lawgiver shall be made to know 
 him as their judge. God determines here to bring his judgments upon 
 them, for the refining of some and the ruining of the rest.

 [1.] Some shall be refined 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):
 
 "Because they are thus corrupt, <I>behold I will melt them and try 
 them,</I> will bring them into trouble and see what that will do 
 towards bringing them to repentance, whether the furnace of affliction 
 will purify them from their dross, and whether, when they are melted, 
 they will be new-cast in a better mould." He will make trial of less 
 afflictions before he brings upon them utter destruction; for he 
 <I>desires not the death of sinners.</I> They shall not be <I>rejected 
 as reprobate silver</I> till <I>the founder has melted in vain,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:29,30"><I>ch.</I> vi. 29, 30</A>.

 <I>For how shall I do for the daughter of my people?</I> He speaks as
 one consulting with himself what to do with them that might be for the 
 best, and as one that could not find in his heart to cast them off and 
 give them up to ruin till he had first tried all means likely to bring 
 them to repentance. Or, "<I>How else shall I do for them?</I> They have 
 grown so very corrupt that there is no other way with them but to put 
 them into the furnace; what other course can I take with them? 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:4,5">Isa. v. 4, 5</A>.

 It is <I>the daughter of my people,</I> and I must do something to
 vindicate my own honour, which will be reflected upon if I connive at 
 their wickedness. I must do something to reduce and reform them." A 
 parent corrects his own children because they are his own. Note, When
 God afflicts his people, it is with a gracious design to mollify and 
 reform them; it is but when need is and when he knows it is the best 
 method he can use.

 [2.] The rest shall be ruined 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Shall I not visit for these things?</I> Fraud and falsehood are sins 
 which God hates and which he will reckon for. "<I>Shall not my soul be
 avenged on such a nation as this,</I> that is so universally corrupt, 
 and, by its impudence in sin, even dares and defies divine vengeance? 
 The sentence is passed, the decree has gone forth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>I will make Jerusalem heaps</I> of rubbish, and lay it in such ruins 
 that it shall be fit for nothing but to be <I>a den of dragons;</I> and 
 <I>the cities of Judah</I> shall be <I>a desolation.</I>" God makes 
 them so, for he gives the enemy warrant and power to do it: but why is 
 the holy city made a heap? The answer is ready, Because it has become 
 an unholy one?</P>

 &nbsp; 16  I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither
 they nor their fathers have known: and I will send a sword after
 them, till I have consumed them.
 &nbsp; 17  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the
 mourning women, that they may come; and send for cunning <I>women,</I>
 that they may come:
 &nbsp; 18  And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that
 our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with
 waters.
 &nbsp; 19  For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we
 spoiled! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the
 land, because our dwellings have cast <I>us</I> out.
 &nbsp; 20  Yet hear the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, O ye women, and let your ear
 receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing,
 and every one her neighbour lamentation.
 &nbsp; 21  For death is come up into our windows, <I>and</I> is entered into
 our palaces, to cut off the children from without, <I>and</I> the
 young men from the streets.
 &nbsp; 22  Speak, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Even the carcases of men shall
 fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the
 harvestman, and none shall gather <I>them.</I>

 Two things the prophet designs, in these verses, with reference to the
 approaching destruction of Judah and Jerusalem:--

 1. To convince people of the justice of God in it, that they had by sin 
 brought it upon themselves and that therefore they had no reason to 
 quarrel with God, who did them no wrong at all, but a great deal of 
 reason to fall out with their sins, which did them all this mischief.

 2. To affect people with the greatness of the desolation that was
 coming, and the miserable effects of it, that by a terrible prospect of 
 it they might be awakened to repentance and reformation, which was the 
 only way to prevent it, or, at least, mitigate their own share in it. 
 This being designed,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He calls for the thinking men, by them to show people the equity of 
 God's proceedings, though they seemed harsh and severe 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):
 
 "<I>Who,</I> where, <I>is the wise man,</I> or the prophet, <I>to whom 
 the mouth of the Lord hath spoken?</I> You boast of your wisdom, and of 
 the prophets you have among you; produce me any one that has but the 
 free use of human reason or any acquaintance with divine revelation, 
 and he will soon understand this himself, and it will be so clear to 
 him that he will be ready to declare it to others, that there is a just 
 ground of God's controversy with this people." Do these wise men 
 enquire, <I>For what does the land perish?</I> What is the matter, that 
 such a change is made with this land? It used to be a land that God 
 cared for, and he had his eyes upon it for good 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+11:12">Deut. xi. 12</A>),

 but it is now a land that he has forsaken and that his face is against.
 It used to flourish as the garden of the Lord and to be replenished 
 with inhabitants; but now it is burnt up like a wilderness, that 
 <I>none passeth through</I> it, much less cares to settle in it. It was 
 supposed, long ago, that it would be asked, when it came to this, 
 <I>Wherefore has the Lord done thus unto this land? What means the heat 
 of this great anger?</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:24">Deut. xxix. 24</A>),

 to which question God here gives a full answer, before which all flesh
 must be silent. He produces out of the record,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The indictment preferred and proved against them, upon which they 
 had been found guilty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 It is charged upon them, and it cannot be denied, 

 (1.) That they have revolted from their allegiance to their rightful 
 Sovereign. <I>Therefore.</I> God has <I>forsaken their land,</I> and
 justly, because they have <I>forsaken his law,</I> which he had so 
 plainly, so fully, so frequently <I>set before them,</I> and had not 
 observed his orders, not <I>obeyed his voice,</I> nor <I>walked in</I> 
 the ways that he had appointed. Here their wickedness began, in the 
 omission of their duty to their God and a contempt of his authority. 
 But it did not end here. It is further charged upon them, 

 (2.) That they have entered themselves into the service of pretenders 
 and usurpers, have not only withdrawn themselves from their obedience 
 to their prince, but have taken up arms against him. For,

 [1.] They have acted according to the dictates of their own lusts, have 
 set up their own will, the wills of the flesh, and the carnal mind, in 
 competition with, and contradiction to the will of God: <I>They have 
 walked after the imagination of their own hearts;</I> they would do as 
 they pleased, whatever God and conscience said to the contrary.

 [2.] They have worshipped the creatures of their own fancy, the work of 
 their own hands, according to the tradition received from their 
 fathers: <I>They have walked after Baalim:</I> the word is plural; they
 had many Baals, Baal-peor and Baal-berith, the Baal of this place and 
 the Baal of the other place; for they had <I>lords many,</I> which 
 <I>their fathers taught them</I> to worship, but which the God of their 
 fathers had again and again forbidden. This was it for which <I>the 
 land perished.</I> The King of kings never makes war thus upon his own 
 subjects but when they treacherously depart from him and rebel against 
 him, and it has become necessary by this means to chastise their 
 rebellion and reduce them to their allegiance; and they themselves 
 shall at length acknowledge that he is just in all that is brought upon 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The judgment given upon this indictment, the sentence upon the 
 convicted rebels, which must now be executed, for it was righteous and 
 nothing could be moved in arrest of it: <I>The Lord of hosts, the God 
 of Israel, hath said it</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>),

 and who can reverse it? 

 (1.) That all their comforts at home shall be poisoned and embittered 
 to them: <I>I will feed this people with wormwood</I> (or rather with 
 <I>wolf's-bane,</I> for it signifies a herb that is not wholesome, as 
 wormwood is though it be bitter, but some herb that is both nauseous 
 and noxious), <I>and</I> I will <I>give them water of gall</I> (or 
 <I>juice of hemlock</I> or some other herb that is poisonous) <I>to 
 drink.</I> Every thing about them, till it comes to their very meat and 
 drink, shall be a terror and torment to them. God will <I>curse their 
 blessings,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:2">Mal. ii. 2</A>.

 (2.) That their dispersion abroad shall be their destruction

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>I will scatter them among the heathen.</I> They were corrupted and 
 debauched by their intimacy with the heathen, with whom they 
 <I>mingled</I> and <I>learned their works;</I> and now they shall lose 
 themselves, where they lost their virtue, <I>among the heathen.</I> 
 They set up gods which <I>neither they nor their fathers had known,</I> 
 strange gods, new gods 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:17">Deut. xxxii. 17</A>);

 and now God will put them among neighbours whom <I>neither they nor
 their fathers have known,</I> whom they can claim no acquaintance with, 
 and therefore can expect no favour from. And yet, though they are 
 scattered so as that they will not know where to find one another. God 
 will know where to find them all out

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:8">Ps. xxi. 8</A>)

 with that evil which still pursues impenitent sinners: <I>I will send a
 sword after them,</I> some killing judgment or other, <I>till I have 
 consumed them;</I> for when God judges he will overcome, when he 
 pursues he will overtake. And now we see for what the land perishes; 
 all this desolation is the desert of their deeds and the performance of 
 God's words.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He calls for the mourning women, and engages them, with the arts 
 they practise to affect people and move their passions, to lament these 
 sad calamities that had come or were coming upon them, that the nation 
 might be alarmed to prepare for them: <I>The Lord of hosts</I> himself 
 <I>says, Call for the mourning women, that they may come,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 
 the scope of this is to show how very woeful and lamentable the 
 condition of this people was likely to be. 

 1. Here is work for the counterfeit mourners: <I>Send for cunning
 women,</I> that know how to compose mournful ditties, or at least to 
 sing them in mournful tunes and accents, and therefore are made use of 
 at funerals to supply the want of true mourners. Let these <I>take up a 
 wailing</I> for us,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 The deaths and funerals were so many that people wept for them till 
 they <I>had no power to weep,</I> as those, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:4">1 Sam. xxx. 4</A>.

 Let those therefore do it now whose trade it is. Or, rather, it
 intimates the extreme sottishness and stupidity of the people, that 
 laid not to heart the judgments they were under, nor, even when there 
 was so much blood shed, could find in their hearts to shed a tear. 
 <I>They cry not when God binds them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:13">Job xxxvi. 13</A>.

 God sent his mourning prophets to them, to call them to weeping and
 mourning, but his word in their mouths did not work upon their faith; 
 rather therefore than they shall go laughing to their ruin, let the 
 mourning women come, and try to work upon their fancy, <I>that their 
 eyes may</I> at length <I>run down with tears, and their eyelids gush 
 out with waters.</I> First or last, sinners must be weepers.

 2. Here is work for the real mourners.

 (1.) There is that which is a lamentation. The present scene is very 
 tragical

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):
 
 <I>A voice of wailing is heard out of Zion.</I> Some make this to be 
 the song of the mourning women: it is rather an echo to it, returned by 
 those whose affections were moved by their wailings. In Zion the voice 
 of joy and praise used to be heard, while the people kept closely to 
 God. But sin has altered the note; it is now the <I>voice of 
 lamentation.</I> It should seem to be the voice of those who fled from 
 all parts of the country to the castle of Zion for protection. Instead 
 of rejoicing that they had got safely thither, they lamented that they 
 were forced to seek for shelter there: "<I>How are we spoiled!</I> How 
 are we stripped of all our possessions! <I>We are greatly 
 confounded,</I> ashamed of ourselves and our poverty;" for that is it 
 that they complain of, that is it that they blush at the thoughts of, 
 rather than of their sin: <I>We are confounded</I> because <I>we have 
 forsaken the land</I> (forced so to do by the enemy), not because we 
 <I>have</I> forsaken the Lord, being drawn aside of <I>our own lust and 
 enticed--because our dwellings have cast us out,</I> not because our God
 has cast us off. Thus unhumbled hearts lament their calamity, but not 
 their iniquity, the procuring cause of it. 

 (2.) There is more still to come which shall be for a lamentation. 
 Things are bad, but they are likely to be worse. Those whose land has 
 <I>spued them out</I> (as it did their predecessors the Canaanites, and 
 justly, because they trod in their steps, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:28">Lev. xviii. 28</A>)

 complain that they are driven into the city, but, after a while, those
 of the city, and they with them, shall be forced thence too: <I>Yet 
 hear the word of the Lord;</I> he has something more to say to you

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>);

 let <I>the women</I> hear it, whose tender spirits are apt to receive 
 the impressions of grief and fear, for the men will not heed it, will 
 not give it a patient hearing. The prophets will be glad to preach to
 a congregation of women that <I>tremble at God's word. Let your ear 
 receive the word of God's mouth,</I> and bid it welcome, though it be a 
 word of terror. Let the women <I>teach their daughters wailing;</I> 
 this intimates that the trouble shall last long, grief shall be 
 entailed upon the generation to come. Young people are apt to love 
 mirth, and expect mirth, and are disposed to be gay and airy; but let 
 the elder women teach the younger to be serious, tell them what a vale 
 of tears they must expect to find this world, and train them up among 
 the mourners in Zion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+2:4,5">Tit. ii. 4, 5</A>.

 Let <I>every one teach her neighbour lamentation;</I> this intimates
 that the trouble shall spread far, shall go from house to house. People 
 shall not need to sympathize with their friends; they shall all have 
 cause enough to mourn for themselves. Note, Those that are themselves 
 affected with the terrors of the Lord should endeavour to affect others 
 with them. The judgment here threatened is made to look terrible.

 [1.] Multitudes shall be slain, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Death shall ride in triumph, and there shall be no escaping his arrests 
 when he comes with commission, neither within doors nor without. Not 
 within doors, for let the doors be shut ever so fast, let them be ever 
 so firmly locked and bolted, <I>death comes up into our windows,</I> 
 like a thief in the night; it steals upon us ere we are aware. Nor does 
 it thus boldly attack the cottages only, but it has <I>entered into our 
 palaces,</I> the palaces of our princes and great men, though ever so 
 stately, ever so strongly built and guarded. Note, No palaces can keep
 out death. Nor are those more safe that are abroad; death <I>cuts 
 off</I> even <I>the children from without and the young men from the 
 streets.</I> The children who might have been spared by the enemy in 
 pity, because they had never been hurtful to them, and the young men 
 who might have been spared in policy, because capable of being 
 serviceable to them, shall fall together by the sword. It is usual now, 
 even in the severest military executions, to put none to the sword. It 
 is usual now, even in the severest military executions, to put none to 
 the sword but those that are found in arms; but then even the boys and 
 girls playing in the streets were sacrificed to the fury of the 
 conqueror.

 [2.] Those that are slain shall be left unburied 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>Speak, Thus saith the Lord</I> (for the confirmation and aggravation 
 of what was before said), <I>Even the carcases of men shall fall as 
 dung,</I> neglected, and left to be offensive to the smell, as dung is. 
 Common humanity obliges the survivors to bury the dead, even for their 
 own sake; but here such numbers shall be slain, and those so dispersed 
 all the country over, that it shall be an endless thing to bury them 
 all, nor shall there be hands enough to do it, nor shall the conquerors 
 permit it, and those that should do it shall be overwhelmed with grief, 
 so that they shall have no heart to do it. The dead bodies even of the 
 fairest and strongest, when they have lain awhile, become dung, such 
 vile bodies have we. And here such multitudes shall fall that their 
 bodies shall lie as thick as heaps of dung <I>in the furrows of the 
 field,</I> and no more notice shall be taken of them than of the 
 <I>handfuls</I> which <I>the harvestman</I> drops for the gleaners, for 
 <I>none shall gather them,</I> but they shall remain in sight, 
 monuments of divine vengeance, that the eye of the impenitent survivors 
 may affect their heart. <I>Slay them not,</I> bury them not, <I>lest my 
 people forget,</I>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet had been endeavouring to possess this people with a holy 
 fear of God and his judgments, to convince them both of sin and wrath; 
 but still they had recourse to some sorry subterfuge or other, under 
 which to shelter themselves from the conviction and with which to 
 excuse themselves in the obstinacy and carelessness. He therefore sets 
 himself here to drive them from these refuges of lies and to show them 
 the insufficiency of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. When they were told how inevitable the judgment would be they 
 pleaded the defence of their politics and powers, which, with the help 
 of their wealth and treasure, they thought made their city impregnable. 
 In answer to this he shows them the folly of trusting to and boasting 
 of all these stays, while they have not a God in covenant to stay 
 themselves upon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.
 
 Here he shows, 

 1. What we may not depend upon in a day of distress: <I>Let not the
 wise man glory in his wisdom,</I> as if with the help of that he could 
 outwit or countermine the enemy, or in the greatest extremity find out 
 some evasion or other; for a man's wisdom may fail him when he needs it 
 most, and he may fail him when he needs it most, and he may be taken in 
 his own craftiness. Ahithophel was befooled, and counsellors are often
 <I>led away spoiled.</I> But, if a man's policies fail him, yet surely 
 he may gain his point by might and dint of courage. No: <I>Let not the 
 strong man glory in his strength,</I> for the battle is not always to 
 the strong. David the stripling proves too hard for Goliath the giant.
 All human force is nothing without God, worse than nothing against him. 
 But may not the <I>rich man's wealth be his strong city?</I> (money 
 answers all things) No: <I>Let not the rich man glory in his 
 riches,</I> for they may prove so far from sheltering him that they may 
 expose him and make him the fairer mark. Let not the people boast of 
 the <I>wise men, and mighty men, and rich men</I> that they have among 
 them, as if they could make their part good against the Chaldeans 
 because they have wise men to advise concerning the war, mighty men to 
 fight their battles, and rich men to bear the charges of the war. Let 
 not particular persons think to escape the common calamity by their 
 wisdom, might, or money; for all these will prove but <I>vain things 
 for safety.</I> 

 2. He shows what we may depend upon in a day of distress.

 (1.) Our only comfort in trouble will be that we have done our duty.
 Those that <I>refused to know God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 will boast in vain of their wisdom and wealth; but those that <I>know 
 God,</I> intelligently, that <I>understand</I> aright <I>that he is the 
 Lord,</I> that have not only right apprehensions concerning his nature, 
 and attributes, and relations to man, but receive and retain the 
 impressions of them, may <I>glory in this</I> it will be their 
 rejoicing in the day of evil. 

 (2.) Our only confidence in trouble will be that, having through grace 
 in some measure done our duty, we shall find God a God all-sufficient 
 to us. We may <I>glory in this,</I> that, wherever we are, we have an 
 acquaintance with an interest in a God that <I>exercises 
 lovingkindness, and judgment, and righteousness in the earth,</I> that 
 is not only just to all his creatures and will do no wrong to any of 
 them, but kind to all his children and will protect them and provide 
 for them. <I>For in these things I delight.</I> God delights to show 
 kindness and to execute judgment himself, and is pleased with those who 
 herein are <I>followers of him as dear children.</I> Those that have 
 such knowledge of the glory of God as to be changed into the same 
 image, and to partake of his holiness, find it to be their perfection 
 and glory; and the God they thus faithfully conform to they may 
 cheerfully confide in, in their greatest straits. But the prophet
 intimates that the generality of this people took no care about this.
 Their wisdom, and might, and riches, were their joy and hope, which 
 would end in grief and despair. But those few among them that had the 
 knowledge of God might please themselves with it, and boast themselves 
 of it; it would stand them in better stead than <I>thousands of gold 
 and silver.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. When they were told how provoking their sins were to God they 
 vainly pleaded the covenant of their circumcision. They were 
 undoubtedly the people of God; as they had the temple of the Lord in 
 their city, so they had the mark of his children in their flesh. "It is 
 true that Chaldean army has laid such and such nations waste, because 
 they were uncircumcised, and therefore not under the protection of the 
 divine providence, as we are." To this the prophet answers, That the 
 days of visitation were now at hand, in which God would punish all 
 wicked people, without making any distinction between the circumcised 
 and uncircumcised, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>.

 They had by sin profaned the crown of their peculiarity, and lived in 
 common with the uncircumcised nations, and so had forfeited the benefit 
 of that peculiarity and must expect to fare never the better for it. 
 God will <I>punish the circumcised with the uncircumcised.</I> As the 
 ignorance of the uncircumcised shall not excuse their wickedness, so 
 neither shall the privileges of the circumcised excuse theirs, but they 
 shall be punished together. Note, The Judge of all the earth is 
 impartial, and none shall fare the better at his bar for any external 
 advantages, but he will render to every man, circumcised or 
 uncircumcised, according to his works. The condemnation of impenitent 
 sinners that are baptized will be as sure as, nay, and more severe 
 than, that of impenitent sinners that are unbaptized. It would affect 
 one to find here Judah industriously put between Egypt and Edom, as 
 standing upon a level with them and under the same doom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 These nations were forbidden a share in the Jews' privileges 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:3">Deut. xxiii. 3</A>);

 but the Jews are here told that they shall share in their punishments.
 Those <I>in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness,</I> are 
 supposed to be the Kedarenes and those of the kingdoms of Hazor, as 
 appears by comparing

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:28-32"><I>ch.</I> xlix. 28-32</A>.

 Some think they are so called because they dwelt as it were in a corner
 of the world, others because they had <I>the hair of their head polled 
 into corners.</I> However that was, they were of those nations that 
 were uncircumcised in flesh, and the Jews are ranked with them and are 
 as near to ruin for their sins as they; for <I>all the house of Israel 
 are uncircumcised in the heart:</I> they have the sign, but not the 
 thing signified,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:4"><I>ch.</I> iv. 4</A>.

 They are heathens in their hearts, strangers to God, and enemies in
 their minds by wicked works. Their hearts are disposed to idols, as the 
 hearts of the uncircumcised Gentiles are. Note, The seals of the
 covenant, though they dignify us, and lay us under obligations, will 
 not save us, unless the temper of our minds and the tenour of our lives 
 agree with the covenant. That only is circumcision, and that baptism, 
 which is <I>of the heart,</I>
