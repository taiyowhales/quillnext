 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is probable that this chapter was Jeremiah's first sermon after his 
 ordination; and a most lively pathetic sermon it is as any we have is 
 all the books of the prophets. Let him not say, "I cannot speak, for I 
 am a child;" for, God having touched his mouth and put his words into 
 it, none can speak better. The scope of the chapter is to show God's 
 people their transgressions, even the house of Jacob their sins; it is 
 all by way of reproof and conviction, that they might be brought to 
 repent of their sins and so prevent the ruin that was coming upon them. 
 The charge drawn up against them is very high, the aggravations are 
 black, the arguments used for their conviction very close and pressing, 
 and the expostulations very pungent and affecting. The sin which they 
 are most particularly charged with here is idolatry, forsaking the true 
 God, their own God, for other false gods. Now they are told, 

 I. That this was ungrateful to God, who had been so kind to them, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>.

 II. That it was without precedent, that a nation should change their
 god, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:9-13">ver. 9-13</A>.

 III. That hereby they had disparaged and ruined themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:14-19">ver. 14-19</A>.

 IV. That they had broken their covenants and degenerated from their 
 good beginnings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:20,21">ver. 20, 21</A>.

 V. That their wickedness was too plain to be concealed and too bad to 
 be excused, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:22,23,35">ver. 22, 23, 35</A>.

 VI. That they persisted witfully and obstinately in it, and were 
 irreclaimable and indefatigable in their idolatries, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:24,25,33,36">ver. 24, 25, 33, 36</A>.

 VII. That they shamed themselves by their idolatry and should shortly 
 be made ashamed of it when they should find their idols unable to help 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:26-29,37">ver. 26-29, 37</A>.

 VIII. That they had not been convinced and reformed by the rebukes of 
 Providence that had been under, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:30">ver. 30</A>.

 IX. That they had put a great contempt upon God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:30,31">ver. 31, 32</A>.

 X. That with their idolatries they had mixed the most unnatural 
 murders, shedding the blood of the poor innocents, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:34">ver. 34</A>.

 Those hearts were hard indeed that were untouched and unhumbled when 
 their sins were thus set in order before them. O that by meditating on 
 this chapter we might be brought to repent of our spiritual idolatries, 
 giving that place in our souls to the world and the flesh which should 
 have been reserved for God only!</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Moreover the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came to me, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of
 thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in
 a land <I>that was</I> not sown.
 &nbsp; 3  Israel <I>was</I> holiness unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>and</I> the first-fruits of
 his increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come
 upon them, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 4  Hear ye the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, O house of Jacob, and all the
 families of the house of Israel:
 &nbsp; 5  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, What iniquity have your fathers found in
 me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity,
 and are become vain?
 &nbsp; 6  Neither said they, Where <I>is</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> that brought us up out
 of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through
 a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of
 the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through,
 and where no man dwelt?
 &nbsp; 7  And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit
 thereof and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled
 my land, and made mine heritage an abomination.
 &nbsp; 8  The priests said not, Where <I>is</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>? and they that
 handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against
 me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after <I>things
 that</I> do not profit.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A command given to Jeremiah to go and carry a message from God to 
 the inhabitants of Jerusalem. He was charged in general 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:17"><I>ch.</I> i. 17</A>)

 to go and <I>speak to them;</I> here he is particularly charged to go 
 and speak <I>this</I> to them. Note, It is good for ministers by faith 
 and prayer to take out a fresh commission when they address themselves 
 solemnly to any part of their work. Let a minister carefully compare 
 what he has to deliver with the word of God, and see that it agrees 
 with it, that he may be able to say, not only, <I>The Lord sent me,</I> 
 but, He sent me to <I>speak this.</I> He must go from Anathoth, where 
 he lived in a pleasant retirement, spending his time (it is likely) 
 among a few friends and in the study of the law, and must make his 
 appearance at Jerusalem, that noisy tumultuous city, and <I>cry in 
 their ears,</I> as a man in earnest and that would be heard: "Cry 
 aloud, that all may hear, and none may plead ignorance. Go close to 
 them, and <I>cry in the ears</I> of those that have stopped their 
 ears."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The message he was commanded to deliver. He must upbraid them with 
 their horrid ingratitude in forsaking a God who had been of old so kind 
 to them, that this might either make them ashamed and bring them to 
 repentance, or might justify God in turning his hand against them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God here puts them in mind of the favours he had of old bestowed 
 upon them, when they were first formed into a people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>I remember for thy sake,</I> and I would have thee to remember it,
 and improve the remembrance of it for thy good; I cannot forget <I>the 
 kindness of thy youth and the love of thy espousals.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) This may be understood of the kindness they had for God; it was 
 not such indeed as they had any reason to boast of, or to plead with 
 God for favour to be shown them (for many of them were very unkind and 
 provoking, and, when they did return and enquire early after God, they 
 did but flatter him), yet God is pleased to mention it, and plead it 
 with them; for, though it was but little love that they showed him, he 
 took it kindly. When <I>they believed the Lord and his servant 
 Moses,</I> when they <I>sang God's praise at the Red Sea,</I> when at 
 the foot of Mount Sinai they promised, <I>All that the Lord shall say 
 unto us we will do and will be obedient,</I> then was the <I>kindness 
 of their youth and the love of their espousals.</I> When they seemed so 
 forward for God he said, <I>Surely they are my people,</I> and will be 
 faithful to me, <I>children that will not lie.</I> Note, Those that 
 begin well and promise fair, but do not perform and persevere, will 
 justly be upbraided with their hopeful and promising beginnings. God 
 remembers the <I>kindness of our youth and the love of our 
 espousals,</I> the zeal we then seemed to have for him and the 
 affection wherewith we made our covenants with him, the buds and 
 blossoms that never came to perfection; and it is good for us to 
 remember them, that we may remember whence we have fallen, and return 
 to our first love, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:4,5,Ga+4:15">Rev. ii. 4, 5; Gal. iv. 15</A>.

 In two things appeared the <I>kindness of their youth:</I>--

 [1.] That they followed the direction of the pillar of cloud and fire 
 in the wilderness; and though sometimes they spoke of returning into 
 Egypt, or pushing forward into Canaan, yet they did neither, but for 
 forty years together <I>went after God in the wilderness,</I> and 
 trusted him to provide for them, though it was <I>a land that was not 
 sown.</I> This God took kindly, and took notice of it to their praise 
 long after, that, though much was amiss among them, yet they never 
 forsook the guidance they were under. Thus, though Christ often chid 
 his disciples, yet he commended them, at parting, for continuing with 
 him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:28">Luke xxii. 28</A>.

 It must be the strong affection of the youth, and the espousals, that
 will carry us on to follow God in a wilderness, with an implicit faith 
 and an entire resignation; and it is a pity that those who have so 
 followed him should ever leave him.

 [2.] That they entertained divine institutions, set up the tabernacle 
 among them, and attended the service of it. Israel <I>was then holiness 
 to the Lord;</I> they joined themselves to him in covenant as a 
 peculiar people. Thus they began in the spirit, and God puts them in 
 mind of it, that they might be ashamed of ending <I>in the 
 flesh.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Or it may be understood of God's kindness to them; of that he 
 afterwards speaks largely. <I>When Israel was a child, then I loved 
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:1">Hos. xi. 1</A>.

 He then espoused that people to himself with all the affection with
 which a <I>young man marries a virgin</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:5">Isaiah lxii. 5</A>),
 
 for the time was <I>a time of love,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:8">Ezek. xvi. 8</A>.

 [1.] God appropriated them to himself. Though they were a sinful 
 people, yet, by virtue of the covenant made with them and the church 
 set up among them, they were <I>holiness to the Lord,</I> dedicated to 
 his honour and taken under his special tuition; they were the <I>first 
 fruits of his increase,</I> the first constituted church he had in the 
 world; they were the first-fruits, but the full harvest was to be 
 gathered from among the Gentiles. The <I>first-fruits of the 
 increase</I> were God's part of it, were offered to him, and he was 
 honoured with them; so were the people of the Jews; what little 
 tribute, rent, and homage, God had from the world, he had it chiefly 
 from them; and it was their honour to be thus set apart for God. This 
 honour have all the saints; they are the <I>first-fruits of his 
 creatures,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:18">Jam. i. 18</A>.

 [2.] Having espoused them, he espoused their cause, and became an 
 <I>enemy to their enemies,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:22">Exod. xxiii. 22</A>.

 Being the <I>first-fruits of his increase, all that devoured him</I>
 (so it should be read) <I>did offend;</I> they <I>trespassed,</I> they 
 contracted guilt, and evil befel them, as those were reckoned 
 <I>offenders</I> that <I>devoured the first-fruits,</I> or any thing 
 else that was <I>holy to the Lord,</I> that embezzled them, or 
 converted them to their own use, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+5:15">Lev. v. 15</A>.

 Whoever offered any injury to the people of God did so at their peril;
 their God was ready to avenge their quarrel, and said to the proudest 
 of kings, <I>Touch not my anointed,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:14,15,Ex+17:14">Ps. cv. 14, 15; Exod. xvii. 14</A>.

 He had in a special manner a controversy with those that attempted to
 debauch them and draw them off from being <I>holiness to the Lord;</I> 
 witness his <I>quarrel with the Midianites about the matter of 
 Peor,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:17,18">Num. xxv. 17, 18</A>.

 [3.] He <I>brought them out of Egypt</I> with a high hand and great 
 terror 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:34">Deut. iv. 34</A>),

 and yet with a kind hand and great tenderness led them through a vast
 howling wilderness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 <I>a land of deserts and pits,</I> or of <I>graves, terram
 sepulchralem--a sepulchral land,</I> where there was ground, not to 
 feed them, but to bury them, where there was no good to be expected, 
 for it was a <I>land of drought,</I> but all manner of evil to be 
 feared, for it was <I>the shadow of death.</I> In that darksome valley 
 they walked forty years; but <I>God was with them; his rod,</I> in 
 Moses's hand, <I>and his staff, comforted them,</I> and even there God 
 <I>prepared a table for them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+23:4,5">Ps. xxiii. 4, 5</A>),

 gave them bread out of the clouds and drink out of the rocks. It was a
 land abandoned by all mankind, as yielding neither road nor rest. It 
 was no thoroughfare, for <I>no man passed through it</I>--no 
 settlement, for <I>no man dwelt there.</I> For God will teach his 
 people to tread untrodden paths, to dwell alone, and to be singular.
 The difficulties of the journey are thus insisted on, to magnify the 
 power and goodness of God in bringing them, through all, safely to 
 their journey's end at last. All God's spiritual Israel must own their 
 obligations to him for a safe conduct through the wilderness of this 
 world, no less dangerous to the soul than that was to the body.

 [4.] At length he settled them in Canaan 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>I brought you into a plentiful country,</I> which would be the more
 acceptable after they had been for so many years in <I>a land of 
 drought.</I> They did <I>eat the fruit thereof</I> and the <I>goodness 
 thereof,</I> and were allowed so to do. I brought you <I>into a land of 
 Carmel</I> (so the word is); Carmel was a place of extraordinary 
 fruitfulness, and Canaan was as one great fruitful field, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:7">Deut. viii. 7</A>.

 [5.] God gave them the means of knowledge and grace, and communion with 
 him; this is implied, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 They had priests that <I>handled the law,</I> read it, and expounded it
 to them; that was part of their business, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:8">Deut. xxxiii. 8</A>.

 They had pastors, to guide them and take care of their affairs,
 magistrates and judges; they had prophets to consult God for them and 
 to make known his mind to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He upbraids them with their horrid ingratitude, and the ill returns 
 they had made him for these favours; let them all come and answer to 
 this charge 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 it is exhibited in the name of God against <I>all the families of the
 house of</I> Israel, for they can none of them plead, <I>Not 
 guilty.</I>

 (1.) He challenges them to produce any instance of his being unjust and 
 unkind to them. Though he had conferred favours upon them in some 
 things, yet, if in other things he had dealt hardly with them, they 
 would not have been altogether without excuse. He therefore puts it 
 fairly to them to show cause for their deserting him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>What iniquity have your fathers found in me,</I> or you either?
 Have you, upon trial, found God a hard master? Have his commands put
 any hardship upon you or obliged you to any thing unfit, unfair, or 
 unbecoming you? Have his promises put any cheats upon you, or raised 
 your expectations of things which you were afterwards disappointed of?
 You that have renounced your covenant with God, can you say that it was 
 a hard bargain and that which you could not live upon? You that have 
 forsaken the ordinances of God, can you say that it was because they 
 were a wearisome service, or work that there was nothing to be got by?
 No; the disappointments you have met with were owing to yourselves, not 
 to God. The yoke of his commandments if easy, and in the <I>keeping of 
 them there is great reward.</I>" Note, Those that forsake God cannot 
 say that he has ever given them any provocation to do so: for this we 
 may safely appeal to the consciences of sinners; the slothful servant 
 that offered such a plea as this had it overruled <I>out of his own 
 mouth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:22">Luke xix. 22</A>.

 Though he afflicts us, we cannot say that there is iniquity in him; he
 does us no wrong. The ways of the Lord are undoubtedly equal; all the 
 iniquity is in our ways.

 (2.) He charges them with being very unjust and unkind to him 
 notwithstanding.

 [1.] They had quitted his service: "<I>They have gone from me,</I> nay, 
 they have gone <I>far from me.</I>" They studied how to estrange 
 themselves from God and their duty, and got as far as they could out of 
 the reach of his commandments and their own convictions. Those that
 have deserted religion commonly set themselves at a greater distance 
 from it, and in a greater opposition to it, than those that never knew 
 it.

 [2.] They had quitted it for the service of idols, which was so much 
 the greater reproach to God and his service; they went from him, not to 
 better themselves, but to cheat themselves: <I>They have walked after 
 vanity,</I> that is, idolatry; for an idol is a vain thing; it is 
 <I>nothing in the world,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:4,De+32:21,Jer+14:22">1 Cor. viii. 4;
 Deut. xxxii. 21; Jer. xiv. 22</A>.
 
 Idolatrous worships are vanities, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:15">Acts xiv. 15</A>.

 Idolaters are vain, for those that make idols <I>are like unto them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:8">Ps. cxv. 8</A>),

 as much stocks and stones as the images they worship, and good for as
 little.

 [3.] They had with idolatry introduced all manner of wickedness. When 
 they entered into the good land which God gave them they defiled it 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 by defiling themselves and disfitting themselves for the service of
 God. It was God's land; they were but tenants to him, sojourners in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+25:23">Lev. xxv. 23</A>.

 It was his heritage, for it was a holy land, Immanuel's land; but they
 <I>made it an abomination,</I> even to God himself, who was wroth, and 
 greatly abhorred Israel.

 [4.] Having forsaken God, though they soon found that they had changed 
 for the worse, yet they had no thoughts of returning to him again, nor 
 took any steps towards it. Neither the people nor the priests made any 
 enquiry after him, took any thought about their duty to him, nor 
 expressed any desire to recover his favour. <I>First,</I> The 
 <I>people</I> said not, <I>Where is the Lord?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Though they were trained up in an observance of him as their God, and 
 had been often told that he <I>brought them out of the land of 
 Egypt,</I> to be a people peculiar to himself, yet they never asked 
 after him nor desired the <I>knowledge of his ways. Secondly,</I> The 
 <I>priests</I> said not, <I>Where is the Lord?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Those whose office it was to attend immediately upon him were in no
 concern to acquaint themselves with him, or approve themselves to him. 
 Those who should have instructed the people in the knowledge of God 
 took no care to get the knowledge of him themselves. The scribes, who 
 <I>handled the law,</I> did not know God nor his will, could not 
 expound the scriptures at all, or not aright. The pastors, who should 
 have kept the flock from transgressing, were themselves ringleaders in 
 transgression: <I>They have transgressed against me.</I> The pretenders 
 to prophecy prophesied by Baal, in his name, to his honour, being 
 backed and supported by the wicked kings to confront the Lord's 
 prophets. Baal's prophets joined with Baal's priests, and walked after 
 the <I>things which do not profit,</I> that is, after the idols which 
 can be no way helpful to their worshippers. See how the best characters 
 are usurped, and the best offices liable to corruption; and wonder not 
 at the sin and ruin of a people when the <I>blind</I> are <I>leaders of 
 the blind.</I></P>

 pleads with them, to bring them to repentance. Note, further, When much 
 has been said of the evil of sin, still there is more to be said; when 
 one article of the charge is made good, there is another to be urged; 
 when we have said a great deal, still <I>we have yet to speak on God's

 Those that deal with sinners, for their conviction, must urge a variety
 of arguments and follow their blow. God had before pleaded with their 
 fathers, and asked why they <I>walked after vanity</I> and became vain,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Now he pleads with those who persisted in that <I>vain conversation
 received by tradition from their fathers,</I> and <I>with their 
 children's children,</I> that is, with all that in every age tread in 
 their steps. Let those that forsake God know that he is willing to 
 argue the case fairly with them, that he may be <I>justified when he 
 speaks.</I> He pleads that with us which we should plead with 
 ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He shows that they acted contrary to the usage of all nations. Their 
 neighbours were more firm and faithful to their false gods than they 
 were to the true God. They were ambitious of being <I>like the 
 nations,</I> and yet in this they were unlike them. He challenges them 
 to produce an instance of any nation that had <I>changed their gods</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>)

 or were apt to change them. Let them survey either the old records or
 the present state of the isles of Chittim, Greece, and the European 
 islands, the countries that were more polite and learned, and of Kedar, 
 that lay south-east (as the other north-west from them), which were 
 more rude and barbarous; and they should not find an instance of a 
 nation that had <I>changed their gods,</I> though they had never done 
 them any kindness, nor could do, for <I>they were no gods.</I> Such a 
 veneration had they for their gods, so good an opinion of them, and 
 such a respect for the choice their fathers had made, that though they 
 were gods of wood and stone they would not change them for gods of 
 silver and gold, no, not for the living and true God. <I>Shall we 
 praise them for this? We praise them not.</I> But it may well be urged, 
 to the reproach of Israel, that they, who were the only people that had 
 no cause to change their God, were yet the only people that had changed 
 him. Note, Men are with difficulty brought off from that religion which 
 they have been brought up in, though ever so absurd and grossly false. 
 The zeal and constancy of idolaters should shame Christians out of 
 their coldness and inconstancy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He shows that they acted contrary to the dictates of common sense, 
 in that they not only changed (it may sometimes be our duty and wisdom 
 to do so), but that they changed for the worse, and made a bad bargain 
 for themselves. 

 1. They parted from a God who was their glory, who made them truly
 glorious and every way put honour upon them, one whom they might with a 
 humble confidence glory in as theirs, who is himself a glorious God and 
 the glory of those whose God he is; he was particularly the glory of 
 his people Israel, for his glory had often appeared on their 
 tabernacle. 

 2. They closed with gods that could do them no good, gods that <I>do 
 not profit</I> their worshippers. Idolaters change God's glory into
 shame 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:23">Rom. i. 23</A>)

 and so they do their own; in dishonouring him, they disgrace and
 disparage themselves, and are enemies to their own interest. Note, 
 Whatever those turn to who forsake God, it will never do them any good; 
 it will flatter them and please them, but it <I>cannot profit them.</I> 
 Heaven itself is here called upon to stand amazed at the sin and folly 
 of these apostates from God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>):

 <I>Be astonished, O you heavens! at this.</I> The earth is so
 universally corrupt that it will take no notice of it; but let the 
 heavens and heavenly bodies be astonished at it. Let the sun blush to 
 see such ingratitude and be afraid to shine upon such ungrateful 
 wretches. Those that forsook God worshipped <I>the host of heaven,</I> 
 the sun, moon, and stars; but these, instead of being pleased with the 
 adorations that were paid to them, <I>were astonished and horribly 
 afraid;</I> and would rather have been <I>very desolate, utterly 
 exhausted</I> (as the word is) and deprived of their light, than that 
 it should have given occasion to any to worship them. Some refer it to 
 the <I>angels of heaven;</I> if they rejoice at the return of souls to 
 God, we may suppose that they are astonished and horribly afraid at the 
 revolt of souls from him. The meaning is that the conduct of this 
 people towards God was,

 (1.) Such as we may well be astonished and wonder at, that ever men, 
 who pretend to reason, should do a thing so very absurd. 

 (2.) Such as we ought to have a holy indignation at as impious, and a 
 high affront to our Maker, whose honour every good man is jealous for. 
 
 (3.) Such as we may tremble to think of the consequences of. What will 
 be in the end hereof? Be horribly afraid to think of the wrath and 
 curse which will be the portion of those who thus throw themselves out 
 of God's grace and favour. Now what is it that is to be thought of with 
 all this horror? It is this: "<I>My people,</I> whom I have taught and 
 should have ruled, <I>have committed two</I> great evils, ingratitude 
 and folly; they have acted contrary both to their duty and to their 
 interest."

 [1.] They have <I>affronted their God,</I> by turning their back upon 
 him, as if he were not worthy their notice: "<I>They have forsaken me, 
 the fountain of living waters,</I> in whom they have an abundant and 
 constant supply of all the comfort and relief they stand in need of, 
 and have it freely." God is their <I>fountain of life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+36:9">Ps. xxxvi. 9</A>.
 
 There is in him an all-sufficiency of grace and strength; all our
 springs are in him and our streams from him; to forsake him is, in 
 effect, to deny this. He has been to us a bountiful benefactor, a
 <I>fountain of living waters,</I> over-flowing, ever-flowing, in the 
 gifts of his favour; to forsake him is to refuse to acknowledge his 
 kindness and to withhold that tribute of love and praise which his 
 kindness calls for.

 [2.] They have cheated themselves, they forsook <I>their own 
 mercies,</I> but it was for lying vanities. They took a great deal of 
 pains to <I>hew themselves out cisterns,</I> to dig pits or pools in 
 the earth or rock which they would carry water to, or which should 
 receive the rain; but they proved <I>broken cisterns,</I> false at the 
 bottom, so that they could <I>hold no water.</I> When they came to 
 quench their thirst there they found nothing but mud and mire, and the 
 filthy sediments of a standing lake. Such idols were to their 
 worshippers, and such a change did those experience who turned from God 
 to them. If we make an idol of any creature-wealth, or pleasure, or 
 honour,--if we place our happiness in it, and promise ourselves the 
 comfort and satisfaction in it which are to be had in God only,--if we 
 make it our joy and love, our hope and confidence, we shall find it a 
 cistern, which we take a great deal of pains to hew out and fill, and 
 at the best it will hold but a little water, and that dead and flat, 
 and soon corrupting and becoming nauseous. Nay, it is a broken cistern, 
 that cracks and cleaves in hot weather, so that the water is lost when 
 we have most need of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:15">Job vi. 15</A>.

 Let us therefore with purpose of heart cleave to the Lord only, for
 whither else <I>shall we go?</I> He has <I>the words of eternal 
 life.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet, further to evince the folly of their forsaking God, shows 
 them what mischiefs they had already brought upon themselves by so 
 doing; it had already cost them dear, for to this were owing all the 
 calamities their country was now groaning under, which were but an 
 earnest of more and greater if they repented not. See how they smarted 
 for their folly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Their neighbours, who were their professed enemies, prevailed 
 against them, and this was owing to their sin. 

 1. They were enslaved and lost their liberty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>Is Israel a servant?</I> No; <I>Israel is my son, my first-born,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:22">Exod. iv. 22</A>.

 They are children; they are heirs. Nay, their extraction is noble; they
 are the seed of Abraham, God's friend, and of Jacob his chosen. <I>Is 
 he a home-born slave?</I> No; he is not the <I>son of the 
 bond-woman,</I> but of the free. They were designed for dominion, not 
 for servitude. Every thing in their constitution carried about it the 
 marks of freedom and honour. <I>Why then is he spoiled</I> of his
 liberty? Why is he used as a servant, as a <I>home-born slave?</I> Why 
 does he <I>make himself a slave</I> to his lusts, to his idols, to that 
 which does not profit?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 What a thing is this, that such a birthright should be sold for a mess
 of pottage, such a crown profaned and laid in the dust! Why is he made 
 a slave to the oppressor? God provided that a Hebrew servant should be 
 free the seventh year, and that their slaves should be <I>of the 
 heathen,</I> not <I>of their brethren,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+25:44,46">Lev. xxv. 44, 46</A>.

 But, notwithstanding this, the princes made slaves of their subjects,
 and masters made slaves of their servants

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:11"><I>ch.</I> xxxiv. 11</A>),

 and so made their country mean and miserable, which God had made happy
 and honourable. The neighbouring princes and powers broke in upon
 them, and made some of them slaves even in their own country, and 
 perhaps sold others for slaves into foreign countries. And how came 
 they thus to lose their liberties? For <I>their iniquities they sold 
 themselves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:1">Isa. l. 1</A>.

 We may apply this spiritually. Is the soul of man a <I>servant? Is it a
 home-born slave?</I> No, it is not. Why then is it spoiled? It is 
 because it has sold its own liberty and enslaved itself to divers lusts 
 and passions, which is a lamentation, and should be for a lamentation.

 2. They were impoverished and had lost their wealth. God brought them 
 into a plentiful country 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 but all their neighbours made a prey of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>Young lions roar aloud over him and yell;</I> they are a continual
 terror to him. Sometimes one potent enemy, and sometimes another, and
 sometimes many in confederacy, fall upon him, and triumph over him. 
 They carry off the fruits of his land, and make that <I>waste,</I> and 
 <I>burn his cities,</I> when first they have plundered them, so that 
 they remain <I>without inhabitant,</I> either because there are no 
 houses to dwell in or because those that should dwell in them are 
 carried into captivity.

 3. They were abused, and insulted over, and beaten by every body 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 "Even <I>the children of Noph and Tahapanes,</I> despicable people, not
 famed for military courage nor strength, <I>have broken the crown of 
 thy head,</I> or fed upon it. In all their struggles with thee they 
 have been too hard for thee, and thou hast always come off with a 
 broken head. The principal part of thy country, that which lay next 
 Jerusalem, has been and is a prey to them." How calamitous the 
 condition of Judah had been of late in the reign of Manasseh we find, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+33:11">2 Chron. xxxiii. 11</A>,
 
 and perhaps it had not now much recovered itself.

 4. All this was owing to their sin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>Hast thou not procured this unto thyself?</I> By their sinful
 confederacies with the nations, and especially their conformity to them 
 in their idolatrous customs and usages, they had made themselves very 
 mean and contemptible, as all those do that have made a profession of 
 religion and afterwards throw it off. Nothing now appeared of that 
 which, by their constitution, made them both honourable and formidable, 
 and therefore nobody either respected them or feared them. But this was 
 not all; they had provoked God to give them up into the hands of their 
 enemies, and to make them a scourge to them and give them success 
 against them; and "thus thou hast <I>procured it to thyself, in that 
 thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God,</I> revolted from thy allegiance 
 to him and so thrown thyself out of his protection; for protection and 
 allegiance go together." Whatever trouble we are in at any time we may 
 thank ourselves for it; for we bring it upon our own head by our 
 forsaking God: "<I>Thou hast forsaken thy God at the time that he was 
 leading thee by the way</I>" (so it should be read); "Then when he was 
 leading thee on to a happy peace and settlement, and thou wast within a 
 step of it, then thou forsookest him, and so didst put a bar in thy own 
 door."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Their neighbours, that were their pretended friends, deceived them, 
 distressed them, and helped them not, and this also was owing to their 
 sin. 

 1. They did in vain seek to Egypt and Assyria for help 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):
 
 "<I>What hast thou to do in the way of Egypt?</I> When thou art under
 apprehensions of danger thou art running to Egypt for help, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:1,2,31:1">Isa. xxx. 1, 2; xxxi. 1</A>.

 Thou art for <I>drinking the waters of Sihor,</I>" that is,
 <I>Nilus.</I> "Thou reliest upon their multitude, and refreshest thy 
 self with the fair promises they make thee. At other times thou art 
 <I>in the way of Assyria,</I> sending or going with all speed to fetch 
 recruits thence, and thinkest to satisfy thyself with the <I>waters of 
 the river Euphrates;</I> what <I>hast thou to do</I> there? What wilt
 thou get by applying to them? They shall <I>help in vain,</I> shall be 
 broken reeds to thee, and what thou thoughtest would be to thee as a 
 river will be but a broken cistern."

 2. This also was because of their sin. The judgment shall unavoidably 
 come upon them which their sin has deserved; and then to what purpose 
 is it to call in help against it? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 "<I>Thy own wickedness shall correct thee,</I> and then it is
 impossible for them to save thee; <I>know and see</I> therefore, upon 
 the whole matter, <I>that it is an evil thing that thou hast forsaken 
 God,</I> for it is that which makes thy enemies enemies indeed, and thy 
 friends friends in vain." Observe here,

 (1.) The nature of sin; it is <I>forsaking the Lord</I> as our God; it 
 is the soul's alienation from him and aversion to him. Cleaving to sin 
 is leaving God. 

 (2.) The cause of sin; it is because <I>his fear is not in us.</I> It 
 is for want of a good principle in us, particularly for want of the 
 fear of God; this is at the bottom of our apostasy from him; men 
 forsake their duty to God because they stand in no awe of him nor have 
 any dread of his displeasure. 

 (3.) The malignity of sin; it is <I>an evil thing and a bitter.</I> Sin 
 is an evil thing, only evil, an evil that has no good in it, an evil 
 that is the root and cause of all other evil; it is evil indeed, for it 
 is not only the greatest contrariety to the divine nature, but the 
 greatest corruption of the human nature. It is <I>bitter;</I> a state 
 of sin is the <I>gall of bitterness,</I> and every sinful way will be 
 <I>bitterness in the latter end;</I> the wages of it is death, and 
 death is bitter. 

 (4.) The fatal consequences of sin; as it is in itself evil and bitter, 
 so it has a direct tendency to make us miserable: "<I>Thy own 
 wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove 
 thee,</I> not only destroy and ruin thee hereafter, but correct and 
 reprove thee now; they will certainly bring trouble upon thee; and 
 punishment will so inevitably follow the sin that the sin shall itself 
 be said to punish thee. Nay, the punishment, in its kind and 
 circumstances, shall so directly answer to the sin, that thou mayest 
 read the sin in the punishment; and the justice of the punishment shall 
 be so plain that thou shalt not have a word to say for thyself; thy own 
 wickedness shall convince thee and stop thy mouth for ever and thou 
 shalt be forced to own that <I>the Lord is righteous.</I>" 

 (5.) The use and application of all this: "<I>Know therefore,</I> and 
 see it, and repent of thy sin, that so the iniquity which is thy 
 correction <I>may not be thy ruin.</I>"</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  For of old time I have broken thy yoke, <I>and</I> burst thy
 bands; and thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every
 high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest, playing the
 harlot.
 &nbsp; 21  Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed:
 how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange
 vine unto me?

 &nbsp; 25  Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from

 Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their
 priests, and their prophets,
 &nbsp; 27  Saying to a stock, Thou <I>art</I> my father; and to a stone,
 Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned <I>their</I> back
 unto me, and not <I>their</I> face: but in the time of their trouble
 they will say, Arise, and save us.
 &nbsp; 28  But where <I>are</I> thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them
 arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for
 <I>according to</I> the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses the prophet goes on with his charge against this
 backsliding people. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The sin itself that he charges them with--idolatry, that great
 provocation which they were so notoriously guilty of. 

 1. They frequented the places of idol-worship 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 "<I>Upon every high hill and under every green tree,</I> in the high
 places and the groves, such as the heathen had a foolish fondness and 
 veneration for, <I>thou wanderest,</I> first to one and then to 
 another, like one unsettled, and still uneasy and unsatisfied; but in 
 all <I>playing the harlot,</I>" worshipping false gods, which is 
 spiritual whoredom, and was commonly accompanied with corporal whoredom 
 too. Note, Those that leave God wander endlessly, and a vagrant lust is 
 insatiable.

 2. They made images for themselves, and gave divine honour to them 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>);

 not only the common people, but even the kings and princes, who should
 have restrained the people from doing ill, and the priests and 
 prophets, who should have taught them to do well, were themselves so 
 wretchedly sottish and stupid, and under the power of such a strong 
 delusion, as to <I>say to a stock, "Thou art my father</I> (that is, 
 Thou art my god, the author of my being, to whom I owe duty and on whom 
 I have a dependence)," and <I>to a stone,</I> to an idol made of stone, 
 "<I>Thou hast</I> begotten me, or <I>brought me forth;</I> therefore 
 protect me, provide for me, and bring me up." What greater affront 
 could men put upon God, who is our Father that has made us? It was a 
 downright disowning of their obligations to him. What greater affront 
 could men put upon themselves and their own reason than to acknowledge 
 that which is in itself absurd and impossible, and, by making stocks 
 and stones their parents, to make themselves no better than stocks and 
 stones? When these were first made the objects of worship they were 
 supposed to be animated by some celestial power or spirit; but by 
 degrees the thought of this was lost, and so vain did idolaters become 
 <I>in their imagination,</I> even the princes and priests themselves, 
 that the very idol, though made of wood and stone, was supposed to be 
 their father, and adored accordingly.

 3. They multiplied these dunghill deities endlessly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):
 
 <I>According to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah!</I>
 When they had forsaken that God who is one, and all-sufficient for all,

 (1.) They were not satisfied with any gods they had, but still desired 
 more, that idolatry being in this respect of the same nature with 
 covetousness, which is spiritual idolatry (for the more men have the 
 more they would have), which is a plain evidence that what men make an 
 idol of they find to be insufficient and unsatisfying, and that it 
 cannot <I>make the comers thereunto perfect.</I> 

 (2.) They could not agree in the same god. Having left the centre of 
 unity, they fell into endless discord; one city fancied one deity and 
 another another, and each was anxious to have one of its own to be near 
 them and to take special care of them. Thus did they in vain seek that 
 in many gods which is to be found in one God only.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The proof of this. No witnesses need be called; it is proved by the 
 notorious evidence of the facts. 

 1. They went about to deny it, and were ready to plead, <I>Not
 guilty.</I> They pretended that they would acquit themselves from this 
 guilt, they <I>washed themselves with nitre,</I> and <I>took much 
 soap,</I> offered many things in excuse and extenuation of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 They pretended that they did not worship these as gods, but as demons,
 and mediators between the immortal God and mortal men, or that it was 
 not divine honour that they gave them, but civil respect; thus they 
 sought to evade the convictions of God's word and to screen themselves 
 from the dread of his wrath. Nay, some of them had the impudence to 
 deny the thing itself; they said, <I>I am not polluted, I have not gone 
 after Baalim,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Because it was done secretly, and industriously concealed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:12">Ezek. viii. 12</A>),
 
 they thought it could never be proved upon them, and they had impudence
 enough to deny it. In this, as in other things, their way was like that
 of <I>the adulterous woman, that says, I have done no wickedness,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:20">Prov. xxx. 20</A>.

 2. Notwithstanding all their evasions, they are convicted of it and
 found guilty: "<I>How canst thou</I> deny the fact, and <I>say, I have 
 not gone after Baalim?</I> How canst thou deny the fault, and say, <I>I 
 am not polluted?</I>" The prophet speaks with wonder at their 
 impudence: "How canst thou put on a face to say so, when it is 
 certain?"

 (1.) "God's omniscience is a witness against thee: <I>Thy iniquity is 
 marked before me, saith the Lord God;</I> it is laid up and hidden, to 
 be produced against thee in the day of judgment, <I>sealed up among his 
 treasures,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:34,Job+21:19,Ho+13:12">Deut. xxxii. 34;
 Job xxi. 19; Hos. xiii. 12</A>.

 "It is <I>imprinted deeply</I> and <I>stained</I> before me;" so some
 read it. "Though thou endeavour to wash it out, as murderers to get
 the stain of the blood of the person slain out of their clothes, yet it 
 will never be got out." God's eye is upon it, and we are sure that his 
 judgment is according to truth.

 (2.) "Thy own conscience is a witness against thee. <I>See thy way in
 the valley</I>" (they had worshipped idols, not only on the high hills, 
 but in the valleys, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:5,6">Isa. lvii. 5, 6</A>),

 in the <I>valley over-against Beth-peor</I> (so some), where they
 worshipped Baal-peor

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+34:6,Nu+25:3">Deut. xxxiv. 6, Num. xxv. 3</A>),

 as if the prophet looked as far back as the <I>iniquity of Peor;</I>
 but, if it mean any particular valley, surely it is the <I>valley of 
 the son of Hinnom,</I> for that was the place where they sacrificed 
 their children to Moloch and which therefore witnessed against them 
 more than any other: "look into that valley, and thou canst not but 
 <I>know what thou hast done.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The aggravations of this sin with which they are charged, which 
 made it exceedingly sinful.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God had done great things for them, and yet they revolted from him 
 and rebelled against him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>Of old time I have broken thy yoke and burst thy bonds;</I> this
 refers to the bringing of them out of the <I>land of Egypt</I> and the 
 <I>house of bondage,</I> which they would not remember

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 but God did; for, when he told them that they should have no other gods
 before him, he prefixed this as a reason: <I>I am the Lord thy God that 
 brought thee out of the land of Egypt!</I> These bonds of theirs which 
 God had loosed should have bound them for ever to him; but they had 
 ungratefully broken the bonds of duty to that God who had broken the 
 bonds of their slavery.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They had promised fair, but had not made good their promise: 
 "<I>Thou saidst, I will not transgress;</I> then, when the mercy of thy 
 deliverance was fresh, thou wast so sensible of it that thou wast 
 willing to lay thyself under the most sacred ties to continue faithful 
 to thy God and never to forsake him." Then they said, <I>Nay, but we 
 will serve the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:21">Josh. xxiv. 21</A>.

 How often have we said that we <I>would not transgress,</I> we would
 not offend any more, and yet we have <I>started aside, like a deceitful 
 bow,</I> and repeated and multiplied our transgressions!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They had wretchedly degenerated from what they were when God first 
 formed them into a people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>).

 <I>I had planted thee a noble vine.</I> The constitution of their
 government both in church and state was excellent, their laws were 
 righteous, and all the ordinances instructive and very significant; and 
 a generation of good men there was among them when they first settled 
 in Canaan. <I>Israel served the Lord,</I> and kept close to him <I>all 
 the days of Joshua, and the elders that out-lived Joshua,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:31">Josh. xxiv. 31</A>.

 They were then <I>wholly a right seed,</I> likely to replenish the
 vineyard they were planted in with choice vines. But it proved 
 otherwise; they very next generation <I>knew not the Lord, nor the 
 works which he had done</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:10">Judg. ii. 10</A>),

 and so they were worse and worse till they became <I>the degenerate
 plants of a strange vine.</I> They were now the reverse of what they 
 were at first. Their constitution was quite broken, and there was 
 nothing in them of that good which one might have expected from a 
 people so happily formed, nothing of the purity and piety of their 
 ancestors. <I>Their vine is as the vine of Sodom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:32">Deut. xxxii. 32</A>.

 This may fitly be applied to the nature of man; it was planted by its
 great author <I>a noble vine,</I> a <I>right seed</I> (God made man 
 upright); but it is so universally corrupt that it has become the 
 <I>degenerate plant of a strange vine,</I> that <I>bears gall and 
 wormwood,</I> and it is so to God, it is highly distasteful and 
 offensive to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They were violent and eager in the pursuit of their idolatries, 
 doted on their idols, and were fond of new ones, and they would not be 
 restrained form them either by the word of God or by his providence, so 
 strong was the <I>impetus</I> with which they were carried out after 
 this sin. They are here compared to a <I>swift dromedary traversing her 
 ways,</I> a female of that species of creatures hunting about for a 
 male 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 and, to the same purport, <I>a wild ass used to the wilderness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 not tamed by labour, and therefore very wanton, <I>snuffing up the wind
 at her pleasure</I> when she comes near the he-ass, and on such an 
 <I>occasion who can turn her away?</I> Who can hinder her from that 
 which she lusts after? <I>Those that seek her</I> then <I>will not 
 weary themselves for her,</I> for they know it is to no purpose; but 
 will have a little patience till she is big with young, till that month 
 comes which is the last of <I>the months that she fulfils</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:2">Job xxxix. 2</A>),

 when she is heavy and unwieldy, and then <I>they shall find her,</I>
 and she cannot out-run them. Note,

 (1.) Eager lust is a brutish thing, and those that will not be turned 
 away from the gratifying and indulging of it by reason, and conscience, 
 and honour, are to be reckoned as brute-beasts and no better, such as 
 were born, and still are, <I>like the wild ass's colt;</I> let them not 
 be looked upon as rational creatures. 

 (2.) Idolatry is strangely intoxicating, and those that are addicted to 
 it will with great difficulty be cured of it. That lust is as 
 headstrong as any. 

 (3.) There are some so violently set upon the prosecution of their 
 lusts that it is to no purpose to attempt to give check to them: those 
 that do so weary themselves in vain. <I>Ephraim is joined to idols; let 
 him alone.</I>

 (4.) The time will come when the most fierce will be tamed and the most
 wanton will be manageable; when distress and anguish come upon them,
 then their ears will be open to discipline, that is the month in which
 you may find them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:5,6">Ps. cxli. 5, 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. They were obstinate in their sin, and, as they could not be 
 restrained, so they would not be reformed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 
 Here is,

 (1.) Fair warning given them of the ruin that this wicked course of 
 life would certainly bring them to at last, with a caution therefore 
 not to persist in it, but to break off from it. He would certainly 
 bring them into a miserable captivity, when their feet should be 
 unshod, and they should be forced to travel barefoot, and when they 
 would be denied fair water by their oppressors, so that their throat 
 should be dried with thirst; this will be in the end hereof. Those that 
 affect strange gods, and strange ways of worship, will justly be made 
 prisoners to a strange king in a strange land. "Take up in time 
 therefore; thy running after thy idols will run the <I>shoes off thy 
 feet,</I> and thy panting after them will bring thy throat to thirst; 
 withhold therefore thy foot from these violent pursuits, and thy throat 
 from these violent desires." One would think that it should effectually 
 check us in the career of sin to consider what it will bring us to at 
 last. 

 (2.) Their rejecting this fair warning. They said to those that would 
 have persuaded them to repent and reform, "<I>There is no hope; no,</I> 
 never expect to work upon us, or prevail with us to cast away our 
 idols, for <I>we have loved strangers, and after them we will go;</I> 
 we are resolved we will, and therefore trouble not yourselves nor us 
 any more with your admonitions; it is to no purpose. There is no hope 
 that we should ever break the corrupt habit and disposition we have 
 got, and therefore we may as well yield to it as go about to get the 
 mastery of it." Note, Their case is very miserable who have brought 
 themselves to such a pass that their corruptions triumph over their 
 convictions; they know they should reform, but own they cannot, and 
 therefore resolve they will not. But, as we must not despair of the 
 mercy of God, but believe that sufficient for the pardon of our sins, 
 though ever so heinous, if we repent and sue for that mercy, so neither 
 must we despair of the grace of God, but believe that able to subdue 
 our corruptions, though ever so strong, if we pray for and improve that 
 grace. A man must never say <I>There is no hope,</I> as long as he is 
 on this side hell.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. They had shamed themselves by their sin, in putting confidence in 
 that which would certainly deceive them in the day of their distress, 
 and putting him away that would have helped them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:26-28"><I>v.</I> 26-28</A>.

 <I>As the thief is ashamed</I> when, notwithstanding all his arts and
 tricks to conceal his theft, he is found, and brought to punishment, 
 <I>so are the house of Israel ashamed,</I> not with a penitent shame 
 for the sin they had been guilty of, but with a penal shame for the 
 disappointment they met with in that sin. They will be ashamed when 
 they find,

 (1.) That they are forced to cry to the God whom they had put contempt 
 upon. In their prosperity they had turned the back to God and not the
 face; they had slighted him, acted as if they had forgotten him, or did 
 what they could to forget him, would not look towards him, but looked 
 another way; they went from him as fast and as far as they could; but 
 in the time of their trouble they will find no satisfaction but in 
 applying to him; then <I>they will say, Arise, and save us.</I> Their 
 fathers had many a time taken this shame to themselves 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+3:9,4:3,10:10">Judg. iii. 9, iv. 3, x. 10</A>),

 yet they would not be persuaded to cleave to God, that they might come
 to him in their trouble with the more confidence.

 (2.) That they have no relief from the gods they have made their court 
 to. They will be ashamed when they perceive that the gods they have 
 made cannot serve them, and that the God who made them will not serve 
 them. To bring them to this shame, if so be they might hereby be 
 brought to repentance, they are here sent <I>to the gods whom they 
 served,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:14">Judg. x. 14</A>.

 They cried to God, <I>Arise, and save us.</I> God says of the idols,
 "<I>Let them arise, and save thee,</I> for thou hast no reason to 
 expect that I should Let them arise, if they can, from the places where 
 they are fixed; let them try whether they can save thee: but thou wilt 
 be ashamed when thou findest that they can do thee no good, for, though 
 thou hadst a god for every city, yet <I>thy cities are burnt without 
 inhabitant,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Thus it is the folly of sinners to please themselves with that which
 will certainly be their grief, and pride themselves in that which will 
 certainly be their shame.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>29  Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed
 against me, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 30  In vain have I smitten your children; they received no

 yet my people have forgotten me days without number.
 &nbsp; 33  Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou
 also taught the wicked ones thy ways.

 poor innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon
 all these.

 shall turn from me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou
 sayest, I have not sinned.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet here goes on in the same strain, aiming to bring a sinful 
 people to repentance, that their destruction might be prevented.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He avers the truth of the charge. It was evident beyond 
 contradiction; it was the greatest absurdity imaginable in them to 
 think of denying it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 "<I>Wherefore will you plead with me,</I> and put me upon the proof of
 it, or wherefore will you go about to plead any thing in excuse of the 
 crime or to obtain a mitigation of the sentence? Your plea will 
 certainly be overruled, and judgment given against you: you know <I>you 
 have all transgressed,</I> one as well as another; why then to you 
 <I>quarrel with me</I> for contending with you?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He heightens it from the consideration both of their 
 incorrigibleness and of their ingratitude. 

 1. They had not been wrought upon by the judgments of God which they
 had been under 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 <I>In vain have I smitten your children,</I> that is, the children or
 people of Judah. They had been under divine rebukes of many kinds. God 
 therein designed to bring them to repentance; but it was <I>in 
 vain.</I> They did not answer God's end in afflicting them; their 
 consciences were not awakened, nor their hearts softened and humbled, 
 nor were they driven to seek unto God; <I>they received no 
 instruction</I> by the <I>correction,</I> were not made the better by 
 it; and it is a great loss thus to lose an affliction. They <I>did not 
 receive,</I> they did not submit to, or comply with, the correction, 
 but their hearts fretted against the Lord, and so they were <I>smitten 
 in vain.</I> Even <I>the children,</I> the <I>young people,</I> among 
 them (so it may be taken), were <I>smitten in vain;</I> they were so 
 soon prejudiced against repentance that they were as untractable as the 
 old ones that had been long <I>accustomed to do evil.</I>

 2. They had not been wrought upon by the word of God which he had sent 
 them in the mouth of his servants the prophets; nay, they had killed 
 the messengers for the sake of the message: "<I>Your own sword has 
 devoured your prophets like a destroying lion;</I> you have put them to 
 death for their faithfulness with as much rage and fury, and with as 
 much greediness and pleasure, as a lion devours his prey." Their 
 prophets, who were their greatest blessings, were treated by them as if 
 they had been the plagues of their generation, and this was their 
 measure-filling sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:16">2 Chron. xxxvi. 16</A>.

 They <I>killed their own prophets,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:15">1 Thess. ii. 15</A>.

 3. They had not been wrought upon by the favours God had bestowed upon
 them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 "<I>O generation!</I>" (he does not call them, as he might, <I>O
 faithless</I> and <I>perverse</I> generation! <I>O generation of 
 vipers!</I> but speaks gently, O you men of this generation!) "<I>see 
 the word of the Lord,</I> do not only hear it, but consider it 
 diligently, apply your minds closely to it." As we are bidden to 
 <I>hear the rod</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:9">Micah vi. 9</A>),

 for that has its voice, so we are bidden to <I>see the word,</I> for
 that has its visions, its views. It intimates that what is here said is 
 plain and undeniable; you may see it to be very evident; it is written 
 as with a sun-beam, so that he that runs may read it: <I>Have I been a 
 wilderness to Israel, a land of darkness.</I> Note, None of those who 
 have had any dealings with God ever had reason to complain of him as 
 <I>a wilderness</I> or a <I>land of darkness.</I> He has blessed us 
 with the fruits of the earth, and therefore we cannot say that he has 
 been a wilderness to us, a dry and barren land, that (as Mr. Gataker 
 expresses it) he has held us to <I>hard meat,</I> as cattle fed upon 
 the common. No; his sheep have been led into green pastures. He has 
 also blessed us with the lights of heaven, and has not withheld them, 
 so that we cannot say, He has been to us a land of darkness. He has 
 caused his sun to shine, as well as his rain to fall, upon the evil and 
 unthankful. Or the meaning is, in general, that the service of God has 
 not been to any either an unpleasant or an unprofitable service. God 
 sometimes has led his people <I>through a wilderness</I> and a <I>land 
 of darkness,</I> but he himself was then to them all that which they 
 needed; he so fed them with manna, and led them by a pillar of fire, 
 that it was to them a fruitful field and a land of light. The world is, 
 to those who make it their home and their portion, a wilderness and a 
 land of darkness, vanity and vexation of spirit; but those that dwell 
 in God have the <I>lines fallen to them in pleasant places.</I>

 4. Instead of being wrought upon by these, they had grown intolerably 
 insolent and imperious. They say, <I>We are lords; we will come no more 
 unto thee.</I> Now that they had become a potent kingdom, or thought 
 themselves such, they set up for themselves, and shook off their 
 dependence upon God. This is the language of presumptuous sinners, and 
 it is not only very impious and profane, but very unreasonable and 
 foolish.

 (1.) It is absurd for us who are subjects to say, <I>We are lords</I> 
 (that is, <I>rulers</I>) and we will come no more to <I>God</I> to 
 receive commands form him; for, as he is King of old, so he is King for 
 ever, and we can never pretend to be from under his authority. 

 (2.) It is absurd for us who are beggars to say, <I>We are lords,</I> 
 that is, We are rich, and we will come no more to God, to receive 
 favours from him, as if we could live without him and need not be 
 beholden to him. God justly takes it ill when those to whom he has
 been a bountiful benefactor care not either for hearing from him or 
 speaking to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He lays the blame of all their wickedness upon their forgetting 
 God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):

 <I>They have forgotten me;</I> they have industriously banished the
 thoughts of God out of their minds, jostled those thoughts out with 
 thoughts of their idols, and avoided all those things that would put 
 them in mind of God.

 1. Though they were his own people, in covenant with him and professing
 relation to him, and had the tokens of his presence in the midst of 
 them and of his favour to them, yet they forgot him. 

 2. They had long neglected him, <I>days without number,</I> time out
 of mind, as we say. They had not for a great while entertained any
 serious thoughts of him; so that they seem quite to have forgotten him, 
 and resolved never to remember him again. How many days of our lives 
 have passed without suitable remembrance of God! Who can number those 
 empty days? 

 3. They had not had such a regard and affection to him as young ladies
 generally have to their fine clothes: <I>Can a maid forget her 
 ornaments or a bride her attire?</I> No; their hearts are upon them; 
 they value them so much, and themselves upon them, that they are ever 
 and anon thinking and speaking of them. When they are to appear in 
 public they do not forget any of <I>their ornaments,</I> but put every 
 one in its place, as they are described,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:18">Isa. iii. 18</A>,

 &c. And <I>yet my people have forgotten me.</I> It is sad that any
 should be more in love with their fine clothes than with their God, and 
 should rather leave their religion behind them, or part with that, than 
 leave any of their ornaments behind them, or part with them. Is not
 God our ornament? Is he not <I>a crown of glory</I> and a <I>diadem of 
 beauty</I> to his people? Did we look upon him to be so, and upon our 
 religion as an <I>ornament of grace to our head</I> and <I>chains about 
 our neck</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:9">Prov. i. 9</A>),

 we should be as mindful of them as ever any maid was of her ornaments,
 or a bride of her attire, we should be as careful to preserve them and 
 as fond to appear in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He shows them what a bad influence their sins had had upon others. 
 The sins of God's professing people harden and encourage those about 
 them in their evil ways, especially when they appear forward and 
 ringleaders in sin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>):

 <I>Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love?</I> There is an allusion
 here to the practice of lewd women who strive to recommend themselves 
 by their ogling looks and gay dress, as Jezebel, who <I>painted her 
 face and tired her head.</I> Thus had they courted their neighbours 
 into sinful confederacies with them and communion in their idolatries, 
 and had <I>taught the wicked ones their ways,</I> their ways of mixing 
 God's institutions with their idolatrous customs and usages, which was 
 a great profanation of that which was sacred and made the ways of their 
 idolatry worse than that of others. Those have a great deal to answer
 for who, by their fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, 
 make wicked ones more wicked than otherwise they would be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He charges them with the guilt of murder added to the guilt of their 
 idolatry 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>):

 <I>Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls,</I> the
 life-blood <I>of the poor innocents,</I> which cried to heaven, and for 
 which God was now <I>making inquisition.</I> The reference is to the 
 children that were offered in sacrifice to Moloch; or it may be taken 
 more generally for all the <I>innocent blood</I> which Manasseh shed, 
 and with which he had <I>filled Jerusalem</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:16">2 Kings xxi. 16</A>),

 the <I>righteous blood,</I> especially the blood of the prophets and
 others that witnessed against their impieties. This blood was found 
 <I>not by secret search,</I> not <I>by diggings</I> (so the word is), 
 but <I>upon all these;</I> it was above ground. This intimates that the 
 guilt of this kind which they had contracted was certain and evident, 
 not doubtful or which would bear a dispute; and that it was avowed and 
 barefaced, and which they had not so much sense either of shame or fear 
 as to endeavour to conceal, which was a great aggravation of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. He overrules their plea of, <I>Not guilty.</I> Though this matter 
 be so plain, yet thou sayest, <I>Because I am innocent, surely his 
 anger shall turn from me;</I> and again, <I>Thou sayest, I have not 
 sinned</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>);

 therefore <I>I will plead with thee,</I> and will convince thee of thy
 mistake. Because they deny the charge, and stand upon their own 
 justification, therefore God will join issue with them and plead with 
 them, both by his word and by his rod. Those shall be made to know how 
 much they deceive themselves,

 1. Who say that they have not offended God, that they are innocent,
 though they have been guilty of the grossest enormities. 

 2. Who expect that God will be reconciled to them though they do not 
 repent and reform. They own that they had been under the tokens of 
 God's anger, but they think that it was causeless, and that they by 
 pleading innocency had proved it to be so, and therefore they conclude 
 that God will immediately let fall his action and <I>his anger shall be 
 turned from them.</I> This is very provoking, and God will plead with 
 them, and convince them that his anger is just, for they have sinned, 
 and he will never cease his controversy till they, instead of 
 justifying themselves thus, humble, and judge, and condemn 
 themselves.</P>

 VII. He upbraids them with the shameful disappointments they met with, 
 in making creatures their confidence, while they made God their enemy, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:36,37"><I>v.</I> 36, 37</A>.

 It was a piece of spiritual idolatry they were often guilty of that
 they trusted in <I>an arm of flesh</I> and their hearts therein 
 <I>departed from the Lord.</I> Now here he shows them the folly of it.

 1. They were restless, and unsatisfied in the choice of their 
 confidences: "<I>Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way?</I> 
 Doubtless it is because thou meetest not with that in those thou didst 
 confide in which thou promisedst thyself." Those that make God their 
 hope, and walk in a continual dependence upon him, need not <I>gad 
 about to change their way;</I> for their souls may return to him, and 
 repose in him, as their rest: but those that trust in creatures will be 
 perpetually uneasy, like Noah's dove, that found no rest for the sole 
 of her foot. Every thing they trust to fails them, and then they think 
 to change for the better, but they will be still disappointed. They 
 first trusted to Assyria, and, when that proved a broken reed, they 
 depended upon Egypt, and that proved no better. Creatures being vanity, 
 they will be vexation of spirit to all those that put their confidence 
 in them; they <I>gad about, seeking rest</I> and finding none. 

 2. They were quite disappointed in the confidences they made choice of; 
 so the prophet tells them they should be: <I>Thou shalt be ashamed of 
 Egypt,</I> which thou now trustest in, as formerly <I>thou wast of 
 Assyria, who distressed them and helped them not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:20">2 Chron. xxviii. 20</A>.

 The Jews were a peculiar people in their profession of religion, and
 for that reason none of the neighbouring nations cared for them, nor 
 could heartily love them; and yet the Jews were still courting them, 
 and confiding in them, and were well enough served when deceived by 
 them. See what will come of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>):

 <I>Thou shalt go forth from him,</I> thy ambassadors or envoys shall
 return from Egypt <I>re infect&acirc;--disappointed,</I> and therefore 
 <I>with their hands upon their heads,</I> lamenting the desperate 
 condition of their people. Or, <I>Thou shalt go forth hence,</I> that 
 is, into captivity in a strange land, <I>with thy hands upon thy 
 head,</I> holding it because it aches (<I>ubi dolor ibi digitus--where 
 the pain is the finger will be applied</I>), or as people ashamed, for 
 Tamar, in the height of her confusion, <I>laid her hand on her 
 head,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+13:19">2 Sam. xiii. 19</A>.

 "And Egypt, that thou reliest on, shall not be able to prevent it nor
 to rescue thee out of captivity." Those that will not lay their hand on 
 their heart in godly sorrow, which works life, shall be made to lay 
 their hand on their head in the sorrow of the world, which works death. 
 And no wonder that Egypt cannot help them, when God will not, If the 
 Lord do not help thee, whence should I? The Egyptians are broken
 reeds, for <I>the Lord has rejected thy confidences;</I> he will not 
 make use of them for thy relief, will neither so far honour them, nor 
 so far give countenance to thy confidence in them, as to appoint them to 
 be the instruments of any good to thee, and therefore <I>thou shalt not 
 prosper in them;</I> they shall not stand thee in any stead nor give 
 thee any satisfaction. As <I>there is no counsel or wisdom</I> that can 
 prevail against the Lord, so there is none that can prevail without 
 him. Some read it, <I>The Lord has rejected thee for thy 
 confidences;</I> because thou hast dealt so unfaithfully with him as to 
 trust in his creatures, nay, in his enemies when thou shouldst have 
 trusted in him only, he has abandoned thee to that destruction from 
 which thou thoughtest thus to shelter thyself; and then thou <I>canst 
 not prosper,</I> for none ever either hardened himself against God or 
 estranged himself from God and prospered.</P>
