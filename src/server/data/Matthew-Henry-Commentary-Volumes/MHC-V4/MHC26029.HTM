 Three chapters we had concerning Tyre and its king; next follow four
 chapters concerning Egypt and its king. This is the first of them.
 Egypt had formerly been a house of bondage to God's people; of late
 they had had but too friendly a correspondence with it, and had
 depended too much upon it; and therefore, whether the prediction
 reached Egypt or no, it would be of use to Israel, to take them off
 from their confidence in their alliance with it. The prophecies against
 Egypt, which are all laid together in these four chapters, were of five
 several dates; the first in the 10th year of the captivity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:1">ver. 1</A>),

 the second in the 27th

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:17">ver. 17</A>),

 the third in the 11th year and the first month

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:20"><I>ch.</I> xxx. 20</A>),

 the fourth in the 11th year and the third month 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:1"><I>ch.</I> xxxi. 1</A>),

 the fifth in the 12th year 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:1"><I>ch.</I> xxxii. 1</A>),

 and another in the same year, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:17">ver. 17</A>.

 In this chapter we have,

 I. The destruction of Pharaoh foretold, for his dealing deceitfully
 with Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 II. The desolation of the land of Egypt foretold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:8-12">ver. 8-12</A>.

 III. A promise of the restoration thereof, in part, after forty years, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:13-16">ver. 13-16</A>.

 IV. The possession that should be given to Nebuchadnezzar of the land 
 of Egypt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:17-20">ver. 17-20</A>.
 
 V. A promise of mercy to Israel,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  In the tenth year, in the tenth <I>month,</I> in the twelfth <I>day</I>
 of the month, the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and
 prophesy against him, and against all Egypt:
 &nbsp; 3  Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Behold, I <I>am</I>
 against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth
 in the midst of his rivers, which hath said, My river <I>is</I> mine
 own, and I have made <I>it</I> for myself.
 &nbsp; 4  But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish
 of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up
 out of the midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers
 shall stick unto thy scales.
 &nbsp; 5  And I will leave thee <I>thrown</I> into the wilderness, thee and
 all the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open fields;
 thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given
 thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the
 heaven.
 &nbsp; 6  And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I <I>am</I> the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of
 Israel.
 &nbsp; 7  When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break,
 and rend all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou
 brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The date of this prophecy against Egypt. It was in the <I>tenth year 
 of the captivity,</I> and yet it is placed after the prophecy against 
 Tyre, which was delivered in the eleventh year, because, in the 
 accomplishment of the prophecies, the destruction of Tyre happened 
 before the destruction of Egypt, and Nebuchadnezzar's gaining Egypt was 
 the reward of his service against Tyre; and <I>therefore</I> the 
 prophecy against Tyre is put first, that we may the better observe 
 that. But particular notice must be taken of this, that the first 
 prophecy against Egypt was just at the time when the king of Egypt was 
 coming to relieve Jerusalem and raise the siege 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+37:5">Jer. xxxvii. 5</A>),

 but did not answer the expectations of the Jews from them. Note, It is
 good to foresee the failing of all our creature-confidences, then when 
 we are most in temptation to depend upon them, that we may <I>cease 
 from man.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The scope of this prophecy. It is directed against <I>Pharaoh king 
 of Egypt, and against all Egypt,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The prophecy against Tyre began with the people, and then proceeded 
 against the prince. But this begins with the prince, because it began 
 to have its accomplishment in the insurrections and rebellions of the 
 people against the prince, not long after this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The prophecy itself. Pharaoh Hophrah (for so was the reigning 
 Pharaoh surnamed) is here represented by a <I>great dragon,</I> or 
 crocodile, that <I>lies in the midst of his rivers,</I> as Leviathan in 
 the waters, to <I>play therein,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Nilus, the river of Egypt, was famed for crocodiles. And what is the 
 king of Egypt, in God's account, but a <I>great dragon,</I> venomous 
 and mischievous? Therefore says God, <I>I am against thee. I am above 
 thee;</I> so it may be read. How high soever the princes and
 potentates of the earth are, there is a <I>higher than they</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:8">Eccl. v. 8</A>),

 a God above them, that can control them, and, if they be tyrannical and
 oppressive, a God against them, that will be free to reckon with them. 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The pride and security of Pharaoh. He <I>lies in the midst of his 
 rivers,</I> rolls himself with a great deal of satisfaction in his 
 wealth and pleasures; and he says, <I>My river is my own.</I> He boasts 
 that he is an absolute prince (his subjects are his vassals; Joseph 
 bought them long ago, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+47:23">Gen. xlvii. 23</A>),--

 that he is a sole prince, and has neither partner in the government nor
 competitor for it,--that he is out of debt (what he has is his 
 <I>own,</I> and none of his neighbours have any demands upon 
 him),--that he is independent, neither tributary nor accountable to 
 any. Note, Worldly carnal minds please themselves with, and pride 
 themselves in, their property, forgetting that whatever we have we have 
 only the use of it, the property is in God. We ourselves are not our 
 own, but his. Our <I>tongues are not our own,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:4">Ps. xii. 4</A>.

 Our river is not <I>our own,</I> for its springs are in God. The most
 potent prince cannot call what he has his own, for, though it be so 
 against all the world, it is not so against God. But Pharaoh's reason 
 for his pretensions is yet more absurd: <I>My river is my own,</I> for 
 <I>I have made it for myself.</I> Here he usurps two of the divine 
 prerogatives, to be the author and the end of his own being and 
 felicity. He only that is the great Creator can say of this world, and 
 of every thing in it, <I>I have made it for myself.</I> He calls his 
 river his own because he <I>looks not unto the Maker thereof, nor has 
 respect unto him that fashioned it long ago,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:11">Isa. xxii. 11</A>.

 What we have we have received from God and must use for God, so that we
 cannot say, We made it, much less, We made it for ourselves; and why 
 then do we boast? Note, Self is the great idol that all the world 
 worships, in contempt of God and his sovereignty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The course God will take with this proud man, to humble him. He is a 
 great dragon in the waters, and God will accordingly deal with him, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 (1.) He will draw him out of his rivers, for he has <I>a hook and a 
 cord</I> for this <I>leviathan,</I> with which he can manage him, 
 though none on earth can 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:1">Job xli. 1</A>):

 "<I>I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers,</I> will cast
 thee out of thy palace, out of thy kingdom, out of all those things in 
 which thou takest such a complacency and placest such a confidence." 
 Herodotus related of this Pharaoh, who was now king of Egypt, that he 
 had reigned in great prosperity for twenty-five years, and was so 
 elevated with his successes that he said that <I>God himself would not 
 cast him out of his kingdom;</I> but he shall soon be convinced of his 
 mistake, and what he depended on shall be no defence. God can force men 
 out of that in which they are most secure and easy.

 (2.) <I>All his fish</I> shall be drawn out with him, his servants, his 
 soldiers, and all that had a dependence on him, as he thought, but 
 really such as he had dependence upon. These shall <I>stick to his 
 scales,</I> adhere to their king, resolving to live and die with him. 
 But, 

 (3.) The king and his army, the dragon and all the fish that stick to 
 his scales, shall perish together, as fish cast upon dry ground, and 
 shall be <I>meat to the beasts and fowls,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Now this is supposed to have had its accomplishment soon after, when 
 this Pharaoh, in defence of Aricius king of Libya, who had been 
 expelled his kingdom by the Cyrenians, levied a great army, and went 
 out against the Cyrenians, to re-establish his friend, but was defeated 
 in battle, and all his forces were put to flight, which gave such 
 disgust to his kingdom that they rose in rebellion against him. Thus 
 was he left <I>thrown into the wilderness, he and all the fish of the 
 river</I> with him. Thus issue men's pride, and presumption, and carnal 
 security. Thus men justly lose what they might call their own, under 
 God, when they call it their own against him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The ground of the controversy God has with the Egyptians; it is 
 because they have cheated his people. They encouraged them to expect 
 relief and assistance from them when they were in distress, but failed 
 them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>):

 <I>Because they have been a staff of reed to the house of</I> Israel. 
 They pretended to be a staff for them to lean upon, but, when any 
 stress was laid upon them, they were either weak and could not or 
 treacherous and would not do that for them which was expected. They 
 <I>broke under them,</I> to their great disappointment and amazement, 
 so that they <I>rent their shoulder</I> and <I>made all their loins to 
 be at a stand.</I> The king of Egypt, it is probable, had encouraged 
 Zedekiah to break his league with the king of Babylon, with a promise 
 that he would stand by him, which, when he failed to do, to any 
 purpose, it could not but put them into a great consternation. God had 
 told them, long since, that the Egyptians were broken reeds, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:6">Isa. xxx. 6, 7</A>.
 
 Rabshakeh had told them so,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+36:6">Isa. xxxvi. 6</A>.

 And now they found it so. It was indeed the folly of Israel to trust
 them, and they were well enough served when they were deceived in them. 
 God was righteous in suffering them to be so. But that is no excuse at 
 all for the Egyptians' falsehood and treachery, nor shall it secure 
 them from the judgments of that God who is and will be the avenger of 
 all such wrongs. It is a great sin, and very provoking to God, as well 
 as unjust, ungrateful, and very dishonourable and unkind, to put a 
 cheat upon those that put a confidence in us.</P>

 I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were
 scattered:
 &nbsp; 14  And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will
 cause them to return <I>into</I> the land of Pathros, into the land of
 their habitation; and they shall be there a base kingdom.
 &nbsp; 15  It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it
 exalt itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish
 them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.
 &nbsp; 16  And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of
 Israel, which bringeth <I>their</I> iniquity to remembrance, when they

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This explains the foregoing prediction, which was figurative, and looks 
 something further. Here is a prophecy,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Of the ruin of Egypt. The threatening of this is very full and 
 particular; and the sin for which this ruin shall be brought upon them 
 is their pride, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 They said, <I>The river is mine and I have made it;</I> therefore their 
 land shall spue them out. 

 1. God is against them, both against the king and against the people,
 <I>against thee and against thy rivers.</I> Waters signify <I>people 
 and multitudes,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:15">Rev. xvii. 15</A>.

 2. Multitudes of them shall be cut off by the sword of war, a sword 
 which God will bring upon them to destroy <I>both man and beast,</I> 
 the sword of civil war. 

 3. The country shall be depopulated. The <I>land of Egypt shall be
 desolate and waste</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 the country not cultivated, the cities not inhabited. The wealth of 
 both was their pride, and that God will take away. It <I>shall be 
 utterly waste (wastes of waste,</I> so the margin reads it), <I>and 
 desolate</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);

 <I>neither men nor beasts shall pass through it, nor shall it be 
 inhabited</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);

 it shall be <I>desolate in the midst of the countries that are so,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 This was the effect not so much of those wars spoken of before, which 
 were made by them, but of the war which the king of Babylon made upon 
 them. It shall be desolate from one end of the land to the other, 
 <I>from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia.</I> The 
 sin of pride is enough to ruin a whole nation. 

 4. The people shall be dispersed and scattered among the nations

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 so that those who thought the balance of power was in their hand should 
 now become a contemptible people. Such a fall does a haughty spirit go 
 before.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Of the restoration of Egypt after awhile, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Egypt shall lie <I>desolate forty years</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>)

 and then <I>I will bring again the captivity of Egypt,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Some date the forty years from Nebuchadnezzar's destroying Egypt, 
 others from the desolation of Egypt some time before; however, they end 
 about the first year of Cyrus, when the seventy years' captivity of 
 Judah ended, or soon after. Then this prediction was accomplished, 

 1. That God will gather the Egyptians out of all the countries into
 which they were dispersed, and make them to <I>return to the land of 
 their habitation,</I> and give them a settlement there again,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Note, Though God will find out a way to humble the proud, yet he will 
 not contend for ever, no, not with them in this world. 

 2. That yet they shall not make a figure again as they have done. Egypt 
 shall be <I>a kingdom</I> again, but it shall be the <I>basest of the 
 kingdoms</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);

 it shall have but little wealth and power, and shall not extend its 
 conquests as formerly; it shall be the tail of the nations, and not the 
 head. It is a mercy that it shall become a kingdom again, but, to 
 humble it, it shall be a despicable kingdom; it shall be a long time 
 before it recover any thing like its ancient lustre. For two reasons it 
 shall be thus mortified:--

 (1.) That it may not domineer over its neighbours, that it may not 
 <I>exalt itself above the nations,</I> nor <I>rule over the 
 nations,</I> as it has done, but that it may know what it is to be low 
 and despised. Note, Those who abuse their power will justly be
 stripped of it; and God, as King of nations, will find out a way to 
 maintain the injured rights and liberties, not only of his own, but of 
 other nations. 

 (2.) That it may not deceive the people of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>It shall no more be the confidence of the house of Israel;</I> they 
 shall no more be in temptation to trust in it as they have done, which 
 is a sin that <I>brings their iniquity to remembrance,</I> that is, 
 provokes God to punish them not for that only, but for all their other 
 sins. Or it <I>puts them in mind</I> of their idolatries to return to 
 them, <I>when they look</I> to the idolaters, to repose a confidence in 
 them. Note, The creatures we confide in are often <I>therefore</I> 
 ruined, because there is no other way effectually to cure us of our 
 confidence in them. Rather than Israel shall be ensnared again, the
 whole land of Egypt shall be laid waste. He that once <I>gave Egypt for 
 their ransom</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:3">Isa. xliii. 3</A>)

 will now give Egypt for their cure; and it shall be destroyed rather
 than Israel shall not in this particular be reformed. God, not only in
 justice, but in wisdom and goodness to us, breaks those creature-stays 
 which we lean too much upon, and makes them to be no more, that they 
 may be no more our confidence.</P>

 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 18  Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army
 to serve a great service against Tyrus: every head <I>was</I> made
 bald, and every shoulder <I>was</I> peeled: yet had he no wages, nor
 his army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served against
 it:
 &nbsp; 19  Therefore thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Behold, I will give the
 land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall
 take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it
 shall be the wages for his army.
 &nbsp; 20  I have given him the land of Egypt <I>for</I> his labour
 wherewith he served against it, because they wrought for me,
 saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 21  In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to
 bud forth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the
 midst of them; and they shall know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The date of this prophecy is observable; it was in the twenty-seventh 
 year of Ezekiel's captivity, sixteen years after the prophecy in the 
 former part of the chapter, and almost as long after those which follow 
 in the next chapters; but it comes in here for the explication of all 
 that was said against Egypt. After the destruction of Jerusalem 
 Nebuchadnezzar spent two or three campaigns in the conquest of the 
 Ammonites and Moabites and making himself master of their countries. 
 Then he spent thirteen years in the siege of Tyre. During all that time 
 the Egyptians were embroiled in war with the Cyrenians and one with 
 another, by which they were very much weakened and impoverished; and 
 just at the end of the siege of Tyre God delivers this prophecy to 
 Ezekiel, to signify to him that that utter destruction of Egypt which 
 he had foretold fifteen or sixteen years before, which had been but in 
 part accomplished hitherto, should now be completed by Nebuchadnezzar. 
 The prophecy which begins here, it should seem, is continued to the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:20">twentieth verse</A>

 of the next chapter. And Dr. Lightfoot observes that it is the last
 prophecy we have of this prophet, and should have been last in the 
 book, but is laid here, that all the prophecies against Egypt might 
 come together. The particular destruction of Pharaoh-Hophrah, foretold
 in the former part of this chapter, was likewise foretold 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+44:30">Jer. xliv. 30</A>.
 
 This general devastation of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar was foretold 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+43:10">Jer. xliii. 10</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What success God would give to Nebuchadnezzar and his forces against 
 Egypt. God gave him <I>that land,</I> that he might <I>take the 
 spoil</I> and <I>prey</I> of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 It was a cheap and easy prey. He subdued it with very little 
 difficulty; the blood and treasure expended upon the conquest of it 
 were inconsiderable. But it was a rich prey, and he carried off a great 
 deal from it that was of value. Their having been divided among 
 themselves, no doubt, gave a common enemy great advantage against them, 
 who, when they had been so long preying upon one another, soon made a 
 prey of them all. <I>En! quo discordia cives perduxit miseros--What 
 wretchedness does civil discord bring!</I> Jeremiah foretold that 
 Nebuchadnezzar should <I>array himself with the land of Egypt as a 
 shepherd puts on his coat,</I> which intimates what a rich and cheap 
 prey it should be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Upon what considerations God would give Nebuchadnezzar this success 
 against Egypt; it was to be a recompence to him for the hard service 
 with which he had caused his army to serve against Tyre, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:18,20"><I>v.</I> 18, 20</A>.

 1. The taking of Tyre was a tedious piece of work; it cost
 Nebuchadnezzar abundance of blood and treasure. It held out thirteen 
 years; all that time the Chaldean army was hard at it, to make 
 themselves masters of it. A large current of the sea, between Tyre and 
 the continent, was filled up with earth, and many other difficulties 
 which were thought insuperable they had to struggle with; but so great 
 a prince, having begun such an undertaking, thought himself bound in 
 honour to push it on, whatever it cost him. How many thousand lives 
 have been sacrificed to such points of honour as this as! In 
 prosecuting this siege <I>every head was made bald, and every shoulder 
 peeled,</I> with carrying burdens and labouring in the water when they 
 had a strong tide and a strong town to contend with. Egypt, a large 
 kingdom, being divided within itself, is easily conquered; Tyre, a 
 single city, being unanimous, is with difficulty subdued. Those that 
 have much to do in the world find some affairs go on a great deal more 
 readily and easily than others. But, 

 2. In this service God own that they <I>wrought for him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 He set them at work, for the humbling of a proud city and its king, 
 though <I>they meant not so, neither did their heart think so,</I> who 
 were employed in it. Note, Even great men and bad men are tools that 
 God makes use of, and are <I>working for him</I> even when they are 
 pursuing their own covetous and ambitious designs; so wonderfully does 
 God overrule all to his own glory. Yet, 

 3. For this service he had <I>no wages</I> nor <I>his army.</I> He was
 at a vast expense to take Tyre; and when he had it, though it was a 
 very rich city, and he promised himself good plunder for his army from 
 it, he was disappointed; the Tyrians sent away by ship their best 
 effects, and threw the rest into the sea, so that they had nothing but 
 bare walls. Thus are the children of this world ordinarily frustrated
 in their highest expectations from it. Therefore, 

 4. He shall have the spoil of Egypt to recompense him for his service 
 against Tyre. Note, God will be behind-hand with none for any service 
 they do for him, but, one way or other, will recompense them for it; 
 none shall kindle a fire on his altar for nought. The service done for 
 him by worldly men, with worldly designs, shall be recompensed with a 
 mere worldly reward, which his faithful servants, that have a sincere 
 regard to his will and glory, would not be put off with. This accounts 
 for the prosperity of wicked men in this world; God is in it paying 
 them for some service or other, in which he has made use of them.
 <I>Verily they have their reward.</I> Let none envy it them. The 
 conquest of Egypt is spoken of as Nebuchadnezzar's <I>full reward,</I> 
 for that completed his dominion over the then known world in a manner; 
 that was the last of the kingdoms he subdued; when he was master of 
 that he became the <I>head of gold.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The mercy God had in store for the house of Israel soon after. 
 When the tide is at the highest it will turn, and so it will when it is 
 at the lowest. Nebuchadnezzar was in the zenith of his glory when he 
 had conquered Egypt, but within a year after he ran mad 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:28-37">Dan. iv.</A>),

 was so seven years, and within a year or two after he had recovered his
 senses he resigned his life. When he was at the highest Israel was at 
 the lowest; then were they in the depth of their captivity, their bones 
 dead and dry; but <I>in that day the horn of the house of Israel shall 
 bud forth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 The day of their deliverance shall begin to dawn, and they shall have 
 some little reviving in their bondage, in the honour that shall be 
 done, 

 1. To their princes; they are the <I>horns of the house of Israel,</I>
 the seat of their glory and power. These began to bud forth when Daniel 
 and his fellows were highly preferred in Babylon; Daniel <I>sat in the 
 gate of the city; Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, were set over the 
 affairs of the province</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:49">Dan. ii. 49</A>);

 these were all <I>of the king's seed, and of the princes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:3">Dan. i. 3</A>.
 
 And it was within a year after the conquest of Egypt that they were
 thus preferred; and, soon after, three of them were made famous by the 
 honour God put upon them in bringing them alive out of the burning 
 fiery furnace. This might very well be called the <I>budding forth of 
 the horn of the house of Israel.</I> And, some years after, this 
 promise had a further accomplishment in the enlargement and elevation 
 of Jehoiachin king of Judah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:31,32">Jer. lii. 31, 32</A>.

 They were both tokens of God's favour to Israel, and happy omens.

 2. To their prophets. And <I>I will give thee the opening of the 
 mouth.</I> Though none of Ezekiel's prophecies, after this, are 
 recorded, yet we have reason to think he went on prophesying, and with 
 more liberty and boldness, when Daniel and his fellows were in power, 
 and would be ready to protect him not only from the Babylonians, but 
 from the wicked ones of his own people. Note, It bodes well to a
 people when God enlarges the liberties of his ministers and they are 
 countenanced and encouraged in their work.</P>
