 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The scope of this chapter is much the same with that of the 17th, to 
 foretel and lament the ruin of the house of David, the royal family of 
 Judah, in the calamitous exit of the four sons and grandsons of 
 Josiah--Jehoahaz, Jehoiakim, Jeconiah, and Zedekiah, in whom that
 illustrious line of kings was cut off, which the prophet is here 
 ordered to lament, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+19:1">ver. 1</A>.

 And he does it by similitudes.

 I. The kingdom of Judah and house of David are here compared to a
 lioness, and those princes to lions, that were fierce and ravenous, but 
 were hunted down and taken in nets, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+19:2-9">ver. 2-9</A>.

 II. That kingdom and that house are here compared to a vine, and these
 princes to branches, which had been strong and flourishing, but were
 now broken off and burnt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+19:10-14">ver. 10-14</A>.

 This ruin of that monarchy was now in the doing, and this lamentation 
 of it was intended to affect the people with it, that they might not 
 flatter themselves with vain hopes of the lengthening out of their 
 tranquility.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of
 Israel,
 &nbsp; 2  And say, What <I>is</I> thy mother? A lioness: she lay down among
 lions, she nourished her whelps among young lions.
 &nbsp; 3  And she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion,
 and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men.
 &nbsp; 4  The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and
 they brought him with chains unto the land of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 5  Now when she saw that she had waited, <I>and</I> her hope was
 lost, then she took another of her whelps, <I>and</I> made him a young
 lion.
 &nbsp; 6  And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young
 lion, and learned to catch the prey, <I>and</I> devoured men.
 &nbsp; 7  And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their
 cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, by
 the noise of his roaring.
 &nbsp; 8  Then the nations set against him on every side from the
 provinces, and spread their net over him: he was taken in their
 pit.
 &nbsp; 9  And they put him in ward in chains, and brought him to the
 king of Babylon: they brought him into holds, that his voice
 should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.

 Here are, 

 I. Orders given to the prophet to bewail the fall of the royal family, 
 which had long made so great a figure by virtue of a covenant of
 royalty made with David and his seed, so that the eclipsing and
 extinguishing of it are justly lamented by all who know what value to
 put upon the <I>covenant of our God,</I> as we find, after a very large
 account of that covenant with David

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:3,20">
 Ps. lxxxix. 3, 20</A>,

 &c.), a sad lamentation for the decays and desolations of his family

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+89:38,39"><I>v.</I> 38, 39</A>):

 <I>But thou hast cast off and abhorred, hast made void the covenant of 
 thy servant and profaned his crown,</I> &c. The kings of Judah are here 
 called <I>princes of Israel;</I> for their glory was diminished and 
 they had become but as princes, and their purity was lost; they had 
 become corrupt and idolatrous as the <I>kings of Israel,</I> whose ways 
 they had learned. The prophet must <I>take up a lamentation</I> for 
 them; that is, he must describe their lamentable fall as one that did 
 himself lay it to heart, and desired that those he preached and wrote 
 to might do so to. And how can we expect that others should be affected 
 with that which we ourselves are not affected with? Ministers, when
 they boldly foretel, must yet bitterly lament the destruction of 
 sinners, as those that have not <I>desired the woeful day.</I> He is 
 not directed to give advice to the princes of Israel (that had been 
 long and often done in vain), but, the decree having gone forth, he 
 must <I>take up a lamentation</I> for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Instructions given him what to say. 

 1. He must compare the kingdom of Judah to a <I>lioness,</I> so
 wretchedly degenerated was it from what it had been formerly, when it 
 sat as a queen among the nations,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+19:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 <I>What is thy mother?</I> thine, O king? (we read of Solomon's crown 
 wherewith his mother crowned him, that is, his people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:11">Cant. iii. 11</A>),
 
 thine, O Judah? The royal family is as a mother to the kingdom, a
 nursing mother. She is a <I>lioness,</I> fierce, and cruel, and 
 ravenous. When they had left their divinity they soon lost their 
 humanity too; and, when they <I>feared not God,</I> neither did they 
 <I>regard man.</I> She <I>lay down among lions.</I> God had said, 
 <I>The people</I> shall dwell alone, but they <I>mingled with the 
 nations</I> and <I>learned their works.</I> She <I>nourished her whelps 
 among young lions,</I> taught the young princes the way of tyrants, 
 which was then used by the arbitrary kings of the east, filled their 
 heads betimes with notions of their absolute despotic power, and 
 possessed them with a belief that they had a right to enslave their 
 subjects, that their liberty and property lay at their mercy: thus 
 <I>she nourished her whelps among young lions.</I> 

 2. He must compare the kings of Judah to <I>lions' whelps,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+19:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Jacob had compared Judah, and especially the house of David, to a 
 <I>lion's whelp,</I> for its being strong and formidable to its enemies 
 abroad 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:9">Gen. xlix. 9</A>,

 <I>He is an old lion; who shall stir him up?</I>) and, if they had 
 adhered to the divine law and promise, God would have preserved to them 
 the might, and majesty, and dominion of a lion, and does it in Christ, 
 the <I>Lion of the tribe of Judah.</I> But these <I>lions' whelps</I> 
 were so to their own subjects, were cruel and oppressive to them, 
 preyed upon their estates and liberties; and, when they thus by their 
 tyranny made themselves a terror to those whom they ought to have 
 protected, it was just with God to make those a terror to them whom 
 otherwise they might have subdued. Here is lamented,

 (1.) The sin and fall of Jehoahaz, one of the whelps of this lioness. 
 He <I>became a young lion</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+19:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 he was made king, and thought he was made so that he might do what he 
 pleased, and gratify his own ambition, covetousness, and revenge, as he 
 had a mind; and so he was soon master of all the arts of tyranny; he 
 <I>learned to catch the prey and devoured men.</I> When he got power 
 into his hand, all that had before in any thing disobliged him were 
 made to feel his resentments and become a sacrifice to his rage. But 
 what came of it? He did not prosper long in his tyranny: <I>The nations 
 heard of him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+19:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 heard how furiously he drove at his first coming to the crown, how he 
 trampled upon all that is just and sacred, and violated all his 
 engagements, so that they looked upon him as a dangerous neighbour, and 
 prosecuted him accordingly, <I>as a multitude of shepherds is called 
 forth against a lion roaring on his prey,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+31:4">Isa. xxxi. 4</A>.

 And <I>he was taken,</I> as a beast of prey, <I>in their pit.</I> His
 own subjects durst not stand up in defence of their liberties, but God 
 raised up a foreign power that soon put an end to his tyranny, and 
 <I>brought him in chains to the land of Egypt.</I> Thither Jehoahaz was 
 carried captive, and never heard of more.

 (2.) The like sin and fall of his successor Jehoiakim. The <I>kingdom
 of Judah</I> for some time expected the return of Jehoahaz out of 
 Egypt, but at length despaired of it, and then <I>took another</I> of 
 the <I>lion's</I> whelps, and <I>made him a young lion,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+19:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 And he, instead of taking warning by his brother's fate to use his 
 power with equity and moderation, and to seek the good of his people, 
 trod in his brother's steps: <I>He went up and down among the 
 lions,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+19:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 He consulted and conversed with those that were fierce and furious like 
 himself, and took his measures from them, as Rehoboam took the advice 
 of the rash and hot-headed young men. And he soon learned to <I>catch 
 the prey,</I> and he <I>devoured men</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+19:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 he seized his subjects' estates, fined and imprisoned them, filled his 
 treasury by rapine and injustice, sequestrations and confiscations, 
 fines and forfeitures, and swallowed up all that stood in his way. He 
 had got the art of discovering what effects men had that lay concealed, 
 and where the treasures were which they had hoarded up; he <I>knew 
 their desolate places</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+19:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 where they his <I>their money</I> and sometimes hid <I>themselves;</I> 
 he knew where to find both out; and by his oppression he <I>laid waste 
 their cities,</I> depopulated them by forcing the inhabitants to remove 
 their families to some place of safety. <I>The land was desolate,</I> 
 and the country villages were deserted; and though there was great 
 plenty, and a fulness of all good things, yet people quitted it all for 
 fear of <I>the noise of his roaring.</I> He took a pride in making all 
 his subjects afraid of him, as the lion makes all the beasts of the 
 forest to tremble 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:8">Amos iii. 8</A>),

 and by his terrible roaring so astonished them that they fell down for
 fear, and, having not spirit to make their escape, became an easy prey 
 to him, as they say the lions do. He hectored, and threatened, and 
 talked big, and bullied people out of what they had. Thus he thought to 
 establish his own power, but it had a contrary effect, it did but 
 hasten his own ruin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+19:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>The nations set against him on every side,</I> to restrain and 
 reduce his exorbitant power, which they joined in confederacy to do for 
 their common safety; and <I>they spread their net over him,</I> formed 
 designs against him. God brought against Jehoiakim bands of the 
 Syrians, Moabites, and Ammonites, with the Chaldees 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:2">2 Kings xxiv. 2</A>),

 and he was <I>taken in their pit. Nebuchadnezzar bound him in fetters
 to carry him to Babylon,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:6">2 Chron. xxxvi. 6</A>.

 They put this lion within grates, bound him <I>in chains,</I> and
 <I>brought him to the king of Babylon,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+19:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 What became of him we know not; but <I>his voice was nowhere heard</I> 
 roaring <I>upon the mountains of Israel.</I> There was an end of his 
 tyranny: he was <I>buried with the burial of an ass</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:19">Jer. xxii. 19</A>),
 
 though he had been as a lion, <I>the terror of the mighty in the land
 of the living.</I> Note, The righteousness of God is to be acknowledged 
 when those who have terrified and enslaved others are themselves 
 terrified and enslaved, when those who by the abuse of their power to 
 destruction which was given them for edification make themselves as 
 wild beasts, as <I>roaring lions and ranging bears</I> (for such, 
 Solomon says, <I>wicked rulers</I> are <I>over the poor people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:15">Prov. xxviii. 15</A>),

 are treated as such--when those who, like Ishmael, have their <I>hand 
 against every man,</I> come at last to have <I>every man's hand against 
 them.</I> It was long since observed that bloody tyrants seldom die in 
 peace, but have blood given them to drink, for they are worthy.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Thy mother <I>is</I> like a vine in thy blood, planted by the
 waters: she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many
 waters.
 &nbsp; 11  And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare
 rule, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and
 she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches.
 &nbsp; 12  But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the
 ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods
 were broken and withered; the fire consumed them.
 &nbsp; 13  And now she <I>is</I> planted in the wilderness, in a dry and
 thirsty ground.
 &nbsp; 14  And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, <I>which</I> hath
 devoured her fruit, so that she hath no strong rod <I>to be</I> a
 sceptre to rule. This <I>is</I> a lamentation, and shall be for a
 lamentation.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Jerusalem, the mother-city, is here represented by another similitude; 
 she is a vine, and the princes are her branches. This comparison we had 
 before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+15:1"><I>ch.</I> xv. 1</A>.

 Jerusalem is as <I>a vine;</I> the Jewish nation is so: <I>Like a vine
 in they blood</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+19:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 the blood-royal, like a vine set in blood and watered with blood, which 
 contributes very much to the flourishing and fruitfulness of vines, as 
 if the blood which had been shed had been designed for the fattening 
 and improving of the soil, in such plenty was it shed; and for a time 
 it seemed to have that effect, for she was <I>fruitful and full of 
 branches</I> by reason of the waters, the <I>many waters</I> near which 
 she was <I>planted.</I> Places of great wickedness may prosper for a 
 while; and a vine set in blood may be full of branches. Jerusalem was 
 full of able magistrates, men of sense, men of learning and experience, 
 that were <I>strong rods,</I> branches of this vine of uncommon bulk 
 and strength, or poles for the support of this vine, for such 
 magistrates are. The boughs of this vine had grown to such maturity 
 that they were fit to make white staves of for <I>the sceptres of those 
 that bore rule,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+19:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 And those are <I>strong rods</I> that are fit for <I>sceptres,</I> men 
 of strong judgments and strong resolutions that are fit for 
 magistrates. When the royal family of Judah was numerous, and the
 courts of justice were filled with men of sense and probity, then 
 <I>Jerusalem's stature was exalted among thick branches;</I> when the 
 government is in good able hands a nation is thereby made considerable 
 Then she was not taken for a weak and lowly vine, but <I>she appeared 
 in her height,</I> a distinguished city, <I>with the multitude of her 
 branches. Tanquam lenta solent inter viburna cupressi--Midst humble 
 withies thus the cypress soars. "In thy quietness</I>" (so some read 
 that, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+19:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>,

 which we translate <I>in thy blood</I>) "thou wast such a vine as 
 this." When Zedekiah was quiet and easy under the king of Babylon's 
 yoke his kingdom flourished thus. See how slow God is to anger, how he 
 defers his judgments, and waits to be gracious. 

 2. This vine is now quite destroyed. Nebuchadnezzar, being highly 
 provoked by Zedekiah's treachery, <I>plucked it up in fury</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+19:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 ruined the city and kingdom, and cut off all the branches of the royal 
 family that fell in his way. The vine was <I>cut off close to the 
 ground,</I> though not plucked up by the roots. The <I>east wind dried 
 up the fruit</I> that was blasted. The young people fell by the sword, 
 or were carried into captivity. The aspect of it had nothing that was 
 pleasing, the prospect nothing that was promising. Her <I>strong rods 
 were broken and withered;</I> her great men were cut off, judges and 
 magistrates deposed. <I>The vine itself is planted in the 
 wilderness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+19:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Babylon was as a wilderness to those of the people that were carried 
 captives thither; the land of Judah was as a wilderness to Jerusalem, 
 now that the whole country was ravaged and laid waste by the Chaldean 
 army--a <I>fruitful land turned into barrenness.</I> "It is <I>burnt 
 with fire</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:16">Ps. lxxx. 16</A>)

 and that fire has <I>gone out of a rod of her branches</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+19:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);

 the king himself, by rebelling against the king of Babylon, has given 
 occasion to all this mischief. She may thank herself for the fire that 
 consumes her; she has by her wickedness made herself like tinder to the 
 sparks of God's wrath, so that her own branches serve as fuel for her 
 own consumption; in them the fire is kindled which <I>devoured the 
 fruit,</I> the sins of the elder being the judgments which destroy the 
 younger; her <I>fruit</I> is burned with her own branches, so that she 
 <I>has no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule,</I> none to be found now 
 that are fit for the government or dare take <I>this ruin under their 
 hand,</I> as the complaint is 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:6,7">Isa. iii. 6, 7</A>),

 none of the house of David left that have a right to rule, no wise men,
 or men of sense, that are able to rule." It goes ill with any state, 
 and is likely to go worse, when it is thus deprived of the blessings of 
 government and has <I>no strong rods for sceptres. Woe unto thee, O 
 land! when thy king is a child,</I> for it is as well to have no rod as 
 not a strong rod. Those strong rods, we have reason to fear, had been
 instruments of oppression, assistant to the king in <I>catching the 
 prey and devouring men,</I> and now they are destroyed with him. 
 Tyranny is the inlet to anarchy; and, when the rod of government is 
 turned into the serpent of oppression, it is just with God to say, 
 "There shall be no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule; but let men be 
 as <I>are the fishes of the sea,</I> where the greater devour the 
 less." Note, <I>This is a lamentation and shall be for a 
 lamentation.</I> The prophet was bidden

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+19:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)

 <I>to take up a lamentation;</I> and, having done so, he leaves it to 
 be made use of by others. "<I>It is a lamentation</I> to us of this 
 age, and, the desolations continuing long, it <I>shall be for a 
 lamentation</I> to those that shall come after us; the child unborn 
 will rue the destruction made of Judah and Jerusalem by the present 
 judgments. They were a great while in coming; the bow was long in the 
 drawing; but now that they have come they will continue, and the sad 
 effects of them will be entailed upon posterity." Note, Those who fill 
 up the measure of their fathers' sins are laying up in store for their 
 children's sorrows and furnishing them with matter for lamentation; and 
 nothing is more so than the overthrow of government.</P>
