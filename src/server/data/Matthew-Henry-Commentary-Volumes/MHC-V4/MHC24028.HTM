 In the foregoing chapter Jeremiah had charged those prophets with lies
 who foretold the speedy breaking of the yoke of the king of Babylon and
 the speedy return of the vessels of the sanctuary; how here we have his
 contest with a particular prophet upon those heads.

 I. Hananiah, a pretender to prophecy, in contradiction to Jeremiah,
 foretold the sinking of Nebuchadnezzar's power and the return both of
 the persons and of the vessels that were carried away

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+28:1-4">ver. 1-4</A></A>),

 and, as a sing of this, he broke the yoke from the neck of Jeremiah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+28:10,11">ver.  10, 11</A>.

 II.  Jeremiah wished his words might prove true, but appealed to the
 event whether they were so or no, not doubting but that would disprove
 them,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+28:5-9">ver. 5-9</A>.

 III. The doom both of the deceived and the deceiver is here read. The
 people that were deceived should have their yoke of wood turned into a
 yoke of iron

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+28:12-14">ver. 12-14</A></A>),

 and the prophet that was the deceiver should be shortly cut off by
 death, and he was so, accordingly, within two months,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the
 reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, <I>and</I> in the
 fifth month, <I>that</I> Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which
 <I>was</I> of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, in the
 presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Thus speaketh the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I
 have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
 &nbsp; 3  Within two full years will I bring again into this place all
 the vessels of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of
 Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon:
 &nbsp; 4  And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of
 Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that
 went into Babylon, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: for I will break the yoke of
 the king of Babylon.
 &nbsp; 5  Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in
 the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the
 people that stood in the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 &nbsp; 6  Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> do so: the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again
 the vessels of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s house, and all that is carried away
 captive, from Babylon into this place.
 &nbsp; 7  Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine
 ears, and in the ears of all the people;
 &nbsp; 8  The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old
 prophesied both against many countries, and against great
 kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.
 &nbsp; 9  The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the
 prophet shall come to pass, <I>then</I> shall the prophet be known,
 that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath truly sent him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This struggle between a true prophet and a false one is said here to 
 have happened <I>in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah,</I> and yet 
 <I>in the fourth year,</I> for the first four years of his reign might 
 well be called <I>the beginning,</I> or former part, of it, because 
 during those years he reigned under the dominion of the king of Babylon 
 and as a tributary to him; whereas the rest of his reign, which might 
 well be called the <I>latter part</I> of it, in distinction from that 
 <I>former part,</I> he reigned in rebellion against the king of 
 Babylon. In this fourth year of his reign he went in person to Babylon 
 (as we find, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:59"><I>ch.</I> li. 59</A>),

 and it is probable that this gave the people some hope that his
 negotiation in person would put a good end to the war, in which hope 
 the false prophets encouraged them, this Hananiah particularly, who was 
 of Gibeon, a priests' city, and therefore probably himself a priest, as 
 well as Jeremiah. Now here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The prediction which Hananiah delivered publicly, solemnly, <I>in 
 the house of the Lord,</I> and in the name of the Lord, in an august 
 assembly, <I>in the presence of the priests and of all the people,</I> 
 who probably were expecting to have some message from heaven. In 
 delivering this prophecy, he faced Jeremiah, he spoke it to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+28:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),
 
 designing to confront and contradict him, as much as to say, "Jeremiah,
 thou liest." Now this prediction is that the king of Babylon's power, 
 at least his power over Judah and Jerusalem, should be speedily broken, 
 that <I>within two full years</I> the vessels of the temple should be 
 brought back, and Jeremiah, and all the captives that were carried away 
 with him, should return; whereas Jeremiah had foretold that the yoke of 
 the king of Babylon should be bound on yet faster, and that the vessels 
 and captives should not return for 70 years, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+28:2-4"><I>v.</I> 2-4</A>.

 Now, upon the reading of this sham prophecy, and comparing it with the 
 messages that God sent by the true prophets, we may observe what a vast 
 difference there is between them. Here is nothing of the spirit and 
 life, the majesty of style and sublimity of expression, that appear in 
 the discourses of God's prophets, nothing of that divine flame and 
 <I>flatus.</I> But that which is especially wanting here is an air of 
 piety; he speaks with a great deal of confidence of the return of their 
 prosperity, but here is not a word of good counsel given them to 
 repent, and reform, and return to God, to pray, and seek his face, that 
 they may be prepared for the favours God had in reserve for them. He 
 promises them temporal mercies, in God's name, but makes no mention of 
 those spiritual mercies which God always promised should go along with 
 them, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+24:7"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 7</A>,

 <I>I will give them a heart to know me.</I> By all this it appears
 that, whatever he pretended, he had only the <I>spirit of the 
 world,</I> not the <I>Spirit of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:12">1 Cor. ii. 12</A>),

 that he aimed to please, not to profit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Jeremiah's reply to this pretended prophecy. 

 1. He heartily wishes it might prove true. Such an affection has he for
 his country, and so truly desirous is he of the welfare of it, that he 
 would be content to lie under the imputation of a false prophet, so 
 that their ruin might be prevented. He said, <I>Amen; the Lord do so; 
 the Lord perform thy words,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+28:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 This was not the first time that Jeremiah had prayed for his people, 
 though he had prophesied against them, and deprecated the judgments 
 which yet he certainly knew would come; as Christ prayed, <I>Father, if 
 it be possible, let this cup pass from me,</I> when yet he knew it must 
 not pass from him. Though, as a faithful prophet, he foresaw and 
 foretold the destruction of Jerusalem, yet, as a faithful Israelite, he 
 prayed earnestly for the preservation of it, in obedience to that 
 command, <I>Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.</I> Though the will of 
 God's purpose is the rule of prophecy and patience, the will of his 
 precept is the rule of prayer and practice. God himself, though he has 
 determined, does not desire, the death of sinners, but would <I>have 
 all men to be saved.</I> Jeremiah often interceded for his people,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:20"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 20</A>.

 The false prophets thought to ingratiate themselves with the people by
 promising them peace; now the prophet shows that he bore them as great 
 a good-will as their prophets did, whom they were so fond of; and, 
 though he had no warrant from God to promise them peace, yet he 
 earnestly desired it and prayed for it. How strangely were those 
 besotted who caressed those who did them the greatest wrong imaginable 
 by flattering them and persecuted him who did them the greatest service 
 imaginable by interceding for them! See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:18"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 18</A>.

 2. He appeals to the event, to prove it false, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+28:7-9"><I>v.</I>  7-9</A>.

 The false prophets reflected upon Jeremiah, as Ahab upon Micaiah, 
 because he never <I>prophesied good concerning them, but evil.</I> Now 
 he pleads that this had been the purport of the prophecies that other 
 prophets had delivered, so that it ought not to be looked upon as a 
 strange thing, or as rendering his mission doubtful; for prophets of 
 old prophesied against <I>many countries and great kingdoms,</I> so 
 bold were they in delivering the messages which God sent by them, and 
 so far from fearing men, or seeking to please them, as Hananiah did.  
 They made no difficulty, any more than Jeremiah did, of threatening 
 war, famine, and pestilence, and what they said was regarded as coming 
 from God; why then should Jeremiah be run down as <I>a pestilent 
 fellow, and a sower of sedition,</I> when he preached no otherwise than 
 God's prophets had always done before him? Other prophets had foretold 
 destruction did not come, which yet did not disprove their divine 
 mission, as in the case of Jonah; for God is gracious, and ready to 
 turn away his wrath from those that turn away from their sins. But the 
 prophet that <I>prophesied of peace</I> and prosperity, especially as 
 Hananiah did, absolutely and unconditionally, without adding that 
 necessary proviso, that they do not by wilful sin put a bar in their 
 own door and stop the current of God's favours, will be proved a true 
 prophet only by the accomplishment of his prediction; if it come to 
 pass, then it shall be known that <I>the Lord has sent him,</I> but, if 
 not, he will appear to be a cheat and an impostor.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet
 Jeremiah's neck, and brake it.
 &nbsp; 11  And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people,
 saying, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Even so will I break the yoke of
 Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations
 within the space of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went
 his way.
 &nbsp; 12  Then the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto Jeremiah <I>the prophet,</I>
 after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the
 neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,
 &nbsp; 13  Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Thou hast
 broken the yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of
 iron.
 &nbsp; 14  For thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, the God of Israel; I have
 put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they
 may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve
 him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.
 &nbsp; 15  Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet,
 Hear now, Hananiah; The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath not sent thee; but thou makest
 this people to trust in a lie.
 &nbsp; 16  Therefore thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Behold, I will cast thee from
 off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou
 hast taught rebellion against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 17  So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh
 month.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an instance,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Of the insolence of the false prophet. To complete the affront he 
 designed Jeremiah, <I>he took the yoke from off his neck</I> which he 
 carried as a memorial of what he had prophesied concerning the 
 enslaving of the nations to Nebuchadnezzar, and he broke it, that he 
 might give a sign of the accomplishment of this prophecy, as Jeremiah 
 had given of his, and might seem to have conquered him, and to have 
 defeated the intention of his prophecy. See how the lying spirit, in 
 the mouth of this false prophet, mimics the language of the Spirit of 
 truth: <I>Thus saith the Lord, So will I break the yoke of the king of 
 Babylon,</I> not only from the neck of this nation, but <I>from the 
 neck of all nations, within two full years.</I> Whether by the force of 
 a heated imagination Hananiah had persuaded himself to believe this, or 
 whether he knew it to be false, and only persuaded them to believe it, 
 does not appear; but it is plain that he speaks with abundance of 
 assurance. It is no new thing for lies to be fathered upon the God of 
 truth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Of the patience of the true prophet. Jeremiah quietly <I>went his 
 way,</I> and <I>when he was reviled he reviled not again,</I> and would 
 not contend with one that was in the height of his fury and in the 
 midst of the priests and people that were violently set against him. 
 The reason why he went his way was not because he had nothing to 
 answer, but because he was willing to stay till God was pleased to 
 furnish him with a direct and immediate answer, which as yet he had not 
 received. He expected that God would send a special message to 
 Hananiah, and he would say nothing till he had received that. <I>I, as 
 a deaf man, heard not, for thou wilt hear,</I> and <I>thou shalt 
 answer, Lord, for me.</I> It may sometimes be our wisdom rather to 
 retreat than to contend. <I>Currenti cede furori--Give place unto
 wrath.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Of the justice of God in giving judgment between Jeremiah and his 
 adversary. Jeremiah went his way, as a man <I>in whose mouth there was 
 no rebuke,</I> but God soon put a word into his mouth; for he will 
 appear for those who silently commit their cause to him. 

 1. The word of God, in the mouth of Jeremiah, is ratified and
 confirmed. Let not Jeremiah himself distrust the truth of what he had 
 delivered in God's name because it met with such a daring opposition 
 and contradiction. If what we have spoken be the truth of God, we must 
 not unsay it because men gainsay it; for <I>great is the truth and will 
 prevail.</I> It will stand, therefore let us stand to it, and not fear 
 that men's unbelief or blasphemy will make it of no effect. Hananiah 
 has broken the <I>yokes of wood,</I> but Jeremiah must make for them 
 <I>yokes of iron,</I> which cannot be broken

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+28:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 for (says God) "<I>I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these 
 nations,</I> which shall lie heavier, and bind harder, upon them 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+28:14"><I>v.</I>  14</A>),

 <I>that they may serve the king of Babylon,</I> and not be able to 
 shake off the yoke however they may struggle, for they shall serve him 
 whether they will or no;" and who is he that can contend with God's 
 counsel? What was said before is repeated again: <I>I have given him 
 the beasts of the field also,</I> as if there were something 
 significant in that. Men had by their wickedness made themselves 
 <I>like the beasts that perish,</I> and therefore deserved to be ruled 
 by an arbitrary power, as beasts are ruled, and such a power 
 Nebuchadnezzar ruled with; for <I>whom he would he slew and whom he 
 would he kept alive.</I> 

 2. Hananiah is sentenced to die for contradicting it, and Jeremiah, 
 when he has received commission from God, boldly tells him so to his 
 face, though before he received that commission he went away and said 
 nothing.

 (1.) The crimes of which Hananiah stands convicted are cheating the 
 people and affronting God: <I>Thou makest this people to trust in a 
 lie,</I> encouraging them to hope that they shall have peace, which 
 will make their destruction the more terrible to them when it comes; 
 yet this was not the worst: <I>Thou hast taught rebellion against the 
 Lord;</I> thou hast taught them to despise all the good counsel given 
 them in God's name by the true prophets, and hast rendered it 
 ineffectual. Those have a great deal to answer for who, by telling 
 sinners that they shall have peace though they go on, harden their 
 hearts in a contempt of the reproofs and admonitions of the word, and 
 the means and methods God takes to bring them to repentance. 

 (2.) The judgment given against him is, "<I>I will cast thee off from 
 the face of the earth,</I> as unworthy to live upon it; thou shalt be 
 buried in it. <I>This year thou shalt die,</I> and die as a rebel 
 against the Lord, to whom death will come with a sting and a curse." 
 This sentence was executed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+28:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Hananiah died the same year, within two months; for his prophecy is 
 dated the fifth month 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+28:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)

 and his death the seventh. Good men may perhaps be suddenly taken off 
 by death in the midst of their days, and in mercy to them, as Josiah 
 was; but this being foretold as the punishment of his sin, and coming 
 to pass accordingly, it may safely be construed as a testimony from 
 Heaven against him and a confirmation of Jeremiah's mission. And, if 
 the people's hearts had not been wretchedly hardened by the 
 deceitfulness of sin, it would have prevented their being further 
 hardened by the deceitfulness of their prophets.</P>
