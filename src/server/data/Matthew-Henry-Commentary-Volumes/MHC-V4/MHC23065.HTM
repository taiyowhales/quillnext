 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are now drawing towards the conclusion of this evangelical prophecy,
 the last two chapters of which direct us to look as far forward as the
 new heavens and the new earth, the new world which the gospel
 dispensation should bring in, and the separation that should by it be
 made between the precious and the vile. "For judgment" (says Christ)
 "have I come into this world." And why should it seem absurd that the
 prophet here should speak of that to which all the prophets bore
 witness?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:10,11">1 Pet. i. 10, 11</A>.

 The rejection of the Jews, and the calling in of the Gentiles, are
 often mentioned in the New Testament as that which was foreseen and
 foretold by the prophets,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:43,13:40,Ro+16:26">Acts x. 43; xiii. 40; Rom. xvi. 26</A>.

 In this chapter we have, 

 I. The anticipating of the Gentiles with the gospel call, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. The rejection of the Jews for their obstinacy and unbelief,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:2-7">ver. 2-7</A>.

 III. The saving of a remnant of them by bringing them into the gospel
 church, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:8-10">ver. 8-10</A>.

 IV. The judgments of God that should pursue the rejected Jews, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:11-16">ver. 11-16</A>.

 V. The blessings reserved for the Christian church, which should be its 
 joy and glory, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:17-25">ver. 17-25</A>.

 But these things are here prophesied of under the type and figure of 
 the difference God would make between some and others of the Jews after 
 their return out of captivity, between those that feared God and those 
 that did not, with reproofs of the sins then found among them and 
 promises of the blessings then in reserve for them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  I am sought of <I>them that</I> asked not <I>for me;</I> I am found of
 <I>them that</I> sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a
 nation <I>that</I> was not called by my name.
 &nbsp; 2  I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious
 people, which walketh in a way <I>that was</I> not good, after their
 own thoughts;
 &nbsp; 3  A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face;
 that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of

 &nbsp; 7  Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together,

 blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their
 former work into their bosom.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle Paul (an expositor we may depend upon) has given us the 
 true sense of these verses, and told us what was the event they pointed 
 at and were fulfilled in, namely, the calling in of the Gentiles and 
 the rejection of the Jews, by the preaching of the gospel, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:20,21">Rom. x. 20, 21</A>.

 And he observes that herein <I>Esaias is very bold,</I> not only in
 foretelling a thing so improbable ever to be brought about, but in 
 foretelling it to the Jews, who would take it as a gross affront to 
 their nation, and therein Moses's words would be made good

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:21">Deut. xxxii. 21</A>),

 <I>I will provoke you to jealousy by those that are no people.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It is here foretold that the Gentiles, who had been afar off, should 
 be made nigh, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Paul reads it thus: <I>I was found of those that sought me not; I was 
 made manifest to those that asked not for me.</I> Observe what a 
 wonderful and blessed change was made with them and how they were 
 surprised into it. 

 1. Those who had long been without God in the world shall now be set a
 seeking him; those who had not said, <I>Where is God my maker?</I> 
 shall now begin to enquire after him. Neither they nor their fathers
 had called upon his name, but either lived without prayer or prayed to 
 stocks and stones, the work of men's hands. But now they shall <I>be 
 baptized and call on the name of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:21">Acts ii. 21</A>.

 With what pleasure does the great God here speak of his being sought
 unto, and how does he glory in it, especially by those who in time past 
 had not asked for him! For there is joy in heaven over great sinners 
 who repent.

 2. God shall anticipate their prayers with his blessings: <I>I am found 
 of those that sought me not.</I> This happy acquaintance and 
 correspondence between God and the Gentile world began on his side; 
 they came to know God because they were <I>known of him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:9">Gal. iv. 9</A>),
 
 to seek God and find him because they were first sought and found of
 him. Though in after-communion God is found of those that seek him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:17">Prov. viii. 17</A>),

 yet in the first conversion he is found of those that seek him not; for
 <I>therefore we love him because he first loved us.</I> The design of 
 the bounty of common providence to them was <I>that they might seek the 
 Lord, if haply they might feel after him and find him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:27">Acts xvii. 27</A>.
 
 But they sought him not; still he was to them <I>an unknown God,</I>
 and yet God was found of them.

 3. God gave the advantages of a divine revelation to those who had
 never made a profession of religion: <I>I said, Behold me, behold 
 me</I> (gave them a sight of me and invited them to take the comfort 
 and benefit of it) to those who <I>were not called by my name,</I> as 
 the Jews for many ages had been. When the apostles went about from 
 place to place, preaching the gospel, this was the substance of what 
 they preached: "<I>Behold God, behold him,</I> turn towards him, fix 
 the eyes of your minds upon him, acquaint yourselves with him, admire 
 him, adore him; look off from your idols that you have made, and look 
 upon the living God who made you." Christ in them said, <I>Behold me, 
 behold me</I> with an eye of faith; <I>look unto me, and be you 
 saved.</I> And this was said to those that had long been 
 <I>lo-ammi,</I> and <I>lo-ruhamah</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:8,9">Hos. i. 8, 9</A>),

 <I>not a people,</I> and that <I>had not obtained mercy,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:25,26">Rom. ix. 25, 26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It is here foretold that the Jews, who had long been a people near 
 to God, should be cast off and set at a distance 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The apostle applies this to the Jews in his time, as a seed of 
 evil-doers. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:21">Rom. x. 21</A>,

 <I>But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands
 unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.</I> Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How the Jews were courted to the divine grace. God himself, by his 
 prophets, by his Son, by his apostles, <I>stretched forth his hands to 
 them,</I> as Wisdom did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:24">Prov. i. 24</A>.

 God <I>spread out his hands to them,</I> as one reasoning and
 expostulating with them, not only beckoned to them with the finger, but 
 <I>spread out his hands,</I> as being ready to embrace and entertain 
 them, reaching forth the tokens of his favour to them, and importuning 
 them to accept them. When Christ was crucified his hands were <I>spread 
 out and stretched forth,</I> as if he were preparing to receive 
 returning sinners into his bosom; and this <I>all the day,</I> all the 
 gospel-day. He waited to be gracious, and was not weary of waiting; 
 even those that came in at the eleventh hour of the day were not 
 rejected.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How they contemned the invitation; it was given to a rebellious and 
 gainsaying people; they were invited to the wedding-supper, and would 
 not come, but <I>rejected the counsel of God against themselves.</I> 
 Now here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The bad character of this people. The world shall see that it was 
 not for nothing that they were rejected of God; no, it was for their 
 whoredoms that they were put away.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Their character in general was such as one would not expect of
 those who had been so much the favourites of Heaven. <I>First,</I> They 
 were very wilful. Right or wrong they would do as they had a mind. 
 "They generally <I>walk</I> on <I>in a way that is not good,</I> not 
 the right way, not a safe way, for they <I>walk after their own 
 thought,</I> their own devices and desires." If our guide be our own 
 thoughts, our way is not likely to be good; for <I>every imagination of 
 the thought of our hearts is only evil.</I> God had told them his 
 thoughts, what his mind and will were, but they would walk <I>after 
 their own thoughts,</I> would do what they thought best. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> They were very provoking. This was God's complaint of 
 them all along--they grieved him, they <I>vexed his Holy Spirit,</I> as
 if they would contrive how to make him their enemy: They <I>provoke me 
 to anger continually to my face.</I> They cared not what affront they 
 gave to God, though it were in his sight and presence, in a downright 
 contempt of his authority and defiance of his justice; and this 
 <I>continually;</I> it had been their way and manner ever since they 
 were a people, witness the <I>day of temptation in the 
 wilderness.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The prophet speaks more particularly of <I>their iniquities and 
 the iniquities of their fathers,</I> as the ground of God's casting 
 them off, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 Now he gives instances of both.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> The most provoking iniquity of their fathers was 
 idolatry; this, the prophet tells them, was provoking God to his face; 
 and it is an iniquity which, as appears by the second commandment, God 
 often <I>visits upon the children.</I> This was the sin that brought 
 them into captivity, and, though the captivity pretty well cured them 
 of it, yet, when the final ruin of that nation came, that was again 
 brought into the account against them; for in the day when God visits 
 he will visit that, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:34">Exod. xxxii. 34</A>.

 Perhaps there were many, long after the captivity, who, though they did
 not worship other gods, were yet guilty of the disorders here 
 mentioned; for they married strange wives.

 1. They forsook God's temple, and <I>sacrificed in gardens or
 groves,</I> that they might have the satisfaction of doing it in their 
 own way, for they liked not God's institutions. 

 2. They forsook God's altar, and <I>burnt incense upon bricks,</I> 
 altars of their own contriving (they burnt incense according to their 
 own inventions, which were of no more value, in comparison with God's 
 institution, than an altar of bricks in comparison with the golden 
 altar which God appointed them to burn incense on), or <I>upon 
 tiles</I> (so some read it), such as they covered their flat-roofed 
 houses with, and on them sometimes they burnt incense to their idols, 
 as appears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:12">2 Kings xxiii. 12</A>,

 where we read of altars <I>on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz,</I>
 and 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:13">Jer. xix. 13</A>,

 of their burning incense to the host of heaven upon the roofs of their
 houses.

 3. "They used necromancy, or consulting with the dead, and, in order to
 that, they <I>remained among the graves,</I> and <I>lodged in the 
 monuments,</I>" to seek for the living to the dead

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:19"><I>ch.</I> viii. 19</A>),

 as the witch of Endor. Or they used to consult the evil spirits that
 haunted the sepulchres. 

 4. They violated the laws of God about their meat, and broke through 
 the distinction between clean and unclean before it was taken away by 
 the gospel. They <I>ate swine's flesh.</I> Some indeed chose rather to 
 die than to eat swine's flesh, as Eleazar and the seven brethren in the 
 story of the Maccabees; but it is probable that many ate of it, 
 especially when it came to be a condition of life. In our Saviour's 
 time we read of a vast herd of swine among them, which gives us cause 
 to suspect that there were many then who made so little conscience of 
 the law as to eat swine's flesh, for which they were justly punished in 
 the destruction of the swine. <I>And the broth,</I> or <I>pieces,</I> 
 of other forbidden meats, called here <I>abominable things,</I> was 
 <I>in their vessels,</I> and was made use of for food. The forbidden 
 meat is called <I>an abomination,</I> and those that meddle with it are 
 said to <I>make themselves abominable,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:42,43">Lev. xi. 42, 43</A>.

 Those that durst not eat the meat yet made bold with the broth, because
 they would come as near as might be to that which was forbidden, to 
 show how they coveted the forbidden fruit. Perhaps this is here put 
 figuratively for all forbidden pleasures and profits which are obtained 
 by sin, that <I>abominable thing which the Lord hates;</I> they loved 
 to be dallying with it, to be tasting of its broth. But those who thus 
 take a pride in venturing upon the borders of sin, and the brink of it, 
 are in danger of falling into the depths of it. But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> The most provoking iniquity of the Jews in our 
 Saviour's time was their pride and hypocrisy, that sin of the scribes 
 and Pharisees against which Christ denounced so many woes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 They say, "<I>Stand by thyself,</I> keep off" (<I>get thee to 
 thine,</I> so the original is); "keep to thy own companions, but 
 <I>come not near to me,</I> lest thou pollute me; <I>touch me not;</I> 
 I will not allow thee any familiarity with me, <I>for I am holier than 
 thou,</I> and therefore thou art not good enough to converse with me; 
 <I>I am not as other men are, nor even as this publican.</I>" This they 
 were ready to say to every one they met with, so that, in saying, <I>I 
 am holier than thou,</I> they thought themselves holier than any, not 
 only very good, as good as they should be, as good as they needed to 
 be, but better than any of their neighbours. <I>These are a smoke in my 
 nose</I> (says God), such a smoke as comes not from a quick fire, which 
 soon becomes glowing and pleasant, but from a fire of wet wood, which 
 <I>burns all the day,</I> and is nothing but smoke. Note, Nothing in 
 men is more odious and offensive to God than a proud conceit of 
 themselves and contempt of others; for commonly those are most unholy 
 of all that think themselves holier than any.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The controversy God had with them for this. The proof against them 
 is plain: <I>Behold, it is written before me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 It is written, to be remembered against them in time to come; for they 
 may not perhaps be immediately reckoned with. The sins of sinners, and 
 particularly the vainglorious boasts and scorns of hypocrites, are 
 <I>laid up in store</I> with God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:34">Deut. xxxii. 34</A>.

 And what is written shall be read and proceeded upon: "<I>I will not
 keep silence</I> always, though I may keep silence long." They shall 
 not think him altogether such a one as themselves, as sometimes they 
 have done; but <I>he will recompense, even recompense into their 
 bosom.</I> Those basely abuse religion, that honourable and sacred 
 thing, who make their profession of it the matter of their pride, and 
 the jealous God will reckon with them for it; the profession they boast 
 of shall but serve to aggravate their condemnation.

 [1.] The <I>iniquity of their fathers</I> shall come against them; not 
 but that their own sin deserved whatever judgments God brought upon 
 them, and much heavier; and this they owned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+9:13">Ezra ix. 13</A>.

 But God would not have wrought so great a desolation upon them if he
 had not therein had an eye to the sins of their fathers. Therefore in 
 the last destruction of Jerusalem God is said to bring upon them the 
 blood of the Old-Testament martyrs, even that of <I>Abel,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:35">Matt. xxiii. 35</A>.

 God will reckon with them, not only for their fathers' idols, but for
 their <I>high places,</I> their <I>burning incense upon the mountains 
 and the hills,</I> though perhaps it was to the true God only. This was 
 blaspheming or reproaching God; it was a reflection upon the choice he 
 had made of the place where he would record his name, and the promise 
 he had made that there he would meet them and bless them.

 [2.] Their own with that shall bring ruin upon them: <I>Your iniquities 
 and the iniquities of your fathers</I> together, the one aggravating 
 the other, constitute the former work, which, though it may seem to be 
 overlooked and forgotten, shall be <I>measured into their bosom.</I> 
 God will render into the bosom, not only of his open enemies 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:12">Ps. lxxix. 12</A>),

 but of his false and treacherous friends, <I>the reproach wherewith
 they have reproached him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is expounded by St. <I>Paul,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:1-5">Rom. xi. 1-5</A>,

 where, when, upon occasion of the rejection of the Jews, it is asked,
 <I>Hath God then cast away his people?</I> he answers, No; for <I>at 
 this time there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</I> 
 This prophecy has reference to that distinguished remnant. When that 
 hypocritical nation is to be destroyed God will separate and secure to 
 himself some from among them; some of the Jews shall be brought to 
 embrace the Christian faith, shall be added to the church, and so be 
 saved. And our Saviour has told us that <I>for the sake of these 
 elect</I> the days of the destruction of the Jews should be shortened, 
 and a stop put to the desolation, which otherwise would have proceeded 
 to such a degree that <I>no flesh should be saved,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:22">Matt. xxiv. 22</A>.
 
 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. This is illustrated here by a comparison, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 When a vine is so blasted and withered that there seems to be no sap 
 nor life in it, and therefore the dresser of the vineyard is inclined 
 to pluck it up or cut it down, yet, if ever so little of the juice of 
 the grape, fit to make new wine, be found, though but in one cluster, a 
 stander-by interposes, and says, <I>Destroy it not, for a blessing is 
 in it;</I> there is life in the root, and hope that yet it may become 
 good for something. Good men are blessings to the places where they 
 live; and sometimes God spares whole cities and nations for the sake of 
 a few such in them. How ambitious should we be of this honor, not only 
 to be distinguished from others, but serviceable to others!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is a description of those that shall make up this saved saving
 remnant. 

 1. They are such as serve God. It is <I>for my servants' sake</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and they are <I>my servants</I> that <I>shall dwell there,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 
 God's faithful servants, however they are looked upon, are the best 
 friends their country has; and those who serve him do therein <I>serve 
 their generation.</I> 

 2. They are such as seek God, make it the end of their lives to glorify 
 God and the business of their lives to call upon him. It is <I>for my 
 people that have sought me.</I> Those that seek God shall find him, and 
 shall find him their bountiful rewarder.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is an account of the mercy God has in store for them. The 
 remnant that shall return out of captivity shall have a happy 
 settlement again in their own land, and that by an hereditary right, as 
 <I>a seed out of Jacob,</I> in whom the family is kept up and the 
 entail preserved, and from whom, as from the seed sown, shall spring a 
 numerous increase; and these typify the remnant of Jacob that shall be 
 incorporated into the gospel church by faith. 

 1. They shall have a good portion for themselves. They shall inherit
 <I>my mountains,</I> the holy mountains on which Jerusalem and the 
 temple were built, or the mountains of Canaan, <I>the land of 
 promise,</I> typifying the covenant of grace, which all God's servants, 
 his elect, both inhabit and inherit; they make it their refuge, their 
 rest and residence, so they dwell in it, are at home in it; and they 
 have taken it to be their heritage for ever, and it shall be to them an 
 inheritance incorruptible. God's chosen, the spiritual seed of praying 
 Jacob, shall be the inheritors of his mountains of bliss and joy, and 
 shall be carried safely to them through the vale of tears. 

 2. They shall have a green pasture for their flocks,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 <I>Sharon and the valley of Achor</I> shall again be as well 
 replenished as ever they were with cattle. Sharon lay westward, near 
 Joppa; Achor lay eastward, near Jordan. It is therefore intimated that 
 they shall recover the possession of the whole land, that they shall 
 have wherewith to stock it all, and that they shall peaceably enjoy it 
 and there shall be none to disturb them nor make them afraid. 
 Gospel-ordinances are the fields and valleys where the sheep of Christ 
 <I>shall go in and out and find pasture</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:9">John x. 9</A>),

 and where they are <I>made to lie down</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the different states of the godly and wicked, of the Jews that 
 believed and of those that still persisted in unbelief, are set the one 
 over--against the other, as life and death, good and evil, the blessing
 and the curse.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is the fearful doom of those that persisted in their idolatry 
 after the deliverance out of Babylon, and in infidelity after the 
 preaching of the gospel of Christ. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What the doom is that is here threatened: "<I>I will number you to 
 the sword</I> as sheep for the slaughter, and there shall be no 
 escaping, no standing out; <I>you shall all bow down to it,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 
 God's judgments come, 

 (1.) Regularly, and are executed according to the commission. Those
 fall by the sword that are numbered or counted out to it, and none 
 besides. Though the sword seems to devour promiscuously <I>one as well 
 as another,</I> yet it is made to know its number and shall not exceed.
 
 (2.) Irresistibly. The strongest and most stout-hearted sinners shall 
 be forced to bow before them; for none ever hardened their hearts 
 against God and prospered.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What the sins are that number them to the sword. 

 (1.) Idolatry was the ancient sin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 "<I>You are those</I> who, instead of seeking me and serving me as my 
 people, <I>forsake the Lord,</I> disown him, and cast him off to 
 embrace other gods, who <I>forget my holy mountain</I> (the privileges 
 it confers and the obligations it lays you under) to burn incense upon 
 the mountains of your idols 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 and have deserted the one only living and true God." They <I>prepared a 
 table for that troop of</I> deities which the heathen worship and 
 <I>poured out drink-offerings to that</I> numberless number of them; 
 for those that thought one God too little never thought scores and 
 hundreds sufficient, but were still adding to the number of them, till 
 they had as many gods as cities and their altars were as thick as 
 <I>heaps in the furrows of the field,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:11">Hos. xii. 11</A>.

 Some take <I>Gad</I> and <I>Meni,</I> which we translate <I>a troop</I>
 and <I>a number,</I> to be the proper names of two of their idols, 
 answering to Jupiter and Mercury. Whatever they were, their worshippers 
 spared no cost to do them honour; they prepared a table for them, and 
 filled out mixed wine for drink-offerings to them; they would pinch 
 their families rather than stint their devotions, which should shame 
 the worshippers of the true God out of their niggardliness.

 (2.) Infidelity was the sin of the later Jews

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>When I called, you did not answer,</I> which refers to the same that

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>

 did (<I>I have stretched out my hands to a rebellious people</I>), and 
 that is applied to those who rejected the gospel. Our Lord Jesus 
 himself called (he <I>stood and cried,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:37">John vii. 37</A>),

 but they did not hear, they would not answer; they were not convinced
 by his reasonings nor moved by his expostulations; both the fair 
 warnings he gave them of death and ruin and the fair offers he made 
 them of life and happiness were slighted and made no impression upon 
 them. Yet this was not all: <I>You did evil before my eyes,</I> not by 
 surprise, or through inadvertency, but with deliberation: <I>You did 
 choose that wherein I delighted not;</I> he means that which he utterly 
 detested and abhorred. It is not strange that those who will not be 
 persuaded to choose that which is good persist in their choice and 
 pursuit of that which is evil. See the malignity of sin; it is evil in 
 God's eyes, highly offensive to him, and yet it is committed before his 
 eyes, in his sight and presence, and in contempt of him; it is likewise 
 a contradiction to the will of God; it is doing that, of choice, which 
 we know will displease him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The aggravation of this doom, from the consideration of the happy 
 state of those that were brought to repentance and faith.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The blessedness of those that serve God, and the woeful condition of 
 those that rebel against him, are here set the <I>one over--against the
 other,</I> that they may serve as a foil to each other, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:13-16"><I>v.</I> 13-16</A>.

 (1.) God's servants may well think themselves happy, and for ever 
 indebted to that free grace which made them so, when they see how 
 miserable some of their neighbours are for want of that grace, who are 
 hardened, and likely to perish for ever in unbelief, and what a narrow 
 escape they had of being among them. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:24"><I>ch.</I> lxvi. 24</A>.

 (2.) It will add to the grief of those that perish to see the happiness
 of God's servants (whom they had hated, and vilified, and looked upon 
 with the utmost disdain), and especially to think that they might have 
 shared in their bliss if it had not been their own fault. It made the 
 torment of the rich man in hell the more grievous that he <I>saw 
 Abraham afar off and Lazarus in his bosom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:23">Luke xvi. 23</A>.
 
 See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:28">Luke xiii. 28</A>.

 Sometimes the providence of God makes such a difference as this between
 good and bad in this world, and the prosperity of the righteous becomes 
 a grievous eye-sore and vexation of heart to the wicked

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:10">Ps. cxii. 10</A>),

 and it will certainly be so in the great day. <I>We fools counted his
 life madness and his end without honour; but now how is he numbered 
 with the saints and his lot is among the chosen.</I> Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The difference of their states lies in two things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) In point of comfort and satisfaction. 

 [1.] God's servants shall eat and drink; they shall have the bread of 
 life to feed, to feast upon, continually, shall be abundantly 
 replenished with the goodness of his house, and shall want nothing that 
 is good for them. Heaven's happiness will be to them an everlasting 
 feast; they shall be filled with that which now they hunger and thirst 
 after. But those who set their hearts upon the world, and place their 
 happiness in that, shall be hungry and thirsty, always empty, always 
 craving; for it is not bread; it surfeits, but it satisfies not. In 
 communion with God, and dependence upon him, there is full 
 satisfaction; but in sinful pursuits there is nothing but 
 disappointment. 

 [2.] God's servants <I>shall rejoice</I> and sing for joy of heart. 
 They have constant cause for joy, and there is nothing that may be an 
 occasion of grief to them but they have an allay sufficient for it; 
 and, as far as faith is in act and exercise, they have a heart to 
 rejoice, and their joy is their strength. They shall rejoice in their 
 hope, because it shall not make them ashamed. Heaven will be a world of 
 everlasting joy to all that are now sowing in tears. But, on the other
 hand, those that forsake the Lord shut themselves out from all true 
 joy, for <I>they shall be ashamed</I> of their vain confidence in 
 themselves, and their own righteousness, and the hopes they had built 
 thereon. When the expectations of bliss wherewith they had flattered 
 themselves are frustrated, O what confusion will fill their faces! Then 
 shall they <I>cry for sorrow of heart, and howl for vexation of 
 spirit,</I> perhaps in this world, when their laughter shall be turned 
 into mourning and their joy into heaviness, and certainly in that world 
 where the torment will be endless, easeless, and remediless--nothing 
 but weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth, to eternity. Let these 
 two be compared, <I>Now he is comforted</I> and <I>thou art 
 tormented,</I> and which of the two will we choose to take our lot 
 with?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) In point of honour and reputation,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 <I>The memory of the just is,</I> and shall be, <I>blessed, but the 
 name of the wicked shall rot.</I>

 [1.] The name of the idolaters and unbelievers shall be left <I>for a 
 curse,</I> shall be loaded with ignominy and made for ever infamous. It 
 shall be used in giving bad characters--<I>Thou art as cruel as a 
 Jew;</I> and in imprecation--<I>God make thee as miserable as a 
 Jew.</I> It shall be <I>for a curse to God's chosen,</I> that is, for a 
 warning to them; they shall be afraid of falling under the curse upon 
 the Jewish nation, of perishing after the <I>same example of 
 unbelief.</I> The curse of those whom God rejects should make his 
 chosen stand in awe. <I>The Lord God shall slay thee;</I> he shall 
 quite extirpate the Jews and cut them off from being a people; they 
 shall no longer live as a nation, nor ever be incorporated again. 

 [2.] The name of God's chosen shall become a blessing: <I>He shall call 
 his servants by another name.</I> The children of the covenant shall no 
 longer be called <I>Jews,</I> but <I>Christians;</I> and to them, under 
 that name, all the promises and privileges of the new covenant shall be 
 secured. This other name shall be an honourable name; it shall not be 
 confined to one nation, but with it men shall <I>bless themselves in 
 the earth,</I> all the world over. God shall have servants out of all 
 nations who shall all be dignified with this new name. They shall bless 
 themselves <I>in the God of truth. First,</I> They shall give honour to 
 God both in their prayers and in their solemn oaths, in their addresses 
 for his favour as their felicity and their appeals to his justice as 
 their Judge. This is a part of the homage we owe to God; we must bless 
 ourselves in him, that is, we must reckon that we have enough to make 
 us happy, that we need no more, and can desire no more, if we have him 
 for our God. It is of great consequence what we bless ourselves in, 
 what we most please ourselves with and value ourselves by our interest 
 in. Worldly people bless themselves in the abundance they have of this
 world's goods 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:18,Lu+12:19">Ps. xlix. 18; Luke xii. 19</A>);

 but God's servants bless themselves in him, as a God all-sufficient for
 them. He is their crown of glory and diadem of beauty, their strength 
 and portion. By him also <I>they shall swear,</I> and not by any
 creature or any false god. To his judgment they shall refer their 
 cause, from whom every man's judgment doth proceed. <I>Secondly,</I> 
 They shall give honour to him as <I>the God of truth, the God of the 
 Amen</I> (so the word is); some understand it of Christ who is himself 
 the <I>Amen,</I> the <I>faithful witness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:14">Rev. iii. 14</A>),

 and in whom all the promises are <I>yea and amen,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:20">2 Cor. i. 20</A>.

 In him we must bless ourselves, and by him we must swear unto the Lord
 and covenant with him. He that is <I>blessed in the earth</I> (so some 
 read it) <I>shall be blessed in the true God,</I> for Christ is <I>the 
 true God and eternal life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:20">1 John v. 20</A>.

 And it was promised of old that <I>in him all the families of the earth
 should be blessed,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:3">Gen. xii. 3</A>.

 Some read it, <I>He shall bless himself in the God of the faithful
 people,</I> in God as the God of all believers, desiring no more than 
 to share in the blessings wherewith they are blessed, to be dealt with 
 as he deals with them. <I>Thirdly,</I> They shall give him honour as
 the author of this blessed change which they have the experience of; 
 they shall think themselves happy in having him for their God who has 
 made them to forget their former troubles, the remembrance of them 
 being swallowed up in their present comforts: <I>Because they are 
 hidden from God's eyes,</I> that is, they are quite taken away; for, if 
 there were any remainder of their troubles, God would be sure to have 
 his eye upon it, in compassion to them and concern for them. They shall 
 no longer feel them; for God will no longer see them. He is pleased to 
 speak as if he would make himself easy by making them easy; and 
 therefore they shall with a great deal of satisfaction bless themselves 
 in him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the
 former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.
 &nbsp; 18  But be ye glad and rejoice for ever <I>in that</I> which I
 create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her
 people a joy.
 &nbsp; 19  And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and
 the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice
 of crying.
 &nbsp; 20  There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old
 man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an

 shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
 &nbsp; 22  They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not
 plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree <I>are</I> the days

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 If these promises were in part fulfilled when the Jews, after their 
 return out of captivity, were settled in peace in their own land and 
 brought as it were into a new world, yet they were to have their full 
 accomplishment in the gospel church, militant first and at length 
 triumphant. <I>The Jerusalem that is from above is free and is the 
 mother of us all.</I> In the graces and comforts which believers have 
 in and from Christ we are to look for this new heaven and new earth. It 
 is in the gospel that <I>old things have passed away and all things 
 have become new,</I> and by it that those who are in Christ are <I>new 
 creatures,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:17">2 Cor. v. 17</A>.

 It was a mighty and happy change that was described

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>,

 that <I>the former troubles were forgotten;</I> but here it rises much 
 higher: even the <I>former world</I> shall be <I>forgotten</I> and 
 <I>shall no more come into mind.</I> Those that were converted to the 
 Christian faith were so transported with the comforts of it that all 
 the comforts they were before acquainted with became as nothing to 
 them; not only their foregoing griefs, but their foregoing joys, were 
 lost and swallowed up in this. The glorified saints will 
 <I>therefore</I> have forgotten this world, because they will be 
 entirely taken up with the other: <I>For, behold, I create new heavens 
 and a new earth.</I> See how inexhaustible the divine power is; the 
 same God that created one heaven and earth can create another. See how 
 entire the happiness of the saints is; it shall be all of a piece; with 
 the new heavens God will create them (if they have occasion for it to 
 make them happy) a new earth too. <I>The world is yours</I> if you be 
 Christ's, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:22">1 Cor. iii. 22</A>.

 When God is reconciled to us, which gives us a new heaven, the
 creatures too are reconciled to us, which gives us a new earth. The 
 future glory of the saints will be so entirely different from what they 
 ever knew before that it may well be called <I>new heavens and a new 
 earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:13">2 Pet. iii. 13</A>.

 <I>Behold, I make all things new,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:5">Rev. xxi. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. There shall be new joys. For, 

 1. All the church's friends, and all that belong to her, shall rejoice

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 You shall <I>be glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create.</I> 
 The new things which God creates in and by his gospel are and shall be 
 matter of everlasting joy to all believers. <I>My servants shall 
 rejoice</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 at last they shall, though now they mourn. <I>Enter thou into the joy
 of thy Lord.</I> 

 2. The church shall be the matter of their joy, so pleasant, so 
 prosperous, shall her condition be: <I>I create Jerusalem a rejoicing 
 and her people a joy.</I> The church shall not only rejoice but be 
 rejoiced in. Those that have sorrowed with the church shall rejoice 
 with her. 

 3. The prosperity of the church shall be a rejoicing to God himself,
 who has pleasure in the prosperity of his servants

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>I will rejoice in Jerusalem's</I> joy, and will <I>joy in my 
 people;</I> for <I>in all their affliction he was afflicted.</I> God 
 will not only rejoice in the church's well-doing, but will himself 
 <I>rejoice to do her good</I> and <I>rest in his love</I> to her, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:17">Zeph. iii. 17</A>.
 
 What God rejoices in it becomes us to rejoice in.

 4. There shall be no allay of this joy, nor any alteration of this 
 happy condition of the church: <I>The voice of weeping shall be no more 
 heard in her.</I> If this relate to any state of the church in this 
 life, it means no more than that the former occasions of grief shall 
 not return, but God's people shall long enjoy an uninterrupted 
 tranquillity. But in heaven it shall have a full accomplishment, in 
 respect both of the perfection and the perpetuity of the promised joy; 
 there <I>all tears shall be wiped away.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. There shall be new life, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Untimely deaths by the sword or sickness shall be no more known as they 
 have been, and by this means there shall be <I>no more the voice of 
 crying,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 When there shall be <I>no more death</I> there shall be <I>no more 
 sorrow,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:4">Rev. xxi. 4</A>.

 As death has reigned by sin, so life shall reign by righteousness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:14,21">Rom. v. 14, 21</A>.

 1. Believers through Christ shall be satisfied with life, though it be
 ever so short on earth. If an infant end its days quickly, yet it shall 
 not be reckoned to die untimely; for the shorter its life is the longer 
 will its rest be. Though <I>death reign over those that have not sinned 
 after the similitude of Adam's transgression,</I> yet they, dying in 
 the arms of Christ, the second Adam, and belonging to his kingdom, are 
 not to be called <I>infants of days,</I> but even the child shall be 
 reckoned to <I>die a hundred years old,</I> for he shall rise again at 
 full age, shall rise to eternal life. Some understand it of children 
 who in their childhood are so eminent for wisdom and grace, and by 
 death nipped in the blossom, that they may be said to die a hundred 
 years old. And, as for old men, it is promised that <I>they shall fill 
 their days</I> with the <I>fruits of righteousness,</I> which they 
 shall <I>still bring forth in old age, to show that the Lord is 
 upright,</I> and then it is a good old age. An old man who is wise, and 
 good, and useful, may truly be said to have <I>filled his days.</I> Old 
 men who have their hearts upon the world have never filled their days, 
 never have enough of this world, but would still continue longer in it. 
 But that man dies old, and <I>satur dierum--full of days,</I> who, with 
 Simeon, having seen God's salvation, desires now to depart in peace. 

 2. Unbelievers shall be unsatisfied and unhappy in life, though it be
 ever so long. The sinner, though he live to <I>a hundred years old, 
 shall be accursed.</I> His living so long shall be no token to him of 
 the divine favour and blessing, nor shall it be any shelter to him from 
 the divine wrath and curse. The sentence he lies under will certainly 
 be executed, and his long life is but a long reprieve; nay, it is 
 itself a curse to him, for the longer he lives the more wrath he 
 treasures up against the day of wrath and the more sins he will have to 
 answer for. So that the matter is not great whether our lives on earth 
 be long or short, but whether we live the lives of saints or the lives 
 of sinners.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. There shall be a new enjoyment of the comforts of life. Whereas 
 before it was very uncertain and precarious, their enemies <I>inhabited 
 the houses</I> which <I>they built</I> and <I>ate the fruit</I> of the 
 trees which <I>they planted,</I> now it shall be otherwise; they shall 
 <I>build houses and inhabit them,</I> shall <I>plant vineyards</I> and 
 <I>eat the fruit of them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.

 Their intimates that the labour of their hands shall be blessed and be 
 made to prosper; they shall gain what they aimed at, and what they have 
 gained shall be preserved and secured to them; they shall enjoy it 
 comfortably, and nothing shall embitter it to them, and they shall live 
 to enjoy it long. Strangers shall not break in upon them, to expel 
 them, and plant themselves in their room, as sometimes they have done: 
 <I>My elect shall wear out,</I> or <I>long enjoy, the work of their 
 hands;</I> it is honestly got, and it will wear well; it is <I>the work 
 of their hands,</I> which they themselves have laboured for, and it is 
 most comfortable to enjoy that, and not to eat the <I>bread of 
 idleness,</I> or <I>bread of deceit.</I> If we have a heart to enjoy 
 it, that is the gift of God's grace 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:13">Eccl. iii. 13</A>);

 and, if we live to enjoy it long, it is the gift of God's providence,
 for that is here promised: <I>As the days of a tree are the days of my 
 people;</I> as the <I>days of an oak</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:13"><I>ch.</I> vi. 13</A>),

 <I>whose substance is in it, though it cast its leaves;</I> though it
 be stripped every winter, it recovers itself again, and lasts many 
 ages; as the days <I>of the tree of life;</I> so the LXX. Christ is to 
 them the tree of life, and in him believers enjoy all those spiritual 
 comforts which are typified by the abundance of temporal blessings here 
 promised; and it shall not be in the power of their enemies to deprive 
 them of these blessings or disturb them in the enjoyment of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. There shall be a new generation rising up in their stead to inherit 
 and enjoy these blessings 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>They shall not labour in vain,</I> for they shall not only enjoy the 
 work of their hands themselves, but they shall leave it with 
 satisfaction to those that shall come after them, and not with such a 
 melancholy prospect as Solomon did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:18,19">Eccl. ii. 18, 19</A>.

 They shall not beget and <I>bring forth</I> children <I>for trouble;
 for they are</I> themselves <I>the seed of the blessed of the Lord,</I> 
 and there is a blessing entailed upon them by descent from their 
 ancestors which <I>their offspring with them</I> shall partake of, and 
 shall be, as well as they, <I>the seed of the blessed of the Lord.</I> 
 They shall not bring forth for trouble; for,

 1. God will make their children that rise up comforts to them; they
 shall have the joy of seeing them <I>walk in the truth.</I> 

 2. He will make the times that come after comfortable to their 
 children. As they shall be good, so it shall be well with them; they 
 shall not be brought forth to days of trouble; nor shall it ever be 
 said, <I>Blessed is the womb that bore not.</I> In the gospel church 
 Christ's name shall be borne up by a succession. <I>A seed shall serve 
 him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:30">Ps. xxii. 30</A>),
 
 <I>the seed of the blessed of the Lord.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. There shall be a good correspondence between them and their God 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>Even before they call, I will answer.</I> God will anticipate their 
 prayers with the blessings of his goodness. David did but say, <I>I 
 will confess,</I> and <I>God forgave,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:5">Ps. xxxii. 5</A>.

 The father of the prodigal met him in his return. <I>While they are yet
 speaking,</I> before they have finished their prayer, I will give them 
 the thing they pray for, or the assurances and earnests of it. These 
 are high expressions of God's readiness to hear prayer; and this 
 appears much more in the grace of the gospel than it did under the law; 
 we owe the comfort of it to the mediation of Christ as our advocate 
 with the Father and are obliged in gratitude to give a ready ear to 
 God's calls.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. There shall be a good correspondence between them and their 
 neighbours 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>The wolf and the lamb shall feed together,</I> as they did in Noah's 
 ark. God's people, though they are as sheep in the midst of wolves, 
 shall be safe and unhurt; for God will not so much break the power and 
 tie the hands of their enemies as formerly, but he will turn their 
 hearts, will alter their dispositions by his grace. When Paul, who had
 been a persecutor of the disciples (and who, being of the tribe of 
 Benjamin, ravened <I>as a wolf,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:27">Gen. xlix. 27</A>)

 joined himself to them and became one of them, then <I>the wolf and the
 lamb fed together.</I> So also when the enmity between Jews and 
 Gentiles was slain, all hostilities ceased, and they fed together as 
 one sheepfold under Christ the great Shepherd, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:16">John x. 16</A>.

 The enemies of the church ceased to do the mischief they had done, and
 its members ceased to be so quarrelsome with and injurious to one 
 another as they had been, so that there was none either from without or 
 from within to hurt or destroy, none to disturb it, much less to ruin 
 it, <I>in all the holy mountain;</I> as was promised,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:8"><I>ch.</I> xi. 9</A>.

 For,

 1. Men shall be changed: <I>The lion</I> shall no more be a beast of
 prey, as perhaps he never would have been if sin had not entered, but 
 <I>shall eat straw like the bullock,</I> shall <I>know his owner,</I> 
 and <I>his master's crib,</I> as <I>the ox</I> does. When those that 
 lived by spoil and rapine, and coveted to enrich themselves, right or 
 wrong, are brought by the grace of God to accommodate themselves to 
 their condition, to live by honest labour, and to be content with such 
 things as they have--when those that stole steal no more, but work with 
 their hands the thing that is good--then this is fulfilled, that <I>the 
 lion shall eat straw like the bullock.</I> 

 2. Satan shall be chained, the dragon bound; for <I>dust shall be the 
 serpent's meat again.</I> That great enemy, when he has been let loose, 
 has glutted and regaled himself with the precious blood of saints, who 
 by his instigation have been persecuted, and with the precious souls of 
 sinners, who by his instigation have become persecutors and have ruined 
 themselves for ever; but now he shall be confined to dust, according to 
 the sentence, <I>On thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou 
 eat,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:14">Gen. iii. 14</A>.

 All the enemies of God's church, that are subtle and venomous as
 serpents, shall be conquered and subdued, and be made to lick the dust, 
 Christ shall reign as Zion's King till all the enemies of his kingdom 
 be made his footstool, and theirs too. In the holy mountain above, and 
 there only, shall this promise have its full accomplishment, that there 
 shall be none to hurt nor destroy.</P>
