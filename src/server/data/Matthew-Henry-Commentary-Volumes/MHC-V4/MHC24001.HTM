 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that
 <I>were</I> in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:
 &nbsp; 2  To whom the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came in the days of Josiah the
 son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.
 &nbsp; 3  It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king
 of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son
 of Josiah king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem
 captive in the fifth month.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here as much as it was thought fit we should know of the 
 genealogy of this prophet and the chronology of this prophecy. 

 1. We are told what family the prophet was of. He was <I>the son of
 Hilkiah,</I> not that Hilkiah, it is supposed, who was high priest in 
 Josiah's time (for then he would have been called so, and not, as here, 
 one <I>of the priests that were in Anathoth</I>), but another of the 
 same name. Jeremiah signifies one <I>raised up by the Lord.</I> It is 
 said of Christ that he is a prophet whom the Lord our God <I>raised up 
 unto us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+18:15">Deut. xviii. 15, 18</A>.

 He was <I>of the priests,</I> and, as a priest, was authorized and
 appointed to teach the people; but to that authority and appointment 
 God added the extraordinary commission of a prophet. Ezekiel also was a 
 priest. Thus God would support the honour of the priesthood at a time 
 when, by their sins and God's judgments upon them, it was sadly 
 eclipsed. He was of the priests in Anathoth, a city of priests, which 
 lay about three miles from Jerusalem. Abiathar had his country house 
 there,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:26">1 Kings ii. 26</A>.

 2. We have the general date of his prophecies, the knowledge of which
 is requisite to the understanding of them.

 (1.) He began to prophesy in the thirteenth year of Josiah's reign, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Josiah, in the twelfth year of his reign, began a work of reformation, 
 applied himself with all sincerity to purge Judah and Jerusalem from 
 the <I>high places, and the groves, and the images,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+34:3">2 Chron. xxxiv. 3</A>.
 
 And very seasonably then was this young prophet raised up to assist and
 encourage the young king in that good work. Then <I>the word of the 
 Lord</I> came to him, not only a charge and commission to him to 
 prophesy, but a revelation of the things themselves which he was to 
 deliver. As it is an encouragement to ministers to be countenanced and 
 protected by such pious magistrates as Josiah was, so it is a great 
 help to magistrates, in any good work of reformation, to be advised and 
 animated, and to have a great deal of their work done for them, by such 
 faithful zealous ministers as Jeremiah was. Now, one would have 
 expected when these two joined forces, such a prince, and such a 
 prophet (as in a like case, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+5:1,2">Ezra v. 1, 2</A>),

 and both young, such a complete reformation would be brought about and
 settled as would prevent the ruin of the church and state; but it 
 proved quite otherwise. In the eighteenth year of Josiah we find there 
 were a great many of the relics of idolatry that were not purged out; 
 for what can the best princes and prophets do to prevent the ruin of a 
 people that hate to be reformed? And therefore, though it was a time of 
 reformation, Jeremiah continued to foretel the destroying judgments 
 that were coming upon them; for there is no symptom more threatening to 
 any people than fruitless attempts of reformation. Josiah and Jeremiah 
 would have healed them, but they would not be healed.

 (2.) He continued to prophesy through the reigns of Jehoiakim and 
 Zedekiah, each of whom reigned eleven years. He prophesied <I>to the 
 carrying away of Jerusalem captive</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 that great event which he had so often prophesied of. He continued to
 prophesy after that,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+40:1"><I>ch.</I> xl. 1</A>.

 But the computation here is made to end with that because it was the
 accomplishment of many of his predictions; and from the thirteenth of 
 Josiah to the captivity was just forty years. Dr. Lightfoot observes 
 that as Moses was so long with the people, a teacher in the wilderness, 
 till they entered into their own land, Jeremiah was so long in their 
 own land a teacher, before they went into the wilderness of the 
 heathen: and he thinks that <I>therefore</I> a special mark is set upon 
 the last forty years of the iniquity of Judah, which Ezekiel bore forty 
 days, a day for a year, because during all that time they had Jeremiah 
 prophesying among them, which was a great aggravation of their 
 impenitency. God, in this prophet, suffered their manners, their ill 
 manners, forty years, and at length swore in his wrath that they should 
 not continue in his rest.</P>

 kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to
 throw down, to build, and to plant.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Jeremiah's early designation to the work and office of a prophet, 
 which God gives him notice of as a reason for his early application to 
 that business 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>):

 <I>The word of the Lord came to him,</I> with a satisfying assurance to
 himself that it was the word of the Lord and not a delusion; and God 
 told him,

 1. That he had <I>ordained him a prophet to the nations,</I> or
 <I>against the nations,</I> the nation of the Jews in the first place, 
 who are now <I>reckoned among the nations</I> because they had learned 
 their works and mingled with them in their idolatries, for otherwise 
 they would not have been numbered with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:9">Num. xxiii. 9</A>.

 Yet he was given to be a prophet, not to the Jews only, but to the
 neighbouring nations, to whom he was to <I>send yokes</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:2,3"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 2, 3</A>)

 and whom he must make to <I>drink of the cup</I> of the Lord's anger,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:17"><I>ch.</I> xxv. 17</A>.

 He is still in his writings a prophet to the nations (to our nation
 among the rest), to tell them what the national judgments are which may 
 be expected for national sins. It would be well for the nations would 
 they take Jeremiah for their prophet and attend to the warnings he 
 gives them. 

 2. That before he was born, even in his eternal counsel, he had
 designed him to be so. Let him know that he who gave him his commission 
 is the same that gave him his being, that <I>formed him in the 
 belly</I> and brought him <I>forth out of the womb,</I> that therefore 
 he was his rightful owner and might employ him and make use of him as 
 he pleased, and that this commission was given him in pursuance of the 
 purpose God had purposed in himself concerning him, before he was born: 
 "<I>I knew thee, and I sanctified thee,</I>" that is, "I determined 
 that thou shouldst be a prophet and set thee apart for the office." 
 Thus St. Paul says of himself that God had <I>separated him from his 
 mother's womb</I> to be a Christian and an apostle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:15">Gal. i. 15</A>.
 
 Observe,

 (1.) The great Creator knows what use to make of every man before he 
 makes him. He has <I>made all for himself,</I> and of the same lumps
 of clay designs <I>a vessel of honour or dishonour,</I> as he pleases, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:21">Rom. ix. 21</A>.

 (2.) What God has designed men for he will call them to; for his 
 purposes cannot be frustrated. Known unto God are all his own works 
 beforehand, and his knowledge is infallible and his purpose 
 unchangeable. 

 (3.) There is a particular purpose and providence of God conversant 
 about his prophets and ministers; they are by special counsel designed 
 for their work, and what they are designed for they are fitted for: I 
 that <I>knew thee, sanctified thee.</I> God destines them to it, and 
 forms them for it, when he first forms the spirit of man within him. 
 <I>Propheta nascitur, non fit--Original endowment, not education, makes 
 a prophet.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His modestly declining this honourable employment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Though God had predestinated him to it, yet it was news to him, and a
 mighty surprise, to hear that he should be <I>a prophet to the 
 nations.</I> We know not what God intends us for, but he knows. One 
 would have thought he would catch at it as a piece of preferment, for 
 so it was; but he objects against it, as a work for which he is 
 unqualified: "<I>Ah, Lord God! behold, I cannot speak</I> to great men 
 and multitudes, as prophets must; I cannot speak finely nor fluently, 
 cannot word things well, as a message from God should be worded; I 
 cannot speak with any authority, nor can expect to be heeded, <I>for I 
 am a child</I> and my youth will be despised." Note, It becomes us, 
 when we have any service to do for God, to be afraid lest we mismanage 
 it, and lest it suffer through our weakness and unfitness for it; it 
 becomes us likewise to have low thoughts of ourselves and to be 
 diffident of our own sufficiency. Those that are young should consider 
 that they are so, should be afraid, as Elihu was, and not venture 
 beyond their length.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The assurance God graciously gave him that he would stand by him 
 and carry him on in his work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Let him not object that he is a child; he shall be a prophet for all 
 that 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "<I>Say no</I> any more, <I>I am a child.</I> It is true thou art;
 but,"

 (1.) "Thou hast God's precept, and let not thy being young hinder thee 
 from obeying it. Go to all <I>to whom I shall send thee and speak 
 whatsoever I command thee.</I>" Note, Though a sense of our own 
 weakness and insufficiency should make us go humbly about our work, yet 
 it should not make us draw back from it when God calls us to it. God 
 was angry with Moses even for his modest excuses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:14">Exod. iv. 14</A>.

 (2.) "Thou hast God's presence, and let not thy being young discourage 
 thee from depending upon it. Though thou art a child, thou shalt be 
 <I>enabled to go to all to whom I shall send thee,</I> though they are 
 ever so great and ever so many. And <I>whatsoever I command thee</I> 
 thou shalt have judgment, memory, and language, wherewith to speak it 
 as it should be spoken." Samuel delivered a message from God to Eli, 
 when he was a little child. Note, God can, when he pleases, make 
 children prophets, and <I>ordain strength out of the mouth of babes and 
 sucklings.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Let him not object that he shall meet with many enemies and much 
 opposition; God will be his protector 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>Be not afraid of their races;</I> though they look big, and so
 think to outface thee and put thee out of countenance, yet <I>be not 
 afraid to speak to them;</I> no, not to speak that to them which is 
 most unpleasing. Thou speakest in the name of the King of kings, and by 
 authority from him, and with that thou mayest <I>face them down.</I> 
 Though they look angry, be not afraid of their displeasure nor 
 disturbed with apprehensions of the consequences of it." Those that 
 have messages to deliver from God must not be <I>afraid of the face of 
 man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:9">Ezek. iii. 9</A>.

 "And thou hast cause both to be bold and easy; for <I>I am with
 thee,</I> not only to assist thee in thy work, but to deliver thee out 
 of the hands of the persecutors; and, <I>if God be for thee, who can be 
 against thee?</I>" If God do not deliver his ministers from trouble, it 
 is to the same effect if he support them under their trouble. Mr. 
 Gataker well observes here, That earthly princes are not wont to go 
 along with their ambassadors; but God goes along with those whom he 
 sends, and is, by his powerful protection, at all times and in all 
 places present with them; and with this they ought to animate 
 themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:10">Acts xviii. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Let him not object that he cannot speak as becomes him--God will
 enable him to speak.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) To speak intelligently, and as one that had acquaintance with God, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 He having now a vision of the divine glory, the Lord <I>put forth his
 hand,</I> and by a sensible sign conferred upon him so much of the gift 
 of the tongue as was necessary for him: <I>He touched his mouth,</I> 
 and with that touch <I>opened his lips,</I> that his mouth should show 
 forth God's praise, with that touch sweetly conveyed <I>his words into 
 his mouth,</I> to be ready to him upon all occasions, so that he could 
 never want words who was thus furnished by him that <I>made man's 
 mouth.</I> God not only put knowledge into his head, but <I>words into 
 his mouth;</I> for there are <I>words which the Holy Ghost teaches,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:13">1 Cor. ii. 13</A>.

 It is fit God's message should be delivered in his own words, that it
 may be delivered accurately. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:4">Ezek. iii. 4</A>,

 <I>Speak with my words.</I> And those that faithfully do so shall not 
 want instructions as the case requires; God will give them a mouth and 
 wisdom <I>in that same hour,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:19">Matt. x. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) To speak powerfully, and as one that had authority from God, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 It is a strange commission that is here given him: <I>See, I have this
 day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms.</I> This sounds 
 very great, and yet Jeremiah is a poor despicable priest still; he is 
 not set over the kingdoms as a prince to rule them by the sword, but as 
 a prophet by the power of the word of God. Those that would hence prove 
 the pope's supremacy over kings, and his authority to depose them and 
 dispose of their kingdoms at his pleasure, must prove that he has the 
 same extraordinary spirit of prophecy that Jeremiah had, else how can 
 be have the power that Jeremiah had by virtue of that spirit? And yet 
 the power that Jeremiah had (who, notwithstanding his power, lived in 
 meanness and contempt, and under oppression) would not content these 
 proud men. Jeremiah was <I>set over the nations,</I> the Jewish nation 
 in the first place, and other nations, some great ones besides, against 
 whom he prophesied; he was set over them, not to demand tribute from 
 them nor to enrich himself with their spoils, but to <I>root out, and 
 pull down, and destroy,</I> and yet withal <I>to build and plant.</I>

 [1.] He must attempt to reform the nations, to <I>root out, and pull 
 down, and destroy</I> idolatry and other wickednesses among them, to 
 extirpate those vicious habits and customs which had long taken root, 
 to <I>throw down</I> the kingdom of sin, that religion and virtue might 
 be <I>planted</I> and <I>built</I> among them. And, to the introducing
 and establishing of that which is good, it is necessary that that which 
 is evil be removed.

 [2.] He must tell them that it would be well or ill with them according 
 as they were, or were not, reformed. He must set before them <I>life 
 and death, good and evil,</I> according to God's declaration of the 
 method he takes with kingdoms and nations,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:9-10"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 9-10</A>.

 He must assure those who persisted in their wickedness that they should
 be <I>rooted out and destroyed,</I> and those who repented that they 
 should be <I>built and planted.</I> He was authorized to read the doom 
 of nations, and God would <I>ratify it</I> and <I>fulfil it</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:26">Isa. xliv. 26</A>),

 would do it according to his word, and therefore is said to do it
 <I>by</I> his word. It is thus expressed partly to show how sure the 
 word of prophecy is--it will as certainly be accomplished as if it were 
 done already, and partly to put an honour upon the prophetic office and 
 make it look truly great, that others may not despise the prophets nor 
 they disparage themselves. And yet more honourable does the gospel 
 ministry look, in that declarative power Christ gave his apostles to 
 <I>remit and retain sin</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:23">John xx. 23</A>),

 <I>to bind and loose,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  Moreover the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond
 tree.
 &nbsp; 12  Then said the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will
 hasten my word to perform it.
 &nbsp; 13  And the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me the second time,
 saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; and
 the face thereof <I>is</I> toward the north.
 &nbsp; 14  Then the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall
 break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.
 &nbsp; 15  For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the
 north, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and they shall come, and they shall set
 every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem,
 and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all
 the cities of Judah.
 &nbsp; 16  And I will utter my judgments against them touching all
 their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense
 unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.
 &nbsp; 17  Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto
 them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces,
 lest I confound thee before them.
 &nbsp; 18  For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and
 an iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against
 the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the
 priests thereof, and against the people of the land.
 &nbsp; 19  And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not
 prevail against thee; for I <I>am</I> with thee, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to
 deliver thee.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. God gives Jeremiah, in vision, a view of the principal errand he was 
 to go upon, which was to foretel the destruction of Judah and Jerusalem 
 by the Chaldeans, for their sins, especially their idolatry. This was 
 at first represented to him in away proper to make an impression upon 
 him, that he might have it upon his heart in all his dealings with this 
 people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He intimates to him that the people were ripening apace for ruin and 
 that ruin was hastening apace towards them. God, having answered his 
 objection, that he was <I>a child,</I> goes on to initiate him in the 
 prophetical learning and language; and, having promised to enable him 
 to speak intelligibly to the people, he here teaches him to understand 
 what God says to him; for prophets must have eyes in their heads as 
 well as tongues, must be seers as well as speakers. He therefore asks 
 him, "<I>Jeremiah, what seest thou?</I> Look about thee, and observe 
 now." And he was soon aware of what was presented to him: "<I>I see a 
 rod,</I> denoting affliction and chastisement, a correcting rod hanging 
 over us; and it is a <I>rod of an almond-tree,</I> which is one of the 
 forwardest trees in the spring, is in the bud and blossom quickly, when 
 other trees are scarcely broken out;" it flourishes, says Pliny, in the 
 month of January, and by March has ripe fruits; hence it is called in 
 the Hebrew, <I>Shakedh,</I> the <I>hasty tree.</I> Whether this rod 
 that Jeremiah saw had already budded, as some think, or whether it was 
 stripped and dry, as others think, and yet Jeremiah knew it to be of an 
 almond-tree, as Aaron's rod was, is uncertain; but God explained it in 
 the next words 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>Thou hast well seen.</I> God commended him that he was so observant,
 and so quick of apprehension, as to be aware, though it was the first 
 vision he ever saw, that it was <I>a rod of an almond-tree,</I> that 
 his mind was so composed as to be able to distinguish. Prophets have 
 need of good eyes; and those that see well shall be commended, and not 
 those only that speak well. "Thou hast seen a <I>hasty tree,</I> which 
 signifies that <I>I will hasten my word to perform it.</I>" Jeremiah 
 shall prophesy that which he himself shall live to see accomplished. We 
 have the explication of this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:10,11">Ezek. vii. 10, 11</A>,

 "<I>The rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded, violence has risen up 
 into a rod of wickedness.</I> The measure of Jerusalem's iniquity fills 
 very fast; and, as if their destruction slumbered too long, they waken 
 it, they hasten it, and I will hasten to perform what I have spoken 
 against them."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He intimates to him whence the intended ruin should arise. Jeremiah 
 is a second time asked: <I>What seest thou?</I> and he sees <I>a 
 seething-pot</I> upon the fire 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 representing Jerusalem and Judah in great commotion, like boiling 
 water, by reason of the descent which the Chaldean army made upon them;
 made <I>like a fiery oven</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:9">Ps. xxi. 9</A>),

 all in a heat, wasting away as boiling water does and sensibly
 evaporating and growing less and less, ready to boil over, to be thrown
 out of their own city and land, as out of the pan into the fire, from
 bad to worse. Some think that those scoffers referred to this who said
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:3">Ezek. xi. 3</A>),

 <I>This city is the cauldron, and we are the flesh.</I> Now the mouth
 or face of the furnace or hearth, over which this pot boiled, was 
 <I>towards the north,</I> for thence the fire and the fuel were to come 
 that must <I>make the pot boil thus.</I> So the vision is explained

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>Out of the north an evil shall break forth,</I> or <I>shall be
 opened.</I> It had been long designed by the justice of God, and long 
 deserved by the sin of the people, and yet hitherto the divine patience 
 had restrained it, and held it in, as it were; the enemies had intended 
 it, and God had checked them; but now all restraints shall be taken 
 off, and the <I>evil shall break forth;</I> the direful scene shall 
 open, and the enemy shall come in like a flood. It shall be a universal 
 calamity; it shall come <I>upon all the inhabitants of the land,</I> 
 from the highest to the lowest, for they have all corrupted their way. 
 Look for this storm to arise <I>out of the north, whence fair weather 
 usually comes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:22">Job xxxvii. 22</A>.

 When there was friendship between Hezekiah and the king of Babylon they
 promised themselves many advantages <I>out of the north;</I> but it 
 proved quite otherwise: <I>out of the north</I> their trouble arose.
 Thence sometimes the fiercest tempests come whence we expected fair 
 weather. This is further explained

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>,
 
 where we may observe,

 (1.) The raising of the army that shall invade Judah and lay it waste: 
 <I>I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the 
 Lord.</I> All the northern crowns shall unite under Nebuchadnezzar, and 
 join with him in this expedition. They lie dispersed, but God, who has 
 all men's hearts in his hand, will bring them together; they lie at a 
 distance from Judah, but God, who directs all men's steps, will call 
 them, and they shall come, though they be ever so far off. God's 
 summons shall be obeyed; those whom he calls shall come. When he has
 work to do of any kind he will find instruments to do it, though he 
 send to the utmost parts of the earth for them. And, that the armies 
 brought into the field may be sufficiently numerous and strong, he will 
 call not only the <I>kingdoms of the north, but all the families</I> of 
 those kingdoms, into the service; not one able-bodied man shall be left 
 behind. 

 (2.) The advance of this army. The commanders of the troops of the 
 several nations shall take their post in carrying on the siege of 
 Jerusalem and the other cities of Judah. They shall set <I>every one 
 his throne,</I> or seat. When a city is besieged we say, The enemy sits 
 down before it. They shall encamp some at the <I>entering of the gates, 
 others against the walls round about,</I> to cut off both the going out 
 of the mouths and the coming in of the meat, and so to starve them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He tells him plainly what was the procuring cause of all these
 judgments; it was the <I>sin of Jerusalem</I> and of the <I>cities of 
 Judah</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>I will pass sentence upon them</I> (so it may be read) or <I>give
 judgment against them</I> (this sentence, this judgment) <I>because of 
 all their wickedness;</I> it is this that plucks up the flood-gates and 
 lets in this inundation of calamities. They <I>have forsaken God</I>
 and revolted from their allegiance to him, and have <I>burnt incense to 
 other gods,</I> new gods, strange gods, and all false gods, pretenders,
 usurpers, the creatures of their own fancy, and <I>they have worshipped 
 the works of their own hands.</I> Jeremiah was young, had looked but 
 little abroad into the world, and perhaps did not know, nor could have 
 believed, what abominable idolatries the children of his people were 
 guilty of; but God tells him, that he might know what to level his 
 reproofs against and what to ground his threatenings upon, and that he 
 might himself be satisfied in the equity of the sentence which in God's 
 name he was to pass upon them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God excites and encourages Jeremiah to apply himself with all 
 diligence and seriousness to his business. A great trust is committed 
 to him. He is sent in God's name as a herald at arms, to proclaim war 
 against his rebellious subjects; for God is pleased to give warning of 
 his judgments beforehand, that sinners may be awakened to meet him by 
 repentance, and so <I>turn away his wrath,</I> and that, if they do 
 not, they may be left inexcusable. With this trust Jeremiah has a 
 charge given him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 "<I>Thou, therefore, gird up thy loins;</I> free thyself from all those
 things that would unfit thee for or hinder thee in this service; buckle 
 to it with readiness and resolution, and be not entangled with doubts 
 about it." He must be quick: <I>Arise,</I> and lose no time. He must be 
 busy: <I>Arise, and speak unto them</I> in season, out of season. He 
 must be bold: <I>Be not dismayed at their faces,</I> as before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 In a word, he must be faithful; it is required of ambassadors that they
 be so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In two things he must be faithful:--

 (1.) He must speak all that he is charged with: <I>Speak all that I 
 command thee.</I> He must forget nothing as minute, or foreign, or not 
 worth mentioning; every word of God is weighty. He must conceal nothing 
 for fear of offending; he must alter nothing under pretence of making 
 it more fashionable or more palatable, but, without addition or 
 diminution, <I>declare the whole counsel of God.</I> 

 (2.) He must speak to all that he is charged against; he must not 
 whisper it in a corner to a few particular friends that will take it 
 well, but he must appear <I>against the kings of Judah,</I> if they be 
 wicked kings, and bear his testimony against the sins even <I>of the 
 princes thereof;</I> for the greatest of men are not exempt from the 
 judgments either of God's hand or of his mouth. Nay, he must not spare
 <I>the priests thereof;</I> though he himself was a priest, and was 
 concerned to maintain the dignity of his order, yet he must not 
 therefore flatter them in their sins. He must appear against the 
 <I>people of the land,</I> though they were his own people, as far as 
 they were against the Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Two reasons are here given why he should do thus:--

 (1.) Because he had reason to fear the wrath of God if he should be 
 false: "<I>Be not dismayed at their faces,</I> so as to desert thy
 office, or shrink from the duty of it, <I>lest I confound and dismay 
 thee before them,</I> lest I give thee up to thy faintheartedness." 
 Those that consult their own credit, ease, and safety, more than their 
 work and duty, are justly left of God to themselves, and to bring upon 
 themselves the shame of their own cowardliness. Nay, <I>lest I reckon 
 with thee for thy faintheartedness, and break thee to pieces;</I> so 
 some read it. Therefore this prophet says

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:17"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 17</A>),

 Lord, <I>be not thou a terror to me.</I> Note, The fear of God is the
 best antidote against the fear of man. Let us always be afraid of 
 offending God, who after he has killed has power to cast into hell, and 
 then we shall be in little danger of fearing the faces of men that can 
 but kill the body, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:4,5">Luke xii. 4, 5</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+4:14">Neh. iv. 14</A>.

 It is better to have all the men in the world our enemies than God our
 enemy.

 (2.) Because he had no reason to fear the wrath of men if he were 
 faithful; for the God whom he served would protect him, and bear him 
 out, so that they should neither sink his spirits nor drive him off 
 from his work, should neither stop his mouth nor take away his life, 
 till he had finished his testimony, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 This young stripling of a prophet is made by the power of God as an
 impregnable city, fortified with iron pillars and surrounded with walls 
 of brass; he sallies out upon the enemy in reproofs and threatenings, 
 and <I>keeps them in awe.</I> They set upon him on every side; the 
 kings and princes batter him with their power, the priests thunder 
 against him with their church-censures, and <I>the people of the 
 land</I> shoot their arrows at him, even slanderous and bitter words; 
 but he shall keep his ground and make his part good with them; he shall 
 still be a curb upon them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>They shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail to destroy
 thee, for I am with thee to deliver thee</I> out of their hands; nor 
 shall they prevail to defeat the word that God sends them by Jeremiah, 
 nor to deliver themselves; it shall take hold of them, for God is 
 against them to destroy them. Note, Those who are sure that they have 
 God with them (as he is if they be with him) need not, ought not, to be 
 afraid, whoever is against them.</P>
