 In this chapter we have, 

 I. God contending with Israel, by the judgments, but are reprieved, and
 the judgments turned away at the prayer of Amos, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 2. God's patience is at length worn out by their obstinacy, and they
 are rejected, and sentenced to utter ruin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:7-9">ver. 7-9</A>.

 II. Israel contending with God, by the opposition given to his prophet.
 
 1. Amaziah informs against Amos
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:10,11">ver. 10, 11</A>)

 and does what he can to rid the country of him as a public nuisance, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:12,13">ver. 12, 13</A>.

 2. Amos justifies himself in what he did as a prophet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:14,15">ver. 14, 15</A>)

 and denounces the judgments of God against Amaziah his prosecutor 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:16,17">ver. 16, 17</A>);

 for, when the contest is between God and man, it is easy to foresee, it
 is very easy to foretel, who will come off with the worst of it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Thus hath the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed
 grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter
 growth; and, lo, <I>it was</I> the latter growth after the king's
 mowings.
 &nbsp; 2 And it came to pass, <I>that</I> when they had made an end of
 eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, forgive, I
 beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he <I>is</I> small.
 &nbsp; 3 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> repented for this: It shall not be, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 4 Thus hath the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord
 G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep,
 and did eat up a part.
 &nbsp; 5 Then said I, O Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall
 Jacob arise? for he <I>is</I> small.
 &nbsp; 6 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the
 Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 7 Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall
 <I>made</I> by a plumb-line, with a plumb-line in his hand.
 &nbsp; 8 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said,
 A plumb-line. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumb-line
 in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them
 any more:
 &nbsp; 9 And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the
 sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise
 against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We here see that God bears long, but that he will not bear always, with 
 a provoking people, both these God here showed the prophet: <I>Thus 
 hath the Lord God showed me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:1,4,7"><I>v.</I> 1, 4, 7</A>.

 He showed him what was present, foreshowed him what was to come, gave 
 him the knowledge both of what he did and of what he designed; for the 
 <I>Lord God reveals his secret unto his servants the prophets,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:7"><I>ch.</I> iii. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We have here two instances of God's sparing mercy, remembered in the 
 midst of judgment, the narratives of which are so much like one another 
 that they will be best considered together, and very considerable they 
 are.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God is here coming forth against this sinful nation, first by one 
 judgment and then by another. 

 (1.) He begins with the judgment of famine. The prophet saw this in 
 vision. He saw God <I>forming grasshoppers,</I> or <I>locusts,</I> and 
 bringing them up upon the land, to eat up the fruits of it, and so to 
 strip it of its beauty and starve its inhabitants,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 God formed these grasshoppers, not only as they were his creatures (and 
 much of the wisdom and power of God appears in the formation of minute 
 animals, as much in the structure of an ant as of an elephant), but as 
 they were instruments of his wrath. God is said to <I>frame evil</I>
 against a sinful people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:11">Jer. xviii. 11</A>.

 These grasshoppers were framed on purpose to <I>eat up the grass of the
 land;</I> and vast numbers of them were prepared accordingly. They were 
 sent <I>in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth, after 
 the king's mowings.</I> See here how the judgment was mitigated by the 
 mercy that went before it. God could have sent these insects to eat up
 the grass at the beginning of the first growth, in the spring, when the 
 grass was most needed, was most plentiful, and was the best in its 
 kind; but God suffered that to grow, and suffered them to gather it in; 
 the king's mowings were safely housed, for <I>the king himself is 
 served from the field</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:9">Eccl. v. 9</A>),

 and could as ill be without his mowings as without any other branch of
 his revenues. Uzziah, who was now king of Judah, <I>loved 
 husbandry,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+26:10">2 Chron. xxvi. 10</A>.

 But the grasshoppers were commissioned to eat up only the <I>latter
 growth</I> (the edgrew we call it in the country), the after-grass, 
 which is of little value in comparison with the former. The mercies 
 which God give us, and continues to us, are more numerous and more 
 valuable than those he removes from us, which is a good reason why we 
 should be thankful and not complain. The remembrance of the mercies of 
 the former growth should make us submissive to the will of God when we 
 meet with disappointments in the latter growth. The prophet, in vision, 
 saw this judgment prevailing far. These grasshoppers <I>ate up the 
 grass of the land,</I> which should have been for the cattle, which the 
 owners must of course suffer by. Some understand this figuratively of a 
 wasting destroying army brought upon them. In the days of Jeroboam the 
 kingdom of Israel began to recover itself from the desolations it had 
 been under in the former reigns

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:25">2 Kings xiv. 25</A>);

 the latter growth shot up, after the mowings of the kings of Syria,
 which we read of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:3">2 Kings xiii. 3</A>.

 And then God commissioned the king of Assyria with an army of
 caterpillars to come upon them and lay them waste, that nation spoken 
 of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:14"><I>ch.</I> vi. 14</A>,

 which afflicted them <I>from the entering of Hamath to the river of the
 wilderness,</I> which seems to refer to 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:25">2 Kings xiv. 25</A>,

 where Jeroboam is said to have restored their coast <I>from the
 entering of Hamath to the sea of the plain.</I> God can bring all to 
 ruin when we think all is in some good measure repaired.

 (2.) He proceeds to the judgment of fire, to show that he has many 
 arrows in his quiver, many ways of humbling a sinful nation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>The Lord God called to contend by fire.</I> He contended, for God's 
 judgment upon a people are his controversies with them; in them he 
 prosecutes his action against them; and his controversies are neither 
 causeless nor groundless. He <I>called to contend;</I> he did by his 
 prophets give them notice of his controversy, and drew up a 
 declaration, setting forth the meaning of it. Or he called for his 
 angels, or other ministers of his justice, that were to be employed in 
 it. A fire was kindled among them, by which perhaps is meant a great 
 drought (the heat of the sun, which should have warmed the earth, 
 scorched it, and burnt up the roots of the grass which the locusts had 
 eaten the spires of), or a raging fever, which was as a fire in their 
 bones, which devoured and ate up multitudes, or lightning, fire from 
 heaven, which consumed their houses, as Sodom and Gomorrah were 
 consumed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+4:11"><I>ch.</I> iv. 11</A>),

 or it was the burning of their cities, either by accident or by the
 hand of the enemy, for fire and sword used to go together; thus were 
 the towns wasted, as the country was by the grasshoppers. This fire, 
 which God called for, did terrible execution; it <I>devoured the great 
 deep,</I> as the fire that fell from heaven on Elijah's altar licked up 
 the water that was in the trench. Though the water designed for the 
 stopping and quenching of this fire was as the water of the great deep, 
 yet it devoured it; for who, or what, can stand before a fire kindled 
 by the wrath of God! It did <I>eat up a part,</I> a great part, of the 
 cities where it was sent; or it was as the fire at Taberah, which 
 <I>consumed the outermost parts of the camp</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:1">Num. xi. 1</A>);

 when some were overthrown others were <I>as brands plucked out of the
 fire.</I> All deserved to be devoured, but it ate up only a part, for 
 God does not stir up all his wrath.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The prophet goes forth to meet him in the way of his judgments, and 
 by prayer seeks to turn away his wrath, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 When he saw, in vision, what dreadful work these caterpillars made, 
 that they had eaten up in a manner <I>all the grass of the land</I> (he 
 foresaw they would do so, if suffered to go on), then he said, <I>O 
 Lord God! forgive, I beseech thee</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 <I>cease, I beseech thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 He that foretold the judgment in his preaching to the people, yet 
 deprecated it in his intercessions for them. <I>He is a prophet, and he 
 shall pray for thee.</I> It was the business of prophets to pray for 
 those to whom they prophesied, and so to make it appear that though 
 they denounced they did not <I>desire the woeful day. Therefore,</I> 
 God showed his prophets the evils coming, that they might befriend the 
 people, not only by warning them, but by praying for them, and 
 <I>standing in the gap,</I> to turn away God's wrath, as Moses, that 
 great prophet, often did. Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The prophet's prayer: <I>O Lord God!</I> 

 [1.] <I>Forgive, I beseech thee,</I> and take away the sin,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 He sees sin at the bottom of the trouble, and therefore concludes that 
 the pardon of sin must be at the bottom of deliverance, and prays for 
 that in the first place. Note, Whatever calamity we are under, personal 
 or public, the forgiveness of sin is that which we should be most 
 earnest with God for. 

 [2.] <I>Cease, I beseech thee,</I> and take away the judgment; cease 
 the fire, cease the controversy; <I>cause they anger towards us to 
 cease.</I> This follows upon the forgiveness of sin. Take away the 
 cause and effect will cease. Note, Those whom God contends with will 
 soon find what need they have to cry for a cessation of arms; and there 
 are hopes that though God has begun, and proceeded far, in his 
 controversy, yet it may be obtained.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The prophet's plea to enforce this prayer: <I>By whom shall Jacob 
 arise, for he is small?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 And it is repeated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 and yet no vain repetition. Christ, <I>in his agony,</I> prayed 
 earnestly, <I>saying the same words,</I> again and again.

 [1.] It is Jacob that he is interceding for, the professing people of 
 God, called by his name, calling on his name, the seed of Jacob, his 
 chosen, and in covenant with him. It it Jacob's case that is in this 
 prayer spread before the God of Jacob.

 [2.] <I>Jacob is small,</I> very small already, weakened and brought 
 low by former judgments; and therefore, it these come, he will be quite 
 ruined and brought to nothing. The people are few; <I>the dust of 
 Jacob,</I> which was once innumerable, is now soon counted. Those few 
 are feeble (it is <I>the worm Jacob,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:14">Isa. xli. 14</A>);

 they are unable to help themselves or one another. Sin will soon make a
 great people small, will diminish the numerous, impoverish the 
 plenteous, and weaken the courageous.

 [3.] <I>By whom shall he arise?</I> He has fallen, and cannot help 
 himself up, and he has no friend to help him, none to raise him, unless 
 the hand of God do it; what will become of him, then, if the hand that 
 should raise him to stretched out against him? Note, When the state of 
 God's church is very low and very helpless it is proper to be 
 recommended by our prayers to God's pity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. God graciously lets fall his controversy, in answer to the prophet's 
 prayer, once and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>The Lord repented for this.</I> He did not change his mind, for he 
 is one mind and who can turn him? But he changed is way, took another 
 course, and determined to deal in mercy and not in wrath. He said, 
 <I>It shall not be.</I> And again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 <I>This also shall not be.</I> The caterpillars were countermanded, 
 were remanded; a stop was put to the progress of the fire, and thus a 
 reprieve was granted. See the power of prayer, of <I>effectual 
 fervent</I> prayer, and how much it <I>avails,</I> what great things it 
 prevails for. A stop has many a time been put to a judgment by making 
 <I>supplication to the Judge.</I> This was not the first time that 
 Israel's life was begged, and so saved. See what a blessing praying 
 people, praying prophets, are to a land, and therefore how highly they 
 ought to be valued. Ruin would many a time have broken in if they had 
 not stood in the breach, and made good the pass. See how ready, how 
 swift, God is to show mercy, how he <I>waits to be gracious.</I> Amos 
 moves for a reprieve, and obtains it, because God inclines to grant it 
 and looks about to see if there be any that will intercede for it, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:16">Isa. lix. 16</A>.

 Nor are former reprieves objected against further instances of mercy,
 but are rather encouragements to pray and hope for them. This also 
 shall not be, any more than that. It is the glory of God that he 
 <I>multiplies to pardon,</I> that he spares, and forgives, to more than 
 seventy times seven times.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We have here the rejection of those at last who had been often 
 reprieved and yet never reclaimed, reduced to straits and yet never 
 reduced to their God and their duty. This is represented to the prophet 
 by a vision 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>)

 and an express prediction of utter ruin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The vision is of a <I>plumb-line,</I> a line with a plummet at the 
 end of it, such as masons and bricklayers use to run up a wall by, that 
 they may work it straight and true, and by rule. 

 (1.) Israel was a wall, a strong wall, which God himself had reared, as 
 a bulwark, or wall of defence, to his sanctuary, which he set up among 
 them. The Jewish church says of herself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:10">Cant. viii. 10</A>),

 <I>I am a wall, and my breasts are like towers.</I> This wall was
 <I>made by a plumb-line,</I> very exact and firm. So happy was its 
 constitution, so well compacted, and every thing so well ordered 
 according to the model; it had long stood fast as a wall of brass. But,

 (2.) God now <I>stands upon</I> this wall, not to hold it up, but to 
 tread it down, or, rather, to consider what he should do with it. He 
 <I>stands upon it with a plumb-line in his hand,</I> to take measure of 
 it, that it may appear to be a bowing, bulging wall. <I>Recti est index 
 sui et oblique--This plumb-line would discover where it was 
 crooked.</I> Thus God would bring the people of Israel to the trial, 
 would discover their wickedness, and show wherein they erred; and he 
 would likewise bring his judgments upon them according to equity, would 
 set a <I>plumb-line in the midst of them,</I> to mark how far their 
 wall must be pulled down, as David measured the <I>Moabites with a 
 line</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:2">2 Sam. viii. 2</A>)

 to <I>put them to death.</I> And, when God is coming to the ruin of a
 people, he is said to <I>lay judgment to the line and righteousness to 
 the plummet;</I> for when he punishes it is with exactness. It is now 
 determined: "<I>I will not again pass by them any more;</I> they shall 
 not be spared and reprieved as they have been; their punishment shall 
 not be <I>turned away,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+1:3"><I>ch.</I> i. 3</A>.

 Note, God's patience, which has long been sinned against, will at
 length be sinned away; and the time will come when those that have been 
 spared often shall be no longer spared. <I>My spirit shall not always 
 strive.</I> After frequent reprieves, yet a day of execution will 
 come.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The prediction is of utter ruin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 (1.) The body of the people shall be destroyed, with all those things 
 that were their ornament and defence. They are here called <I>Isaac</I> 
 as well as <I>Israel, the house of Isaac</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 some think in allusion to the signification of Isaac's name; it is 
 <I>laughter;</I> they shall become a jest among all their neighbours; 
 their neighbours shall <I>laugh at them.</I> The desolation shall 
 fasten upon their high places and their <I>sanctuaries,</I> either 
 their <I>castles</I> or their <I>temples,</I> both built on high 
 places. Their castles they thought safe, and their temples sacred as 
 sanctuaries. These shall be <I>laid waste,</I> to punish them for their 
 idolatry and to make them ashamed of their carnal confidences, which 
 were the two things for which God had a controversy with them. When 
 these were made desolate they might read their sin and folly in their 
 punishment. 

 (2.) The royal family shall sink first, as an earnest of the ruin of 
 the whole kingdom: <I>I will rise against the house of Jeroboam,</I> 
 Jeroboam the second, who was now king of the ten tribes; his family was 
 extirpated in his son Zecharias, who was <I>slain with the sword before 
 the people,</I> by Shallum who <I>conspired against him,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:10">2 Kings xv. 10</A>.

 How unrighteous soever the instruments were, God was righteous, and in
 them God rose up against that idolatrous family. Even king's houses
 will be no shelter against the sword of God's wrath.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10 Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of
 Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of
 the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.
 &nbsp; 11 For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and
 Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.
 &nbsp; 12 Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away
 into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:
 &nbsp; 13 But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it <I>is</I> the
 king's chapel, and it <I>is</I> the king's court.
 &nbsp; 14 Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I <I>was</I> no prophet,
 neither <I>was</I> I a prophet's son; but I <I>was</I> a herdman, and a
 gatherer of sycamore fruit:
 &nbsp; 15 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> took me as I followed the flock, and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.
 &nbsp; 16 Now therefore hear thou the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: Thou sayest,
 Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not <I>thy word</I> against the
 house of Isaac.
 &nbsp; 17 Therefore thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Thy wife shall be a harlot
 in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the
 sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die
 in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity
 forth of his land.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 One would have expected, 

 1. That what we met with in the former part of the chapter would awaken
 the people to repentance, when they saw that they were reprieved in 
 order that they might have <I>space to repent</I> and that they could 
 not obtain a pardon unless the did repent. 

 2. That it would endear the prophet Amos to them, who had not only
 shown his good-will to them in praying against the judgments that 
 invaded them, but had prevailed to turn away those judgments, which, if 
 they had had any sense of gratitude, would have gained him an interest 
 in their affections. But it fell out quite contrary; they continue 
 impenitent, and the next news we hear of Amos is that he is persecuted.
 Note, As it is the praise of great saints that they pray for those that 
 are enemies to them, so it is the shame of many great sinners that they 
 are enemies to those who pray for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:13,109:4">Ps. xxxv. 13, 15; cix. 4</A>.

 We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The malicious information brought to the king against the prophet 
 Amos, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 The informer was <I>Amaziah the priest of Bethel,</I> the chief of the 
 priests that ministered to the golden calf there, the <I>president of 
 Bethel</I> (so some read it), that had the principal hand in civil 
 affairs there. He complained against Amos, not only because he 
 prophesied without license from him, but because he prophesied against 
 his altars, which would soon be deserted and demolished if Amos's 
 preaching could but gain credit. Thus the shrine-makers at Ephesus 
 hated Paul, because his preaching tended to spoil their trade. Note, 
 Great pretenders to sanctity are commonly the worst enemies to those 
 who are really sanctified. Priests have been the most bitter 
 persecutors. Amaziah brings an information to Jeroboam against Amos. 
 Observe, 

 1. The crime he is charged with is no less than treason: "<I>Amos has
 conspired against thee,</I> to depose and murder thee; he aims at 
 succeeding thee, and therefore is taking the most effectual way to 
 weaken thee. He sows the seeds of sedition in the hearts of the good 
 subjects of the king, and makes them disaffected to him and his 
 government, that he may draw them by degrees from their allegiance; 
 upon this account <I>the land is not able to bear his words.</I>" It is 
 slyly insinuated to the king that the country was exasperated against 
 him, and it is given in as their sense that his preaching was 
 intolerable, and such as nobody could be reconciled to, such as the 
 times would by no means bear, that is, the men of the times would not.
 Both the impudence of his supposed treason, and the bad influence it 
 would have upon the country, are intimated in that part of the charge, 
 that he conspired against the king in the midst of the house of Israel.
 Note, It is no new thing for the accusers of the brethren to 
 misrepresent them as enemies to the king and kingdom, as traitors to 
 their prince and troublers of the land, when really they are the best 
 friends to both. And it is common for designing men to assert that as 
 the sense of the country which is far from being so. And yet here, I 
 doubt, it was too true, that the people could not bear plain dealing 
 any more than the priests. 

 2. The words laid in the indictment for the support of this charge

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>Amos says</I> (and they have witnesses ready to prove it) 
 <I>Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall be led away 
 captive;</I> and hence they infer that he is an enemy to his king and 
 country, and not to be tolerated. See the malice of Amaziah; he does 
 not tell the king how Amos had interceded for Israel, and by his 
 intercession had turned away first one judgment and then another, and 
 did not let fall his intercession till he saw the decree had gone 
 forth; he does not tell him that these threatenings were conditional, 
 and that he had often assured them that if they would repent and reform 
 the ruin should be prevented. Nay, it was not true that he said, 
 <I>Jeroboam shall die by the sword,</I> nor did he so die 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:28">2 Kings xiv. 28</A>),

 but that God would <I>rise against the house of Jeroboam with the
 sword,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 God's prophets and ministers have often had occasion to make David's 
 complaint 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:5">Ps. lvi. 5</A>),

 <I>Every day they wrest my words.</I> But shall it be made the
 watchman's crime, when he sees the sword coming, to give warning to the 
 people, that they may get themselves secured? or the physician's crime 
 to tell his patient of the danger of his disease, that he may use means 
 for the cure of it? What enemies are foolish men to themselves, to 
 their own peace, to their best friends! It does not appear that 
 Jeroboam took any notice of this information; perhaps he reverenced a 
 prophet, and stood more in awe of the divine authority than Amaziah his 
 priest did.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The method he used to persuade Amos to withdraw and quit the 
 country 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>);

 when he could not gain his point with the king to have Amos imprisoned, 
 banished, or put to death, or at least to have him frightened into 
 silence or flight, he tried what he could do by fair means to get rid 
 of him; he insinuated himself into his acquaintance, and with all the 
 arts of wheedling endeavored to persuade him to go and prophesy in the 
 <I>land of Judah,</I> and not at Bethel. He owns him to be a seer, and
 does not pretend to enjoin him silence, but suggests to him,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That Bethel was not a proper place for him to exercise his ministry 
 in, for it was <I>the king's chapel,</I> or <I>sanctuary,</I> where he 
 had his idols and their altars and priests; and it was <I>the king's 
 court,</I> or <I>the house of the kingdom,</I> where the royal family 
 resided and where were set the thrones of judgment; and therefore 
 <I>prophesy not any more</I> here. And why not? 

 (1.) Because Amos is too plain and blunt a preacher for the court and 
 the king's chapel. Those that <I>wear silk and fine clothing,</I> and
 speak silken soft words, are fit for king's palaces. 

 (2.) Because the worship that is in the king's chapel will be a 
 continual vexation and trouble to Amos; let him therefore get far 
 enough from it, and what the eye sees not the heart grieves not for. 
 
 (3.) Because it was not fit that the king and his house should be 
 affronted in their own court and chapel by the reproofs and 
 threatenings which Amos was continually teazing them with in the name 
 of the Lord; as if it were the prerogative of the prince, and the 
 privilege of the peers, when they are running headlong upon a 
 precipice, not to be told of their danger.

 (4.) Because he could not expect any countenance or encouragement 
 there, but, on the contrary, to be bantered and ridiculed by some and 
 to be threatened and brow-beaten by others; however, he could not think 
 to make any converts there, or to persuade any from that idolatry which 
 was supported by the authority and example of the king. To preach his 
 doctrine there was but (as we say) to run his head against a post; and 
 therefore <I>prophesy no more</I> there. But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He persuades him that the land of Judah was the fittest place for 
 him to set up in: <I>Flee thee away</I> thither with all speed, and 
 <I>there eat bread,</I> and <I>prophesy there.</I> There thou wilt be 
 safe; there thou wilt be welcome; the king's court and chapel there are 
 on thy side; the prophets there will second thee; the priests and 
 princes there will take notice of thee, and allow thee an honourable 
 maintenance. See here, 

 (1.) How willing wicked men are to get clear of their faithful 
 reprovers, and how ready to <I>say to the seers, See not,</I> or See 
 not for us; the two witnesses were a torment to those that dwelt on the 
 earth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:10">Rev. xi. 10</A>),

 and it were indeed a pity that men should be <I>tormented before the 
 time,</I> but that it is in order to the preventing of eternal torment. 
 
 (2.) How apt worldly men are to measure others by themselves. Amaziah, 
 as a priest, aimed at nothing but the profits of his place, and he 
 thought Amos, as a prophet, had the same views, and therefore advised 
 him to prophesy were he might <I>eat bread,</I> where he might be sure 
 to have as much as he chose; whereas Amos was to prophesy where God 
 appointed him, and where there was most need of him, not where he would 
 get most money. Note, Those that make gain their godliness, and are 
 governed by the hopes of wealth and preferment themselves, are ready to 
 think these the most powerful inducements with others also.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The reply which Amos made to these suggestions of Amaziah's. He 
 did not <I>consult with flesh and blood,</I> nor was it his care to 
 enrich himself, but to <I>make full proof of his ministry,</I> and to 
 be found faithful in the discharge of it, not to sleep in a whole skin, 
 but to keep a good conscience; and therefore he resolved to abide by 
 his post, and, in answer to Amaziah,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He justified himself in his constant adherence to his work and to 
 his place 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>);

 and that which he was sure would not only bear him out, but bind him to 
 it, was that he had a divine warrant and commission for it: "<I>I was 
 no prophet, nor prophet's son,</I> neither born nor bred to the office, 
 not originally designed for a prophet, as Samuel and Jeremiah, not 
 educated in the schools of the prophets, as many others were; but <I>I 
 was a herdsman,</I> a keeper of cattle, and <I>a gatherer of 
 sycamore-fruit.</I>" Our sycamores bear no fruit, but, it seems, theirs 
 did, which Amos gathered either for his cattle or for himself and his 
 family, or to sell. He was a plain country-man, bred up and employed in 
 country work and used to country fare. He <I>followed the flocks</I> as 
 well as the herds, and thence God <I>took him,</I> and bade him 
 <I>go</I> and <I>prophesy to his people Israel,</I> deliver to them 
 such messages as he should from time to time <I>receive from the 
 Lord.</I> God made him a prophet, and a prophet to them, appointed him 
 his work and appointed him his post. Therefore he ought not to be 
 silenced, for, 

 (1.) He could produce a divine commission for what he did. He did not 
 run before he was sent, but pleads, as Paul, that he was <I>called to 
 be an apostle;</I> and men will find it is at their peril if they 
 contradict and oppose any that come in God's name, if they say to his 
 <I>seers, See not,</I> or silence those whom he has bidden to speak; 
 such <I>fight against God.</I> An affront done to an ambassador is an 
 affront to the prince that sends him. Those that have a warrant from 
 God ought not to <I>fear the face of man.</I> 

 (2.) The mean character he wore before he received that commission 
 strengthened his warrant, so far was it from weakening it.

 [1.] He had no thoughts at all of ever being a prophet, and therefore 
 his prophesying could not be imputed to a raised expectation or a 
 heated imagination, but purely to a divine impulse.

 [2.] He was not educated nor instructed in the art or mystery of 
 prophesying, and therefore he must have his abilities for it 
 immediately from God, which is an undeniable proof that he had his 
 mission from him. The apostles, being originally unlearned and ignorant 
 men, evidenced that they owed their knowledge to their having <I>been 
 with Jesus,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Act+4:13">Acts iv. 13</A>.

 When the treasure is put into such earthen vessels, it is thereby made
 to appear that the <I>excellency of the power is of God, and not of 
 man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:7">2 Cor. iv. 7</A>.

 [3.] He had an honest calling, by which he could comfortably maintain 
 himself and his family; and therefore did not need to prophesy for 
 bread, as Amaziah suggested

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 did not take it up as a trade to live by, but as a trust to honour God 
 and do good with. 

 [4.] He had all his days been accustomed to a plain homely way of 
 living among poor husbandmen, and never affected either gaieties or 
 dainties, and therefore would not have thrust himself so near the 
 king's court and chapel if the business God had called him to had not 
 called him thither.

 [5.] Having been so meanly bred, he could not have the courage to speak 
 to kings and great men, especially to speak such bold and provoking 
 things to them, if he had not been animated by a greater spirit than 
 his own. If God, that sent him, had not strengthened him, he could not 
 thus have <I>set his face as a flint,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:7">Isa. l. 7</A>.

 Note, God often chooses the <I>weak and foolish things of the world</I>
 to confound the wise and mighty; and a herdman of Tekoa puts to shame a 
 priest of Bethel, when he receives from God authority and ability to 
 act for him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He condemns Amaziah for the opposition he gave them, and denounces 
 the judgments of God against him, not from any private resentment or 
 revenge, but in the name of the Lord and by authority from him, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 Amaziah would not suffer Amos to preach at all, and therefore he is 
 particularly ordered to preach against him: <I>Now therefore hear thou 
 the word of the Lord,</I> hear it and tremble. Those that cannot bear
 general woes may expect woes of their own. The sin he is charged with 
 is forbidding Amos to prophesy; we do not find that he beat him, or put 
 him in the stocks, only he enjoined him silence: <I>Prophesy not 
 against Israel, and drop not thy word against the house of Isaac;</I> 
 he must not only thunder against them, but he must not so much as drop 
 a word against them; he cannot bear, no, not the most gentle distilling 
 of that rain, that small rain. Let him therefore hear his doom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) For the opposition he gave to Amos God will bring ruin upon 
 himself and his family. This was the sin that filled the measure of his 
 iniquity. 

 [1.] He shall have no comfort in any of his relations, but be afflicted 
 in those that were nearest to him: <I>His wife shall be a harlot;</I> 
 either she shall be forcibly abused by the soldiers, as the Levite's 
 concubine by the men of Gibeah (they <I>ravish the women of Zion,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:11">Lam. v. 11</A>),

 or she shall herself wickedly play the harlot, which, though her sin,
 her great sin, would be his affliction, his great affliction and 
 reproach, and a just punishment upon him for promoting spiritual 
 whoredom. Sometimes the sins of our relations are to be looked upon as 
 judgments of God upon us. His children, though they keep honest, yet 
 shall not keep alive: <I>His sons and his daughters shall fall by the 
 sword</I> of war, and he himself shall live to see it. He has trained 
 them up in iniquity, and therefore God will cut them off in it.

 [2.] He shall be stripped of all his estate; it shall fall into the 
 hand of the enemy, and be <I>divided by line,</I> by lot, among the 
 soldiers. What is ill begotten will not be long kept.

 [3.] He shall himself perish in a strange country, not in the <I>land
 of Israel,</I> which had been holiness to the Lord, but in a 
 <I>polluted land,</I> in a heathen country, the fittest place for such 
 a heathen to end his days in, that hated and silenced God's prophets 
 and contributed so much to the polluting of his own land with 
 idolatry.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Notwithstanding the opposition he gave to Amos, God will bring 
 ruin upon the land and nation. He was accused for saying, <I>Israel 
 shall be led away captive</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 but he stands to it, and repeats it; for the unbelief of man shall not 
 make the word of God of no effect. The <I>burden of the word of the 
 Lord</I> may be striven with, but it cannot be shaken off. Let Amaziah 
 rage, and fret, and say what he will to the contrary, <I>Israel shall 
 surely go into captivity forth of his land.</I> Note, it is to no 
 purpose to contend with the judgments of God; for when God judges he 
 will overcome. Stopping the mouths of God's ministers will not stop the
 progress of God's word, for it shall not return void.</P>
