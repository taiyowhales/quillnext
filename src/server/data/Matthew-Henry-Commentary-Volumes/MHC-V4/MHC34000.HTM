 name of this prophet signifies a <I>comforter;</I> for it was a charge 
 given to all the prophets, <I>Comfort you, comfort you, my people:</I> 
 and even this prophet, though wholly taken up in foretelling the 
 destruction of Nineveh, which speaks terror to the Assyrians, is, even 
 in that, comforter to the ten tribes of Israel, who, it is probable, 
 were now lately carried captives into Assyria. It is very uncertain at 
 what time he lived and prophesied, but it is most probable that he 
 lived in the time of Hezekiah, and prophesied against Nineveh, after 
 the captivity of Israel by the king of Assyria, which was in the ninth 
 year of Hezekiah, and before Sennacherib's invading Judah, which was in 
 the fourteenth year of Hezekiah, for to that attempt, and the defeat of 
 it, it is supposed, the first chapter has reference; and it is probable 
 that it was delivered a little before it, for the encouragement of 
 God's people in that day of treading down and perplexity. It is the 
 conjecture of the learned Huetius that the two other chapters of this 
 book were delivered by Nahum some years after, perhaps in the reign of 
 Manasseh, and in that reign the Jewish chronologies generally place 
 him, somewhat nearer to the time when Nineveh was conquered, and the 
 Assyrian monarchy reduced, by Cyaxares and Nebuchadnezzar, some time 
 before the first captivity of Judah. It is probable that Nahum did by 
 word of mouth prophesy many things concerning Israel and Judah, as it 
 is certain that Jonah did

 though we have nothing of either of them in writing, but what related
 to Nineveh, of which though a great and ancient city, yet probably we 
 should never have heard in sacred writ if the Israel of God had not had 
 some concern in it.</P>
