 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet proceeds, in this chapter, both to magnify and to justify 
 the destruction that God was bringing upon this people, to show how 
 grievous it would be and yet how righteous. 

 I. He represents the judgments coming as so very terrible that death
 should appear so as most to be dreaded and yet should be desired, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. He aggravates the wretched stupidity and wilfulness of this people
 as that which brought this ruin upon them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:4-12">ver. 4-12</A>.

 III. He describes the great confusion and consternation that the whole
 land should be in upon the alarm of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:13-17">ver. 13-17</A>.

 IV. The prophet is himself deeply affected with it and lays it very 
 much to heart,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  At that time, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, they shall bring out the bones
 of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the
 bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the
 bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves:
 &nbsp; 2  And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and
 all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have
 served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have
 sought, and whom they have worshipped: they shall not be
 gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of
 the earth.
 &nbsp; 3  And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue
 of them that remain of this evil family, which remain in all the
 places whither I have driven them, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These verses might fitly have been joined to the close of the foregoing
 chapter, as giving a further description of the dreadful desolation 
 which the army of the Chaldeans should make in the land. It shall 
 strangely alter the property of death itself, and for the worse 
 too.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Death shall not now be, as it always used to be--the repose of the
 dead. When Job makes his court to the grave it is in hope of this, that 
 <I>there he shall rest with kings and counsellors of the earth;</I> but 
 now the ashes of the dead, even of <I>kings</I> and <I>princes,</I> 
 shall be disturbed, and their <I>bones scattered at the grave's 
 mouth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:7">Ps. cxli. 7</A>.

 It was threatened in the close of the former chapter that the slain
 should be unburied; that might be through neglect, and was not so 
 strange; but here we find the graves of those that were buried 
 industriously and maliciously opened by the victorious enemy, who 
 either for covetousness, hoping to find treasure in the graves, or for 
 spite to the nation and in a rage against it, <I>brought out the bones 
 of the kings of Judah and the princes.</I> The dignity of their 
 sepulchres could not secure them, nay, did the more expose them to be 
 rifled; but it was base and barbarous thus to trample upon royal dust. 
 We will hope that the bones of good Josiah were not disturbed, because 
 he piously protected the bones of the man of God when he burnt the 
 bones of the idolatrous priests, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:18">2 Kings xxiii. 18</A>.

 The bones of the priests and prophets too were digged up and thrown
 about. Some think the false prophets and the idol-priests, God putting 
 this mark of ignominy upon them: but, if they were God's prophets and 
 his priests, it is what the Psalmist complains of as the fruit of the 
 outrage of the enemies,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:1,2">Ps. lxxix. 1, 2</A>.

 Nay, those of the spiteful Chaldeans that could not reach to violate 
 the sepulchres of princes and priests would rather play at small game 
 than sit out, and therefore pulled the bones of the ordinary 
 <I>inhabitants of Jerusalem out of their graves.</I> The barbarous 
 nations were sometimes guilty of these absurd and inhuman triumphs over 
 those they had conquered, and God permitted it here, for a mark of his 
 displeasure against the generation of his wrath, and for terror to 
 those that survived. The bones, being dug out of the graves, were 
 spread abroad upon the face of the earth in contempt, and to make the 
 reproach the more spreading and lasting. They spread them to be dried 
 that they might carry them about in triumph, or might make fuel of 
 them, or make some superstitious use of them. <I>They shall be spread 
 before the sun</I> (for they shall not be ashamed openly to avow the 
 fact at noon day) and before <I>the moon and</I> stars, even <I>all the 
 host of heaven,</I> whom they have made idols of,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 From the mention of the <I>sun, moon, and stars,</I> which should be
 the unconcerned spectators of this tragedy, the prophet takes occasion 
 to show how they had idolized them, and paid those respects to them 
 which they should have paid to God only, that it might be observed how 
 little they got by worshipping the creature, for the creatures they 
 worshipped when they were in distress saw it, but regarded it not, nor 
 gave them any relief, but were rather pleased to see those abused in 
 being vilified by whom they had been abused in being deified. See how 
 their respects to their idols are enumerated, to show how we ought to 
 behave towards our God. 

 1. They <I>loved</I> them. As amiable being and bountiful benefactors
 they esteemed them and delighted in them, and therefore did all that 
 follows. 

 2. They <I>served</I> them, did all they could in honour of them, and 
 thought nothing too much; they conformed to all the laws of their 
 superstition, without disputing. 

 3. They <I>walked after</I> them, strove to imitate and resemble them,
 according to the characters and accounts of them they had received, 
 which gave rise and countenance to much of the abominable wickedness of 
 the heathen. 

 4. They <I>sought</I> them, consulted them as oracles, appealed to them 
 as judges, implored their favour, and prayed to them as their 
 benefactors.

 5. They <I>worshipped</I> them, gave them divine honour, as having a
 sovereign dominion over them. Before these light of heaven, which they 
 had courted, shall their dead bodies be cast, and left to putrefy, and 
 to be <I>as dung upon the face of the earth;</I> and the sun's shining 
 upon them will but make them the more noisome and offensive. Whatever 
 we make a god of but the true God only, it will stand us in no stead on 
 the other side death and the grave, nor for the body, much less for the 
 soul.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Death shall now be what it never used to be--the choice of the
 living, not because there appears in it any thing delightsome; on the 
 contrary, death never appeared in more horrid frightful shapes than 
 now, when they cannot promise themselves either a comfortable death or 
 a human burial; and yet every thing in this world shall become so 
 irksome, and all the prospects so black and dismal, that <I>death shall 
 be chosen rather than life</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 not in a believing hope of happiness in the other life, but in an utter 
 despair of any ease in this life. The nation is now reduced to a 
 <I>family,</I> so small is <I>the residue of those that remain</I> in 
 it; and it is an <I>evil family,</I> still as bad as ever, their hearts 
 unhumbled and their lusts unmortified. These <I>remain</I> alive (and 
 that is all) in the many <I>places whither they were driven</I> by the 
 judgments of God, some prisoners in the country of their enemies, 
 others beggars in their neighbour's country, and others fugitives and 
 vagabonds there and in their own country. And, though those that died 
 died very miserably, yet those that survived and were thus driven out 
 should live yet more miserably, so that they should <I>choose death 
 rather than life,</I> and wish a thousand times that they had fallen 
 with those that fell by the sword. Let this cure us of the inordinate 
 love of life, that the case may be such that it may become a burden and 
 terror, and we may be strongly tempted to <I>choose strangling</I> and 
 death rather.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Shall
 they fall, and not arise? shall he turn away, and not return?
 &nbsp; 5  Why <I>then</I> is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a
 perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to
 return.
 &nbsp; 6  I hearkened and heard, <I>but</I> they spake not aright: no man
 repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every
 one turned to his course, as the horse rusheth into the battle.
 &nbsp; 7  Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and
 the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of

 scribes <I>is</I> in vain.

 they have rejected the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and what wisdom <I>is</I> in
 them?
 &nbsp; 10  Therefore will I give their wives unto others, <I>and</I> their
 fields to them that shall inherit <I>them:</I> for every one from the
 least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness, from the
 prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.
 &nbsp; 11  For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people
 slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when <I>there is</I> no peace.
 &nbsp; 12  Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay,
 they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore
 shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their
 visitation they shall be cast down, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet here is instructed to set before this people the folly of 
 their impenitence, which was it that brought this ruin upon them. They 
 are here represented as the most stupid senseless people in the world, 
 that would not be made wise by all the methods that Infinite Wisdom 
 took to bring them to themselves and their right mind, and so to 
 prevent the ruin that was coming upon them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They would not attend to the dictates of reason. They would not act 
 in the affairs of their souls with the same common prudence with which 
 they acted in other things. Sinners would become saints if they would 
 but show themselves men, and religion would soon rule them if right 
 reason might. Observe it here. <I>Come, and let us reason together, 
 saith the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>):

 <I>Shall men fall and not arise?</I> If men happen to fall to the 
 ground, to fall into the dirt, will they not get up again as fast as 
 they can? They are not such fools as to lie still when they are down. 
 Shall <I>a man turn aside</I> out of the right way? Yes, the most 
 careful traveller may miss his way; but then, as soon as he is aware of 
 it, <I>will he not return?</I> Yes, certainly he will, with all speed, 
 and will thank him that showed him his mistake. Thus men do in other 
 things. <I>Why then has this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a 
 perpetual backsliding?</I> Why do not they, when they have fallen into 
 sin, hasten to get up again by repentance? Why do not they, when they
 see they have missed their way, correct their error and reform? No man 
 in his wits will go on in a way that he knows will never bring him to 
 his journey's end; <I>why then has this people slidden back by a 
 perpetual backsliding?</I> See the nature of sin--it is a 
 <I>backsliding</I> it is going back from the right way, not only into a 
 by-path, but into a contrary path, back from the way that leads to life 
 to that which leads to utter destruction. And this backsliding, if 
 almighty grace do not interpose to prevent it, will be a perpetual 
 backsliding. The sinner not only wanders endlessly, but proceeds 
 end-ways towards ruin. The same subtlety of the tempter that brings men 
 to sin holds them fast in it, and they contribute to their own 
 captivity: <I>They hold fast deceit.</I> Sin is a great cheat, and they 
 <I>hold it fast;</I> they love it dearly, and resolve to stick to it, 
 and baffle all the methods God takes to separate between them and their 
 sins. The excuses they make for their sins are deceits, and so are all 
 their hopes of impunity; yet they hold fast these, and will not be 
 undeceived, and therefore <I>they refuse to return.</I> Note, There is 
 some deceit or other which those hold fast that go on wilfully in 
 sinful ways, some <I>lie in their right hand,</I> by which they keep 
 hold of their sins.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They would not attend to the dictates of conscience, which is our 
 reason reflecting upon ourselves and our own actions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. What expectations there were from them, that they would bethink
 themselves: <I>I hearkened and heard.</I> The prophet listened to see 
 what effect his preaching had upon them; God himself listened, as one 
 that desires not the death of sinners, that would have been glad to 
 hear any thing that promised repentance, that would certainly have 
 heard it if there had been any thing said of that tendency, and would 
 soon have answered it with comfort, as he did David when he said, <I>I 
 will confess,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:5">Ps. xxxii. 5</A>.

 God <I>looks upon men</I> when they have done amiss

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:27">Job xxxiii. 27</A>),

 to see what they will do next; he <I>hearkens and hears.</I>

 2. How these expectations were disappointed: <I>They spoke not 
 aright,</I> as I thought they would have done. They did not only not 
 <I>do right,</I> but not so much as <I>speak right;</I> God could not 
 get a good word from them, nothing on which to ground any favour to 
 them or hopes concerning them. There was <I>none of them</I> that 
 <I>spoke aright,</I> none that <I>repented him of his wickedness.</I> 
 those that have sinned then, and then only, speak aright when they 
 speak of repenting; and it is sad when those that have made so much 
 work for repentance do not say a word of repenting. Not only did God 
 not find any repenting of the national wickedness, which might have 
 helped to empty the measure of public guilt, but none repented of that 
 particular wickedness which he knew himself guilty of.

 (1.) They did not so much as take the first step towards repentance; 
 they did not so much as say, <I>What have I done?</I> There was no 
 motion towards it, not the least sign or token of it. Note, True 
 repentance beings in a serious and impartial inquiry into ourselves, 
 <I>what have we done,</I> arising from a conviction that we have done 
 amiss. 

 (2.) They were so far from repenting of their sins that they went on 
 resolutely in their sins: <I>Every one turned to his course,</I> his 
 wicked course, that course of sin which he had chosen and accustomed 
 himself to, <I>as the horse rushes into the battle,</I> eager upon 
 action, and scorning to be curbed. How the horse rushes into the battle 
 is elegantly described,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:21">Job xxxix. 21</A>,

 &c. <I>He mocks at fear and is not affrighted.</I> Thus the daring
 sinner laughs at the threatenings of the word as bugbears, and runs 
 violently upon the instruments of death and slaughter, and nothing will 
 be restrained from him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They would not attend to the dictates of providence, nor 
 understand the voice of God in them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 It is an instance of their sottishness that, though they are God's
 people, and therefore should readily understand his mind upon every 
 intimation of it, yet they <I>know not the judgment of the Lord;</I> 
 they apprehend not the meaning either of a mercy or an affliction, not 
 how to accommodate themselves to either, nor to answer God's intention 
 in either. They know not how to improve the seasons of grave that God 
 affords them when he sends them his prophets, nor how to make use of 
 the rebukes they are under when <I>his voice cries in the city.</I> 
 They <I>discern not the signs of the times</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:3">Matt. xvi. 3</A>),

 nor are aware how God is dealing with them. They know not that way of
 duty which God had prescribed them, though it be written both in their 
 hearts and in their books.

 2. It is an aggravation of their sottishness that there is so much
 sagacity in the inferior creatures. <I>The stork in the heaven knows
 her appointed times</I> of coming and continuing; so do other 
 season-birds, <I>the turtle, the crane, and the swallow.</I> These by a 
 natural instinct change their quarters, as the temper of the air 
 alters; they come when the spring comes, and go, we know not whither, 
 when the winter approaches, probably into warmer climates, as some 
 birds come with winter and go when that is over.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. They would not attend to the dictates of the written word. They 
 say, <I>We are wise;</I> but <I>how</I> can they say so? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 With what face can they pretend to any thing of wisdom, when they do
 not understand themselves so well as the brute-creatures? Why, truly, 
 they think they are wise because <I>the law of the Lord is with 
 them,</I> the book of the law and the interpreters of it; and their 
 neighbours, for the same reason, conclude they are wise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:6">Deut. iv. 6</A>.

 But their pretensions are groundless for all this: <I>Lo, certainly in
 vain made he it;</I> surely never any people had Bibles to so little 
 purpose as they have. They might as well have been without the law, 
 unless they had made a better use of it. God has indeed made it able to 
 make men wise to salvation, but as to them it is made so in vain, for 
 they are never the wiser for it: <I>The pen of the scribes,</I> of 
 those that first wrote the law and of those that now write expositions 
 of it, <I>is in vain.</I> Both the favour of their God and the labour 
 of their scribes are lost upon them; they receive the grace of God 
 therein in vain. Note, There are many that enjoy abundance of the means 
 of grace, that have great plenty of Bibles and ministers, but they have 
 them in vain; they do not answer the end of their having them. But it 
 might be said, They have some wise men among them, to whom the law and 
 the pen of the scribes are not in vain. To this it is answered

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>The wise men are ashamed,</I> that is, they have reasons to be so, 
 that they have not made a better use of their wisdom, and lived more up 
 to it. <I>They are confounded and taken;</I> all their wisdom has not 
 served to keep them from those courses that tend to their ruin. They 
 are taken in the same snares that others of their neighbours, who have 
 not pretended to so much wisdom, are taken in, and filled with the same 
 confusion. Those that have more knowledge than others, and yet do no 
 better than others for their own souls, have reason to be ashamed. They 
 talk of their wisdom, but, <I>Lo, they have rejected the word of the 
 Lord;</I> they would not be governed by it, would not follow its 
 direction, would not do what they knew; <I>and</I> then <I>what wisdom 
 is in them?</I> None to any purpose; none that will be found to their 
 praise at the great day, how much soever it is found to their pride 
 now. The pretenders to wisdom, who said, "<I>We are wise and the law of 
 the Lord is with us,</I>" were the priests and the false prophets; with 
 them the prophet here deals plainly. 

 1. He threatens the judgments of God against them. Their families and
 estates shall be ruined

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):
 
 <I>Their wives shall be given to others,</I> when they are taken 
 captives, <I>and their fields.</I> shall be taken from them by their 
 victorious enemy and shall be given <I>to those that shall inherit 
 them,</I> not only strip them for once, but take possession of them as 
 their own and acquire a property in them as their own and acquire a 
 property in them, which they shall transmit to their posterity. And 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 notwithstanding all their pretensions to wisdom and sanctity, <I>they 
 shall fall among those that fall;</I> for, <I>if the blind lead the 
 blind, both shall fall together into the ditch. In the time of their 
 visitation,</I> when the wickedness of the land comes to be enquired 
 into, it will be found that they have contributed to it more than any, 
 and therefore <I>they shall be</I> sure to be <I>cast down</I> and cast 
 out. 
 
 2. He gives a reason for these judgments
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:10-12"><I>v.</I> 10-12</A>),

 even the same account of their badness which we meet with before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:13-15"><I>ch.</I> vi. 13-15</A>),

 where it was opened at large. 

 (1.) They were greedy of the wealth of this world, which is bad enough 
 in any, but worst in prophets and priests, who should be best 
 acquainted with another world and therefore should be most dead to 
 this. But these, <I>from the least to the greatest,</I> were <I>given 
 to covetousness.</I> The <I>priests teach for hire</I> and the 
 <I>prophets divine for money,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+3:11">Mic. iii. 11</A>.

 (2.) They made no conscience of speaking truth, no, not when they spoke 
 as priests and prophets: <I>Every one deals falsely,</I> looks one way 
 and rows another. There is no such thing as sincerity among them. 

 (3.) They flattered people in their sins, and so flattered them into 
 destruction. They pretended to be the physicians of the state, but
 knew not how to apply proper remedies to its growing maladies; they 
 <I>healed them slightly,</I> killed the patient with palliative cures, 
 silencing their fears and complaints with, "<I>Peace, peace,</I> all is 
 well, and there is no danger," when the God of heaven was proceeding in 
 his controversy with them, so that there could be no peace to them.
 
 (4.) When it was made to appear how basely they prevaricated
 <I>they</I> were not at all ashamed of it, but rather gloried in it,

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>They could not blush,</I> so perfectly lost were they to all sense 
 of virtue and honour. When they were convicted of the grossest 
 forgeries they would justify what they had done, and laugh at those 
 whom they had imposed upon. Such as these were ripe for ruin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  I will surely consume them, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: <I>there shall be</I>
 no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf
 shall fade; and <I>the things that</I> I have given them shall pass
 away from them.
 &nbsp; 14  Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter
 into the defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of gall
 to drink, because we have sinned against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 15  We looked for peace, but no good <I>came; and</I> for a time of
 health, and behold trouble!
 &nbsp; 16  The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole
 land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones;
 for they are come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in
 it; the city, and those that dwell therein.
 &nbsp; 17  For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you,
 which <I>will</I> not <I>be</I> charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 18  <I>When</I> I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart <I>is</I>
 faint in me.
 &nbsp; 19  Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people
 because of them that dwell in a far country: <I>Is</I> not the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in
 Zion? <I>is</I> not her king in her? Why have they provoked me to
 anger with their graven images, <I>and</I> with strange vanities?
 &nbsp; 20  The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not
 saved.
 &nbsp; 21  For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am
 black; astonishment hath taken hold on me.
 &nbsp; 22  <I>Is there</I> no balm in Gilead; <I>is there</I> no physician there?
 why then is not the health of the daughter of my people
 recovered?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God threatening the destruction of a sinful people. He has borne 
 long with them, but they are still more and more provoking, and 
 therefore now their ruin is resolved on: <I>I will surely consume them 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 consuming I will consume them,</I> not only surely, but utterly, 
 consume them, will follow them with one judgment after another, till 
 they are quite consumed; it is a <I>consumption determined,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:23">Isa. x. 23</A>.

 1. They shall be quite stripped of all their comforts
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):
 
 <I>There shall be no grapes on the vine.</I> Some understand this as 
 intimating their sin; God came looking for grapes from this vineyard, 
 seeking fruit upon this fig-tree, but he <I>found none</I> (as 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:2,Lu+13:6">Isa. v. 2, Luke xiii. 6</A>);
 
 nay, they had not so much as leaves, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:19">Matt. xxi. 19</A>.

 But it is rather to be understood of God's judgments upon them, and may
 be meant literally--The enemy shall seize the fruits of the earth, 
 shall pluck the grapes and figs for themselves and beat down the very 
 leaves with them; or, rather, figuratively--They shall be deprived of 
 all their comforts and shall have nothing left them wherewith to 
 <I>make glad their hearts.</I> It is expounded in the last clause: 
 <I>The things that I have given them shall pass away from them.</I> 
 Note, God's gifts are upon condition, and revocable upon
 non-performance of the condition. Mercies abused are forfeited, and it 
 is just with God to take the forfeiture.

 2. They shall be set upon by all manner of grievances, and surrounded 
 with calamities

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>I will send serpents among you,</I> the Chaldean army, fiery 
 serpents, flying serpents, cockatrices; these shall bite them with 
 their venomous teeth, give them wounds that shall be mortal; and they 
 <I>shall not be charmed,</I> as some serpents used to be, with music.
 These are serpents of another nature, that are not so wrought upon, or 
 they are as <I>the deaf adder, that stops her ear, and will not hear 
 the voice of the charmer.</I> The enemies are so intent upon making 
 slaughter that it will be to no purpose to accost them gently, or offer 
 any thing to pacify them, or mollify them, or to bring them to a better 
 temper. No peace with God, therefore none with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The people sinking into despair under the pressure of those 
 calamities. Those that were void of fear (when the trouble was at a 
 distance) and set it at defiance, are void of hope now that it breaks 
 in upon them, and have no heart either to make head against it or to 
 bear up under it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 They cannot think themselves safe in the open villages: <I>Why do we
 sit still here?</I> Let us <I>assemble, and go</I> into a body <I>into 
 the defenced cities.</I> Though they could expect no other than to be 
 surely cut off there at last, yet not so soon as in the country, and 
 therefore, "<I>Let us go, and be silent there;</I> let us attempt 
 nothing, nor so much as make a complaint; for to what purpose?" It is 
 not a submissive, but a sullen silence, that they here condemn 
 themselves to. Those that are most jovial in their prosperity commonly 
 despond most, and are most melancholy, in trouble. Now observe what it
 is that sinks them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They are sensible that God is angry with them: "<I>The Lord our God
 has put us to silence,</I> has struck us with astonishment, and
 <I>given us water of gall to drink,</I> which is both bitter and
 stupifying, or intoxicating. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+60:3">Ps. lx. 3</A>,

 <I>Thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment.</I> We had
 better sit still than rise up and fall; better say nothing than say 
 nothing to the purpose. To what purpose is it to contend with our fate 
 when God himself has become our enemy and fights against us?
 <I>Because we have sinned against the Lord,</I> therefore we are 
 brought to the plunge." This may be taken as the language,

 (1.) Of their indignation. They seem to quarrel with God as if he had 
 dealt hardly with them in putting them to silence, not permitting them 
 to speak for themselves, and then telling them that it was because they 
 had sinned against him. Thus men's foolishness <I>perverts their way,
 and</I> then <I>their hearts fret against the Lord.</I> Or rather, 

 (2.) Of their convictions. At length they begin to see the hand of God 
 lifted up against them, and stretched out in the calamities under which 
 they are now groaning, and to own that they have provoked him to 
 contend with them. Note, Sooner or later God will bring the most 
 obstinate to acknowledge both his providence and his justice in all the 
 troubles they are brought into, to see and say both that it is his hand 
 and that he is righteous.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They are sensible that the enemy is likely to be too hard for them, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 They are soon apprehensive that it is to no purpose to make head
 against such a mighty force; they and their people are quite 
 dispirited; and, when the courage of a nation is gone, their numbers 
 will stand them in little stead. <I>The snorting of the horses was 
 heard from Dan,</I> that is, the report of the formidable strength of 
 their cavalry was soon carried all the nation over and every body 
 <I>trembled at the sound of the neighing of his steeds;</I> for <I>they 
 have devoured the land and all that is in the city;</I> both town and 
 country are laid waste before them, not only the wealth, but the 
 inhabitants, of both, <I>those that dwell therein.</I> Note, When God 
 appears against us, every thing else that is against us appears very 
 formidable; whereas, if he be for us, every thing appears very 
 despicable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:3">Rom. viii. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They are disappointed in their expectations of deliverance out of 
 their troubles, as they had been surprised when their troubles came 
 upon them; and this double disappointment very much aggravated their 
 calamity. 
 
 (1.) The trouble came when they little expected it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):
 
 <I>We looked for peace,</I> the continuance of our peace, <I>but no 
 good came,</I> no good news from abroad; we looked <I>for a time of 
 health</I> and prosperity to our nation, but, <I>behold, trouble,</I> 
 the alarms of war; for, as it follows 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 <I>the noise of the</I> enemies' <I>horses was heard from Dan.</I> 
 Their false prophets had cried <I>Peace, peace,</I> to them, which made 
 it the more terrible when the scene of war opened on a sudden. This 
 complaint will occur again,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:19"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 19</A>.

 (2.) The deliverance did not come when they had long expected it 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>The harvest is past, the summer is ended;</I> that is, there is a
 great deal of time gone. Harvest and summer are parts of the year, and 
 when they are gone the year draws towards a conclusion; so the meaning 
 is, "One year passes after another, one campaign after another, and yet 
 our affairs are in as bad a posture as ever they were; no relief comes, 
 nor is any thing done towards it: <I>We are not saved.</I>" Nay, there 
 is a great deal of opportunity lost, the season of action is over and 
 slipped, the summer and harvest are gone, and a cold and melancholy 
 winter succeeds. Note, The salvation of God's church and people often 
 goes on very slowly, and God keeps his people long in the expectation 
 of it, for wise and holy ends. Nay, they stand in their own light, and
 put a bar in their own door, and are not saved because they are not 
 ready for salvation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They are deceived in those things which were their confidence and 
 which they thought would have secured their peace to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>The daughter of my people</I> cries, cries aloud, <I>because of 
 those that dwell in a far country,</I> because of the foreign enemy 
 that invades them, that comes from a far country to take possession of 
 ours; this occasions the cry; and what is the cry? It is this: <I>Is 
 not the Lord in Zion? Is not her king in her?</I> These were the two 
 things that they had all along buoyed up themselves with and depended 
 upon, 

 (1.) That they had among them the temple of God, and the tokens of his 
 special presence with them. The common cant was, "<I>Is not the Lord in 
 Zion?</I> What danger then need we fear?" And they held by this when 
 the trouble was breaking in upon them. "Surely we shall do well enough, 
 for have we not God among us?" But, when it grew to an extremity, it 
 was an aggravation of their misery that they had thus flattered 
 themselves. 

 (2.) That they had the throne of the house of David. As they had a 
 temple, so they had a monarchy, <I>jure divino--by divine right: Is not 
 Zion's king in her?</I> And will not Zion's God protect Zion's king and 
 his kingdom? Surely he will; but why does he not? "What" (say they)
 "has Zion neither a God nor a king to stand by her and help her, that 
 she is thus run down and likely to be ruined?" This outcry of theirs 
 reflects upon God, as if his power and promise were broken or weakened; 
 and therefore he returns an answer to it immediately: <I>Why have they 
 provoked me to anger with their graven images?</I> They quarrel with 
 God as if he had dealt unkindly by them in forsaking them, whereas they 
 by their idolatry had driven him from them; they have withdrawn from 
 their allegiance to him, and so have thrown themselves out of this 
 protection. They <I>fret themselves, and curse their king and their 
 God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:21">Isa. viii. 21</A>),
 
 when it is their own sin that <I>separates between them and God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:2">Isa. lix. 2</A>);

 they <I>feared not the Lord,</I> and then <I>what can a king do for 
 them?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:3">Hos. x. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We have here the prophet himself bewailing the calamity and ruin 
 of his people; for there were more of the lamentations of Jeremiah than 
 those we find in the book that bears that title. Observe here, 

 1. How great his griefs were. He was an eyewitness of the desolations
 of his country, and saw those things which by the spirit of prophecy he 
 had foreseen. In the foresight, much more in the sight, of them, he 
 cries out, "<I>My heart is faint in me,</I> I sink, I die away at the 
 consideration of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 <I>When I would comfort myself against my sorrow,</I> I do but labour
 in vain; nay, every attempt to alleviate the grief does but aggravate 
 it." It is our wisdom and duty, under mournful events, to do what we 
 can to <I>comfort ourselves against our sorrow,</I> by suggesting to 
 ourselves such considerations as are proper to allay the grief and 
 balance the grievance. But sometimes the sorrow is such that the more 
 it is repressed the more strongly it recoils. This may sometimes be the 
 case of very good men, as of the prophet here, whose soul refused to be 
 comforted and fainted at the cordial, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+77:2,3">Ps. lxxvii. 2, 3</A>.
 
 He tells us

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>)

 what was the matter: "It is <I>for the hurt of the daughter of my 
 people</I> that <I>I am</I> thus <I>hurt;</I> it is for their sin, and 
 the miseries they have brought upon themselves by it; it is for this 
 that <I>I am black,</I> that I look black, that I go in black as 
 mourners do, and that <I>astonishment has taken hold on me,</I> so that 
 I know not what to do nor which way to turn." Note, The miseries of our 
 country ought to be very much the grief of our souls. A gracious spirit 
 will be a public spirit, a tender spirit, a mourning spirit. It becomes 
 us to lament the miseries of our fellow-creatures, much more to lay to 
 heart the calamities of our country, and especially of the church of 
 God, to <I>grieve for the affliction of Joseph.</I> Jeremiah had 
 prophesied the destruction of Jerusalem, and, though the truth of his 
 prophecy was questioned, yet he did not rejoice in the proof of the 
 truth of his prophecy was questioned, yet he did not rejoice in the 
 proof of the truth of it by the accomplishment of it, preferring the 
 welfare of his country before his own reputation. If Jerusalem had 
 repented and been spared, he would have been far from fretting as Jonah 
 did. Jeremiah had many enemies in Judah and Jerusalem, that hated, and 
 reproached, and persecuted him; and in the judgments brought upon them 
 God reckoned with them for it and pleaded his prophet's cause; yet he 
 was far from rejoicing in it, so truly did he forgive his enemies and 
 desire that God would forgive them. 
 
 2. How small his hopes were

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 "<I>Is there no balm in Gilead</I>--no medicine proper for a sick and 
 dying kingdom? <I>Is there no physician there</I>--no skilful faithful 
 hand to apply the medicine?" He looks upon the case to be deplorable 
 and past relief. There is no balm in Gilead that can cure the disease 
 of sin, no physician there that can restore the health of a nation 
 quite overrun by such a foreign army as that of the Chaldeans. The
 desolations made are irreparable, and the disease has presently come to 
 such a height that there is no checking it. Or

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:22">this verse</A>

 may be understood as laying all the blame of the incurableness of their
 disease upon themselves; and so the question must be answered 
 affirmatively: <I>Is there no balm in Gilead--no physician there?</I> 
 Yes, certainly there is; God is able to help and heal them, there is a 
 sufficiency in him to redress all their grievances. Gilead was a place 
 in their own land, not far off. They had among themselves God's law and 
 his prophets, with the help of which they might have been brought to 
 repentance, and their ruin might have been prevented. They had princes 
 and priests, whose business it was to reform the nation and redress 
 their grievances. What could have been done more than had been done for 
 their recovery? <I>Why then was not</I> their health restored? 
 Certainly it was not owing to God, but to themselves; it was not for 
 want of balm and a physician, but because they would not admit the 
 application nor submit to the methods of cure. The physician and
 physic were both ready, but the patient was wilful and irregular, would 
 not be tied to rules, but must be humoured. Note, If sinners die of 
 their wounds, their blood is upon their own heads. The blood of Christ
 is balm in Gilead, his Spirit is the physician there, both sufficient, 
 all-sufficient, so that they might have been healed, but would not.</P>
