 Those books of scripture are all prophetical of which here, <I>in
 weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling,</I> we have endeavoured a 
 methodical explication and a practical improvement. I call them
 <I>prophetical</I> because so they are for the main, though we have
 some histories (here and there brought in for the illustration of the 
 prophecies) and a book of Lamentations. Our Saviour often puts <I>the
 Law and the Prophets</I> for all the Old Testament. The prophets, by
 waiving the ceremonial precepts, and not insisting on them, but only on 
 the weightier matters of the law, plainly intimated the abolishing of 
 that part of the law of Moses by the gospel; and by their many 
 predictions of Christ, and the kingdom of his grace, they intimated the 
 accomplishing the perfecting of that part of the law of Moses in the 
 gospel. Thus the prophets were the <I>nexus--the connecting bond</I> 
 between the law and the gospel, and are therefore fitly placed between 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These books, being prophetical, are, as such, divine, and of heavenly
 origin and extraction. We have human laws, human histories, and human
 poems, as well as divine ones, but we can have no human prophecies.
 Wise and good men may make prudent conjectures concerning future events
 (<I>moral prognostications</I> we call them); but it is essential to
 true prophecy that it be of God. The learned
 
 Huetius<SUP><A HREF="#{1}">1</A></SUP>
 
 lays this down for one of his axioms, <I>Omnis prophetica facultas
 &agrave; Deo est--The prophetic talent is entirely from God;</I> and
 he proves it to be the sense both of Jews and heathen that it is God's 
 prerogative to foresee things to come, and that whoever had such a 
 power had it from God. And therefore the Jews reckon all prophecy to be 
 given by the highest degree of inspiration, except that which was 
 peculiar to Moses. When our Saviour asked the chief priests whether 
 John's baptism were from heaven or of men, they durst not say <I>Of 
 men,</I> because the people counted him a prophet, and, if so, then not 
 of men. The Hebrew name for a prophet is <B><I>nby'</I></B>--<I>a 
 speaker, preacher,</I> or <I>orator, a messenger,</I> or 
 <I>interpreter,</I> that delivers God's messages to the children of 
 men, as a herald to proclaim war or an ambassador to treat of peace.
 But then it must be remembered that he was formerly called 
 <B><I>r'h</I></B> or <B><I>hsh,</I></B> that is, <I>a seer</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:9">1 Sam. ix. 9</A>);

 for prophets, with the eyes of their minds, first saw what they were to
 speak and then spoke what they had seen.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Prophecy, taken strictly, is the foretelling of things to come; and
 there were those to whom God gave this power, not only that it might be
 a sign for the confirming of the faith of the church concerning the
 doctrine preached when the things foretold should be fulfilled, but for
 warning, instruction, and comfort, in prospect of what they themselves
 might not live to see accomplished, but which should be fulfilled in
 its season: so predictions of things to come long after might be of
 present use.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The learned Dr. 
 
 Grew<SUP><A HREF="#{2}">2</A></SUP>
 
 describes prophecy in this sense to be, "A declaration of the divine
 prescience, looking at any distance through a train of infinite causes,
 known and unknown to us, upon a sure and certain effect." Hence he
 infers, "That the being of prophecies supposes the non-being of
 contingents; for, though there are many things which seem to us to be
 contingents, yet, were they so indeed, there could have been no
 prophecy; and there can be no contingent seemingly so loose and
 independent but it is a link of some chain." And Huetius gives this
 reason why none but God can foretel things to come, Because every
 effect depends upon an infinite number of preceding causes, all which,
 in their order, must be known to him that foretels the effect, and
 therefore to God only, for he alone is omniscient. So Tully argues:
 <I>Qui teneat causas rerum futurarum, idem necesse est omnia teneat
 qu&aelig; futura sint; quod facere nemo nisi Deus potest--He who knows the
 causes of future events must necessarily know the events themselves;
 this is the prerogative of God 
 
 alone.</I><SUP><A HREF="#{3}">3</A></SUP>
 
 And therefore we find that by <I>this</I> the God of Israel proves
 himself to be God, that by his prophets he foretold things to come,
 which came to pass according to the prediction,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:9,10">Isa. xlvi. 9, 10</A>.

 And by <I>this</I> he disproves the pretensions of the Pagan deities,
 that they could not show the <I>things that were to come to pass 
 hereafter,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:23">Isa. xli. 23</A>.

 Tertullian proves the divine authority of the scripture from the
 fulfilling of scripture-prophecies: <I>Idoneum, opinor, testimonium
 divinitatis, veritas divinationis--I conceive the accomplishment of
 prophecy to be a satisfactory attestation from 
 
 God.</I><SUP><A HREF="#{4}">4</A></SUP> 

 And, besides the foretelling of things to come, the discovering of
 things secret by revelation from God is a branch of prophecy, as 
 Ahijah's discovering Jeroboam's wife in disguise, and Elisha's telling 
 Gehazi what passed between him and Naaman.

 But<SUP><A HREF="#{5}">5</A></SUP> 

 prophecy, in scripture language, is taken more largely for a
 declaration of such things to the children of men, either by word or 
 writing, as God has revealed to those that speak or write it, by 
 vision, dream, or inspiration, guiding their minds, their tongues, and 
 pens, by his Holy Spirit, and giving them not only ability, but 
 authority, to declare such things in his name, and to preface what they 
 say with, <I>Thus saith the Lord.</I> In this sense it is said, The 
 prophecy of scripture <I>came not in old time by the will of man,</I> 
 as other pious moral discourses might, <I>but holy men spoke</I> and 
 wrote <I>as they were moved by the Holy Ghost,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:20,21">2 Pet. i. 20, 21</A>.

 The same Holy Spirit that moved upon the face of the waters to produce
 the world moved upon the minds of the prophets to produce the 
 Bible.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now I think it is worthy to be observed that all nations, having had
 some sense of God and religion, have likewise had a notion of prophets
 and prophecy, have had a veneration for them, and a desire and
 expectation of acquaintance and communion with the gods they worshipped 
 in that way. Witness their oracles, their augurs, and the many arts of 
 divination they had in use among them in all the ages ad all the 
 countries of the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is commonly urged as an argument against the atheists, to prove that
 there is a God, That all nations of the world acknowledged some god or
 other, some Being above them, to be worshipped and prayed to, to be
 trusted in and praised; the most ignorant and barbarous nations could
 not avoid the knowledge of it; the most learned and polite nations
 could not avoid the belief of it. And this is a sufficient proof of the
 general and unanimous consent of mankind to this truth, though far the
 greatest part of men made to themselves gods which yet were no gods.
 Now I think it may be urged with equal force against the Deists, for 
 the proof of a divine revelation, that all nations of the world had, 
 and had veneration for, that which they at least took to e a divine 
 revelation, and could not live without it, though in this also they 
 became <I>vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was 
 darkened.</I> But, if there were not a true deity and a true prophecy, 
 there would never have been pretended deities and counterfeit 
 prophecies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Lycurgus and Numa, those two great lawgivers of the Spartan and Roman
 commonwealths, brought their people to an observance of their laws by
 possessing them with a notion that they had them by divine revelation,
 and so making it a point of religion to observe them. And those that
 have been ever so little conversant with the Greek and Roman histories,
 as well as with the more ancient ones of Chaldea and Egypt cannot but
 remember what a profound deference their princes and great commanders, 
 and not their unthinking commonalty only, paid to the oracles and 
 prophets, and the prognostications of their soothsayers, which, in all 
 cases of importance, were consulted with abundance of gravity and 
 solemnity, and how often the resolutions of councils and the motions of 
 mighty armies turned upon them, though they appeared ever so groundless 
 and farfetched.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 There is a full account given by that learned philosopher and physician
 Caspar 
 
 Peucer<SUP><A HREF="#{6}">6</A></SUP>
 
 of the many kinds of divination and prediction used among the Gentiles,
 by which they took on them to tell the fortune both of states and 
 particular persons. They were all, he says, reduced by Plato to two 
 heads: <I>Divinatio</I> <B><I>Mantike,</I></B> which was a kind of 
 inspiration, or was though to be so, the prophet or prophetess 
 foretelling things to come by an internal <I>flatus</I> or fury; such 
 was the oracle of Apollo at Delphos, and that of Jupiter Trophonius, 
 which, with others like them, were famous for many ages, during the 
 prevalency of the kingdom of darkness, but (as appears by some of the 
 Pagan writers themselves) they were all silenced and struck dumb, when 
 the gospel (that truly divine oracle) began to be preached to the 
 nations. The other kind of divination was that which he calls 
 <B><I>Oionistike,</I></B> which was a prognostication by signs, 
 according to rules of art, as by the flight of birds, the entrails of 
 beasts, by stars or meteors, and abundance of ominous accidents, with 
 which a foolish world was miserably imposed upon. A large account of 
 this matter we have also in the late learned dissertations of Anton.
 Van Dale, to which I refer the 
 
 reader.<SUP><A HREF="#{7}">7</A></SUP>
 
 But nothing of this kind made a greater noise in the Gentile world than
 the oracles of the Sibyls and their prophecies. Their name signifies
 <I>a divine counsel: Sibyll&aelig;,</I> qu. <I>Siobul&aelig;,
 Sios,</I> in the &AElig;olic dialect, being put for <I>Theos.</I> 
 Peucer says, "Almost every nation had its Sibyls, but those of Greece 
 were most celebrated." They lived in several ages; the most ancient is 
 said to be the <I>Sibylla Delphica,</I> who lived before the Trojan 
 war, or about that time. The <I>Sibylla Erythrea</I> was the most 
 noted; she lived about the time of Alexander the Great. But it the
 <I>Sibylla Cumana</I> of whom the story goes that she presented 
 herself, and nine books of oracles, to Tarquinius Superbus, which she 
 offered to sell him at so vast a rate that he refused to purchase them, 
 upon which she burnt three, and, upon his second refusal, three more, 
 but made him give the same rate for the remaining three, which were 
 deposited with great care in the Capitol. But, those being afterwards
 burnt accidentally with the Capitol, a collection was made of other 
 Sibylline oracles, and those are they which Virgil refers to in his 
 fourth 
 
 Eclogue.<SUP><A HREF="#{8}">8</A></SUP>
 
 All the oracles of the Sibyls that are extant were put together, and
 published, in Holland, not many years ago, by Seryatius Gall&aelig;us, 
 in Greek and Latin, with large and learned notes, together with all 
 that could be met with of the metrical oracles that go under the names 
 of Jupiter, Apollo, Serapis, and others, by Joannes Opsop&aelig;us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The oracles of the Sibyls were appealed to by many of the fathers for
 the confirmation of the Christian religion. Justin 
 
 Martyr<SUP><A HREF="#{9}">9</A></SUP>
 
 appeals with a great deal of assurance, persuading the Greeks to give
 credit to that ancient Sibyl, whose works were extant all the world 
 over; and to their testimony, and that of Hydaspis, he appeals 
 concerning the general conflagration and the torments of hell. Clemens 
 
 Alexandrinus<SUP><A HREF="#{10}">10</A></SUP>
 
 often quotes the Sibyls' verses with great respect; so does

 Lactantius;<SUP><A HREF="#{11}">11</A></SUP>

 St. Austin,<SUP><A HREF="#{12}">12</A></SUP>

 <I>De Civitate Dei,</I> has the famous acrostic at large, said to be
 one of the oracles of the <I>Sibylla Erythrea,</I> the first letters of 
 the verses making <B><I>Iesous Christos Theou hyios 
 Soter</I></B>--<I>Jesus Christ the Son of God the Saviour.</I> Divers 
 passages they produce out of those oracles which expressly foretel the 
 coming of the Messiah, his being born of a virgin, his miracles, his 
 sufferings, particularly his being buffeted, spit upon, crowned with 
 thorns, having vinegar and gall given him to drink, &c. Whether these
 oracles were genuine and authentic or no has been much controverted 
 among the learned. Baronius and the popish writers generally admit and 
 applaud them, and build much upon them; so do some protestant writers; 
 Isaac Vossius has written a great deal to support the reputation of 
 them, and (as I find him quoted by Van Dale) will needs have it that 
 they were formerly a part of the canon of scripture; and a learned 
 prelate of our own nation, Bishop Montague, pleads largely, and with 
 great assurance, for their authority, and is of opinion that some of 
 them were divinely inspired. But many learned men look upon it to be a 
 pious fraud, as they call it, concluding that those verses of the 
 Sibyls which speak so very expressly of Christ and the future state 
 were forged by some Christians and imposed upon the over-credulous. 
 
 Huetius,<SUP><A HREF="#{13}">13</A></SUP>
 
 though of the Romish church, condemns both the ancient and more modern
 compositions of the Sibyls, and refers his reader, for the proof of 
 their vanity, to the learned Blondel. Van Dale and Gall&aelig;us look 
 upon them to be a forgery. And the truth is they speak so much more 
 particularly and plainly concerning our Saviour and the future state 
 than any of the prophets of the Old Testament do, that we must conclude 
 St. Paul, who was the apostle of the Gentiles, guilty not only of a 
 very great omission (that in all his preaching of the gospel to the 
 Gentiles, and in all his epistles to the Gentile churches, he never so 
 much as mentions the prophecies of the Sibyls, nor vouches their 
 authority, as he does that of the Old-Testament prophets, in his 
 preaching and writing to the Jews), but likewise of a very great 
 mistake, in making it the particular advantage which the Jews had above 
 the Gentiles that <I>to them were committed the oracles of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:1,2">Rom. iii. 1, 2</A>),

 and that they were the children of the prophets, while he speaks of the
 Gentiles as sitting in darkness and being afar off. We cannot conceive 
 that heathen women, and those actuated by d&aelig;mons, should speak 
 more clearly and fully of the Messiah than those holy men did who, we 
 are sure, were moved by the Holy Ghost, nor that the Gentiles should be 
 entrusted with larger and earlier discoveries of the great salvation 
 than that people of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ was to come.
 But enough, if not more than enough, of the pretenders to prophecy. It 
 is a good remark which the learned Gall&aelig;us makes upon the great 
 veneration which the Romans had for the oracles of the Sibyls, for 
 which he quotes Dionysius Halicarnass&aelig;us, <B><I>Ouden oute 
 Romaioi phylattousin, oute hosion ktema oute hieron, hos ta Sibylleia 
 thesphata</I></B>--<I>The Romans preserve nothing with such sacred 
 care, nor do they hold any thing in such high estimation, as the 
 Sibylline oracles. Hi si pro vitreis suis thesauris ade&ograve; 
 decertarunt, quid nos pro genuinis nostris, &agrave; Deo 
 inspiratis?--If they had such a value for these counterfeits, how 
 precious should the true treasure of the divine oracles be to us!</I> 
 Of these we come next to speak.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Prophecy, we are sure, was of equal date with the church; for <I>faith
 comes,</I> not by thinking and seeing, as philosophy does, but by
 hearing, <I>by hearing the word of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:17">Rom. x. 17</A>.

 In the antediluvian period Adam received divine revelation in the
 promise of the Seed of the woman, and no doubt communicated it in the 
 name of the Lord, to his seed, and was prophet, as well as priest, to 
 his numerous family. Enoch was a prophet, and foretold perhaps the 
 deluge, certainly the last judgment, that of the great day. <I>Behold 
 the Lord comes,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:14">Jude 14</A>.

 When men began, as a church, to <I>call upon the name of the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:26">Gen. iv. 26</A>),

 or to call themselves by his name, they were blessed with prophets, for
 the <I>prophecy came in old time</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:21">2 Pet. i. 21</A>);

 it is venerable for its antiquity. When God renewed his covenant of
 providence (and that a figure of the covenant of grace) with Noah and 
 his sons, we soon after find Noah, as a prophet, foretelling, not only 
 the servitude of Canaan, but God's enlarging Japhet by Christ, and his 
 dwelling in the tents of Shem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:26">Gen. ix. 26, 27</A>.

 And when, upon the general revolt of mankind to idolatry (as, in the
 former period, upon the apostasy of Cain), God distinguished a church 
 for himself by the call of Abraham, and by his covenant with him and 
 his seed, he conferred upon him and the other patriarchs the spirit of 
 prophecy; for, when he reproved kings for their sakes, he said, 
 <I>Touch not my anointed,</I> who have received that unction from the 
 Holy One, and <I>do my prophets no harm,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:14,15">Ps. cv. 14, 15</A>.

 And of Abraham he said expressly, <I>He is a prophet</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:7">Gen. xx. 7</A>);

 and it was with a prophetic eye, as a seer, that <I>Abraham saw
 Christ's day</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:56">John viii. 56</A>),

 saw it as so great a distance, and yet with so great an assurance
 triumphed in it. And Stephen seems to speak of the first settling of a 
 correspondence between him and God, by which he was established to be a 
 prophet, when he says, <I>The God of glory appeared to him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:2">Acts vii. 2</A>),

 appeared in glory. Jacob, upon his death-bed, as a prophet, told his
 sons <I>what should befal them in the last days</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:1">Gen. xlix. 1</A>),

 and spoke very particularly concerning the Messiah.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Hitherto was the infancy of the church, and with it of prophecy; it was
 the dawning of that day; and that morning-light owed its rise to the
 Sun of righteousness, though he rose not till long after, but it shone
 more and more. During the bondage of Israel in Egypt, this, as other
 glories of the church, was eclipsed; but, as the church made a
 considerable and memorable advance in the deliverance of Israel out of
 Egypt and the forming of them into a people, so did the Spirit of
 prophecy in Moses, the illustrious instrument employed in that great
 service; and it was by that Spirit that he performed that service; so 
 it is said, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hos+12:13">Hos. xii. 13</A>,

 <I>By a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet
 was he preserved</I> through the wilderness to Canaan, that is, by 
 Moses as a prophet. It appears, by what God said to Aaron, that there 
 were then other prophets among them, to whom God made known himself and 
 his will in dreams and visions

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:6">Num. xii. 6</A>),

 but to Moses he spoke in a peculiar manner, <I>mouth to mouth, even
 apparently, and not in dark speeches,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:8">Num. xii. 8</A>.

 Nay, such a plentiful effusion was there of the Spirit of prophecy at
 that time (because Moses was such a prophet as was to be a type of 
 Christ the great prophet) that some of his Spirit was put upon seventy 
 elders of Israel at once, <I>and they prophesied,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:25">Num. xi. 25</A>.

 What they said was extraordinary, and not only under the direction of a
 prophetic inspiration, but under the constraint of a prophetic impulse, 
 as appears by the case of Eldad and Meded.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When Moses, that great prophet, was laying down his office, he promised
 Israel that the <I>Lord God would raise them up a prophet of their
 brethren like unto him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+18:15,18">Deut. xviii. 15, 18</A>.

 In these words, says the learned Bishop

 Stillingfleet<SUP><A HREF="#{14}">14</A></SUP>
 
 though, in their full and complete sense, they relate to Christ, and
 to him they are more than once applied in the New Testament), there is
 included a promise of an order of prophets, which should succeed Moses
 in the Jewish church, and be the <B><I>logia zonta</I></B>--<I>the
 living oracles</I> among them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:38">Acts vii. 38</A>),

 by which they might know the mind of God; for, in the next words, he
 lays down rules for the trial of prophets, whether what they said was 
 of God or no, and it is observable that that promise comes in 
 immediately upon an express prohibition of the Pagan rites of 
 divination and the consulting of wizards and familiar spirits: "You 
 shall not need to do that" (said Moses), "for, to your much better 
 satisfaction, you shall have prophets divinely inspired, by whom you 
 may know from God himself both what to do and what to expect." But as 
 Jacob's dying prophecy concerning the sceptre in Judah, and the 
 lawgiver between his feet, did not begin to be remarkably fulfilled 
 till David's time, most of the Judges being of other tribes, so Moses's 
 promise of a succession of prophets began not to receive its 
 accomplishment till Samuel's time, a little before the other promise 
 began to emerge and operate; and it was an introduction to the other, 
 for it was by Samuel, as a prophet, that David was anointed king, which 
 was an intimation that the prophetical office of our Redeemer should 
 make way, both in the world and in the heart, for his kingly office; 
 and therefore when he was asked, <I>Art thou a king?</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:37">John xviii. 37</A>)

 he answered, not evasively, but very pertinently, <I>I came to bear
 witness to the truth,</I> and so to rule as a king purely by the power 
 of truth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 During the government of the Judges there was a pouring out of the
 Spirit, but more as a Spirit of skill and courage for war than as a
 Spirit of prophecy. Deborah is indeed called <I>prophetess,</I> because
 of her extraordinary qualifications for judging Israel; but that is the
 only mention of prophecy, that I remember, in all the book of
 <I>Judges.</I> Extraordinary messages were sent by angels, as to Gideon
 and Manoah; and it is expressly said that before the word of the Lord
 came to Samuel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:1">1 Sam. iii. 1</A>)

 it was <I>precious,</I> it was very scarce, there was <I>no open
 vision.</I> And it was therefore with more than ordinary solemnity that 
 the word of the Lord came first to Samuel; and by degrees notice and 
 assurance were given to all Israel <I>that Samuel was established to be 
 a prophet of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:20">1 Sam. iii. 20</A>.

 In Samuel's time, and by him, the schools of the prophets were erected,
 by which prophecy was dignified and provision made for a succession of 
 prophets; for it should seem that in those colleges, hopeful young men 
 were bred up in devotion, in a constant attendance upon the instruction 
 the prophets gave from God, and under a strict discipline, as 
 candidates, or probationers, for prophecy, who were called <I>the sons 
 of the prophets;</I> and their religious exercises of prayer, 
 conference, and psalmody especially, are called prophesyings; and their 
 pr&aelig;fect, or president, is called <I>their father,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:12">1 Sam. x. 12</A>.

 Out of these God ordinarily chose the prophets he sent; and yet not
 always: Amos was no prophet nor prophet's son

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:14">Amos vii. 14</A>),

 had not his education in the schools of the prophets, and yet was
 commissioned to go on God's errands, and (which is observable) though 
 he had not academical education himself, yet he seems to speak of it 
 with great respect when he reckons it among the favours God had 
 bestowed upon Israel that he <I>raised up of their sons for prophets 
 and of their young men for Nazarites,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:11">Amos ii. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is worth noting that when the glory of the priesthood was eclipsed 
 by the iniquity of the house of Eli, the desolations of Shiloh, and the
 obscurity of the ark, there was then a more plentiful effusion of the
 Spirit of prophecy than had been before; a standing ministry of another
 kind was thereby erected, and a succession of it kept up. And thus
 afterwards, in the kingdom of the ten tribes, where there was no legal
 priesthood at all, yet there were prophets and prophets; sons; in
 Ahab's time we meet with a hundred of them, whom Obadiah his by
 <I>fifty in a cave,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:4">1 Kings xviii. 4</A>.

 When the people of God, who desired to know his mind, were deprived of
 one way of instruction, God furnished them with another, and a less 
 ceremonious one; for he left not himself without witness, nor them 
 without a guide. And when they had no temple or altar that they could 
 attend upon with any safety or satisfaction then had private meetings 
 at the prophets' houses, to which the devout faithful worshippers of 
 God resorted (as we find the good Shunamite did,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+4:23">2 Kings iv. 23</A>),

 and where they kept their new-moons and their sabbaths, comfortably,
 and to their edification.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David was himself a prophet; so St. Peter calls him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:30">Acts ii. 30</A>);

 and, though we read not of God's speaking to him by dreams and visions,
 yet we are sure that <I>the Spirit of the Lord spoke by him, and his 
 word was in his tongue</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+23:2">2 Sam. xxiii. 2</A>),

 and he had those about him that were seers, that were his seers, as Gad
 and Iddo, that brought him messages from God, and wrote the history of 
 his times. And now the productions of the Spirit of prophecy were 
 translated into the service of the temple, not only in the model of the 
 house which the Lord made David <I>understand in writing by his hand 
 upon him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+28:19">1 Chron. xxviii. 19</A>),
 
 but in the worship performed there; for there we find Asaph, Heman, and
 Jeduthun, prophesying with harps and other musical instruments, 
 according to the order of the king, not to foretel things to come, but 
 to <I>give thanks</I> and to <I>praise the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+25:1-3">1 Chron. xxv. 1-3</A>);
 
 yet, in their psalms, they spoke much of Christ and his kingdom, and
 the glory to be revealed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the succeeding reigns, both of Judah and Israel, we frequently meet
 with prophets sent on particular errands to Rehoboam, Jeroboam, Asa,
 and other kings, who, it is probable, instructed the people in the
 things of God at other times, though it is not recorded. But, prophecy
 growing into contempt with many, God revived the honour of it, and put
 a new lustre upon it, in the power given to Elijah and Elisha to work 
 miracles, and the great things that God did by them for the confirming 
 of the people's faith in it, and the awakening of their regard to it, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:3,4:1,38,5:22,6:1">2 Kings ii. 3; iv. 1, 38; v. 22; vi. 1</A>.

 In their time, and by their agency, it should seem, the schools of the
 prophets were revived, and we find sons of the prophets, fellows of 
 those sacred colleges, employed in carrying messages to the great men, 
 as to Ahab

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:35">1 Kings xx. 35</A>),

 and to Jehu, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:1">2 Kings ix. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Hitherto, the prophets of the Lord delivered their messages by word of
 mouth, only we read of one writing which came from Elijah the prophet
 to Jehoram king of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+21:12">2 Chron. xxi. 12</A>.

 The histories of those times which are left us were compiled by
 prophets, under a divine direction; and, when the Old Testament is 
 divided into the law and the Prophets, the historical books are, for 
 that reason, reckoned among the prophets. But, in the later times of
 the kingdoms of Judah and Israel, some of the prophets were divinely 
 inspired to write their prophecies, or abstracts of them, and to leave 
 them upon record, for the benefit of after-ages, that the children who 
 should be born might praise the Lord for them, and, by comparing the 
 event with the prediction, might have their faith confirmed. And, 
 probably, those later prophets spoke more fully and plainly of the 
 Messiah and his kingdom than their predecessors had done, and for that 
 reason their prophecies were put in writing, not only for the 
 encouragement of the pious Jews that looked for the consolation of 
 Israel, but for the use of us Christians, upon whom the ends of the 
 world have come, as David's psalms had been for the same reason, that 
 the Old Testament and the New might mutually give light and lustre to 
 each other. Many other faithful prophets there were at the same time, 
 who spoke in God's name, who did not commit their prophecies to 
 writing, but were of those whom God sent, rising up betimes and sending 
 them, the contempt of whom, and of their messages, brought ruin without 
 remedy upon that sottish people, that knew not the day of their 
 visitation. In their captivity they had some prophets, some to <I>show 
 them how long;</I> and though it was not by a prophet, like Moses, that 
 they were brought out of Babylon, as they had been out of Egypt, but by 
 Joshua the high priest first, and afterwards by Ezra the scribe, to 
 show that God can do his work by ordinary means when he pleases, yet, 
 soon after their return, the Spirit of prophecy was poured out 
 plentifully, and continued (according to the Jews' computation) forty 
 years in the second temple, but ceased in Malachi. Then (say the
 rabbin) <I>the Holy Spirit was taken from Israel,</I> and they had the 
 benefit only of the <I>Bathkol--the daughter of a voice,</I> that is,
 a voice from heaven, which they look upon to be the lowest degree of 
 divine revelation. Now herein they are witnesses against themselves for 
 rejecting the true Messiah, for our Lord Jesus, and he only was spoken 
 to by a voice from heaven at his baptism, his transfiguration, and his 
 entrance on his sufferings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In John the Baptist prophecy revived, and therefore in him the gospel
 is said to begin, when the church had had no prophets for above 300
 years. We have not only the <I>vox populi--the voice of the people</I>
 to prove John a prophet, for all the people counted him so, but <I>vox
 Dei--the voice of God</I> too; for Christ calls him a prophet,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:9,10">Matt. xi. 9, 10</A>.

 He had an extraordinary commission from God to call people to
 repentance, was <I>filled with the Holy Ghost from his mother's 
 womb,</I> and was <I>therefore</I> called the <I>prophet of the 
 Highest,</I> because he <I>went before the face of the Lord, to prepare 
 his way</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:15,16">Luke i. 15, 16</A>);

 and though he did no miracle, nor gave any sign or wonder, yet this
 proved him a true prophet, <I>that all he said of Christ was true,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:41">John x. 41</A>.

 Nay, and <I>this</I> proved him more than a prophet, than any of the 
 other prophets, that whereas by other prophets Christ was discovered as 
 at a great distance, by him he was discovered as already come, and he 
 was enabled to say, <I>Behold the Lamb of God.</I> But after the 
 ascension of our Lord Jesus there was a more plentiful effusion of the 
 Spirit of prophecy than ever before; then was the promise fulfilled 
 that God would <I>pour out his Spirit upon all flesh</I> (and not as 
 hitherto upon the Jews only), and their <I>sons and their daughters 
 should prophesy,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:16">Acts ii. 16</A>,

 &c. The gift of tongues was one new product of the Spirit of prophecy,
 and given for a particular reason, that, the Jewish pale being taken 
 down, all nations might be brought into the church. These and other 
 gifts of prophecy, being for a sign, have long since ceased and laid 
 aside, and we have no encouragement to expect the revival of them; but, 
 on the contrary, are directed to call the scriptures the <I>more sure 
 word of prophecy,</I> more sure than voices from heaven; and to them we 
 are directed to <I>take heed,</I> to search them, and to hold them 
 fast, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:19">2 Pet. i. 19</A>.

 All God's spiritual Israel know that they are established to be the
 <I>oracles of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:20">1 Sam. iii. 20</A>),

 and if any add to, or take from, the book of that prophecy, they may
 read their doom in the close of it; God shall take blessings from them, 
 and add curses to them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:18,19">Rev. xxii. 18, 19</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now concerning the prophets of the Old Testament, whose writings are
 before us, observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That they were all holy men. We are assured by the apostle that
 <I>the prophecy came in old time by holy men of God</I> (and <I>men of
 God</I> they were commonly called, because they were devoted to him),
 <I>who spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</I> They were men,
 <I>subject to like passions as we are</I> (so Elijah, one of the
 greatest of them, is said to have been, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:17">Jam. v. 17</A>);

 but they were holy men, men that in the temper of their minds, and the
 tenour of their lives, were examples of serious piety. Though there 
 were many pretenders, that, without warrant, said <I>Thus saith the 
 Lord,</I> when he sent them not, and some that prophesied in Christ's 
 name, but he never knew them, and they indeed were workers of iniquity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:22,23">Matt. vii. 22, 23</A>),

 and though the cursing blaspheming lips of Balaam and Caiaphas, even
 when they actually designed mischief, were over-ruled to speak oracles, 
 yet none were employed and commissioned to speak as prophets but those 
 that had received the Spirit of grace and sanctification; for holiness 
 becomes God's house. The Jewish doctors universally agree in this rule, 
 That the Spirit of prophecy never rests upon any but a holy and wise 
 man, and one whose passions are 
 
 allayed,<SUP><A HREF="#{15}">15</A></SUP>
 
 or, as others express it, a humble man and a man of fortitude, that is,
 one that has power to keep his sensual animal part in due subjection to 
 religion and right reason. And some of 
 
 them<SUP><A HREF="#{16}">16</A></SUP>
 
 give this rule, That the Spirit of prophecy does not reside where there
 are either, on the one hand, grief and melancholy, or, on the other
 hand, laughter and lightness of behaviour, and impertinent idle talk: 
 and it is commonly observed by them, both from the musical instruments 
 used in the schools of the prophets in Samuel's time and from the 
 instance of Elisha's calling for a minstrel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:15">2 Kings iii. 15</A>),

 that the divine presence does not reside with sadness, but with
 cheerfulness, and Elisha, they say, had not yet recovered himself from
 the sorrow he conceived at parting with Elijah. They have also a
 tradition (but I know no ground for it) that all the while Jacob
 mourned for Joseph, the Shechinah, or Holy Spirit, withdrew from him.
 Yet I believe that when David intimates that by his sin in the matter
 of Uriah he had lost the right Spirit, and the free Spirit, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:10,12">Ps. li. 10, 12</A>

 (which therefore he begs might be renewed in him and restored to him),
 it was not because he was under grief, but because he was under guilt. 
 And therefore, in order to the return of that right and free Spirit, he 
 prays that God would create in him a clean heart.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That they had all a full assurance in themselves of their divine
 mission; and (though they could not always prevail to satisfy others)
 they were abundantly satisfied themselves that what they delivered as
 from God, and in his name, was indeed from him; and with the same
 assurance did the apostles speak of the word of life, as that which
 they had heard, and seen, and looked on, and which their hands had
 handled, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:1">1 John i. 1</A>.

 Nathan spoke from himself when he encouraged David to build the temple,
 but afterwards knew he spoke from God when, in his name, he forbade him 
 to do it. God had various ways of making known to his prophets the 
 messages they were to deliver to his people; it should seem, 
 ordinarily, to have been by the ministry of angels. In the Apocalypse 
 Christ is expressly said to have <I>signified by his angel to his 
 servant John,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:1">Rev. i. 1</A>.

 It was sometimes done in a vision when the prophet was awake, sometimes
 in a dream when the prophet was asleep, and sometimes by a secret but 
 strong impression upon the mind of the prophet. But Maimonides has laid 
 down, as a maxim, That all prophecy makes itself known to the prophet 
 that it is prophecy indeed; that is, says another of the rabbin, By the 
 vigour and liveliness of the perception whereby he apprehends the thing 
 propounded (which Jeremiah intimates when he says, <I>The word of the 
 Lord was as a fire in my bones,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+20:9">Jer. xx. 9</A>),

 and therefore they always spoke with great assurance, knowing they
 should be justified, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:7">Isa. i. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That in their prophesying, both in receiving their message from 
 God and in delivering it to the people, they always kept possession of 
 their own souls. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:8">Dan. x. 8</A>.

 Though sometimes their bodily strength was overpowered by the abundance
 of the revelations, and their eyes were dazzled with the visionary 
 light, as in the instances of Daniel and John

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:17">Rev. i. 17</A>),

 yet still their understanding remained with them, and the free exercise
 of their reason. This is excellently well expressed by a learned writer 
 of our 
 
 own:<SUP><A HREF="#{17}">17</A></SUP>
 
 "The prophetical Spirit, seating itself in the rational powers as well
 as in the imagination, did never alienate the mind, but inform and
 enlighten it; and those that were actuated by it always maintained a 
 clearness and consistency of reason, with strength and solidity of 
 judgment. "For" (says he 
 
 afterwards<SUP><A HREF="#{18}">18</A></SUP>)
 
 "God did not make use of idiots or fools to reveal his will by, but
 such whose intellects were entire and perfect; and he imprinted such a 
 clear copy of his truth upon them as that it became their own sense, 
 being digested fully into their understandings, so that they were able 
 to deliver and represent it to others as truly as any can paint forth 
 his own thoughts." God's messengers were speaking men, not speaking 
 trumpets. The Fathers frequently took notice of this difference
 between the prophets of the Lord and the false prophets--that the 
 pretenders to prophecy (who either were actuated by an evil spirit or 
 were under the force of a heated imagination) underwent alienations of 
 mind, and delivered what they had to say in the utmost agitation and 
 disorder, as the Pythian prophetess, who delivered her infernal oracles 
 with many antic gestures, tearing her hair and foaming at the mouth. 
 And by this rule they condemned the Montanists, who pretended to 
 prophecy, in the second century, that what they said was in a way of 
 ecstasy, not like rational men, but like men in a frenzy.
 
 Chrysostom,<SUP><A HREF="#{19}">19</A></SUP>
 
 having described the furious violent motions of the pretenders to
 prophecy, adds, <B><I>Ho de Prophetes ouch houtos</I></B>--<I>A true
 prophet does not do so. Sed mente sobri&acirc;, et constanti animi
 staut, et intelligens qu&aelig; profert, omnia pronunciat--He
 understands what he utters, and utters it soberly and calmly.</I> And
 Jerome, in his preface to his Commentaries upon Nahum, observes that it 
 is called <I>the book of the vision of Nahum. Non enim loquitur</I> 
 <B><I>en ekstasei,</I></B> sed est liber intelligentis omnia qu&aelig; 
 loquitur--For he speaks not in an ecstasy, but as one who understands 
 every thing he says. And 
 
 again,<SUP><A HREF="#{20}">20</A></SUP>
 
 <I>Non ut amens loquitur propheta, nec in morem insanientium foeminarum
 dat sine mente sonum--The prophet speaks not as an insane person, nor
 like women wrought into fury, does he utter sound without 
 sense.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That they all aimed at one and the same thing, which was to bring
 people to repent of their sins and to return to God and to do their
 duty to him. This was the errand on which all God messengers were sent,
 to beat down sin, and to revive and advance serious piety. The burden
 of every son was, <I>Turn you now every one from his evil way; amend
 your ways and your doings, and execute judgment between a man and his 
 neighbour,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:3,5">Jer. vii. 3, 5</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+7:8,9,8:16">Zech. vii. 8, 9; viii. 16</A>.

 The scope and design of all their prophecies were to enforce the
 precepts and sanctions of the law of Moses, the moral law, which is of 
 universal and perpetual obligation. Here is nothing of the ceremonial 
 institutes, of the carnal ordinances that were imposed only <I>till the 
 times of reformation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:10">Heb. ix. 10</A>.

 Those were now waxing old and ready to vanish away; but they make it
 their business to press the great and <I>weighty matters of the law, 
 judgment, mercy, and truth.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. That they all bore witness to Jesus Christ and had an eye to him.
 God raising up the <I>horn of salvation for us, in the house of his 
 servant David,</I> was consonant to, and in pursuance of, what <I>he 
 spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets who have been since the world 
 began,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:69,70">Luke i. 69, 70</A>.

 They prophesied of the grace that should come to us, and it was the
 Spirit of Christ in them, one and the same Spirit, that testified 
 beforehand the <I>sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should 
 follow,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:10,11">1 Pet. i. 10, 11</A>.

 Christ was then made known, and yet comparatively hid, in the
 predictions of the prophets, as before in the types of the ceremonial 
 law. And the learned

 Huetius<SUP><A HREF="#{21}">21</A></SUP>
 
 observes it as really admirable that so many persons, in different
 ages, should conspire with one consent, as it were, to foretel, some 
 one particular and others another, concerning Christ, all which had, at 
 length, their full accomplishment in him. <I>Ab ipsis mundi
 incunabulis, per quatuor annorum millia, uno ore venturum Christum 
 pr&aelig;dixerunt viri complures, in ejusque ortu, vit&acirc;, 
 virtutibus, rebus gestis, morte, ac tot&acirc; denique</I> 
 <B><I>Oikonomia</I></B> <I>pr&aelig;monstranda consenserunt--From the 
 earliest period of time, for</I> 4000 <I>years, a great number of men 
 have predicted the advent of Christ, and presented a harmonious 
 statement of his birth, life, character, actions, and death, and of 
 that economy which he came to establish.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. That these prophets were generally hated and abused in their
 several generations by those that lived with them. Stephen challenges
 his judges to produce an instance to the contrary: <I>Which of the
 prophets have not your fathers persecuted?</I> Yea, and, as it should
 seem, for this reason, because <I>they showed before of the coming of
 the Just One,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:52">Acts vii. 52</A>.

 Some there were that trembled at the word of God in their mouths, but
 by the most they were ridiculed and despised, and (as ministers are now 
 by profane people) made a jest of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:7">Hos. ix. 7</A>);

 the prophet was the fool in the play. <I>Wherefore came this mad fellow
 unto thee?</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:11">2 Kings ix. 11</A>)

 said one of the captains concerning one of the sons of the prophets!
 The Gentiles never treated their false prophets so ill as the Jews did 
 their true prophets, but, on the contrary, had them always in 
 veneration. The Jews' mocking the messengers of the Lord, killing the 
 prophets, and stoning those that were sent unto them, was as amazing 
 unaccountable an instance of the enmity that is in the carnal mind 
 against God as any that can be produced. And this makes their rejection 
 of Christ's gospel the less strange, that the Spirit of prophecy, 
 which, for many ages, was so much the glory of Israel, in every age met 
 with so much opposition, and there were those that <I>always resisted 
 the Holy Ghost</I> in the prophets, and <I>turned that glory into 
 shame,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:51">Acts vii. 51</A>.

 But this was it that was the measure-filling sin of Israel, that
 brought upon them both their first destruction by the Chaldeans and 
 their final ruin by the Romans, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:16">2 Chron. xxxvi. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. That though men slighted these prophets, God owned them and put 
 honour upon them. As they were men of God, his immediate servants and
 his messengers, so he always showed himself <I>the Lord God of the holy
 prophets</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:6">Rev. xxii. 6</A>),

 stood by them and strengthened them, and by his Spirit they were full
 of power; and those that slighted them, when they had lost them, were 
 made to know, to their confusion, that <I>a prophet had been among 
 them.</I> What was said of one of the primitive fathers of the prophets 
 was true of them all, <I>The Lord was with them, and did let none of 
 their words fall to the ground,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:19">1 Sam. iii. 19</A>.

 What they said by way of warning and encouragement, for the enforcing
 of their calls to repentance and reformation, was to be understood 
 conditionally. When God spoke by them either, on the one hand, to build 
 and to plant, or, on the other hand, to pluck up and pull down, the 
 change of the people's way might produce a change of God's way

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:7-10">Jer. xviii. 7-10</A>);

 such was Jonah's prophecy of Nineveh's ruin within forty days; or God
 might sometimes be better than his word in granting a reprieve. But 
 what they said by way of prediction of a particular matter, and as a 
 sign, did always come to pass exactly as it was foretold; yea, and the 
 general predictions, sooner or later, took hold even of those that 
 would fain have got clear of them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:6">Zech. i. 6</A>);
 
 for this is that which God glories in, that he <I>confirms the word of
 his servants</I> and <I>performs the counsel of his messengers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:26">Isa. xliv. 26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the opening these prophecies I have endeavoured to give the genuine 
 sense of them, as far as I could reach it, by consulting the best
 expositors, considering the scope and coherence, and comparing 
 spiritual things with spiritual, the spiritual things of the Old 
 Testament with those of the New, and especially by prayer to God for 
 the guidance and direction of the Spirit of truth. But, after all, thee 
 are many things here <I>dark and hard to be understood,</I> concerning 
 the certain meaning of which though I could not gain myself, much less 
 expect to give my reader, full satisfaction, Yet I have not, with the 
 <I>unlearned</I> and <I>unstable, wrested them</I> to the destruction 
 of any, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:16">2 Pet. iii. 16</A>.

 It is the prerogative of the <I>Lamb of God</I> to <I>take this
 book</I> and to <I>open</I> all <I>its seals.</I> I have likewise 
 endeavoured to accommodate these prophecies to the use and service of 
 those who desire to faith and holiness. And we shall find that whatever 
 is <I>given by inspiration of God is profitable</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:16">2 Tim. iii. 16</A>),

 though not all alike profitable, not all alike easy or improvable; but,
 when the mystery of God shall be finished, we shall see, what we are 
 now bound to believe, that there is not one idle word in all the 
 prophecies of this book. What God has said, as well as what he does, 
 <I>we know not now, but we shall know hereafter.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The pleasure I have had in studying and meditating upon those parts of
 these prophecies which are plain and practical, and especially those
 which are evangelical, has been an abundant balance to, and recompence 
 for, the harder tasks we have met with in other parts that are more 
 obscure. In many parts of this field the treasure must be dug for, as 
 that in the mines; but in other parts the surface is covered with rich 
 and precious products, with corn, and flocks, of which we may say, as 
 was said of Noah, These same have comforted us greatly concerning our 
 work and the toil of our hands, and have made it very pleasant and 
 delightful; God grant it may be no less so to the readers!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 And now let me desire the assistance of my friends, in setting up my
 Eben-Ezer here, in a thankful acknowledgment that hitherto the Lord has
 helped me. I desire to praise God that he has spared my life to finish 
 the Old Testament, and has graciously given me some tokens of his 
 presence with me in carrying this work, though the more I reflect upon 
 myself the more unworthy I see myself of the honour of being thus 
 employed, and the more need I see of Christ and his merit and grace. 
 <I>Remember me, O my God! for good, and spare me according to the 
 multitude of thy mercies.</I> The Lord forgive what is mine, and accept 
 what is his own!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I purpose, if God continue my life and health, according to the measure 
 of the grace given to me, and in a constant and entire dependence upon 
 divine strength, to go through the New Testament in two volumes more. I 
 intimated in my preface to the first volume that I had drawn up some 
 expositions upon some parts of the New Testament; namely, The gospels 
 of St. Matthew and St. John; but they are so large that, to make them 
 bear some proportion to the rest, it is necessary that they be much
 contracted, so that I shall be obliged to write them all over again, 
 and to make considerable alterations, and therefore I cannot expect 
 they should be published but as these hitherto have been, if God 
 permit, a volume every other year. I shall begin it now shortly, if the 
 Lord will, and apply myself to it as closely as I can; and I earnestly 
 desire the prayers of all that wish well to that undertaking that, if 
 the Lord spare me to go on with it, I may be enabled to do it well, and 
 so as that by it some may be led into the <I>riches of the full 
 assurance of understanding in the mystery of God, even of the Father 
 and of Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:2">Col. ii. 2</A>.

 And, if it shall please God to remove me by death before it be
 finished, I trust I shall be able to say not only, Welcome his blessed 
 will, but, Welcome that blessed world, in which, though now we <I>know 
 in part, and prophesy but in part, that knowledge which is perfect will 
 come, and that which is partial will be done away</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:8-10,12">1 Cor. xiii. 8-10, 12</A>),

 in which all our mistakes will be rectified, all our doubts resolved,
 all our deficiencies made up, all our endeavours in preaching, 
 catechising, and expounding, superseded and rendered useless, and all 
 our prayers swallowed up in everlasting praises,--in which prophecy, 
 now so much admired, shall fail, and tongues shall cease, and the 
 knowledge we have now shall vanish away, as the light of the 
 morning-star does when the sun has risen,--in which we shall no longer 
 see through a glass darkly, but face to face. In a believing, 
 comfortable, well-grounded, expectation of that true and perfect light, 
 I desire to continue, living and dying; in a humble and diligent 
 preparation for it let me spend my time, and in the full enjoyment of 
 it Oh that I may spend a glorious eternity!</P>
