 God, by the prophet here, designing shortly to deliver them out of
 their captivity, prepared them for that deliverance by possessing them
 with a detestation of idols and with a believing confidence in God,
 even their own God.

 I. Let them not be afraid of the idols of Babylon, as if they could in
 any way obstruct their deliverance, for they should be defaced 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>);

 but let them trust in that God who had often delivered them to do it
 still, to do it now,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>.

 II. Let them not think to make idols of their own, images of the God of
 Israel, by them to worship him, as the Babylonians worship their gods, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:5-7">ver. 5-7</A>.
 
 Let them not be so sottish
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:8">ver. 8</A>),

 but have an eye to God in his word, not in an image; let them depend
 upon that, and upon the promises and predictions of it, and God's power
 to accomplish them all,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:9-11">ver. 9-11</A>.

 And let them know that the unbelief of man shall not make the word of
 God of no effect,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth, their idols were upon the
 beasts, and upon the cattle: your carriages <I>were</I> heavy loaden;
 <I>they are</I> a burden to the weary <I>beast.</I>
 &nbsp; 2  They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver
 the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.
 &nbsp; 3  Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the
 house of Israel, which are borne <I>by me</I> from the belly, which
 are carried from the womb:
 &nbsp; 4  And <I>even</I> to <I>your</I> old age I <I>am</I> he; and <I>even</I> to hoar
 hairs will I carry <I>you:</I> I have made, and I will bear; even I
 will carry, and will deliver <I>you.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That the false gods will certainly fail their worshippers when they 
 have most need of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 Bel and Nebo were two celebrated idols of Babylon. Some make Bel to be 
 a contraction of Baal; others rather think not, but that it was Belus, 
 one of their first kings, who after his death was deified. As Bel was a 
 deified prince, so (some think) Nebo was a deified prophet, for so Nebo 
 signifies; so that Bel and Nebo were their Jupiter and their Mercury or
 Apollo. Barnabas and Paul passed at Lystra for Jupiter and Mercury. The 
 names of these idols were taken into the names of their princes, Bel 
 into Belshazzar's, Nebo into Nebuchadnezzar's and Nebuzaradan's, &c. 
 These gods they had long worshipped, and in their revels praised them 
 for their successes (as appears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:4">Dan. v. 4</A>);

 and they insulted over Israel as if Bel and Nebo were too hard for
 Jehovah and could detain them in captivity in defiance of their God. 
 Now, that this might be no discouragement to the poor captives, God 
 here tells them what shall become of these idols, which they threaten 
 them with. When Cyrus takes Babylon, down go the idols. It was usual 
 then with conquerors to destroy the gods of the places and people they 
 conquered, and to put the gods of their own nation in the room of them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:19"><I>ch.</I> xxxvii. 19</A>.

 Cyrus will do so; and then Bel and Nebo, that were set up on high, and
 looked great, bold, and erect, shall <I>stoop and bow down</I> at the 
 feet of the soldiers that plunder their temples. And because there is a 
 great deal of gold and silver upon them, which was intended to adorn 
 them, but serves to expose them, they carry them away with the rest of 
 the spoil. The carriers' horses, or mules, are laden with them and 
 their other idols, to be sent among other lumber (for so it seems they 
 accounted them rather than treasure) into Persia. So far are they from 
 being able to support their worshippers that they are themselves a 
 heavy load in the wagons, and <I>a burden to the weary beast.</I> The 
 idols cannot help one another 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>They stoop, they bow down together.</I> They are all alike, 
 tottering things, and their day has come to fall. Their worshippers 
 cannot help them: <I>They could not deliver the burden</I> out of the 
 enemy's hand, <I>but themselves</I> (both the idols and the idolaters) 
 <I>have gone into captivity.</I> Let not therefore God's people be 
 afraid of either. When God's ark was taken prisoner by the Philistines 
 it proved a burden, not to the beasts, but to the conquerors, who were 
 forced to return it; but, when Bel and Nebo have gone into captivity, 
 their worshippers may even give their good word with them: they will 
 never recover themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That the true God will never fail his worshippers: "You hear what 
 has become of Bel and Nebo, now <I>hearken to me, O house of Jacob!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 Am I such a god as these? No; though you are brought low, and the house 
 of Israel is but a remnant, your God has been, is, and ever will be, 
 your powerful and faithful protector."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Let God's Israel do him the justice to own that he has hitherto been 
 kind to them, careful of them, tender over them, and has all along done 
 well for them. Let them own, 

 (1.) That he bore them at first: <I>I have made.</I> Out of what womb 
 came they, but that of his mercy, and grace, and promise? He formed 
 them into a people and gave them their constitution. Every good man is 
 what God makes him. 

 (2.) That he bore them up all along: You have been <I>borne by me from 
 the belly,</I> and <I>carried from the womb.</I> God began betimes to 
 do them good, as soon as ever they were formed into a nation, nay, when 
 as yet they were very few, and strangers. God took them under a special 
 protection, and <I>suffered no man to do them wrong,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:12-14">Ps. cv. 12-14</A>.
 
 In the infancy of their state, when they were not only foolish and
 helpless, as children, but forward and peevish, God carried them in the 
 arms of his power and love, bore them <I>as upon eagles' wings,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:4,De+32:11">Exod. xix. 4; Deut. xxxii. 11</A>.

 Moses had not patience <I>to carry them as the nursing father does the
 sucking child</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:12">Num. xi. 12</A>),

 but God bore them, and <I>bore their manners,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:18">Acts xiii. 18</A>.

 And as God began early to do them good (when <I>Israel was a child,
 then I loved him</I>), so he had constantly continued to do them good: 
 he had carried them from the womb to this day. And we may all witness 
 for God that he has been thus gracious to us. We have been borne by him 
 from the belly, from the womb, else we should have died from the womb 
 and given up the ghost when we came out of the belly. We have been the 
 constant care of his kind providence, carried in the arms of his power 
 and in the bosom of his love and pity. The new man is so; all that in 
 us which is born of God is borne up by him, else it would soon fail.
 Our spiritual life is sustained by his grace as necessarily and 
 constantly as our natural life by his providence. The saints have 
 acknowledged that God has carried them from the womb, and have 
 encouraged themselves with the consideration of it in their greatest 
 straits,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:9,10,71:5,6,17">Ps. xxii. 9, 10; lxxi. 5, 6, 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He will then do them the kindness to promise that he will never 
 leave them. He that was their first will be their last; he that was the 
 author will be the finisher of their well-being 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "You have been <I>borne by me from the belly,</I> nursed when you were 
 children; and <I>even to your old age I am he,</I> when, by reason of 
 your decays and infirmities, you will need help as much as in your 
 infancy." Israel were now growing old, so was their covenant by which 
 they were incorporated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:13">Heb. viii. 13</A>.

 <I>Gray hairs were here and there upon them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:9">Hos. vii. 9</A>.

 And they had hastened their old age, and the calamities of it, by their
 irregularities. But God will not cast them off now, will not fail them 
 when their strength fails; he is still their God, will still carry them 
 in the same everlasting arms that were laid under them in Moses's time,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:27">Deut. xxxiii. 27</A>.

 He has made them and owns his interest in them, and therefore he will
 bear them, will bear with their infirmities, and bear them up under 
 their afflictions: "Even <I>I will carry and will deliver</I> them; I 
 will now bear them upon eagles' wings out of Babylon, as in their 
 infancy I bore them out of Egypt." This promise to aged Israel is 
 applicable to every aged Israelite. God has graciously engaged to 
 support and comfort his faithful servants, even in their old age: 
 "<I>Even to your old age,</I> when you grow unfit for business, when 
 you are compassed with infirmities, and perhaps your relations begin to 
 grow weary of you, yet <I>I am he</I>--he that I am, he that I have 
 been--the very same by whom you have been borne from the belly and 
 carried from the womb. You change, but I am the same. I am he that I 
 have promised to be, he that you have found me, and he that you would 
 have me to be. <I>I will carry you, I will bear,</I> will bear you up 
 and bear you out, and will carry you on in your way and carry you home 
 at last."</P>

 The deliverance of Israel by the destruction of Babylon (the general 
 subject of all these chapters) is here insisted upon, and again 
 promised, for the conviction both of idolaters who set up as rivals 
 with God, and of oppressors who were enemies to the people of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. For the conviction of those who made and worshipped idols, 
 especially those of Israel who did so, who would have images of their 
 God, as the Babylonians had of theirs,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He challenges them either to frame an image that should be thought a 
 resemblance of him or to set up any being that should stand in 
 competition with him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>To whom will you liken me?</I> It is absurd to think of representing 
 an infinite and eternal Spirit by the figure of any creature 
 whatsoever. It is to change his truth into a lie and to turn his glory 
 into shame. None ever saw any similitude of him, nor can see his face 
 and live. <I>To whom then can we liken God?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:18,25"><I>ch.</I> xl. 18, 25</A>.

 It is likewise absurd to think of making any creature equal with the
 Creator, who is infinitely above the noblest creatures, yea, or to make 
 any comparison between the creature and the Creator, since between 
 infinite and finite there is no proportion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He exposes the folly of those who made idols and then prayed to 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 (1.) They were at great charge upon their idols and spared no cost to 
 fit them for their purpose: <I>They lavish gold out of the bag;</I> no 
 little will serve, and they do not care how much goes, though they 
 pinch their families and weaken their estates by it. How does the
 profuseness of idolaters shame the niggardliness of many who call 
 themselves God's servants but are for a religion that will cost them 
 nothing! Some <I>lavish gold out of the bag</I> to make an idol of it 
 in the house, while others <I>hoard up gold in the bag</I> to make an 
 idol of it in the heart; for <I>covetousness is idolatry,</I> as 
 dangerous, though not as scandalous, as the other. <I>They weigh
 silver in the balance,</I> either to be the matter of their idol (for 
 even those that were most sottish had so much sense as to think that 
 God should be served with the best they had, the best they could 
 possibly afford; those that represented him by a calf made it a golden 
 one) or to pay the workmen's wages. The service of sin often proves 
 very expensive. 

 (2.) They were in great care about their idols and took no little pains 
 about them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>They bear him upon their</I> own <I>shoulders,</I> and do not hire 
 porters to do it; they <I>carry him, and set him in his place,</I> more 
 like a dead corpse than a living God. They set him on a pedestal, 
 <I>and he stands.</I> They take a great deal of pains to fasten him, 
 and <I>from his place he shall not remove,</I> that they may know where 
 to find him, though at the same time they know he can neither move a 
 hand nor stir a step to do them any kindness. 

 (3.) After all, they paid great respect to their idols, though they 
 were but the works of their own hands and the creatures of their own 
 fancies. When the goldsmith has made it that which they please to call 
 a god <I>they fall down, yea, they worship it.</I> If they magnified 
 themselves too much in pretending to make a god, as if they would atone 
 for that, they vilified themselves as much in prostrating themselves to 
 a god that they knew the original of. And, if they were deceived by the 
 custom of their country in making such gods as these, they did no less 
 deceive themselves when they cried unto them, though they knew they 
 could not answer them, could not understand what they said to them, nor 
 so much as reply Yea, or No, much less could they <I>save them out of 
 their trouble.</I> Now shall any that have some knowledge of, and 
 interest in, the true and living God, thus make fools of 
 themselves?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He puts it to themselves, and their own reason, let that judge in 
 the case 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>Remember this,</I> that has been often told you, what senseless 
 helpless things idols are, <I>and show yourselves men</I>--men and not 
 brutes, men and not babes. Act with reason; act with resolution; act
 for your own interest. Do a wise thing; do a brave thing; and scorn to 
 disparage your own judgment as you do when you worship idols." Note, 
 Sinners would become saints if they would but show themselves men, if 
 they would but support the dignity of their nature and use aright its 
 powers and capacities. "Many things you have been reminded of; <I>bring 
 them again to mind,</I> recall them into you memories, and revolve them 
 there. <I>O! you transgressors, consider your ways; remember whence you 
 have fallen, and repent,</I> and so recover yourselves."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He again produces incontestable proofs that he is God, that he and 
 none besides is so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>I am God, and there is none like me.</I> This is that which we have 
 need to be reminded of again and again; for proof of it he refers, 

 (1.) To the sacred history: "<I>Remember the former things of old,</I> 
 what the God of Israel did for his people in their beginnings, whether 
 he did not that for them which no one else could, and which the false 
 gods did not, nor could do, for their worshippers. Remember those 
 things, and you will own that <I>I am God and there is none else.</I>" 
 This is a good reason why we should give glory to him as a nonsuch, and 
 why we should not give that glory to any other which is due to him 
 alone, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:11">Exod. xv. 11</A>.

 (2.) To the sacred prophecy. He is God alone, for it is he only that 
 <I>declares the end from the beginning,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 From the beginning of time he declared the end of time, and end of all 
 things. Enoch prophesied, <I>Behold, the Lord comes.</I> From the
 beginning of a nation he declares what the end of it will be. He told 
 Israel what should befal them in <I>the latter days,</I> what <I>their 
 end should be,</I> and wished they were so wise as to consider it, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:20,29">Deut. xxxii. 20, 29</A>.

 From the beginning of an event he declares what the end of it will be.
 <I>Known unto God are all his works,</I> and, when he pleases, he makes 
 them known. Further than prophecy guides us it is impossible for us to 
 <I>find out the work that God makes from the beginning to the end,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:11">Eccl. iii. 11</A>.

 He <I>declares from ancient times the things that are not yet done.</I>
 Many scripture prophecies which were delivered long ago are not yet 
 accomplished; but the accomplishment of some in the mean time is an 
 earnest of the accomplishment of the rest in due time. By this it
 appears that he is <I>God, and none else;</I> it is he, and none 
 besides, that can say, and make his words good, "<I>My counsel shall 
 stand,</I> and all the powers of hell and earth cannot control or 
 disannul it nor all their policies correct or countermine it." As God's 
 operations are all according to his counsels, so his counsels shall all 
 be fulfilled in his operations, and none of his measures shall be 
 broken, none of his designs shall miscarry. This yields abundant 
 satisfaction to those who have bound up all their comforts in God's 
 counsels, that his counsel shall undoubtedly stand; and, if we are 
 brought to this, that whatever pleases God pleases us, nothing can 
 contribute more to make us easy than to be assured of this, that <I>God 
 will do all his pleasure,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:6">Ps. cxxxv. 6</A>.

 The accomplishment of this particular prophecy, which relates to the
 elevation of Cyrus and his agency in the deliverance of God's people 
 out of their captivity, is mentioned for the confirmation of this 
 truth, that the Lord is God and there is none else; and this is a thing 
 which shall shortly come to pass,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 God by his counsel <I>calls a ravenous bird from the east,</I> a bird 
 of prey, <I>Cyrus,</I> who (they say) had a nose like the beak of a 
 hawk or eagle, to which some think this alludes, or (as others say) to 
 the eagle which was his standard, as it was afterwards that of the 
 Romans, to which there is supposed to be a reference, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:28">Matt. xxiv. 28</A>.

 Cyrus came from the east at God's call: for God is Lord of hosts and of
 those that have hosts at command. And, if God give him a call, he will 
 give him success. He is the man that shall <I>execute God's 
 counsel,</I> though he comes <I>from a far country</I> and knows 
 nothing of the matter. Note, Even those that know not, and mind not,
 God's revealed will, are made use of to fulfil the counsels of his 
 secret will, which shall all be punctually accomplished in their season 
 by what hand he pleases. That which is here added, to ratify this
 particular prediction, may abundantly show to the heirs of promise the 
 immutability of his counsel: "<I>I have spoken of it</I> by my servants 
 the prophets, and what I have spoken is just the same with what <I>I 
 have purposed.</I>" For, though God has many things in his purposes 
 which are not in his prophecies, he has nothing in his prophecies but 
 what are in his purposes. And he <I>will do it,</I> for he will never 
 change his mind; he <I>will bring it to pass,</I> for it is not in the 
 power of any creature to control him. Observe with what majesty he says 
 it, as one having authority: <I>I have spoken it, I will also bring it 
 to pass. Dictum, factum--no sooner said than done. I have purposed
 it,</I> and he does not say, "I will take care it shall be done," but, 
 "<I>I will do it.</I>" Heaven and earth shall pass away sooner than one 
 tittle of the word of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. For the conviction of those that daringly opposed the counsels of 
 God assurance is here given not only that they shall be accomplished, 
 but that they shall be accomplished very shortly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:12,13">
 <I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. This is addressed to the <I>stout-hearted,</I> that is, either, 

 (1.) The proud and obstinate Babylonians, <I>that are far from 
 righteousness,</I> far from doing justice or showing mercy to those 
 they have power over, that say they will never let the oppressed go 
 free, but will still detain them in spite of their petitions or God's 
 predictions, that are far from any thing of clemency or compassion to 
 the miserable. Or, 

 (2.) The unhumbled Jews, that have been long under the hammer, long in 
 the furnace, but are not broken are not melted, that, like the 
 unbelieving murmuring Israelites in the wilderness, think themselves 
 far from God's righteousness (that is, from the performance of his 
 promise, and his appearing to judge for them), and by their distrusts 
 set themselves at a yet further distance from it, and keep good things 
 from themselves, as their fathers, who could not enter into the land of 
 promise because of unbelief. This is applicable to the Jewish nation 
 when they rejected the gospel of Christ; though they <I>followed after 
 the law of righteousness,</I> they <I>attained not to righteousness, 
 because they sought it not by faith,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:31,32">Rom. ix. 31, 32</A>.

 They perished far from righteousness; and it was because they were
 <I>stout-hearted,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:3">Rom. x. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Now to them God says that, whatever they think, the one in 
 presumption, the other in despair, 

 (1.) Salvation shall be certainly wrought for God's people. If men will 
 not do them justice, God will, and his righteousness shall effect that 
 for them which men's righteousness would not reach to. He <I>will place 
 salvation in Zion,</I> that is, he will make Jerusalem a place of 
 safety and defence to all those who will plant themselves there; thence 
 shall salvation go forth <I>for Israel his glory.</I> God glories in 
 his Israel; and he will be glorified in the salvation he designs to 
 work out for them; it shall redound greatly to his honour. This 
 salvation shall be in Zion; for thence the gospel shall take rise

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:3"><I>ch.</I> ii. 3</A>),

 thither the Redeemer comes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:20,Ro+11:26"><I>ch.</I> lix. 20, Rom. xi. 26</A>),

 and it is Zion's King that has salvation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:9">Zech. ix. 9</A>.

 (2.) It shall be very shortly wrought. This is especially insisted on 
 with those who thought it at a distance: "<I>I bring near my 
 righteousness,</I> nearer than you think of; perhaps it is nearest of 
 all when your straits are greatest and your enemies most injurious; it 
 shall not be far off when there is occasion for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+85:9">Ps. lxxxv. 9</A>.
 
 <I>Behold, the Judge stands before the door.</I> My salvation shall not
 tarry any longer than till it is ripe and you are ready for it; and 
 therefore, <I>though it tarry, wait for it;</I> wait patiently, for 
 <I>he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.</I>"</P>
