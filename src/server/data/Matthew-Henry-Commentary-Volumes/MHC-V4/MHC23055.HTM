 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As we had much of Christ in the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:1-12">53rd chapter</A>,

 and much of the church of Christ in the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:1-17">54th chapter</A>,

 so in this chapter we have much of the covenant of grace made with us
 in Christ. The "sure mercies of David," which are promised here
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:3">ver. 3</A>),

 are applied by the apostle to the benefits which flow to us from the
 resurrection of Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:34">Acts xiii. 34</A>),

 which may serve as a key to this chapter; not but that it was intended
 for the comfort of the people of God that lived then, especially of the
 captives in Babylon, and others of the dispersed of Israel; but unto us
 was this gospel preached as well as unto them, and much more clearly
 and fully in the New Testament. Here is,

 I. A free and gracious invitation to all to come and take the benefit
 of gospel grace,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. Pressing arguments to enforce this invitation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:2-4">ver. 2-4</A>.

 III. A promise of the success of this invitation among the Gentiles, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:5">ver. 5</A>.

 IV. An exhortation to repentance and reformation, with great 
 encouragement given to hope for pardon thereupon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:6-9">ver. 6-9</A>.

 V. The ratification of all this, with the certain efficacy of the word 
 of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:10,11">ver. 10, 11</A>.

 And a particular instance of the accomplishment of it in the return of 
 the Jews out of their captivity, which was intended for a sign of the 
 accomplishment of all these other promises.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he
 that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine
 and milk without money and without price.
 &nbsp; 2  Wherefore do ye spend money for <I>that which is</I> not bread?
 and your labour for <I>that which</I> satisfieth not? hearken
 diligently unto me, and eat ye <I>that which is</I> good, and let your
 soul delight itself in fatness.

 the sure mercies of David.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. We are all invited to come and take the benefit of that provision 
 which the grace of God has made for poor souls in the new covenant, of 
 that which is the <I>heritage of the servants of the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:17"><I>ch.</I> liv. 17</A>),

 and not only their heritage hereafter, but their cup now, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Who are invited: <I>Ho, every one.</I> Not the Jews only, to whom 
 first the word of salvation was sent, but the Gentiles, the poor and 
 the maimed, the halt and the blind, are called to this marriage supper, 
 whoever can be picked up out of the highways and the hedges. It 
 intimates that in Christ there is enough for all and enough for each, 
 that ministers are to make a general offer of life and salvation to 
 all, that in gospel times the invitation should be more largely made 
 than it had been and should be sent to the Gentiles, and that the 
 gospel covenant excludes none that do not exclude themselves. The 
 invitation is published with an <I>Oyez-Ho,</I> take notice of it. 
 <I>He that has ears to hear let him hear.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What is the qualification required in those that shall be 
 welcome--they must thirst. All shall be welcome to gospel grace upon
 those terms only that gospel grace be welcome to them. Those that are 
 satisfied with the world and its enjoyments for a portion, and seek not 
 for a happiness in the favour of God,--those that depend upon the merit
 of their own works for a righteousness, and see no need they have of 
 Christ and his righteousness,--these do not thirst; they have no sense
 of their need, are in no pain or uneasiness about their souls, and 
 therefore will not condescend so far as to be beholden to Christ. But 
 those that thirst are invited to the waters, as those that labour, and 
 are heavy-laden, are invited to Christ for rest. Note, Where God gives 
 grace he first gives a thirsting after it; and, where he has given a 
 thirsting after it, he will give it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:10">Ps. lxxxi. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Whither they are invited: <I>Come you to the waters.</I> Come to the 
 water-side, to the ports, and quays, and wharfs, on the navigable 
 rivers, into which goods are imported; thither come and buy, for that 
 is the market-place of foreign commodities; and to us they would have 
 been for ever foreign if Christ had not brought in an everlasting 
 righteousness. Come to Christ; for he is the fountain opened; he is the 
 rock smitten. Come to holy ordinances, to those streams that make glad 
 the city of our God; come to them, and though they may seem to you 
 plain and common things, like waters, yet to those who believe in 
 Christ the things signified will be as wine and mile, abundantly 
 refreshing. Come to the healing waters; come to the living waters. 
 Whoever will, let him come, and <I>partake of the waters of life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:17">Rev. xxii. 17</A>.
 
 Our Saviour referred to it,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:37">John vii. 37</A>.

 <I>If any man thirst, let him come to me and drink.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. What they are invited to do. 

 (1.) <I>Come, and buy.</I> Never did any tradesman court customers that 
 he hoped to get by as Christ courts us to that which we only are to be 
 gainers by. "Come and buy, and we can assure you you shall have a good 
 bargain, which you will never repent of nor lose by. Come and buy; make 
 it your own by an application of the grace of the gospel to yourselves; 
 make it your own upon Christ's terms, nay, your own upon any terms, nor 
 deliberating whether you shall agree to them." 

 (2.) "<I>Come, and eat;</I> make it still more your own, as that which 
 we eat is more our own than that which we only buy." We must buy the 
 truth, not that we may lay it by to be looked at, but that we may feed 
 and feast upon it, and that the spiritual life may be nourished and 
 strengthened by it. We must buy necessary provisions for our souls, be 
 willing to part with any thing, though ever so dear to us, so that we 
 may but have Christ and his graces and comforts. We must part with sin, 
 because it is an opposition to Christ, part with all opinion of our own 
 righteousness, as standing in competition with Christ, and part with 
 life itself, and its most necessary supports, rather than quit our 
 interest in Christ. And, when we have bought what we need, let us not
 deny ourselves the comfortable use of it, but enjoy it, and eat the 
 labour of our hands: <I>Buy, and eat.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. What is the provision they are invited to: "<I>Come, and buy wine 
 and milk,</I> which will not only quench the thirst" (fair water would 
 do that), "but nourish the body, and revive the spirits." The world 
 comes short of our expectations. We promise ourselves, at least, water 
 in it, but we are disappointed of that, as <I>the troops of Tema,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:19">Job vi. 19</A>.

 But Christ outdoes our expectations. We come to the waters, and would
 be glad of them, but we find there wine and milk, which were the staple 
 commodities of the tribe of Judah, and which the Shiloh of that tribe 
 is furnished with to entertain the <I>gathering of the people to 
 him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:10,12">Gen. xlix. 10, 12</A>.

 <I>His eyes shall be red with wine and his teeth white with milk.</I>
 We must come to Christ, to have milk for babes, to nourish and cherish 
 those that are but lately born again; and with him strong men shall 
 find that which will be a cordial to them: they shall have wine to make 
 glad their hearts. We must part with our puddle-water, nay, with our 
 poison, that we may procure this wine and milk.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. The free communication of this provision: <I>Buy it without money, 
 and without price.</I> A strange way of buying, not only without ready 
 money (that is common enough), but without any money, or the promise of 
 any; yet it seems not so strange to those who have observed Christ's 
 counsel to Laodicea, that was wretchedly poor, to <I>come and buy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:17,18">Rev. iii. 17, 18</A>.
 
 Our buying without money intimates,

 (1.) That the gifts offered us are invaluable and such as no price can 
 be set upon. Wisdom is that which cannot be gotten for gold. 

 (2.) That he who offers them has no need of us, nor of any returns we 
 can make him. He makes us these proposals, not because he has occasion 
 to sell, but because he has a disposition to give. 

 (3.) That the things offered are already bought and paid for. Christ 
 purchased them at the full value, with price, not with money, but with 
 <I>his own blood,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:19">1 Pet. i. 19</A>.

 (4.) That we shall be welcome to the benefits of the promise, though we 
 are utterly unworthy of them, and cannot make a tender of any thing 
 that looks like a valuable consideration. We ourselves are not of any 
 value, nor is any thing we have or can do, and we must own it, that, if 
 Christ and heaven be ours, we may see ourselves for ever indebted to 
 free grace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We are earnestly pressed and persuaded (and O that we would be 
 prevailed with!) to accept this invitation, and make this good bargain 
 for ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That which we are persuaded to is to hearken to God and to his 
 proposals: "<I>Hearken diligently unto me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Not only give me the hearing, but approve of what I say, and apply it 
 to yourselves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Incline your ear,</I> as you do to that which you find yourselves
 concerned in and pleased with; bow the ear, and let the proud heart 
 stoop to the humbling methods of the gospel; bend the ear this way, 
 that you may hear with attention and remark; hear, <I>and come unto 
 me;</I> not only come and treat with me, but comply with me, come up to 
 my terms;" accept God's offers as very advantageous; answer his demands 
 as very fit and reasonable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The arguments used to persuade us to this are taken,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) From the unspeakable wrong we do to ourselves if we neglect and 
 refuse this invitation: "<I>Wherefore do you spend money for that which 
 is not bread,</I> which will not yield you, no, not beggar's food, dry 
 bread, when with me you may have wine and milk without money? 
 <I>Wherefore do you spend your labour</I> and toil <I>for that 
 which</I> will not be so much as dry bread to you, for it <I>satisfies 
 not?</I>" See here, 

 [1.] The vanity of the things of this world. They are not bread, not 
 proper food for a soul; they afford no suitable nourishment or 
 refreshment. Bread is the staff of the natural life, but it affords no 
 support at all to the spiritual life. All the wealth and pleasure in 
 the world will not make one meal's meat for a soul. Eternal truth and 
 eternal good are the only food for a rational and immortal soul, the 
 life of which consists in reconciliation and conformity to God, and in 
 union and communion with him, which the things of the world will not at 
 all befriend. <I>They satisfy not;</I> they yield not any solid comfort 
 and content to the soul, nor enable it to say, "Now I have what I would 
 have." Nay, they do not satisfy even the appetites of the body. The 
 more men have the more they would have, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:8">Eccl. i. 8</A>.

 Haman was unsatisfied in the midst of his abundance. They flatter, but
 they do not fill; they please for a while, like the dream of a hungry 
 man, who awakes and his soul is empty. They soon surfeit, but they 
 never satisfy; they cloy a man, but do not content him, or make him 
 truly easy. It is all vanity and vexation.

 [2.] The folly of the children of this world. They spend their money 
 and labour for these uncertain unsatisfying things. Rich people live by 
 their money, poor people by their labour; but both mistake their truest 
 interest, while the one is trading, the other toiling, for the world, 
 both promising themselves satisfaction and happiness in it, but both 
 miserably disappointed. God vouchsafes compassionately to reason with 
 them: "Wherefore do you thus act against your own interest? Why do you 
 suffer yourselves to be thus imposed upon?" Let us reason with 
 ourselves, and let the result of these reasonings be a holy resolution 
 not to <I>labour for the meat that perishes, but for that which endures 
 to everlasting life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:27">John vi. 27</A>.

 Let all the disappointments we meet with in the world help to drive us
 to Christ, and lead us to seek for satisfaction in him only. This is
 the way to make sure which will be made sure.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) From the unspeakable kindness we do to ourselves if we accept this 
 invitation and comply with it. 

 [1.] hereby we secure to ourselves present pleasure and satisfaction: 
 "If you hearken to Christ, you <I>eat that which is good,</I> which is 
 both wholesome and pleasant, good in itself and good for you." God's 
 good word and promise, a good conscience, and the comforts of God's 
 good Spirit, are a continual feast to those that hearken diligently and 
 obediently to Christ. Their souls shall <I>delight themselves in 
 fatness,</I> that is, in the riches and most grateful delights. Here 
 the invitation is not, "Come, and <I>buy,</I>" lest that should 
 discourage, but, "Come, and <I>eat;</I> come and entertain yourselves 
 with that which will be abundantly pleasing; eat, O friends!" It is sad 
 to think that men should need to be courted thus to their own bliss. 
 
 [2.] Hereby we secure to ourselves lasting happiness: "<I>Hear, and 
 your soul shall live;</I> you shall not only be saved from perishing 
 eternally, but you shall be eternally blessed:" for less than that 
 cannot be the life of an immortal soul. The words of Christ are spirit 
 and life, life to spirits 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:33,63">John vi. 33, 63</A>),

 the words of this life, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:20">Acts v. 20</A>.

 On what easy terms is happiness offered to us! It is but "Hear, and you
 shall live."

 [3.] The great God graciously secures all this to us: "Come to me, 
 <I>and I will make an everlasting covenant with you,</I> will put 
 myself into covenant-relations and under covenant-engagements to you, 
 and thereby settle upon you <I>the sure mercies of David.</I>" Note, 
 <I>First,</I> If we come to God to serve him, he will covenant with us 
 to do us good and make us happy; such are his condescension to us and 
 concern for us. <I>Secondly,</I> God's covenant with us is an 
 everlasting covenant--its contrivance from everlasting, its continuance 
 to everlasting. <I>Thirdly,</I> The benefits of this covenant are 
 mercies suited to our case, who, being miserable, are the proper 
 objects of mercy. They come from God's mercy, and are ordered every way 
 in kindness to us. <I>Fourthly,</I> They are the mercies of David, such 
 mercies as God promised to David

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:28,29">Ps. lxxxix. 28, 29</A>,

 &c.), which are called <I>the mercies of David his servant,</I> and are
 appealed to by Solomon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+6:42">2 Chron. vi. 42</A>.

 It shall be a covenant as sure as that with David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:25,26">Jer. xxxiii. 25, 26</A>.

 The covenant of royalty was a figure of the covenant of grace,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+23:5">2 Sam. xxiii. 5</A>.
 
 Or, rather, by David here we are to understand the Messiah.
 Covenant-mercies are all <I>his</I> mercies; they are purchased by him; 
 they are promised in him; they are treasured up in his hand, and out of 
 his hand they are dispensed to us. He is the Mediator and trustee of 
 the covenant; to him this is applied, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:34">Acts xiii. 34</A>.

 They are the <B><I>ta hosia</I></B> (the word used there, and by the
 Septuagint here)--<I>the holy things</I> of David, for they are 
 confirmed by the holiness of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:35">Ps. lxxxix. 35</A>)

 and are intended to advance holiness among men. <I>Fifthly,</I> They
 are sure mercies. The covenant, being well-ordered in all things, is 
 sure. It is sure in the general proposal of it; God is real and 
 sincere, serious and in earnest, in the offer of these mercies. It is 
 sure in the particular application of it to believers; God's gifts and 
 callings are without repentance. They are the mercies of David, and 
 therefore sure, for in Christ the promises are all yea and amen.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Jesus Christ is promised for the making good of all the other 
 promises which we are here invited to accept of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 He is that David whose sure mercies all the blessings and benefits of 
 the covenant are. "And God has <I>given him</I> in his purpose and
 promise, has constituted and appointed him, and in the fulness of time 
 will as surely send him as if he had already come, to be all that to us 
 which is necessary to our having the benefit of these preparations." He 
 has given him freely; for what more free than a gift? There was nothing 
 in us to merit such a favour, but Christ is the gift of God. We want 
 one,

 1. To attest the truth of the promises which we are invited to take the 
 benefit of; and Christ is given <I>for a witness</I> that God is 
 willing to receive us into his favour upon gospel terms, to confirm the 
 promises made unto the fathers, that we may venture our souls upon 
 those promises with entire satisfaction. Christ is a faithful witness, 
 we may take his word--a competent witness, for he lay in the bosom of
 the Father from eternity, and was perfectly apprised of the whole 
 matter. Christ, as a prophet, testifies the will of God to the world; 
 and to believe is to receive his testimony. 

 2. To assist us in closing with the invitation, and coming up to the 
 terms of it. We know not how to find the way to the waters where we are 
 to be supplied, but Christ is given to be <I>a leader.</I> We know not 
 what to do that we may be qualified or it, and become sharers in it, 
 but he is given for <I>a commander,</I> to show us what to do and 
 enable us to do it. Much difficulty and opposition lie in our way to 
 Christ; we have spiritual enemies to grapple with, but, to animate us 
 for the conflict, we have a good captain, like Joshua, a leader and 
 commander to tread our enemies under our feet and to put us in 
 possession of the land of promise. Christ is a commander by his
 precept and a leader by his example; our business is to obey him and 
 follow him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The Master of the feast being fixed, it is next to be furnished 
 with guests, for the provision shall not be lost, nor made in vain, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 1. The Gentiles shall be called to this feast, shall be invited out of
 the highways and the hedges: "<I>Thou shalt call a nation that thou 
 knowest not,</I> that is, that was not formerly called and owned as thy 
 nation, that thou didst not send prophets to as to Israel, the people 
 whom God knew above all the families of the earth." The Gentiles shall 
 now be favoured as they never were before; their knowing God is said to 
 be rather their <I>being known of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:9">Gal. iv. 9</A>.

 2. They shall come at the call: <I>Nations that knew not thee shall run 
 unto thee;</I> those that had long been afar off from Christ shall be 
 made nigh; those that had been running from him shall run to him, with 
 the greatest speed and alacrity imaginable. There shall be a concourse 
 of believing Gentiles to Christ, who, being lifted up from the earth, 
 will draw all men to him. Now see the reason,

 (1.) Why the Gentiles will thus flock to Christ; it is <I>because of 
 the Lord his God,</I> because he is the Son of God, and is declared to 
 be so with power, because they now see his God is one with whom they 
 have to do, and there is no coming to him as their God but by making an 
 interest in his Son. Those that are brought to be acquainted with God, 
 and understand how the concern lies between them and him, cannot but 
 run to Jesus Christ, who is the only Mediator between God and Man, and 
 there is no coming to God but by him.

 (2.) Why God will bring them to him; it is because he is the Holy One 
 of Israel, true to his promises, and he has promised to glorify him by 
 giving him the heathen for his inheritance. When Greeks began to 
 enquire after Christ he said, <I>The hour has come that the Son of man 
 should be glorified,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:22,23">John xii. 22, 23</A>.

 And his being glorified in his resurrection and ascension was the great
 argument by which multitudes were wrought upon to run to him.</P>

 &nbsp; 11  So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it
 shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which
 I please, and it shall prosper <I>in the thing</I> whereto I sent it.
 &nbsp; 12  For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace:
 the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into
 singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap <I>their</I> hands.
 &nbsp; 13  Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead
 of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> for a name, for an everlasting sign <I>that</I> shall not be
 cut off.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a further account of that covenant of grace which is made 
 with us in Jesus Christ, both what is required and what is promised in 
 the covenant, and of those considerations that are sufficient 
 abundantly to confirm our believing compliance with and reliance on 
 that covenant. This gracious discovery of God's good-will to the 
 children of men is not to be confined either to the Jew or to the 
 Gentile, to the Old Testament or to the New, much less to the captives 
 in Babylon. No, both the precepts and the promises are here given to 
 all, to <I>every one that thirsts after happiness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 And who does not? Hear this, and live.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is a gracious offer made of pardon, and peace, and all 
 happiness, to poor sinners, upon gospel terms, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Let them pray, and their prayers shall be heard and answered 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):
 
 "<I>Seek the Lord while he may be found.</I> Seek him whom you have
 left by revolting from your allegiance to him and whom you have lost by 
 provoking him to withdraw his favour from you. <I>Call upon him</I> now 
 <I>while he is near,</I> and within call." Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The duties required. 

 [1.] "Seek the Lord. Seek to him, and enquire of him, as your oracle. 
 <I>Ask the law at his mouth. What wilt thou have me to do?</I> Seek for 
 him, and enquire after him, as your portion and happiness; seek to be 
 reconciled to him and acquainted with him, and to be happy in his 
 favour. Be sorry that you have lost him; be solicitous to find him; 
 take the appointed method of finding him, making use of Christ as your 
 way, the Spirit as your guide, and the word as your rule." 

 [2.] "Call upon him. Pray to him, to be reconciled, and, being 
 reconciled, pray to him for every thing else you have need of."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The motives made use of to press these duties upon us: <I>While he 
 may be found--while he is near.</I> 

 [1.] It is implied that now God is near and will be found, so that it 
 shall not be in vain to seek him and to call upon him. Now his patience 
 is waiting on us, his word is calling to us, and his Spirit striving 
 with us. Let us now improve our advantages and opportunities; for now 
 is the accepted time. But, 

 [2.] There is a day coming when he will be afar off, and will not be 
 found, when the day of his patience is over, and his Spirit will strive 
 no more. There may come such a time in this life, when the heart is 
 incurably hardened; it is certain that at death and judgment the door 
 will be <I>shut,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:26,13:25,26">Luke xvi. 26; xiii. 25, 26</A>.

 Mercy is now offered, but then judgment without mercy will take
 place.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Let them repent and reform, and their sins shall be pardoned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 Here is a call to the unconverted, to <I>the wicked and the
 unrighteous</I>--to the wicked, who live in known gross sins, to the
 unrighteous, who live in the neglect of plain duties: to them is the 
 word of this salvation sent, and all possible assurance given that 
 penitent sinners shall find God a pardoning God. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What it is to repent. There are two things involved in 
 repentance:--

 [1.] It is to turn from sin; it is to forsake it. It is to leave it, 
 and to leave it with loathing and abhorrence, never to return to it 
 again. The wicked must <I>forsake his way,</I> his evil way, as we 
 would forsake a false way that will never bring us to the happiness we 
 aim at, and a dangerous way, that leads to destruction. Let him not 
 take one step more in that way. Nay, there must be not only a change of 
 the way, but a change of the mind; the unrighteous must <I>forsake his 
 thoughts.</I> Repentance, if it be true, strikes at the root, and 
 washes the heart from wickedness. We must alter our judgments 
 concerning persons and things, dislodge the corrupt imaginations and 
 quit the vain pretences under which an unsanctified heart shelters 
 itself. Note, It is not enough to break off from evil practices, but we 
 must enter a caveat against evil thoughts. Yet this is not all: 

 [2.] To repent is to <I>return to the Lord;</I> to return to him as our 
 God, our sovereign Lord, against whom we have rebelled, and to whom we 
 are concerned to reconcile ourselves; it is to return to the Lord as 
 the fountain of life and living waters, which we had forsaken for 
 broken cisterns.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What encouragement we have thus to repent. If we do so, 

 [1.] God <I>will have mercy.</I> He will not deal with us as our sins 
 have deserved, but will have compassion on us. Misery is the object of 
 mercy. Now both the consequences of sin, by which we have become truly 
 miserable 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:5,6">Ezek. xvi. 5, 6</A>),

 and the nature of repentance, by which we are made sensible of our
 misery and are brought to bemoan ourselves

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:18">Jer. xxxi. 18</A>),

 both these make us objects of pity, and with God there are tender
 mercies.

 [2.] <I>He will abundantly pardon. He will multiply to pardon</I> (so 
 the word is), as we have multiplied to offend. Though our sins have 
 been very great and very many, and though we have often backslidden and 
 are still prone to offend, yet God will repeat his pardon, and welcome 
 even backsliding children that return to him in sincerity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here are encouragements given us to accept this offer and to 
 venture our souls upon it. For, look which way we will, we find enough 
 to confirm us in our belief of its validity and value.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. If we look up to heaven, we find God's counsels there high and 
 transcendent, his thoughts and ways infinitely above ours, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 The wicked are urged to forsake their evil ways and thoughts

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>)

 and to return to God, that is, to bring their ways and thoughts to
 concur and comply with his; "for" (says he) "my thoughts and ways are 
 not as yours. Yours are conversant only about things beneath; they are 
 of the earth earthy: but mine are above, <I>as the heaven is high above 
 the earth;</I> and, if you would approve yourselves true penitents, 
 yours must be so too, and your affections must be set on things above." 
 Or, rather, it is to be understood as an encouragement to us to depend 
 upon God's promise to pardon sin, upon repentance. Sinners may be ready 
 to fear that God will not be reconciled to them, because they could not 
 find in their hearts to be reconciled to one who should have so basely 
 and so frequently offended them. "But" (says God) "my thoughts in this 
 matter are not as yours, but as far above them as the heaven is above 
 the earth." They are so in other things. Men's sentiments concerning 
 sin, and Christ, and holiness, concerning this world and the other, are 
 vastly different from God's; but in nothing more than in the matter of 
 reconciliation. We think God apt to take offence and backward to 
 forgive--that, if he forgives once, he will not forgive a second time.
 Peter thought it a great deal to <I>forgive seven times</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:21">Matt. xviii. 21</A>),

 and a hundred pence go far with us; but God meets returning sinners
 with pardoning mercy; he forgives freely, and as he gives: it is 
 without upbraiding. We forgive and cannot forget; but, when God 
 forgives sin, he remembers it no more. Thus God invites sinners to 
 return to him, by possessing them with good thoughts of him, as 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:20">Jer. xxxi. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. If we look down to this earth, we find God's word there powerful and 
 effectual, and answering all its great intentions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 Observe here,

 (1.) The efficacy of God's word in the kingdom of nature. He saith to 
 the snow, Be thou on the earth; he appoints when it shall come, to what 
 degree, and how long it shall lie there; he saith so <I>to the small 
 rain and the great rain of his strength,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:6">Job xxxvii. 6</A>.

 And according to his order they come down from heaven, and do
 <I>whatsoever he commands them upon the face of the world, whether it 
 be for correction, or for his land, or for mercy,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.

 It returns not <I>re infect&acirc;--without having accomplished its
 end,</I> but waters the earth, which he is therefore said to do <I>from 
 his chambers,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:13">Ps. civ. 13</A>.

 And the watering of the earth is in order to its fruitfulness. Thus he
 makes it to <I>bring forth and bud,</I> for the products of the earth 
 depend upon the dews of heaven; and thus it gives not only <I>bread to 
 the eater,</I> present maintenance to the owner and his family, but 
 <I>seed</I> likewise <I>to the sower,</I> that he may have food for 
 another year. The husbandman must be a sower as well as an eater, else 
 he will soon see the end of what he has.

 (2.) The efficacy of his word in the kingdom of providence and grace, 
 which is as certain as the former: "<I>So shall my word be,</I> as 
 powerful in the mouth of prophets as it is in the hand of providence; 
 <I>it shall not return unto me void,</I> as unable to effect what it 
 was sent for, or meeting with an insuperable opposition; no, <I>it 
 shall accomplish that which I please</I>" (for it is the declaration of 
 his will, according to the counsel of which he works all things) 
 "<I>and it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it.</I>" This 
 assures us,

 [1.] That the promises of God shall all have their full accomplishment 
 in due time, and not one iota or tittle of them shall fail, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:56">1 Kings viii. 56</A>.
 
 These promises of mercy and grace shall have as real an effect upon the
 souls of believers, for their sanctification and comfort, as ever the 
 rain had upon the earth, to make it fruitful. 

 [2.] That according to the different errands on which the word is sent 
 it will have its different effects. If it be not a savour of life unto 
 life, it will be a savour of death unto death; if it do not convince 
 the conscience and soften the heart, it will sear the conscience and 
 harden the heart; if it do not ripen for heaven, it will ripen for 
 hell. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:9"><I>ch.</I> vi. 9</A>.

 One way or other, it will take effect. 

 [3.] That Christ's coming into the world, as the dew from heaven 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:5">Hos. xiv. 5</A>),

 will not be in vain. For, if Israel be not gathered, he will be
 glorious in the conversion of the Gentiles; to them therefore the 
 tenders of grace must be made when the Jews refuse them, that the 
 wedding may be furnished with guests and the gospel not return 
 void.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. If we take a special view of the church, we shall find what great 
 things God has done, and will do, for it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>):

 <I>You shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace.</I> This
 refers,

 (1.) To the deliverance and return of the Jews out of Babylon. They 
 shall go out of their captivity, and be led forth towards their own 
 land again. God will go before them as surely, though not as sensibly, 
 as before their fathers in the pillar of cloud and fire. They shall go 
 out, not with trembling, but with triumph, not with any regret to part 
 with Babylon, or any fear of being fetched back, but <I>with joy</I> 
 and <I>peace.</I> Their journey home over the mountains shall be 
 pleasant, and they shall have the good-will and good wishes of all the 
 countries they pass through. <I>The hills</I> and their inhabitants 
 <I>shall,</I> as in a transport of joy, <I>break forth into 
 singing;</I> and, if the people should altogether hold their peace, 
 even <I>the trees of the field</I> would attend them with their 
 applauses and acclamations. And, when they come to their own land, it 
 shall be ready to bid them welcome; for, whereas they expected to find 
 it all overgrown with briers and thorns, it shall be set with 
 <I>fir-trees and myrtle-trees:</I> for, though it lay desolate, yet it 
 <I>enjoyed its sabbaths</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:34">Lev. xxvi. 34</A>),

 which, when they were over, like the land after the sabbatical year, it
 was the better for. And this shall redound much to the honour of God 
 and be to him <I>for a name.</I> But,

 (2.) Without doubt it looks further. This shall be <I>for an 
 everlasting sign,</I> that it,

 [1.] The redemption of the Jews out of Babylon shall be a ratification 
 of those promises that relate to gospel times. The accomplishment of 
 the predictions relating to that great deliverance would be a pledge 
 and earnest of the performance of all the other promises; for thereby 
 it shall appear that <I>he is faithful who has promised.</I> 

 [2.] It shall be a representation of the blessings promised and a type 
 and figure of them. <I>First,</I> Gospel grace will set those at
 liberty that were in bondage to sin and Satan. They <I>shall go out and 
 be led forth.</I> Christ shall make them free, and then they shall be 
 free indeed. <I>Secondly,</I> It will fill those with joy that were 
 melancholy. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:7">Ps. xiv. 7</A>,

 <I>Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.</I> The earth and the
 inferior part of the creation shall share in the joy of this salvation,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+94:11,12">Ps. xciv. 11, 12</A>.

 <I>Thirdly,</I> It will make a great change in men's characters. Those
 that were as thorns and briers, good for nothing but the fire, nay, 
 hurtful and vexatious, shall become graceful and useful as the fir-tree 
 and the myrtle-tree. Thorns and briers came in with sin and were the
 fruits of the curse, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:18">Gen. iii. 18</A>.

 The raising of pleasant trees in the room of them signifies the removal
 of the curse of the law and the introduction of gospel blessings. The 
 church's enemies were as thorns and briers; but, instead of them, God 
 will raise up friends to be her protection and ornament. Or it may
 denote the world's growing better; instead of a generation of thorns 
 and briers, there shall come up a generation of fir-trees and myrtles; 
 the children shall be wiser and better than the parents. And, 
 <I>fourthly,</I> in all this God shall be glorified. It shall be to
 him for a name, by which he will be made known and praised, and by it 
 the people of God shall be encouraged. It shall be for an everlasting 
 sign of God's favour to them, assuring them that, though it may for a 
 time be clouded, it shall never <I>be cut off.</I> The covenant of 
 grace is an everlasting covenant; for the present blessings of it are 
 signs of everlasting ones.</P>
