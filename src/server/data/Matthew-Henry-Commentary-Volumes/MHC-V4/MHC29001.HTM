 This chapter is the description of a lamentable devastation made of the 
 country of Judah by locusts and caterpillars. Some think that the 
 prophet speaks of it as a thing to come and gives warning of it 
 beforehand, as usually the prophets did of judgments coming. Others 
 think that it was now present, and that his business was to affect the 
 people with it and awaken them by it to repentance. 

 I. It is spoken of as a judgment which there was no precedent of in 
 former ages, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 II. All sorts of people sharing in the calamity are called upon to
 lament it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:8-13">ver. 8-13</A>.

 III. They are directed to look up to God in their lamentations, and to
 humble themselves before him,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 The word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.
 &nbsp; 2 Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of
 the land. Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of
 your fathers?
 &nbsp; 3 Tell ye your children of it, and <I>let</I> your children <I>tell</I>
 their children, and their children another generation.
 &nbsp; 4 That which the palmer-worm hath left hath the locust eaten;
 and that which the locust hath left hath the canker-worm eaten;
 and that which the canker-worm hath left hath the caterpillar
 eaten.
 &nbsp; 5 Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of
 wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.
 &nbsp; 6 For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without
 number, whose teeth <I>are</I> the teeth of a lion, and he hath the
 cheek teeth of a great lion.
 &nbsp; 7 He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath
 made it clean bare, and cast <I>it</I> away; the branches thereof are
 made white.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is a foolish fancy which some of the Jews have, that this Joel the 
 prophet was the same with that Joel who was the son of Samuel 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:2">1 Sam. viii. 2</A>);

 yet one of their rabbin very gravely undertakes to show why Samuel is
 here called <I>Pethuel.</I> This Joel was long after that. He here 
 speaks of a sad and sore judgment which was now brought, or to be 
 brought, upon Judah, for their sins. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The greatness of the judgment, expressed here in two things:--

 1. It was such as could not be paralleled in the ages that were past,
 in history, or in the memory of any living,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The <I>old men</I> are appealed to, who could remember what had 
 happened long ago; nay, and <I>all the inhabitants of the land</I> are 
 called on to testify, if they could any of them remember the like. Let 
 them go further than any man's memory, and <I>prepare themselves for 
 the search of their fathers</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:8">Job viii. 8</A>),

 and they would not find an account of the like in any record. Note,
 Those that outdo their predecessors in sin may justly expect to fall 
 under greater and sorer judgments than any of their predecessors knew. 
 
 2. It was such as would not be forgotten in the ages to come

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>Tell you your children of it;</I> let them know what dismal tokens 
 of the wrath of God you have been under, that they make take warning, 
 and may learn obedience by the things which you have suffered, for it 
 is designed for warning to them also. Yea, let <I>your children tell 
 their children, and their children another generation;</I> let them 
 tell it not only as a strange thing, which may serve for matter of 
 talk" (as such uncommon accidents are records in our almanacs--It is so 
 long since the plague, and fire--so long since the great frost, and the 
 great wind), "but let them tell it to <I>teach their children</I> to 
 stand in awe of God and of his judgments, and to tremble before him." 
 Note, We ought to transmit to posterity the memorial of God's judgments 
 as well as of his mercies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The judgment itself; it is an invasion of the country of Judea by a 
 great army. Many interpreters both ancient and modern understand it of 
 armies of men, the forces of the Assyrians, which, under Sennacherib, 
 <I>took all the defenced cities of Judah,</I> and then, no doubt, made 
 havoc of the country and destroyed the products of it: nay, some make 
 the four sorts of animals here names 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)

 to signify the four monarchies which, in their turns, were oppressive 
 to the people of the Jews, one destroying what had escaped the fury of 
 the other. Many of the Jewish expositors think it is a parabolic 
 expression of the coming of enemies, and their multitude, to lay all 
 waste. So the Chaldee paraphrast mentions these animals 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 but afterwards

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:25"><I>ch.</I> ii. 25</A>)
 
 puts instead of them, <I>Nations, peoples, tongues, languages,
 potentates,</I> and <I>revenging kingdoms.</I> But it seems much rather 
 to be understood literally of armies of insects coming upon the land 
 and eating up the fruits of it. Locusts were one of the plagues of 
 Egypt. Of them it is said, There never were any like them, nor should 
 be 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:14">Exod. x. 14</A>),

 none such as those in Egypt, none such as these in Judah--none like
 those locusts for bigness, none like these for multitude and the 
 mischief they did. The plague of locusts in Egypt lasted but for a few
 days; this seems to have continued for four years successively (as some 
 think), because here are four sorts of insects mentioned

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 one destroying what the other left; but others think they came all in 
 one year. We are not told, in the history of the Old Testament, when 
 this happened, but we are sure that no word of God fell to the ground; 
 and, though a devastation by these insects is primarily intended here, 
 yet it is expressed in such a language as is very applicable to the 
 destruction of the country by a foreign enemy invading it, because, if 
 the people were not humbled and reformed by that less judgment which 
 devoured the land, God would send this greater upon them, which would 
 devour the inhabitants; and by the description of that they are bidden 
 to take it for a warning. If this nation of worms do not subdue them, 
 another nation shall come to ruin them. Observe,

 1. What these animals are that are sent against them--<I>locusts</I>
 and <I>caterpillars, palmer-worms</I> and <I>canker-worms,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 We cannot now describe how these differed one from another; they were 
 all little insects, any one of them despicable, and which a man might 
 easily crush with his foot or with his finger; but when they came in 
 vast swarms, or shoals, they were very formidable and ate up all before 
 them. Note, God is Lord of hosts, has all creatures at his command, 
 and, when he pleases, can humble and mortify a proud and rebellious 
 people by the weakest and most contemptible creatures. Man is said to 
 be a worm; and by this it appears that he is <I>less than a worm,</I> 
 for, when God pleases, worms are too hard for him, plunder his country, 
 eat up that for which he laboured, destroy the forage, and cut off the 
 subsistence of a potent nation. The weaker the instrument is that God 
 employs the more is his power magnified. 

 2. What fury and force they came with. They are here called a
 <I>nation</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 because they are embodied, and act by consent, and as it were with a 
 common design; for, though <I>the locusts have no king, yet they go 
 forth all of them by bands</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:27">Prov. xxx. 27</A>),

 and it is there mentioned as an instance of their <I>wisdom.</I> It is 
 prudence for those that are weak severally to unite and act jointly.
 They are <I>strong,</I> for they are <I>without number.</I> The 
 <I>small dust of the balance</I> is light, and easily blown away, but a 
 heap of dust is weighty; so a worm can do little (yet one worm served 
 to destroy Jonah's gourd), but numbers of them can do wonders. They are 
 said to have <I>teeth of a lion,</I> of a <I>great lion,</I> because of 
 the great and terrible execution they do. Note, Locusts become as lions 
 when they come armed with a divine commission. We read of the locusts
 out of the bottomless pit, that <I>their teeth were as the teeth of 
 lions,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+9:8">Rev. ix. 8</A>.

 3. What mischief they do. They <I>eat up</I> all before them
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);
 
 what one leaves the other devours; they destroy not only the grass and 
 corn, but the trees 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 The <I>vine is laid waste.</I> There vermin eat the leaves which should 
 be a shelter to the fruit while it ripens, and so that also perishes 
 and comes to nothing. They eat the very bark of the fig-tree, and so
 kill it. Thus the <I>fig-tree does not blossom,</I> nor is there 
 <I>fruit in the vine.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A call to the drunkards to lament this judgment 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Awake and weep, all you drinkers of wine.</I> This intimates, 

 1. That they should suffer very sensibly by this calamity. It should
 touch them in a tender part; the <I>new wine</I> which they loved so 
 well should be <I>cut off from their mouth.</I> Note, It is just with 
 God to take away those comforts which are abused to luxury and excess, 
 to <I>recover</I> the <I>corn and wine</I> which are <I>prepared</I> 
 for Baal, which are made the food and fuel of a base lust. And to them 
 judgments of that kind are most grievous. The more men place their 
 happiness in the gratification of sense the more pressing temporal 
 afflictions are upon them. The drinkers of water need not to care when 
 the vine was laid waste; they could live as well without it as they had 
 done; it was no trouble to the Nazarites. But the <I>drinkers of 
 wine</I> will <I>weep and howl.</I> The more delights we make necessary 
 to our satisfaction the more we expose ourselves to trouble and 
 disappointment. 

 2. It intimates that they had been very senseless and stupid under the
 former tokens of God's displeasure; and therefore they are here called 
 to <I>awake and weep.</I> Those that will not be roused out of their 
 security by the word of God shall be roused by his rod; those that will 
 not be startled by judgments at a distance shall be themselves arrested 
 by them; and when they are going to partake of the forbidden fruit a 
 prohibition of another nature shall come <I>between the cup and the 
 lip,</I> and <I>cut off the wine from their mouth.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8 Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of
 her youth.
 &nbsp; 9 The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the
 house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; the priests, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s ministers, mourn.
 &nbsp; 10 The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is
 wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.
 &nbsp; 11 Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for
 the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is
 perished.
 &nbsp; 12 The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the
 pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, <I>even</I>
 all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is withered
 away from the sons of men.
 &nbsp; 13 Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers
 of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of
 my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is
 withholden from the house of your God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The judgment is here described as very lamentable, and such as all 
 sorts of people should share in; it shall not only rob the drunkards of 
 their pleasure (if that were the worst of it, it might be the better 
 borne), but it shall deprive others of their necessary subsistence, who 
 are therefore called to lament 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 as a virgin laments the death of her lover to whom she was espoused, 
 but not completely married, yet so that he was in effect her husband, 
 or as a young woman lately married, from whom the <I>husband of her 
 youth,</I> her young husband, or the husband to whom she was married 
 when she was young, is suddenly taken away by death. Between a 
 new-married couple that are young, that married for love, and that are 
 every way amiable and agreeable to each other, there is great fondness, 
 and consequently great grief if either be taken away. Such lamentation 
 shall there be for the loss of their corn and wine. Note, The more we 
 are wedded to our creature-comforts that harder it is to part with 
 them. See that parallel place,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:10-12">Isa. xxxii. 10-12</A>.

 Two sorts of people are here brought in, as concerned to lament this
 devastation, countrymen and clergymen.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Let the husbandmen and vine-dressers lament, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Let them be ashamed of the care and pains they have taken about their 
 vineyards, for it will be all labour lost, and they shall gain no 
 advantage by it; they shall see the fruit of their labour eaten up 
 before their eyes, and shall not be able to save any of it. Note, Those 
 who labour only <I>for the meat that perishes</I> will, sooner or 
 later, be ashamed of their labour. The <I>vine-dressers</I> will then 
 express their extreme grief by <I>howling,</I> when they see their 
 vineyards stripped of leaves and fruit, and the vines withered, so that 
 nothing is to be had or hoped for from them, wherewith they might pay 
 their rent and maintain their families. The destruction is particularly 
 described here: <I>The field is laid waste</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>).;

 all is consumed that is produced; <I>the land mourns;</I> the ground
 has a melancholy aspect, and looks ruefully; all the inhabitants of the
 land are in tears for what they have lost, are in fear of perishing for
 want, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:4,Jer+4:28">Isa. xxiv. 4; Jer. iv. 28</A>.

 "The <I>corn,</I> the bread-corn, which is the staff of life, is
 <I>wasted;</I> the <I>new wine,</I> which should be brought into the 
 cellars for a supply when the old is drunk, is <I>dried up,</I> is 
 <I>ashamed</I> of having promised so fair what it is not now able to 
 perform; the oil <I>languishes,</I> or is <I>diminished,</I> because 
 (as the Chaldee renders it) <I>the olives have fallen off.</I>" The 
 people were not thankful to God as they should have been for the 
 <I>bread that strengthens man's heart,</I> the <I>wine</I> that 
 <I>makes glad the heart,</I> and the <I>oil that makes the face to 
 shine</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:14,15">Ps. civ. 14, 15</A>);

 and therefore they are justly brought to lament the loss and want of
 them, of all the products of the earth, which God had given either for 
 necessity or for delight (this is repeated,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>)--

 the <I>wheat and barley,</I> the two principal grains bread was then 
 made of, wheat for the rich and barley for the poor, so that the rich 
 and poor meet together in the calamity. The trees are destroyed, not 
 only the <I>vine and the fig-tree</I> (as before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 which were more useful and necessary, but other trees also that were 
 for delight--the <I>pomegranate, palm-tree,</I> and <I>apple-tree,</I> 
 yea, all the <I>trees of the field,</I> as well as those of the 
 orchard, timber-trees as well as fruit-trees. In short, all <I>the 
 harvest of the field has perished,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 And by this means <I>joy has withered away from the children of men</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);

 the <I>joy of harvest,</I> which is used to express great and general 
 joy, has come to nothing, is turned into shame, is turned into 
 lamentation. Note, The perishing of the harvest is the withering of the 
 joy of the children of men. Those that place their happiness in the 
 delights of the sense, when they are deprived of them, or in any way 
 disturbed in the enjoyment of them, lose all their joy; whereas the 
 children of God, who look upon the pleasures of sense with holy 
 indifference and contempt, and know what it is to make God their 
 hearts' delight, can rejoice in him as the <I>God of their 
 salvation</I> even when the <I>fig-tree does not blossom;</I> spiritual 
 joy is so far from withering then, that it flourishes more than ever, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:17,18">Hab. iii. 17, 18</A>.
 
 Let us see here,

 1. What perishing uncertain things all our creature-comforts are. We
 can never be sure of the continuance of them. Here the heavens had 
 given their rains in due season, the earth had yielded her strength, 
 and, when the appointed weeks of harvest were at hand, they saw no 
 reason to doubt but that they should have a very plentiful crop; yet 
 then they are invaded by these unthought-of enemies, that lay all 
 waste, and not by fire and sword. It is our wisdom not to lay up our 
 treasure in those things which are liable to so many untoward 
 accidents. 

 2. See what need we have to live in continual dependence upon God and
 his providence, for our own hands are not sufficient for us. When we 
 see the <I>full corn in the ear,</I> and think we are sure of it--nay, 
 when we have <I>brought it home,</I> if <I>he blow upon it,</I> nay, if 
 he do not bless it, we are not likely to have any good of it. 

 3. See what ruinous work sin makes. A paradise is turned into a
 wilderness, a fruitful land, the most fruitful land upon earth, <I>into 
 barrenness,</I> for the <I>iniquity of those that dwelt 
 therein.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Let the priests, the Lord's ministers, lament, for they share 
 deeply in the calamity: <I>Gird yourselves</I> with sackcloth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);
 
 nay, they <I>do mourn,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Observe, The priests are called the <I>ministers of the altar,</I> for 
 on that they attended, and the <I>ministers of the Lord</I> (of <I>my 
 God,</I> says the prophet), for in attending on the altar they served 
 him, did is work, and did him honour. Note, Those that are employed in 
 holy things are therein God's ministers, and on him they attend. The 
 ministers of the altar used to rejoice before the Lord, and to spend 
 their time very much in singing; but now they must <I>lament and 
 howl,</I> for the <I>meat-offering</I> and <I>drink-offering</I> were 
 <I>cut off from the house of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),
 
 and the same again
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 <I>from the house of your God.</I> "He is your God in a particular 
 manner; you are in a nearer relation to him than other Israelites are; 
 and therefore it is expected that you should be more concerned than 
 others for that which is a hindrance to the service of his sanctuary." 
 It is intimated, 

 1. That the people, as long as they had the fruits of the earth brought
 in in their season, presented to the Lord his dues out of them, and 
 brought the offerings to the altar and tithes to those that served at 
 the altar. Note, A people may be filling up the measure of their 
 iniquity apace, and yet may keep up a course of external performances 
 in religion. 

 2. That, when the meat and drink failed, the meat-offering and
 drink-offering failed of course; and this was the sorest instance of 
 the calamity. Note, As far as any public trouble is an obstruction to 
 the course of religion it is to be upon that account, more than any 
 other, sadly lamented, especially by the priests, the Lord's ministers.
 As far as poverty occasions the decay of piety and the neglect of 
 divine offices, and starves the cause of religion among a people, it is 
 indeed a sore judgment. When the famine prevailed God could not have 
 his sacrifices, nor could the priests have their maintenance; and 
 therefore let <I>the Lord's ministers mourn.</I></P>

 &nbsp; 19 O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the
 pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the
 trees of the field.
 &nbsp; 20 The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers
 of waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures
 of the wilderness.

 We have observed abundance of tears shed for the destruction of the 
 fruits of the earth by the locusts; now here we have those tears turned 
 into the right channel, that of repentance and humiliation before God. 
 The judgment was very heavy, and here they are directed to own the hand 
 of God in it, his <I>mighty hand,</I> and to <I>humble themselves</I> 
 under it. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A proclamation issued out for a general fast. The priests are 
 ordered to appoint one; they must not only mourn themselves, but they 
 must call upon others to mourn too: "<I>Sanctify a fast;</I> let some 
 time be set apart from all worldly business to be spent in the 
 exercises of religion, in the expressions of repentance and other 
 extraordinary instances of devotion." Note, Under public judgments 
 there ought to be public humiliations; for by them the <I>Lord God 
 calls to weeping and mourning.</I> With all the marks of sorrow and 
 shame sin must be confessed and bewailed, the righteous of God must be 
 acknowledged, and his favour implored. Observe what is to be done by a 
 nation at such a time. 

 1. A day is to be appointed for this purpose, a <I>day of restraint</I>
 (so the margin reads it), a day in which people must be restrained from 
 their other ordinary business (that they may more closely attend God's 
 service), and from all bodily refreshments; for, 

 2. It must be a <I>fast,</I> a religious abstaining from meat and 
 drink, further than is of absolute necessity. The king of Nineveh 
 appointed a fast, in which they were to <I>taste nothing,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+3:7">Jonah iii. 7</A>.

 Hereby we own ourselves unworthy of our necessary food, and that we
 have forfeited it and deserve to be wholly deprived of it, we punish 
 ourselves and mortify the body, which has been the occasion of sin, we 
 keep it in a frame fit to serve the soul in serving God, and, by the 
 appetite's craving food, the desires of the soul towards that which is 
 better than life, and all the supports of it, are excited. This was in 
 a special manner seasonable now that God was depriving them of their 
 <I>meat and drink;</I> for hereby they accommodated themselves to the 
 affliction they were under. When God says, <I>You shall fast,</I> it is 
 time to say, <I>We will fast.</I>

 3. There must be a solemn assembly. The <I>elders</I> and the
 <I>people,</I> magistrates and subjects, must be <I>gathered 
 together,</I> even <I>all the inhabitants of the land,</I> that God 
 might be honoured by their public humiliations, that they might thereby 
 take the more shame to themselves, and that they might excite and stir 
 up one another to the religious duties of the day. All had contributed 
 to the national guilt, all shared in the national calamity, and 
 therefore they must all join in the professions of repentance. 

 4. They must come together in the temple, <I>the house of the Lord</I>
 their <I>God,</I> because that was the house of prayer, and there they 
 might be hope to meet with God because it was the place which he had 
 <I>chosen to put his name there,</I> there they might hope to speed 
 because it was a type of Christ and his mediation. Thus they interested 
 themselves in Solomon's prayer for the acceptance of all the requests 
 that should be put up in or towards this house, in which their present 
 case was particularly mentioned. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+7:37">1 Kings vii. 37</A>,

 <I>If there be locust, if there be caterpillar.</I>

 5. They must <I>sanctify</I> this fast, must observe it in a religious
 manner, with sincere devotion. What is a fast worth if it be not
 sanctified? 

 6. They must <I>cry unto the Lord.</I> To him they must make their
 complaint and offer up their supplication. When we cry in our 
 affliction we must <I>cry to the Lord;</I> this is <I>fasting to 
 him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+7:5">Zech. vii. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Some considerations suggested to induce them to proclaim this fast 
 and to observe it strictly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God was beginning a controversy with them. It is time to <I>cry unto 
 the Lord,</I> for <I>the day of the Lord is at hand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Either they mean the continuance and consequences of this present 
 judgment which they now saw but breaking in upon them, or some greater 
 judgments which this was but a preface to. However it be, this they are 
 taught to make the matter of their lamentation: <I>Alas, for the day! 
 for the day of the Lord is at hand.</I> Therefore <I>cry to God.</I> 
 For, 

 (1.) "The day of his judgment is very near, it is <I>at hand;</I> it
 <I>will not slumber,</I> and therefore you should not. It is time to 
 fast and pray, for you have but a little time to turn yourselves in."

 (2.) It will be very terrible; there is no escaping it, no resisting
 it: <I>As a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.</I> See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+13:6">Isa. xiii. 6</A>.

 It is not a correction, but a destruction; and it comes from the hand,
 not of a weak creature, but <I>of the Almighty;</I> and <I>who 
 knows</I> (nay, who does not know) <I>the power of his anger?</I> 
 Whither should we go with our cries but to him from whom the judgment 
 we dread comes? There is no fleeing from him but by fleeing to him, no 
 escaping destruction from the Almighty but by making our submission and 
 supplication to the Almighty; this is <I>taking hold on his strength, 
 that we may make peace,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:5">Isa. xxvii. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They saw themselves already under the tokens of his displeasure. It 
 is time to fast and pray, for their distress is very great, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 (1.) Let them look into their own houses, and was no plenty there, as 
 used to be. Those who kept a good table were now obliged to retrench: 
 <I>Is not the meat cut off before our eyes?</I> If, when God's hand is 
 lifted up, men <I>will not see,</I> when his hand is laid on <I>they 
 shall see.</I> Is not the meat many a time cut off before our eyes? Let 
 us then labour for that spiritual meat which is not before our eyes, 
 and which cannot be cut off. 

 (2.) Let them look into God's house, and see the effects of the
 judgment there; joy and gladness were <I>cut off from the house of 
 God.</I> Note, The house of our God is the proper place of joy and 
 gladness; when David goes to the <I>altar of God,</I> it is to God 
 <I>my exceeding joy;</I> but when <I>joy and gladness</I> are <I>cut 
 off from God's house,</I> either by corruption of holy things or the 
 persecution of holy persons, when serious godly decays and love waxes 
 cold, then it time to cry to the Lord, time to cry, <I>Alas!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The prophet returns to describe the grievousness of the calamity, in 
 some particulars of it. Corn and cattle are the husbandman's staple 
 commodities; now here he is deprived of both. 

 (1.) The caterpillars have devoured the corn,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 The <I>garners,</I> which they used to fill with corn, <I>are laid 
 desolate,</I> and <I>the barns broken down,</I> because <I>the corn has 
 withered,</I> and the owners think it not worth while to be at the 
 charge of repairing them when they have nothing to put in them, nor are 
 likely to have any thing; for <I>the seed it rotten under the 
 clods,</I> either through too much rain or (which was the more common 
 case in Canaan) for want of rain, or perhaps some insects under ground 
 ate it up. When one crop fails the husband man hopes the next may make 
 it up; but here they despair of that, the seedness being as bad as the 
 harvest. 
 
 (2.) The cattle perish too for want of grass
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>How do the beasts groan!</I> This the prophet takes notice of, that 
 the people might be affected with it and lay to heart the judgment. The 
 groans of the cattle should soften their hard and impenitent hearts.
 <I>The herds of cattle,</I> the large cattle (black cattle we call 
 them), <I>are perplexed;</I> nay, even <I>the flocks of sheep,</I> 
 which will live upon a common and be content with very short grass, 
 <I>are made desolate.</I> See here the inferior creatures suffering for 
 our transgression, and groaning under the double burden of being 
 serviceable to the sin of man and subject to the curse of God for it.
 <I>Cursed is the ground for thy sake.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The prophet stirs them up to cry to God, with the consideration of 
 the examples given them for it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His own example 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>O Lord! to thee will I cry.</I> He would not put them upon doing 
 that which he would not resolve to do himself; nay, whether they would 
 do it or no, he would. Note, If God's ministers cannot prevail to 
 affect others with the discoveries of divine wrath, yet they ought to 
 be themselves affected with them; if they cannot bring others to cry to 
 God, yet they themselves be much in prayer. In time of trouble we must 
 not only pray, but cry, must be fervent and importunate in prayer; and 
 to God, from whom both the destruction is and the salvation must be, 
 ought our cry to be always directed. That which engaged him <I>to cry 
 to God</I> was, not so much any personal affliction, as the national 
 calamity: The <I>fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness,</I> 
 which seems to be meant of some parching scorching heat of the sun, 
 which was as fire to the fruits of the earth; it consumed them all. 
 Note, When God <I>calls to contend by fire</I> it concerns those that 
 have any interest in heaven to cry mightily to him for relief. See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:2,Am+7:4,5">Num. xi. 2; Amos vii. 4, 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The example of the inferior creatures: "<I>The beasts of the 
 field</I> do not only <I>groan,</I> but <I>cry unto thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 
 They appeal to thy pity, according to their capacity, and as if, though 
 they are not capable of a rational and revealed religion, yet they had 
 something of dependence upon God by natural instinct." At least, when 
 they groan by reason of their calamity, he is pleased to interpret it 
 as if they cried to him; much more will he put a favourable 
 construction upon the groanings of his own children, though sometimes
 so feeble that they <I>cannot be uttered,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:26">Rom. viii. 26</A>.

 The beasts are here said to <I>cry unto God,</I> as from him the
 <I>lions seek their meat</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:21">Ps. civ. 21</A>)

 and the young <I>ravens,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:41">Job xxxviii. 41</A>.

 The complaints of the brute-creatures here are for want of water
 (<I>The rivers are dried up,</I> through the excessive heat), and for 
 want of grass, for the <I>fire has devoured the pastures of the 
 wilderness.</I> And what better are those than beasts who never cry to 
 God but for corn and wine, and complain of nothing but the want of 
 delight of sense? Yet their crying to God in those cases shames the 
 stupidity of those who cry not to God in any case.</P>
