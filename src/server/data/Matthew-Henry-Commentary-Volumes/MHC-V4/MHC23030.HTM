 The prophecy of this chapter seems to relate (as that in the foregoing 
 chapter) to the approaching danger of Jerusalem and desolations of
 Judah by Sennacherib's invasion. Here is, 

 I. A just reproof to those who, in that distress, trusted to the
 Egyptians for help, and were all in a hurry to fetch succours from Egypt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 II. A terrible threatening against those who slighted the good advice
 which God by his prophets gave them for the repose of their minds in 
 that distress, assuring them that whatever became of others the 
 judgment would certainly overtake them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:8-17">ver. 8-17</A>.

 III. A gracious promise to those who trusted in God, that they should
 not only see through the trouble, but should see happy days after it,
 times of joy and reformation, plenty of the means of grace, and
 therewith plenty of outward good things and increasing joys and
 triumphs 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:18-26">ver. 18-26</A>),

 and many of these promises are very applicable to gospel grace.

 IV. A prophecy of the total rout and ruin of the Assyrian army, which
 should be an occasion of great joy and an introduction to those happy
 times,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Woe to the rebellious children, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that take
 counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not
 of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin:
 &nbsp; 2  That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my
 mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and
 to trust in the shadow of Egypt!
 &nbsp; 3  Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and
 the trust in the shadow of Egypt <I>your</I> confusion.
 &nbsp; 4  For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to
 Hanes.
 &nbsp; 5  They were all ashamed of a people <I>that</I> could not profit
 them, nor be a help nor profit, but a shame, and also a
 reproach.
 &nbsp; 6  The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of
 trouble and anguish, from whence <I>come</I> the young and old lion,
 the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches
 upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the
 bunches of camels, to a people <I>that</I> shall not profit <I>them.</I>
 &nbsp; 7  For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose:
 therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength <I>is</I> to
 sit still.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It was often the fault and folly of the people of the Jews that, when 
 they were insulted by their neighbours on one side, they sought for 
 succour from their neighbours on the other side, instead of looking up 
 to God and putting their confidence in him. Against the Israelites
 they sought to the Syrians, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+16:2,3">2 Chron. xvi. 2, 3</A>.

 Against the Syrians they sought to the Assyrians, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:7">2 Kings xvi. 7</A>.

 Against the Assyrians they here sought to the Egyptians, and Rabshakeh
 upbraided them with so doing,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:21">2 Kings xviii. 21</A>.
 
 Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How this sin of theirs is described, and what there was in it that 
 was provoking to God. When they saw themselves in danger and distress, 

 1. They would not consult God. They would do things of their own heads, 
 and not advise with God, though they had a ready and certain way of 
 doing it by Urim or prophets. They were so confident of the prudence of 
 their own measures that they thought it needless to consult the oracle; 
 nay, they were not willing to put it to that issue: "They <I>take 
 counsel</I> among themselves, and one from another; but they do not ask 
 counsel, much less will they take counsel, of me. They <I>cover with a 
 covering</I>" (they think to secure themselves with one shelter or 
 other, which may serve to cover them from the violence of the storm), 
 "<I>but not of my Spirit</I>" (not such as God by his Spirit, in the 
 mouth of his prophets, directed them to), "and therefore it will prove 
 too short a covering, and a refuge of lies." 

 2. They could not confide in God. They did not think it enough to have 
 God on their side, nor were they at all solicitous to make him their 
 friend, but they <I>strengthened themselves in the strength of 
 Pharaoh;</I> they thought him a powerful ally, and doubted not but to 
 be able to cope with the Assyrian while they had him for them. <I>The 
 shadow of Egypt</I> (and it was but a shadow) was the covering in which 
 they wrapped themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What was the evil of this sin. 

 1. It bespoke them <I>rebellious children;</I> and a <I>woe</I> is here
 denounced against them under that character, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 They were, in profession, God's children; but, not trusting in him, 
 they were justly stigmatized as rebellious; for, if we distrust God's 
 providence, we do in effect withdraw ourselves from our allegiance. 

 2. They added sin to sin. It was sin that brought them into distress;
 and then, instead of repenting, they <I>trespassed yet more against the 
 Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:22">2 Chron. xxviii. 22</A>.

 And those that had abused God's mercies to them, making them the fuel
 of their lusts, abused their afflictions too, making them an excuse for 
 their distrust of God; and so they make bad worse, and add sin to sin; 
 and those that do so, as they make their own chain heavy, so it is just 
 with God to make their plagues wonderful. Now that which aggravated 
 their sin was,

 (1.) That they took so much pains to secure the Egyptians for their 
 allies: <I>They walk to go down to Egypt,</I> travel up and down to 
 find an advantageous road thither; but they <I>have not asked at my 
 mouth,</I> never considered whether God would allow and approve of it 
 or no. 

 (2.) That they were at such a vast expense to do it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 They load <I>the beasts of the south</I> (horses fetched from Egypt, 
 which lay south from Judea) with their riches, fancying, as it is 
 common with people in a fright, that they were safer any where than 
 where they were. Or they sent their riches thither as bribes to 
 Pharaoh's courtiers, to engage them in their interests, or as pay for 
 their army. God would have helped them <I>gratis;</I> but, if they
 will have help from the Egyptians, they must pay dearly for it, and 
 they seem willing to do so. The riches that are so spent will turn to
 a bad account. They carried their effects to Egypt through a land (so
 it may be read) of trouble and anguish, that vast howling wilderness 
 which lay between Canaan and Egypt, <I>whence come the lion and fiery 
 serpent,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:15">Deut. viii. 15</A>.

 They would venture through that dangerous wilderness, to bring what
 they had to Egypt. Or it may be meant of Egypt itself, which had been 
 to Israel a house of bondage and therefore a land of trouble and 
 anguish, and which abounded in ravenous and venomous creatures. See 
 what dangers men run into that forsake God, and what dangers they will 
 run into in pursuance of their carnal confidences and their 
 expectations from the creature.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What would be the consequence of it. 

 1. The Egyptians would receive their ambassadors, would address them 
 very respectfully, and be willing to treat with them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>His princes were at Zoan,</I> at Pharaoh's court there, and had 
 their audience of the king, who encouraged them to depend upon his 
 friendship and the succours he would send them. But,

 2. They would not answer their expectation: They <I>could not profit 
 them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 For God says, <I>They shall not profit them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 and every creature is that to us (and no more) which he makes it to be.
 The forces they were to furnish them with could not be raised in time; 
 or, when they were raised, they were not fit for service, and they 
 would not venture any of their veteran troops in the expedition; or the 
 march was so long that they could not come up when they had occasion 
 for them; or the Egyptians would not be cordial to Israel, but would 
 secretly incline to the Assyrians, upon some account or other: <I>The 
 Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 They shall hinder and hurt, instead of helping. And therefore,

 3. These people, that were now so fond of the Egyptians, would at
 length be ashamed of them, and of all their expectations from them and 
 confidence in them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>The strength of Pharaoh,</I> which was your pride, <I>shall be your 
 shame;</I> all your neighbours will upbraid you, and you will upbraid 
 yourselves, with your folly in trusting to it. And the <I>shadow of 
 Egypt,</I> that <I>land shadowing with wings</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+18:1"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 1</A>),

 which was your confidence, shall be your confusion; it will not only
 disappoint you, and be the matter of your shame, but it will weaken all 
 your other supports, and be an occasion of mischief to you." God 
 afterwards threatens the ruin of Egypt for this very thing, because 
 they had dealt treacherously with Israel and <I>been a staff of a 
 reed</I> to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:6,7">Ezek. xxix. 6, 7</A>.

 The princes and ambassadors of Israel, who were so forward to court an
 alliance with them, when they come among them shall see so much of 
 their weakness, or rather of their baseness, that <I>they shall all be 
 ashamed of a people that could not be a help or profit to them,</I> but 
 a <I>shame and reproach,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 Those that trust in God, in his power, providence, and promise, are
 never made ashamed of their hope; but those that put confidence in any 
 creature will sooner or later find it a reproach to them. God is true, 
 and may be trusted, but every man a liar, and must be suspected. The 
 Creator is a rock of ages, the creature a broken reed. We cannot expect 
 too little from man nor too much from God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The use and application of all this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "<I>Therefore have I cried concerning this</I> matter, this project of 
 theirs. I have published it, that all might take notice of it. I have 
 pressed it as one in earnest. <I>Their strength is to sit still,</I> in 
 a humble dependence upon God and his goodness and a quiet submission to 
 his will, and not to wander about and put themselves to great trouble 
 to seek help from this and the other creature." If we sit still in a 
 day of distress, hoping and quietly waiting for the salvation of the 
 Lord, and using only lawful regular methods for our own preservation, 
 this will be the strength of our souls both for services and 
 sufferings, and it will engage divine strength for us. We weaken 
 ourselves, and provoke God to withdraw from us, when we make flesh our 
 arm, for then our hearts depart from the Lord. When we have tired 
 ourselves by seeking for help from creatures we shall find it the best 
 way of recruiting ourselves to repose in the Creator. <I>Here I am, let 
 him do with me as he pleases.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a
 book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever:
 &nbsp; 9  That this <I>is</I> a rebellious people, lying children, children
 <I>that</I> will not hear the law of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 &nbsp; 10  Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets,
 Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things,
 prophesy deceits:
 &nbsp; 11  Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause
 the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.
 &nbsp; 12  Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye
 despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and
 stay thereon:
 &nbsp; 13  Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to
 fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly
 at an instant.
 &nbsp; 14  And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel
 that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall
 not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the
 hearth, or to take water <I>withal</I> out of the pit.
 &nbsp; 15  For thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, the Holy One of Israel; In
 returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in
 confidence shall be your strength: and ye would not.
 &nbsp; 16  But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore
 shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall
 they that pursue you be swift.
 &nbsp; 17  One thousand <I>shall flee</I> at the rebuke of one; at the
 rebuke of five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon
 the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on a hill.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. The preface is very awful. The prophet must not only preach this, 
 but he must write it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 <I>write it in a table,</I> to be hung up and exposed to public view; 
 he must carefully <I>note it,</I> not in loose papers which might be 
 lost or torn, but <I>in a book,</I> to be preserved for posterity, 
 <I>in perpetuam rei memoriam--for a standing testimony</I> against this 
 wicked generation; let it remain not only to the next succeeding ages, 
 but for ever and ever, while the world stands; and so it shall, for the 
 book of the scriptures no doubt, shall continue, and be read, to the 
 end of time. Let it be written,

 1. To shame the men of the present age, who would not hear and heed it
 when it was spoken. Let it be written, that it may not be lost; their 
 children may profit by it, though they will not. 

 2. To justify God in the judgments he was about to ring upon them; 
 people will be tempted to think he was too hard upon them, and 
 over-severe, unless they know how very bad they were, how very 
 provoking, and what fair means God tried with them before he brought it 
 to this extremity. 

 3. For warning to others not to do as they did, lest they should fare
 as they fared. It is designed for admonition to those of the remotest 
 place and age, even those <I>upon whom the ends of the world have 
 come,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:11">1 Cor. x. 11</A>.

 It may be of use for God's ministers not only to preach, but to write;
 for that which is written remains.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The character given of the profane and wicked Jews is very sad. He 
 must, if he will draw them in their own colours, write this concerning 
 them (and we are sure he does not bear false witness against them, nor 
 make them worse than they were, for the judgment of God is according to 
 truth), <I>That this is a rebellious people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 The Jews were, for aught we know, the only professing people God had
 then in the world, and yet many of them were a rebellious people.

 1. They rebelled against their own convictions and covenants: "They are 
 <I>lying children,</I> that will not stand to what they say, that 
 promise fair, but perform nothing;" when he took them into covenant 
 with himself he said of them, <I>Surely they are my people, children 
 that will not lie</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:8"><I>ch.</I> lxiii. 8</A>);

 but they proved otherwise. 

 2. They rebelled against the divine authority: "They are <I>children 
 that will not hear the law of the Lord,</I> nor heed it, but will do as 
 they have a mind, let God himself say what he will to the 
 contrary."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The charge drawn up against them is very high and the sentence 
 passed upon them very dreadful. Two things they here stand charged 
 with, and their doom is read for both, a fearful doom:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They forbade the prophets to speak to them in God's name, and to 
 deal faithfully with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) This their sin is described,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 They set themselves so violently against the prophets to hinder them
 from preaching, or at least from dealing plainly with them in their 
 preaching, did so banter them and browbeat them, that they did in 
 effect <I>say to the seers, See not.</I> They had the light, but they 
 loved darkness rather. It was their privilege that they had seers among 
 them, but they did what they could to put out their eyes--that they had 
 prophets among them, but they did what they could to stop their mouths; 
 for they tormented them in their wicked ways, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:10">Rev. xi. 10</A>.

 Those that silence good ministers, and discountenance good preaching,
 are justly counted, and called, <I>rebels against God.</I> See what it 
 was in the prophets' preaching with which they found themselves 
 aggrieved.

 [1.] The prophets told them of their faults, and warned them of their 
 misery and danger by reason of sin, and they could not bear that. They 
 must speak to them smooth things, must flatter them in their sins, and 
 say that they did well, and there was no harm, no peril, in the course 
 of life they lived in. Let a thing be ever so right and true, if it be
 not smooth, they will not hear it. But if it be agreeable to the good 
 opinion they have of themselves, and will confirm them in that, though 
 it be ever so false and ever so great a cheat upon them, they will have 
 it prophesied to them. Those deserve to be deceived that desire to be 
 so. 

 [2.] The prophets stopped them in their sinful pursuits, and stood in 
 their way like the angel in Balaam's road, with the sword of God's 
 wrath drawn in their hand; so that they could not proceed without 
 terror. And this they took as a great insult. When they went on 
 frowardly in the way of their hearts they said to the prophets, <I>"Get 
 you out of the way, turn aside out of the paths.</I> What do you do in 
 our way? Cannot you let us alone to do as we please?" Those have their 
 hearts fully set in them to do evil that bid their faithful monitors to 
 stand out of their way. <I>Forbear, why shouldst thou be smitten?</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:16">2 Chron. xxv. 16</A>.

 [3.] The prophets were continually telling them of the Holy One of 
 Israel, what an enemy he is to sin ad how severely he will reckon with 
 sinners; and this they could not endure to hear of. Both the thing 
 itself and the expression of it were too serious for them; and 
 therefore, if the prophets will speak to them, they will make it their 
 bargain that they shall not call God <I>the Holy One of Israel;</I> for 
 God's holiness is that attribute which wicked people most of all dread. 
 Let us no more be troubled with that state-preface (as Mr. White calls 
 it) to your impertinent harangues. Those have reason to fear perishing 
 in their sins that cannot bear to be frightened out of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Now what is the doom passed upon them for this? We have it, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 [1.] Who it is that gives judgment upon them: <I>Thus saith the Holy
 One of Israel.</I> That title of God which they particularly excepted 
 against the prophet makes use of. Faithful ministers will not be driven 
 from using such expressions as are proper to awaken sinners, though 
 they be displeasing. We must tell men that God is the <I>Holy One of 
 Israel,</I> and so they shall find him, whether they will hear or 
 whether they will forbear. 

 [2.] What the ground of the judgment is: <I>Because they despise this 
 word</I>--wither, in general, every word that the prophets said to 
 them, or this word in particular, which declares God to be <I>the Holy 
 One of Israel:</I> "they despise this, and will neither make it their 
 fear, to stand in awe of it, nor make it their hope, to put any 
 confidence in it; but, rather than they will be beholden to <I>the Holy 
 One of Israel,</I> they will <I>trust in oppression and 
 perverseness,</I> in the wealth they have got and the interest they 
 have made by fraud and violence, or in the sinful methods they have 
 taken for their own security, in contradiction to God and his will. On 
 these they lean, and therefore it is just that they should fall." 

 [3.] What the judgment is that is passed upon them: "<I>This iniquity 
 shall be to you as a breach ready to fall.</I> This confidence of yours 
 will be like a house built upon the sand, which will fall in the storm 
 and bury the builder in the ruins of it. Your contempt of that word of
 God which you might build upon will make every thing else you trust 
 like a wall that bulges out, which, if any weight be laid upon it, 
 comes down, nay, which often sinks with its own weight." The ruin they 
 would hereby bring upon themselves should be, <I>First,</I> A 
 surprising ruin: <I>The breaking shall come suddenly, at an 
 instant,</I> when they do not expect it, which will make it the more 
 frightful, and when they are not prepared or provided for it, which 
 will make it the more fatal. <I>Secondly,</I> An utter ruin, universal
 and irreparable: "Your and all your confidences shall be not only weak 
 as the potter's clay

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:16"><I>ch.</I> xxix. 16</A>),
 
 but <I>broken to pieces as the potter's vessel.</I> He that has the rod
 of iron shall break it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:9">Ps. ii. 9</A>)

 and he shall not spare, shall not have any regard to it, nor be in care
 to preserve or keep whole any part of it. But, when once it is broken 
 so as to be unfit for use, let it be dashed, let it be crushed, all to 
 pieces, so that there may not remain one <I>sherd</I> big enough <I>to 
 take up</I> a little <I>fire or water</I>"--two things we have daily 
 need of, and which poor people commonly fetch in a piece of a broken 
 pitcher. They shall not only be as a <I>bowing wall</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:3">Ps. lxii. 3</A>),

 but as a broken mug or glass, which is good for nothing, nor can ever
 be made whole again.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They slighted the gracious directions God gave them, not only how to 
 secure themselves and make themselves safe, but how to compose 
 themselves and make themselves easy; they would take their own way, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:15-17"><I>v.</I> 15-17</A>.
 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The method God put them into for salvation and strength. The God 
 that knew them, and knew what was proper for them, and desired their 
 welfare, gave them this prescription; and it is recommended to us all. 
 
 [1.] Would we be saved from the evil of every calamity, guarded against 
 the temptation of it and secured from the curse of it, which are the 
 only evil things in it? It must be <I>in returning and rest,</I> in 
 returning to God and reposing in him as our rest. Let us return from 
 our evil ways, into which we have gone aside, and rest and settle in 
 the way of God and duty, and that is the way to be saved. "Return from 
 this project of going down to Egypt, and rest satisfied in the will of 
 God, and then you may trust him with your safety. <I>In returning</I> 
 (in the thorough reformation of your hearts and lives) <I>and in 
 rest</I> (in an entire submission of your souls to God and a 
 complacency in him) <I>you shall be saved.</I>" 

 [2.] Would we be strengthened to do what is required of us and to bear 
 what is laid upon us? It must be <I>in quietness and in confidence;</I> 
 we must keep our spirits calm and sedate by a continual dependence upon 
 God, and his power and goodness; we must retire into ourselves with a 
 holy quietness, suppressing all turbulent and tumultuous passions, and 
 keeping the peace in our own minds. And we must rely upon God with a 
 holy confidence that he can do what he will and will do what is best 
 for his people. And this will be our strength; it will inspire us with 
 such a holy fortitude as will carry us with ease and courage through 
 all the difficulties we may meet with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The contempt they put upon this prescription; they would not take
 God's counsel, though it was so much for their own good. And justly 
 will those die of their disease that will not take God for their 
 physician. We are certainly enemies to ourselves if we will not be 
 subjects to him. They would not so much as try the method prescribed: 
 "<I>But you said, No</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 we will not compose ourselves, for <I>we will flee upon horses</I> and 
 <I>we will ride upon the swift;</I> we will hurry hither and thither to 
 fetch in foreign aids." They think themselves wiser than God, and that 
 they know what is good for themselves better than he does. When 
 Sennacherib took all the fenced cities of Judah, those rebellious 
 children would not be persuaded to sit still and patiently to expect 
 God's appearing for them, as he did wonderfully at last; but they would 
 shift for their own safety, and thereby they exposed themselves to so 
 much the more danger.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The sentence passed upon them for this. Their sin shall be their 
 punishment: "You will flee, and therefore <I>you shall flee;</I> you 
 will be upon the full speed, and therefore so shall those be that 
 pursue you." The dogs are most apt to run barking after him that rides 
 fast. The conquerors protected those that sat still, but pursued those 
 that made their escape; and so that very project by which they hoped to 
 save themselves was justly their ruin and the most guilty suffered 
 most. It is foretold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>,

 [1.] That they should be easily cut off; they should be so dispirited
 with their own fears, increased by their flight, that one of the enemy 
 should defeat a thousand of them, and five put an army to flight, which 
 could never be <I>unless their Rock had sold them</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:30">Deut. xxxii. 30</A>.

 [2.] That they should be generally cut off, and only here and there one 
 should escape alone in a solitary place, and be left for a spectacle 
 too, <I>as a beacon upon the top of a mountain,</I> a warning to others 
 to avoid the like sinful courses and carnal confidences.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  And therefore will the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> wait, that he may be gracious
 unto you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have
 mercy upon you: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> a God of judgment: blessed
 <I>are</I> all they that wait for him.
 &nbsp; 19  For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt
 weep no more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of
 thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee.
 &nbsp; 20  And <I>though</I> the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and
 the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed
 into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers:
 &nbsp; 21  And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This
 <I>is</I> the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and
 when ye turn to the left.
 &nbsp; 22  Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of
 silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt
 cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get
 thee hence.
 &nbsp; 23  Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow
 the ground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it
 shall be fat and plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle feed in
 large pastures.
 &nbsp; 24  The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground
 shall eat clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the
 shovel and with the fan.
 &nbsp; 25  And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every
 high hill, rivers <I>and</I> streams of waters in the day of the great
 slaughter, when the towers fall.
 &nbsp; 26  Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the
 sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of
 seven days, in the day that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> bindeth up the breach of his
 people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The closing words of the foregoing paragraph (<I>You shall be left as a 
 beacon upon a mountain</I>) some understand as a promise that a remnant 
 of them should be reserved as monuments of mercy; and here the prophet 
 tells them what good times should succeed these calamities. Or the 
 first words in this paragraph may be read by way of antithesis, 
 <I>Notwithstanding this, yet will the Lord wait that he may be 
 gracious.</I> The prophet, having shown that those who made Egypt their 
 confidence would be ashamed of it, here shows that those who sat still 
 and made God alone their confidence would have the comfort of it. It is 
 matter of comfort to the people of God, when the times are very bad, 
 that <I>all will be well yet,</I> well with those that fear God, when 
 we say to the wicked, <I>It shall be ill with you.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God will be gracious to them and will have mercy on them. This is 
 the foundation of all good. If we find favour with God, and he have 
 mercy upon us, we shall have comfort according to the time that we have 
 been afflicted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The mercy in store for them is very affectingly expressed. 

 (1.) "He will <I>wait to be gracious</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>);

 he will wait till you return to him and seek his face, and then he will 
 be ready to meet you with mercy. He will wait, that he may do it in the 
 best and fittest time, when it will be most for his glory, when it will 
 come to you with the most pleasing surprise. He will continually follow 
 you with his favours, and not let slip any opportunity of being 
 gracious to you."

 (2.) "He will stir up himself to deliver you, will be exalted, will be 
 <I>raised up out of his holy habitation</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:13">Zech. ii. 13</A>),

 that he may appear for you in more than ordinary instances of power and
 goodness; <I>and thus he will be exalted,</I> that is, he will glorify 
 his own name. This is what he aims at in having mercy on his people."

 (3.) <I>He will be very gracious</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 and this in answer to prayer, which makes his kindness doubly kind: 
 "<I>He will be gracious to thee, at the voice of thy cry,</I> the cry 
 of thy necessity, when that is most urgent--the cry of thy prayer, when 
 that is most fervent. <I>When he shall hear it,</I> there needs no
 more; at the first word <I>he will answer thee,</I> and say, <I>Here I 
 am.</I>" Herein he is very gracious indeed. In particular, 

 [1.] Those who were disturbed in the possession of their estates shall 
 again enjoy them quietly. When the danger is over <I>the people shall 
 dwell in Zion, at Jerusalem,</I> as they used to do; they shall dwell 
 safely, free from the fear of evil.

 [2.] Those who were all in tears shall have cause to rejoice, and shall 
 weep no more; and those who dwell in Zion, the holy city, will find 
 enough there to wipe away tears from their eyes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. This is grounded upon two great truths: 

 (1.) That <I>the Lord is a God of judgment;</I> he is both wise and 
 just in all the disposals of his providence, true to his word and 
 tender of his people. If he correct his children, it is <I>with 
 judgment</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:24">Jer. x. 24</A>),

 with moderation and discretion, considering their frame. We think we
 may safely refer ourselves to a man of judgment; and shall we not 
 commit our way to a God of judgment?

 (2.) That therefore all those are blessed who <I>wait for him,</I> who 
 not only wait on him with their prayers, but wait for him with their 
 hopes, who will not take any indirect course to extricate themselves 
 out of their straits, or anticipate their deliverance, but patiently 
 expect God's appearances for them in his own way and time. Because God 
 is infinitely wise, those are truly happy who refer their cause to 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They shall not again know the want of the means of grace, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.
 
 Here,

 1. It is supposed that they might be brought into straits and troubles 
 after this deliverance was wrought for them. It was promised 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),
 
 that they should <I>weep no more</I> and that God would be <I>gracious 
 to them;</I> and yet here it is taken for granted that God may give 
 them the <I>bread of adversity and the water of affliction,</I> 
 prisoners' fare 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+22:27">1 Kings xxii. 27</A>),

 coarse and sorry food, such as the poor use. When one trouble is over
 we know not how soon another may succeed; and we may have an interest 
 in the favour of God, and such consolations as are sufficient to 
 prohibit weeping, and yet may have bread of adversity given us to eat 
 and water of affliction to drink. Let us therefore not judge of love
 or hatred by what is before us.

 2. It is promised that their eyes should <I>see their teachers,</I> 
 that is, that they should have faithful teachers among them, and should 
 have hearts to regard them and not slight them as they had done; and 
 then they might the better be reconciled to the bread of adversity and 
 the water of affliction. It was a common saying among the old Puritans, 
 <I>Brown bread and the gospel are good fare.</I> A famine of bread is 
 not so great a judgment as a famine of the word of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+8:11,12">Amos viii. 11, 12</A>.
 
 It seems that their teachers had been removed into corners (probably
 being forced to shift for their safety in the reign of Ahaz), but it 
 shall be so no more. <I>Veritas non qu&aelig;rit angulos--Truth seeks 
 no corners for concealment.</I> But the teachers of truth may sometimes 
 be driven into corners for shelter; and it goes ill with the church 
 when it is so, when the woman with her crown of twelve stars is forced 
 to flee into the wilderness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:6">Rev. xii. 6</A>),

 when the prophets are <I>hidden by fifty in a cave,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:4">1 Kings xviii. 4</A>.

 But God will find a time to call the teachers out of their corners
 again, and to replace them in their solemn assemblies, which shall 
 <I>see their own teachers,</I> the <I>eyes of all the synagogue</I> 
 being fastened on them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:20">Luke iv. 20</A>.

 And it will be the more pleasing because of the restraint they have
 been for some time under, as light out of darkness, as life from the 
 dead. To all that love God and their own souls this return of faithful
 teachers out of their corners, especially with a promise that they 
 <I>shall not be removed into corners any more,</I> is the most 
 acceptable part of any deliverance, and has comfort enough in it to 
 sweeten even the bread of adversity and the water of affliction. But 
 this is not all:

 3. It is promised that they shall have the benefit, not only of the
 public ministry, but of private and particular admonition and advice 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 "<I>Thy ears shall hear a word behind thee,</I> calling after thee as a 
 man calls after a traveller that he sees going out of his road." 
 Observe,

 (1.) Whence this word shall come--from <I>behind thee,</I> from some 
 one whom thou dost not see, but who sees thee. "Thy eyes see thy 
 teachers; but this is a teacher out of sight, it is thy own conscience, 
 which shall now by the grace of God be awakened to do its office." 

 (2.) What the word shall be: "<I>This is the way, walk you in it.</I> 
 When thou art doubting, conscience shall direct thee to the way of 
 duty; when thou art dull and trifling, conscience shall quicken thee in 
 that way." As God has not left himself without witness, so he has not 
 left us without guides to show us our way. 

 (3.) The seasonableness of this word: It shall come <I>when you turn to 
 the right hand or to the left.</I> We are very apt to miss our way; 
 there are turnings on both hands, and those so tracked and seemingly 
 straight that they may easily be mistaken for the right way. There are
 right-hand and left-hand errors, extremes on each side virtue; the 
 tempter is busy courting us into the by-paths. It is happy then if by 
 the particular counsels of a faithful minister or friend, or the checks 
 of conscience and the strivings of God's Spirit, we be set right and 
 prevented from going wrong. 

 (4.) The success of this word: "It shall not only be spoken, but thy 
 ears shall hear it; whereas God has formerly <I>spoken once, yea, 
 twice,</I> and thou <I>hast not perceived it</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:14">Job xxxiii. 14</A>),

 now thou shalt listen attentively to these secret whispers, and hear
 them with an obedient ear." If God gives us not only the word, but the 
 hearing ear, not only the means of grace, but a heart to make a good 
 use of those means, we have reason to say, He is very gracious to us, 
 and reason to hope he has yet further mercy in store for us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They shall be cured of their idolatry, shall fall out with their 
 idols, and never be reconciled to them again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 The deliverance God shall work for them shall convince them that it is
 their interest, as well as duty, to serve him only; and they shall own 
 that, as their trouble was brought upon them for their idolatries, so 
 it was removed upon condition that they should not return to them. This 
 is also the good effect of their seeing their teachers and hearing the 
 word behind them; by this it shall appear that they are the better for 
 the means of grace they enjoy--they shall break off from their 
 best-beloved sin. Observe,

 1. How foolishly mad they had formerly been upon their idols, in the 
 day of their apostasy. Idolaters are said to be <I>mad upon their 
 idols</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:38">Jer. l. 38</A>),

 doatingly fond of them. They had <I>graven images of silver,</I> and
 <I>molten images of gold,</I> and, though gold needs no painting, they 
 had coverings and ornaments on these; they spared no cost in doing 
 honour to their idols.

 2. How wisely mad (if I may so speak) they now were at their idols, 
 what a holy indignation they conceived against them in the day of their 
 repentance. They not only degraded their images, but defaced them, not 
 only defaced them, but defiled them; they not only spoiled the shape of 
 them, but in a pious fury threw away the gold and silver they were made 
 of, though otherwise valuable and convertible to a good use. They could 
 not find in their hearts to make any vessel of honour of them. The rich 
 clothes wherewith their images were dressed up they cast away as a 
 filthy cloth which rendered those that touched it <I>unclean until the 
 evening,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+15:23">Lev. xv. 23</A>.

 Note, To all true penitents sin has become very odious; they loathe it,
 and loathe themselves because of it; they cast it away to the dunghill, 
 the fittest place for it, nay, to the cross, for they crucify the 
 flesh; their cry against it is, <I>Crucify it, crucify it.</I> They say 
 unto it, <I>Abi hinc in malam rem--Get thee hence.</I> They are 
 resolved never to harbour it any more. They put as far from as they can 
 all the occasions of sin and temptations to it, though they are as a 
 right eye or a right hand, and protest against it as Ephraim did

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:8">Hos. xiv. 8</A>),

 <I>What have I to do any more with idols?</I> Probably this was
 fulfilled in many particular persons, who, by the deliverance of 
 Jerusalem from Sennacherib's army, were convinced of the folly of their 
 idolatry and forsook it. It was fulfilled in the body of the Jewish 
 nation at their return from their captivity in Babylon, for they 
 abhorred idols ever after; and it is accomplished daily in the 
 conversion of souls, by the power of divine grace, from spiritual 
 idolatry to the fear and love of God. Those that join themselves to the 
 Lord must abandon every sin, and say unto it, <I>Get thee 
 hence.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. God will then give them plenty of all good things. When he gives 
 them their teachers, and they give him their hearts, so that they begin 
 to seek the kingdom of God and the righteousness thereof, <I>then all 
 other things shall be added to them</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:33">Matt. vi. 33</A>.

 And when the people are brought to praise God <I>then shall the earth
 yield her increase, and with it God, even our own God, shall bless 
 us,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+67:5,6">Ps. lxvii. 5, 6</A>.

 So it follows here: "When you shall have abandoned your idols, <I>then 
 shall God give the rain of your seed,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 When we return to God in a way of duty he will meet us with his
 favours.

 1. God will give you rain of your seed, rain to water the seed you sow, 
 just at the time that it calls for it, as much as it needs and no more.
 Observe, How man's industry and God's blessing concur to the good 
 things we enjoy relating to the life that now is: <I>Thou shalt sow the
 ground,</I> that is thy part, and then <I>God will give the rain of thy 
 seed,</I> that is his part. It is so in spiritual fruit; we must take 
 pains with our hearts and then wait on God for his grace. 

 2. The increase of the earth shall be rich and good, and every thing 
 the best of the kind; it shall be <I>fat and fat,</I> very fat and very 
 good, <I>fat and plenteous</I> (so we read it), good and enough of it. 
 Your land shall be Canaan indeed; it was remarkably so after the defeat 
 of Sennacherib, by the special blessing of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:30"><I>ch.</I> xxxvii. 30</A>.

 God would thus repair the losses they sustained by that devastation. 

 3. Not only the tillage, but the pasture-ground should be remarkably
 fruitful: <I>The cattle shall feed in large pastures;</I> those that
 are at grass shall have room enough, and the oxen and asses that are 
 kept up for use, to ear the ground, which must be the better fed for 
 their being worked, <I>shall eat clean provender.</I> The corn shall 
 not be given them in the chaff as usual, to make it go the further, but 
 they shall have good clean corn fit for man's use, being <I>winnowed 
 with the fan.</I> The brute-creatures shall share in the abundance; it 
 is fit they should, for they groan under the burden of the curse which 
 man's sin has brought upon the earth. 

 4. Even the tops of the mountains, that used to be barren, shall be so 
 well watered with the rain of heaven that there shall be <I>rivers and 
 streams</I> there, and running down thence to the valleys 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 and this <I>in the day of the great slaughter</I> that should be made 
 by the angel in the camp of the Assyrians, <I>when the towers</I> and 
 batteries they had erected for the carrying on of the siege of 
 Jerusalem, the army being slain, <I>should fall</I> of course. It is 
 probable that this was fulfilled in the letter of it, and that about 
 the same time that that army was cut off there were extraordinary rains 
 in mercy to the land.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The effect of all this should be extraordinary comfort and joy to 
 the people of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Light shall increase; that is, knowledge shall increase (when the
 prophecies are accomplished they shall be fully understood) or rather 
 triumph shall: the light of the joy that is sown for the righteous 
 shall now come up with a great increase. <I>The light of the moon shall 
 become as</I> bright and as strong as <I>that of the sun, and that of 
 the sun</I> shall increase proportionably and be <I>as the light of 
 seven days;</I> every one shall be much more cheerful and appear much 
 more pleasant than usual. There shall be a high spring-tide of joy in 
 Judah and Jerusalem, upon occasion of the ruin of the Assyrian army, 
 <I>when the Lord binds up the breach of his people,</I> not only saves 
 them from being further wounded, but heals the wounds that have been 
 given them by this invasion and makes up all their losses. The great 
 distress they were reduced to, their despair of relief, and the 
 suddenness of their deliverance, would much augment their joy. This is 
 not unfitly applied by many to the light which the gospel brought into 
 the world to those that sat in darkness, which has far exceeded the 
 Old-Testament light as that of the sun does that of the moon, and which 
 proclaims <I>healing to the broken-hearted, and the binding up of their 
 wounds.</I></P>

 which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall lay upon him, <I>it</I> shall be with tabrets and
 harps: and in battles of shaking will he fight with it.
 &nbsp; 33  For Tophet <I>is</I> ordained of old; yea, for the king it is
 prepared; he hath made <I>it</I> deep <I>and</I> large: the pile thereof
 <I>is</I> fire and much wood; the breath of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, like a stream of
 brimstone, doth kindle it.

 This terrible prediction of the ruin of the Assyrian army, though it is 
 a threatening to them, is part of the promise to the Israel of God, 
 that God would not only punish the Assyrians for the mischief they had 
 done to the Israel of God, but would disable and deter them from doing 
 the like again; and this prediction, which would now shortly be 
 accomplished, would ratify and confirm the foregoing promises, which 
 should be accomplished in the latter days. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God Almighty angry, and coming forth in anger against the Assyrians. 
 He is here introduced in all the power and all the terror of his wrath, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 <I>The name of Jehovah,</I> which the Assyrians disdain and set at a
 distance from them, as if they were out of its reach and it could do 
 them no harm, <I>behold, it comes from far.</I> A messenger in the name 
 of the Lord comes from as far off as heaven itself. He is a messenger 
 of wrath, <I>burning with his anger.</I> God's <I>lips are full of 
 indignation</I> at the blasphemy of Rabshakeh, who compared the God of 
 Israel with the gods of the heathen; <I>his tongue is as a devouring 
 fire,</I> for he can speak his proud enemies to ruin; his very breath 
 comes with as much force as an overflowing stream, and with it he shall 
 slay the wicked,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:4"><I>ch.</I> xi. 4</A>.

 He does not stifle or smother his resentments, as men do theirs when
 they are either causeless or impotent; but he <I>shall cause his 
 glorious voice to be heard</I> when he proclaims war with an enemy that 
 sets him at defiance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 He shall display <I>the indignation of his anger,</I> anger in the
 highest degree; it shall be as <I>the flame of a devouring fire,</I> 
 which carries and consumes all before it, with <I>lightning</I> or 
 dissipation, and with <I>tempest and hailstones,</I> all which are the 
 formidable phenomena of nature, and therefore expressive of the terror 
 of the Almighty God of nature.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The execution done by this anger of the Lord. Men are often angry 
 when they can only threaten and talk big; but when God causes his 
 glorious voice to be heard that shall not be all: he will <I>show the 
 lighting down of his arm</I> too, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 The operations of his providence shall accomplish the menaces of his
 word. Those that <I>would not see the lifting up of his arm</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:11"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 11</A>)

 shall feel the lighting down of it, and find, to their cost, that the
 burden thereof is heavy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 so heavy that they cannot bear it, nor bear up against it, but must
 unavoidably sink and be crushed under it. <I>Who knows the power of
 his anger</I> or imagines what an offended God can do? Five things are 
 here prepared for the execution:--

 1. Here is <I>an overflowing stream,</I> that <I>shall reach to the
 midst of the neck,</I> shall quite overwhelm the whole body of the 
 army, and Sennacherib only, the head of it, shall keep above water and 
 escape this stroke, while yet he is reserved for another in the house 
 of Nisroch his god. The Assyrian army had been to Judah <I>as an 
 overflowing stream, reaching even to the neck</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:7,8"><I>ch.</I> viii. 7, 8</A>),

 and now the breath of God's wrath will be so to it. 

 2. Here is <I>a sieve of vanity,</I> with which God would sift those 
 nations of which the Assyrian army was composed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 The great God can sift nations, for they are all before him as the
 small dust of the balance; he will sift them, not to gather out of them 
 any that should be preserved, but so as to shake them one against 
 another, put them into great consternation, and shake them all away at 
 last; for it is a sieve of vanity (which retains nothing) that they are 
 shaken with, and they are found all chaff.

 3. Here is <I>a bridle,</I> which God has in their jaws, to curb and
 restrain them from doing the mischief they would do, and to force and 
 constrain them to serve his purposes against their own will,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:7"><I>ch.</I> x. 7</A>.
 
 God particularly says of Sennacherib

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:29"><I>ch.</I> xxxvii. 29</A>)

 that he will put a hook in his nose and a bridle in his lips. It is a
 <I>bridle causing them to err,</I> forcing them to such methods as will 
 certainly be destructive to themselves and their interest and in which 
 they will be infatuated. God with a word guides his people into the 
 right way 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 but with a bridle he turns his enemies headlong upon their own ruin.

 4. Here is <I>a rod</I> and <I>a staff,</I> even <I>the voice of the 
 Lord,</I> his word giving orders concerning it, with which <I>the 
 Assyrian shall be beaten down,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 The Assyrian had been himself a rod in God's hand for the chastising of
 his people, and had smitten them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:5"><I>ch.</I> x. 5</A>.

 That was a transient rod; but against the Assyrian shall go forth <I>a
 grounded staff,</I> that shall give a steady blow, shall stick close to 
 him and strike home, so as to leave an impression upon him. It is a 
 staff with a foundation, founded upon the enemies' deserts and God's 
 determinate counsel. It is a consumption determined

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:23"><I>ch.</I> x. 23</A>),

 and therefore there is no escaping it, no getting out of the reach of
 it; it shall pass in every place where an Assyrian is found, and the 
 Lord shall <I>lay it upon him,</I> and cause it to rest,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 Such is the woeful case of those that persist in enmity to God: <I>the
 wrath of God abides on them.</I> 

 5. Here is <I>Tophet ordained</I> and <I>prepared</I> for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.
 
 The valley of the son of Hinnom, adjoining to Jerusalem, was called
 <I>Tophet.</I> In that valley, it is supposed, many of the Assyrian 
 regiments lay encamped, and were there slain by the destroying angel; 
 or there the bodies of those that were so slain were burned. Hezekiah 
 had <I>lately, and from yesterday</I> (so the word is) <I>ordained 
 it;</I> that is, say some, he had cleared it of the images that were 
 set up in it, to which they there burnt their children, and so prepared 
 it to be a receptacle for the dead bodies of their enemies, <I>for the 
 king of Assyria</I> (that is, for his army) <I>it is prepared,</I> and 
 there is fuel enough ready to burn them all; and they shall be consumed 
 as suddenly and effectually as if the fire were kept burning by a 
 continual stream of brimstone, for such the breath of the Lord, his 
 word and his wrath, will be to it. Now as the prophet, in the foregoing 
 promises, slides insensibly into the promises of gospel graces and 
 comforts, so here, in the threatening of the ruin of Sennacherib's 
 army, he points at the final and everlasting destruction of all 
 impenitent sinners. Our Saviour calls the future misery of the damned 
 <I>Gehenna,</I> in allusion to the valley of Hinnom, which gives some 
 countenance to the applying of this to that misery, as also that in the 
 Apocalypse it is so often called the <I>lake that burns with fire and 
 brimstone.</I> This is said to be prepared of old for the devil and his 
 angels, for the greatest of sinners, the proudest, and that think 
 themselves not accountable to any for what they say and do; even for 
 kings it is prepared. It is <I>deep and large,</I> sufficient to 
 receive the world of the ungodly; the <I>pile thereof is fire and much 
 wood.</I> God's wrath is the fire, and sinners make themselves fuel to 
 it; and <I>the breath of the Lord</I> (the power of his anger) 
 <I>kindles it,</I> and will keep it ever burning. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:24"><I>ch.</I> lxvi. 24</A>.

 Wherefore <I>stand in awe and sin not.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The great joy which this should occasion to the people of God. The 
 Assyrian's fall is Jerusalem's triumph 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 <I>You shall have a song as in the night,</I> a psalm of praise such as 
 those sing who <I>by night stand in the house of the Lord,</I> and sing 
 to his glory who <I>gives songs in the night.</I> It shall not be a 
 song of vain mirth, but a sacred song, such as was sung when a holy 
 solemnity was kept in a grave and religious manner. Our joy in the fall 
 of the church's enemies must be a holy joy, <I>gladness of heart, as 
 when one goes, with a pipe</I> (such as the sons of the prophets used 
 when they prophesied, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:5">1 Sam. x. 5</A>),

 <I>to the mountain of the Lord,</I> there to celebrate the praises of
 <I>the Mighty One of Israel.</I> Nay, in every place where the divine 
 vengeance shall pursue the Assyrians they shall not only fall 
 unlamented, but all their neighbours shall attend their fall <I>with 
 tabrets and harps,</I> pleased to see how God, <I>in battles of 
 shaking,</I> such as shake them out of the world, fights with them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>);

 for <I>when the wicked perish there is shouting;</I> and it is with a 
 particular satisfaction that wise and good men see the ruin of those 
 who, like the Assyrians, have insolently bidden defiance to God and 
 trampled upon all mankind.</P>
