 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet, in this chapter, goes on to foretel the desolations that 
 were coming upon Judah and Jerusalem for their sins, both that by the 
 Babylonians and that which completed their ruin by the Romans, with 
 some of the grounds of God's controversy with them. God threatens, 

 I. To deprive them of all the supports both of their life and of their
 government, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. To leave them to fall into confusion and disorder, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:4,5,12">ver. 4, 5, 12</A>.
 
 III. To deny them the blessing of magistracy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:6-8">ver. 6-8</A>.

 IV. To strip the daughters of Zion of their ornaments, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:17-24">ver. 17-24</A>.

 V. To lay all waste by the sword of war,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:25,26">ver. 25, 26</A>.

 The sins that provoked God to deal thus with them were,

 1. Their defiance of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:8">ver. 8</A>.
 
 2. Their impudence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:9">ver. 9</A>.

 3. The abuse of power to oppression and tyranny, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:12-15">ver. 12-15</A>.

 4. The pride of the daughters of Zion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:16">ver. 16</A>.

 In the midst of the chapter the prophet is directed how to address 
 particular persons.

 (1.) To assure good people that it should be well with them, 
 notwithstanding those general calamities, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:10">ver. 10</A>.

 (2.) To assure wicked people that, however God might, in judgment, 
 remember mercy, yet it should go ill with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:11">ver. 11</A>.

 O that the nations of the earth, at this day, would hearken to rebukes 
 and warnings which this chapter gives!</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  For, behold, the Lord, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, doth take away from
 Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay
 of bread, and the whole stay of water,
 &nbsp; 2  The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the
 prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,
 &nbsp; 3  The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the
 counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.
 &nbsp; 4  And I will give children <I>to be</I> their princes, and babes
 shall rule over them.
 &nbsp; 5  And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and
 every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself
 proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.
 &nbsp; 6  When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his
 father, <I>saying,</I> Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and
 <I>let</I> this ruin <I>be</I> under thy hand:
 &nbsp; 7  In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be a healer;
 for in my house <I>is</I> neither bread nor clothing: make me not a
 ruler of the people.
 &nbsp; 8  For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their
 tongue and their doings <I>are</I> against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to provoke the
 eyes of his glory.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet, in the close of the foregoing chapter, had given a 
 necessary caution to all not to put confidence in man, or any creature; 
 he had also given a general reason for that caution, taken from the 
 frailty of human life and the vanity and weakness of human powers. Here 
 he gives a particular reason for it--God was now about to ruin all their
 creature-confidences, so that they should meet with nothing but 
 disappointments in all their expectations from them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>The stay and the staff</I> shall be taken away, all their supports,
 of what kind soever, all the things they trusted to and looked for help 
 and relief from. Their church and kingdom had now grown old and were 
 going to decay, and they were (after the manner of aged men,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:4">Zech. viii. 4</A>)

 leaning on a staff: now God threatens to take away their staff, and
 then they must fall of course, to take away the stays of both the city 
 and the country, of Jerusalem and of Judah, which are indeed stays to 
 one another, and, if one fail, the other feels from it. He that does 
 this is <I>the Lord, the Lord of hosts--Adon,</I> the Lord that is 
 himself the stay or foundation; if that stay depart, all other stays 
 certainly break under us, for he is the strength of them all. He that 
 is the Lord, the ruler, that has authority to do it, and the Lord of 
 hosts, that has the ability to do it, he shall take away the stay and 
 the staff. St. Jerome refers this to the sensible decay of the Jewish 
 nation after they had crucified our Saviour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:9,10">Rom. xi. 9, 10</A>.

 I rather take it as a warning to all nations not to provoke God; for if 
 they make him their enemy, he can and will thus make them miserable. 
 Let us view the particulars.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Was their plenty a support to them? It is so to any people; bread is 
 the staff of life: but God can <I>take away the whole stay of bread, 
 and the whole stay of water;</I> and it is just with him to do so when 
 fulness of bread becomes an iniquity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:49">Ezek. xvi. 49</A>),

 and that which was given to be provision for the life is made provision
 for the lusts. He can take away the bread and the water by withholding 
 the rain, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:23,24">Deut. xxviii. 23, 24</A>.

 Or, if he allow them, he can take away the stay of bread and the stay
 of water by withholding his blessing, by which man lives, and not by
 bread only, and which is the staff of bread

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:4">Matt. iv. 4</A>),

 and then the bread is not nourishing nor the water refreshing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:6">Hag. i. 6</A>.

 Christ is the bread of life and the water of life; if he be our stay,
 we shall find that this is a good part not to be taken away, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:14,6:27">John iv. 14; vi. 27</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Was their army a support to them--their generals, and commanders,
 and military men? These shall be taken away, either cut off by the 
 sword or so discouraged with the defeats they meet with that they shall 
 throw up their commissions and resolve to act no more; or they shall be 
 disabled by sickness, or dispirited, so as to be unfit for business; 
 <I>The mighty men, and the man of war,</I> and even the inferior 
 officer, <I>the captain of fifty,</I> shall be removed. It bodes ill 
 with a people when their valiant men are lost. Let not the strong man 
 therefore glory in his strength, nor any people trust too much to their 
 mighty men; but let the strong <I>people glorify God</I> and <I>the 
 city of the terrible nations fear him,</I> who can make them weak and 
 despicable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:3"><I>ch.</I> xxv. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Were their ministers of state a support to them--their learned men,
 their politicians, their clergy, their wits and virtuoso? These also 
 should be taken away--<I>the judges,</I> who were skilled in the laws,
 and expert in administering justice,--<I>the prophets,</I> whom they
 used to consult in difficult cases,--<I>the prudent,</I> who were
 celebrated as men of sense and sagacity above all others and were 
 assistants to the judges, <I>the diviners</I> (so the word is), those 
 who used unlawful arts, who, though rotten stays, yet were stayed on, 
 (but it may be taken, as we read it, in a good sense),--<I>the
 ancients,</I> elders in age, in office,--<I>the honourable man,</I> the
 gravity of whose aspect commands reverence and whose age and experience 
 make him fit to be a counsellor. Trade is one great support to a 
 nation, even manufactures and handicraft trades; and therefore, when 
 the whole stay is broken, <I>the cunning artificer</I> too shall be 
 taken away; and the last is <I>the eloquent orator,</I> the man skilful 
 of speech, who in some cases may do good service, though he be none of 
 the prudent or the ancient, by putting the sense of others in good 
 language. Moses cannot speak well, but Aaron can. God threatens to take 
 these away, that is, 

 1. To disable them for the service of their country, <I>making judges
 fools, taking away the speech of the trusty and the understanding of 
 the aged,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:17">Job xii. 17</A>,

 &c. Every creature is that to us which God makes it to be; and we 
 cannot be sure that those who have been serviceable to us shall always 
 be so. 

 2. To put an end to their days; for the reason why princes are not to 
 be trusted in is because their <I>breath goeth forth,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+146:3,4">Ps. cxlvi. 3, 4</A>.

 Note, The removal of useful men by death, in the midst of their
 usefulness, is a very threatening symptom to any people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Was their government a support to them? It ought to have been so; 
 it is the business of the sovereign to bear up the pillars of the land, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+75:3">Ps. lxxv. 3</A>.

 But it is here threatened that this stay should fail them. When the
 mighty men and the prudent are removed <I>children shall be their 
 princes</I>--children in age, who must be under tutors and governors, 
 who will be clashing with one another and making a prey of the young 
 king and his kingdom-children in understanding and disposition, 
 childish men, such as are babes in knowledge, no more fit to rule than 
 a child in the cradle. These shall rule over them, with all the folly, 
 fickleness, and frowardness, of a child. And <I>woe unto thee, O land! 
 when thy king</I> is such a one! 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:16">Eccl. x. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Was the union of the subjects among themselves, their good order and 
 the good understanding and correspondence that they kept with one 
 another, a stay to them? Where this is the case a people may do better 
 for it, though their princes be not such as they should be; but it is 
 here threatened that God would send an evil spirit among them too (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:23">Judg. ix. 23</A>),
 
 which would make them,

 1. Injurious and unneighbourly one towards another 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>The people shall be oppressed every one by his neighbour," </I> and
 their princes, being children, will take no care to restrain the 
 oppressors or relieve the oppressed, nor is it to any purpose to appeal 
 to them (which is a temptation to every man to be his own avenger), and 
 therefore they bite and devour one another and will soon be consumed 
 one of another. Then <I>homo homini lupus--man becomes a wolf to man; 
 jusque datum sceleri--wickedness receives the stamp of law; nec hospes 
 ab hospite tutus--the guest and the host are in danger from each 
 other.</I> 

 2. Insolent and disorderly towards their superiors. It is as ill an
 omen to a people as can be when the rising generation among them are 
 generally untractable, rude, and ungovernable, when <I>the child 
 behaves himself proudly against the ancient,</I> whereas he should 
 <I>rise up before the hoary head</I> and <I>honour the face of the old 
 man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:32">Lev. xix. 32</A>.

 When young people are conceited and pert, and behave scornfully towards
 their superiors, their conduct is not only a reproach to themselves, 
 but of ill consequence to the public; it slackens the reins of 
 government and weakens the hands that hold them. It is likewise ill
 with a people when persons of honour cannot support their authority, 
 but are affronted by the base and beggarly, when judges are insulted 
 and their powers set at defiance by the mob. Those have a great deal to 
 answer for who do this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. It is some stay, some support, to hope that, though matters may be 
 now ill-managed, yet other may be raised up, who may manage better? Yet 
 this expectation also shall be frustrated, for the case shall be so 
 desperate that no man of sense or substance will meddle with it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The government shall go a begging, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 Here,

 (1.) It is taken for granted that there is no way of redressing all 
 these grievances, and bringing things into order again, but by good 
 magistrates, who shall be invested with power by common consent, and 
 shall exert that power for the good of the community. And it is 
 probable that this was, in many places, the true origin of government; 
 men found it necessary to unite in a subjection to one who was thought 
 fit for such a trust, in order to the welfare and safety of them all, 
 being aware that they must either be ruled or ruined. Here therefore is 
 the original contract: "<I>Be thou our ruler,</I> and we will be 
 subject to thee, and <I>let this ruin be under thy hand,</I> to be 
 repaired and restored, and then to be preserved and established, and 
 the interests of it advanced,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:12"><I>ch.</I> lviii. 12</A>.

 Take care to protect us by the sword of war from being injured from
 abroad, and by the sword of justice from being injurious to another, 
 and we will bear faith and true allegiance to thee." 

 (2.) The case is represented as very deplorable, and things as having 
 come to a sad pass; for,

 [1.] Children being their princes, every man will think himself fit to 
 prescribe who shall be a magistrate, and will be for preferring his own 
 relations; whereas, if the princes were as they should be, it would be 
 left entirely to them to nominate the rulers, as it ought to be.

 [2.] Men will find themselves under a necessity even of forcing power 
 into the hands of those that are thought to be fit for it: <I>A man 
 shall take hold</I> by violence of one to make him a ruler, perceiving 
 him ready to resist the motion: nay, he shall urge it upon his brother; 
 whereas, commonly, men are not willing that their equals should be 
 their superiors, witness the envy of Joseph's brethren.

 [3.] It will be looked upon as ground sufficient for the preferring of 
 a man to be a ruler that he has clothing better than his neighbours--a 
 very poor qualification to recommend a man to a place of trust in the 
 government. It was a sign that the country was much impoverished when
 it was a rare thing to find a man that had good clothes, or could 
 afford to buy himself an alderman's gown or a judge's robes; and it was 
 proof enough that the people were very unthinking when they had so much 
 respect to a man in <I>gay clothing, with a gold ring</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:2,3">
 Jam. ii. 2, 3</A>),

 that, for the sake thereof, they would make him their ruler. It would
 have been some sense to have said, "Thou hast wisdom, integrity, 
 experience; be thou our ruler." But it was a jest to say, <I>Thou hast 
 clothing; be thou our ruler.</I> A <I>poor wise man,</I> though in vile 
 raiment, <I>delivered a city,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:15">Eccl. ix. 15</A>.

 We may allude to this to show how desperate the case of fallen man was
 when our Lord Jesus was pleased to become our brother, and, though he 
 was not courted, offered himself to be our ruler and Saviour, and to 
 take this ruin under his hand.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Those who are thus pressed to come into office will swear themselves 
 off, because, though they are taken to be men of some substance, yet 
 they know themselves unable to bear the charges of the office and to 
 answer the expectations of those that choose them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>He shall swear</I> (shall lift up the hand, the ancient ceremony
 used in taking the oath) <I>I will not be a healer; make not me a 
 ruler.</I> Note, Rulers must be healers, and good rulers will be so; 
 they must study to unite their subjects, and not to widen the 
 differences that are among them. Those only are fit for government that 
 are of a meek, quiet, healing, spirit. They must also heal the wounds 
 that are given to any of the interests of their people, by suitable 
 applications. But why will he not be a ruler? Because <I>in my house is 
 neither bread nor clothing.</I>

 (1.) If he said true, it was a sign that men's estates were sadly 
 ruined when even those who made the best appearance really wanted 
 necessaries--a common case, and a piteous one. Some who, having lived 
 fashionably, are willing to put the best side outwards, are yet, if the 
 truth were known, in great straits, and go with heavy hearts for want 
 of bread and clothing. 

 (2.) If he did not speak truth, it was a sign that men's consciences 
 were sadly debauched, when, to avoid the expense of an office, they 
 would load themselves with the guilt of perjury, and (which is the 
 greatest madness in the world) would damn their souls to save their 
 money, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:26">Matt. xvi. 26</A>.

 (3.) However it was, it was a sign that the case of the nation was very 
 bad when nobody was willing to accept a place in the government of it, 
 as despairing to have either credit or profit by it, which are the two 
 things aimed at in men's common ambition of preferment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The reason why God brought things to this sad pass, even among his 
 own people (which is given either by the prophet or by him that refused 
 to be a ruler); it was not for want of good will to his country, but 
 because he saw the case desperate and past relief, and it would be to 
 no purpose to attempt it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Jerusalem is ruined</I> and <I>Judah is fallen;</I> and they may
 thank themselves. They have brought their destruction upon their own 
 heads, for <I>their tongue and their doings are against the Lord;</I> 
 in word and action they broke the law of God and therein designed an 
 affront to him; they wilfully intended to offend him, in contempt of 
 his authority and defiance of his justice. Their tongue was against the 
 Lord, for they contradicted his prophets; and their doings were no 
 better, for they acted as they talked. It was an aggravation of their 
 sin that God's eye was upon them, and that his glory was manifested 
 among them; but they provoked him to his face, as if the more they knew 
 of his glory the greater pride they took in slighting it, and turning 
 it into shame. And this, this, is it for which Jerusalem is ruined. 
 Note, The ruin both of persons and people is owing to their sins. If 
 they did not provoke God, he would <I>do them no hurt,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  The show of their countenance doth witness against them; and

 the faces of the poor? saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> of hosts.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here God proceeds in his controversy with his people. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The ground of his controversy. It was for sin that God contended 
 with them; if they vex themselves, let them look a little further and 
 they will see that they must <I>thank</I> themselves: <I>Woe unto their 
 souls! For they have rewarded evil unto themselves. Alas for their 
 souls!</I> (so it may be read, in a way of lamentation), <I>for they 
 have procured evil to themselves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Note, The condition of sinners is woeful and very deplorable. Note,
 also, It is the soul that is damaged and endangered by sin. Sinners may 
 prosper in their outward estates, and yet at the same time there may be 
 a woe to their souls. Note, further, Whatever evils befals sinners it
 is of their own procuring,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:19">Jer. ii. 19</A>.
 
 That which is here charged upon then is,

 1. That the shame which should have restrained them from their sins was
 quite thrown off and they had grown impudent, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 This hardens men against repentance, and ripens them for ruin, as much
 as anything: <I>The show of their countenance doth witness against 
 them</I> that their minds are vain, and lewd, and malicious; their eyes 
 declare plainly that they <I>cannot cease from sin,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:14">2 Pet. ii. 14</A>.

 One may look them in the face and guess at the desperate wickedness
 that there is in their hearts: <I>They declare their sin as Sodom,</I> 
 so impetuous, so imperious, are their lusts, and so impatient of the 
 least check, and so perfectly are all the remaining sparks of virtue 
 extinguished in them. The Sodomites declared their sin, not only by the 
 exceeding greatness of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:13">Gen. xiii. 13</A>),
 
 so that it cried to heaven
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:20">Gen. xviii. 20</A>),

 but by their shameless owning of that which was most shameful

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:5">Gen. xix. 5</A>);

 and thus Judah and Jerusalem did: they were so far from hiding it that
 they gloried in it, in the bold attempts they made upon virtue, and the 
 victory they gained over their own convictions. They had a whore's 
 forehead

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:3">Jer. iii. 3</A>)

 and could not blush, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:15">Jer. vi. 15</A>.

 Note, Those that have grown impudent in sin are ripe for ruin. Those
 that are past shame (we say) are past grace, and then past hope.

 2. That their guides, who should direct them in the right way, put them
 out of the way

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 "<I>Those who lead thee</I> (the princes, priests, and prophets)
 mislead thee; they <I>cause thee to err.</I>" Either they preached to 
 them that which was false and corrupt, or, if they preached that which 
 was true and good, they contradicted it by their practices, and the 
 people would soon follow a bad example than a good exhortation. Thus 
 they <I>destroyed the ways of their paths,</I> pulling down with one 
 hand what they built up with the other. <I>Que te beatificant--Those 
 that call thee blessed</I> cause thee to err; so some read it. Their 
 priests applauded them, as if nothing were amiss among them, cried 
 <I>Peace, peace,</I> to them, as if they were in no danger; and thus 
 they caused them to go on in their errors. 

 3. That their judges, who should have patronized and protected the
 oppressed, were themselves the greatest oppressors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 The elders of the people, and the princes, who had learning and could
 not but know better things, who had great estates and were not under 
 the temptation of necessity to encroach upon those about them, and who 
 were men of honour and should have scorned to do a base thing, yet 
 <I>they have eaten up the vineyard.</I> God's vineyard, which they were 
 appointed to be the dressers and keepers of, they burnt (so the word 
 signifies); they did as ill by it as its worst enemies could do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:16">Ps. lxxx. 16</A>.

 Or the vineyards of the poor they wrested out of their possession, as
 Jezebel did Naboth's, or devoured the fruits of them, fed their lusts 
 with that which should have been the necessary food of indigent 
 families; the spoil of the poor was hoarded up in their houses; when 
 God came to search for stolen goods there he found it, and it was a 
 witness against them. It was to be had, and they might have made 
 restitution, but would not. God reasons with these great men

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 "<I>What mean you, that you beat my people into pieces?</I> What cause
 have you for it? What good does it do you?" Or, "What hurt have they 
 done you? Do you think you had power given you for such a purpose as 
 this?" Note, There is nothing more unaccountable, and yet nothing which 
 must more certainly be accounted for, than the injuries and abuses that 
 are done to God's people by their persecutors and oppressors. "<I>You 
 grind the faces of the poor;</I> you put them to as much pain and 
 terror as if they were ground in a mill, and as certainly reduce them 
 to dust by one act of oppression after another." Or, "Their faces are 
 bruised and crushed with the blows you have given them; you have not 
 only ruined their estates, but have given them personal abuses." Our 
 Lord Jesus was <I>smitten on the face,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:67">Matt. xxvi. 67</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The management of this controversy. 

 1. God himself is the prosecutor 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>The Lord stands up to plead,</I> or he sets himself to debate the
 matter, and he <I>stands to judge the people,</I> to judge for those 
 that were oppressed and abused; and he will <I>enter into judgment with 
 the princes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Note, The greatest of men cannot exempt or secure themselves from the
 scrutiny and sentence of God's judgment, nor demur to the jurisdiction 
 of the court of heaven.

 2. The indictment is proved by the notorious evidence of the fact:
 "Look upon the oppressors, and the <I>show of their countenance 
 witnesses against them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 look upon the oppressed, and you see how their faces are battered and
 abused," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 3. The controversy is already begun in the change of the ministry. To
 punish those that had abused their power to bad purposes God sets those 
 over them that had not sense to use their power to any good purposes: 
 <I>Children are their oppressors, and women rule over them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 men that have as weak judgments and strong passions as women and
 children: this was their sin, that their rulers were such, and it 
 became a judgment upon them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The distinction that shall be made between particular persons, in 
 the prosecution of this controversy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>):

 <I>Say to the righteous, It shall be well with thee. Woe to the wicked;
 it shall be ill with him.</I> He had said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 they <I>have rewarded evil to themselves,</I> in proof of which he here
 shows that God will <I>render to every man according to his works.</I> 
 Had they been righteous, it would have been well with them; but, if it 
 be ill with them, it is because they are wicked and will be so. Thus 
 God stated the matter to Cain, to convince him that he had no reason to 
 be angry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:7">Gen. iv. 7</A>.

 Or it may be taken thus: God is threatening national judgments, which
 will ruin the public interests. Now,

 1. Some good people might fear that they should be involved in that
 ruin, and therefore God bids the prophets comfort them against those 
 fears: "Whatever becomes of the unrighteous nation, let <I>the 
 righteous man</I> know that he shall not be lost in the crowd of 
 sinners; the <I>Judge of all the earth will not slay the righteous with 
 the wicked</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:25">Gen. xviii. 25</A>);

 no, assure him, in God's name, that <I>it shall be well with him.</I>
 The property of the trouble shall be altered to him, and he shall be 
 <I>hidden in the day of the Lord's anger.</I> He shall have divine 
 supports and comforts, which shall abound as afflictions abound, and so 
 it shall be well with him." When the whole <I>stay of bread is taken 
 away,</I> yet in the <I>day of famine the righteous shall be 
 satisfied;</I> they <I>shall eat the fruit of their doings</I>--they 
 shall have the testimony of their consciences for them that they kept 
 themselves pure from the common iniquity, and therefore the common 
 calamity is not the same thing to them that it is to others; they 
 brought no fuel to the flame, and therefore are not themselves fuel for 
 it. 

 2. Some wicked people might hope that they should escape that ruin, and
 therefore God bids the prophets shake their vain hopes: "<I>Woe to the 
 wicked; it shall be ill with him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 To him the judgments shall have sting, and there shall be <I>wormwood
 and gall</I> in the <I>affliction and misery.</I>" There is a woe to 
 wicked people, and, though they may think to shelter themselves from 
 public judgments, yet it shall be ill with them; it will grow worse and 
 worse with them if they repent not, and the worst of all will be at 
 last; for <I>the reward of their hands shall be given them,</I> in the 
 day when every man shall receive according to the things done in the 
 body.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  Moreover the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> saith, Because the daughters of Zion are
 haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes,
 walking and mincing <I>as</I> they go, and making a tinkling with

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet's business was to show all sorts of people what they had 
 contributed to the national guilt and what share they must expect in 
 the national judgments that were coming. Here he reproves and warns the 
 daughters of Zion, tells the ladies of their faults; and Moses, in the 
 law, having denounced God's wrath against <I>the tender and delicate 
 woman</I> (the prophets being a comment upon the law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:56">Deut. xxviii. 56</A>),

 he here tells them how they shall smart by the calamities that are
 coming upon them. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The sin charged upon the daughters of Zion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 The prophet expressly vouches God's authority for what he said, lest it
 should be thought it was unbecoming in him to take notice of such 
 things, and should be resented by the ladies: <I>The Lord saith it.</I> 
 "Whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, let them know 
 that God takes notice of, and is much displeased with, the folly and 
 vanity of proud women, and his law takes cognizance even of their 
 dress." Two things that here stand indicted for--haughtiness and 
 wantonness, directly contrary to that <I>modesty, shamefacedness, and 
 sobriety, with which women ought to adorn themselves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:9">1 Tim. ii. 9</A>.
 
 They discovered the disposition of their mind by their gait and
 gesture, and the lightness of their carriage. They are haughty, for 
 they <I>walk with stretched-forth necks,</I> that they may seem tall, 
 or, as thinking nobody good enough to speak to them or to receive a 
 look or a smile from them. Their eyes are wanton, <I>deceiving</I> (so 
 the word is); with their amorous glances they draw men into their 
 snares. They affect a formal starched way of going, that people may 
 look at them, and admire them, and know they have been at the 
 dancing-school, and have learned the minuet-step. They go 
 <I>mincing,</I> or nicely tripping, not willing to set so much as the 
 sole of their foot to the ground, for tenderness and delicacy. They 
 make a <I>tinkling with their feet,</I> having, as some think, chains, 
 or little bells, upon their shoes, that made a noise: they go <I>as if 
 they were fettered</I> (so some read it), like a horse tramelled, that 
 he may learn to pace. Thus Agag came delicately,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:32">1 Sam. xv. 32</A>.

 Such a nice affected mien is not only a force upon that which is
 natural, and ridiculous before men, men of sense; but as it is an 
 evidence of a vain mind, it is offensive to God. And two things 
 aggravated it here:

 1. That these were the daughters of Zion, the holy mountain, who should 
 have behaved with the gravity that becomes women professing godliness. 
 
 2. That it should seem, by the connexion, they were the wives and
 daughters of the princes who spoiled and oppressed the poor 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>)

 that they might maintain the pride and luxury of their families.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The punishments threatened for this sin; and they answer the sin as 
 face answers to face in a glass, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.

 1. They <I>walked with stretched-forth necks,</I> but God will <I>smite 
 with a scab the crown of their head,</I> which shall lower their 
 crests, and make them ashamed to show their heads, being obliged by it 
 to cut off their hair. Note, Loathsome diseases are often sent as the
 just punishment of pride, and are sometimes the immediate effect of 
 lewdness, the flesh and the body being consumed by it. 

 2. They cared not what they laid out in furnishing themselves with
 great variety of fine clothes; but God will reduce them to such poverty 
 and distress that they shall not have clothes sufficient to cover their 
 nakedness, but their uncomeliness shall be exposed through their rags. 
 
 3. They were extremely fond and proud of their ornaments; but God will
 strip them of those ornaments, when their houses shall be plundered, 
 their treasures rifled, and they themselves led into captivity. The 
 prophet here specifies many of the ornaments which they used as 
 particularly as if he had been the keeper of their wardrobe or had 
 attended them in their dressing-room. It is not at all material to 
 enquire what sort of ornaments these respectively were and whether the 
 translations rightly express the original words; perhaps 100 years 
 hence the names of some of the ornaments that are now in use in our own 
 land will be as little understood as some of those here mentioned now 
 are. Fashions alter, and so do the names of them; and yet the mention 
 of them is not in vain, but is designed to expose the folly of the 
 daughters of Zion; for,

 (1.) Many of these things, we may suppose, were very odd and 
 ridiculous, and, if they had not been in fashion, would have been 
 hooted at. They were fitter to be toys for children to play with than 
 ornaments for grown people to go to Mount Zion in. 

 (2.) Those things that were decent and convenient, as <I>the linen, the 
 hoods, and the veils,</I> needed not be provided in such abundance and 
 variety. It is necessary to have apparel and proper that all should 
 have it according to their rank; but what occasion was there for so 
 many changeable suits of apparel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 that they might not be seen two days together in the same suit? "They
 must have (as the homily against excess of apparel speaks) one gown for 
 the day, another for the night--one long, another short--one for the 
 working day, another for the holy-day--one of this colour, another of 
 that colour--one of cloth, another of silk or damask--one dress afore 
 dinner, another after--one of the Spanish fashion, another Turkey--and 
 never content with sufficient." All this, as it is an evidence of pride 
 and vain curiosity, so must needs spend a great deal in gratifying a 
 base lust that ought to be laid out in works of piety and charity; and 
 it is well if poor tenants be not racked, or poor creditors defrauded 
 to support it.

 (3.) The enumeration of these things intimates what care they were in 
 about them, how much their hearts were upon them, what an exact account 
 they kept of them, how nice and critical they were about them, how 
 insatiable their desire was of them, and how much of their comfort was 
 bound up in them. A maid could forget none of these ornaments, though 
 they were ever so many 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:32">Jer. ii. 32</A>),

 but they would report them as readily, and talk of them with as much
 pleasure, as if they had been things of the greatest moment. The 
 prophet did not speak of these things as in themselves sinful (they 
 might lawfully be had and used), but as things which they were proud of 
 and should therefore be deprived of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They were very nice and curious about their clothes; but God would 
 make those bodies of theirs, which were at such expense to beautify and 
 make easy, a reproach and burden to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>Instead of sweet smell</I> (those tablets, or boxes, of perfume,
 <I>houses of the soul</I> or <I>breath,</I> as they are called,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>,

 <I>margin</I>) <I>there shall be stink,</I> garments grown filthy with
 being long worn, or from some loathsome disease or plasters for the 
 cure of it. <I>Instead of a</I> rich embroidered <I>girdle</I> used to
 make the clothes sit tight, there shall be <I>a rent,</I> a rending of 
 the clothes for grief, or old rotten clothes rent into rags. <I>Instead 
 of well-set hair,</I> curiously plaited and powdered, there shall be 
 <I>baldness,</I> the hair being plucked off or shaven, as was usual in 
 times of great affliction

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+15:2,Jer+16:6"><I>ch.</I> xv. 2; Jer. xvi. 6</A>),
 
 or in great servitude,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:18">Ezek. xxix. 18</A>.

 <I>Instead of a stomacher,</I> or a scarf or sash, there shall be <I>a
 girding of sackcloth,</I> in token of deep humiliation; <I>and burning 
 instead of beauty.</I> Those that had a good complexion, and were proud 
 of it, when they are carried into captivity shall be tanned and 
 sun-burnt; and it is observed that the best faces are soonest injured 
 by the weather. From all this let us learn, 

 1. Not to be nice and curious about our apparel, not to affect that 
 which is gay and costly, nor to be proud of it. 

 2. Not to be secure in the enjoyment of any of the delights of sense,
 because we know not how soon we may be stripped of them, nor what 
 straits we may be reduced to.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. They designed by these ornaments to charm the gentlemen, and win 
 their affections 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+7:16,17">Prov. vii. 16, 17</A>),

 but there shall be none to be charmed by them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>Thy men shall fall by the sword, and the mighty in the war,</I> The
 <I>fire shall consume them,</I> and then the <I>maidens</I> shall 
 <I>not be given in marriage;</I> as it is, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:63">Ps. lxxviii. 63</A>.

 When the sword comes with commission the mighty commonly fall first by
 it, because they are most forward to venture. And, when Zion's guards 
 are cut off, no marvel that Zion's gates <I>lament and mourn</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 the enemies having made themselves masters of them; and the city
 itself, being desolate, being emptied or swept, shall <I>sit upon the 
 ground</I> like a disconsolate widow. If sin be harboured with in the 
 walls, lamentation and mourning are near the gates.</P>
