 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 The word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> that came to Micah the Morasthite in the
 days of Jotham, Ahaz, <I>and</I> Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he
 saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 2 Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein
 is: and let the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> be witness against you, the Lord from

 &nbsp; 3 For, behold, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> cometh forth out of his place, and will

 shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, <I>and</I> as the waters <I>that
 are</I> poured down a steep place.
 &nbsp; 5 For the transgression of Jacob <I>is</I> all this, and for the
 sins of the house of Israel. What <I>is</I> the transgression of
 Jacob? <I>is it</I> not Samaria? and what <I>are</I> the high places of
 Judah? <I>are they</I> not Jerusalem?
 &nbsp; 6 Therefore I will make Samaria as a heap of the field, <I>and</I>
 as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones
 thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations
 thereof.
 &nbsp; 7 And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces,
 and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all
 the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered <I>it</I> of
 the hire of a harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an
 harlot.

 Here is, 

 I. A general account of this prophet and his prophecy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+1:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 This is prefixed for the satisfaction of all that read and hear the 
 prophecy of this book, who will give the more credit to it when they 
 know the author and his authority. 

 1. The prophecy is the <I>word of the Lord;</I> it is a divine
 revelation. Note, What is written in the Bible, and what is preached by 
 the ministers of Christ according to what is written there, must be 
 heard and received, not as the word of dying men, which we may be 
 judges of, but as the word of the living God, which we must be judged 
 by, for so it is. This word of the Lord came to the prophet, came 
 plainly, came powerfully, came in a preventing way, and he saw it, saw 
 the vision in which it was conveyed to him, saw the things themselves 
 which he foretold, with as much clearness and certainty as if they had 
 been already accomplished. 

 2. The prophet is Micah the Morasthite; his name <I>Micah</I> is a
 contraction of Micaiah, the name of a prophet some ages before (in 
 Ahab's time,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+22:8">1 Kings xxii. 8</A>);

 his surname, the <I>Morasthite,</I> signifies that he was born, or
 lived, at Moresheth, which is mentioned here

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 or Mareshah, which is mentioned 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+1:15,Jos+15:44"><I>v.</I> 15, and Josh. xv. 44</A>.

 The place of his abode is mentioned, that any one might enquire in that 
 place, at that time, and might find there was, or had been, such a one 
 there, who was generally reputed to be a prophet. 

 3. The date of his prophecy is in the reigns of three kings of
 Judah--Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. Ahaz was one of the worst of Judah's 
 kings, and Hezekiah one of the best; such variety of times pass over 
 God's ministers, times that frown and times that smile, to each of 
 which they must study to accommodate themselves, and to arm themselves 
 against the temptations of both. The promises and threatenings of this 
 book are interwoven, by which it appears that even in the wicked reign 
 he preached comfort, and said <I>to the righteous</I> then that it 
 should be <I>well with them;</I> and that in the pious reign he 
 preached conviction, and said to the wicked then that it should be 
 <I>ill with them;</I> for, however the times change, the word of the 
 Lord is still the same. 

 4. The parties concerned in this prophecy; it is <I>concerning Samaria
 and Jerusalem,</I> the head cities of the two kingdoms of Israel and 
 Judah, under the influence of which the kingdoms themselves were. 
 Though the ten tribes have deserted the houses both of David and Aaron, 
 yet God is pleased to send prophets to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A very solemn introduction to the following prophecy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 in which,

 1. The people are summoned to draw near and give their attendance, as 
 upon a court of judicature: <I>Hear, all you people,</I> Note, Where 
 God has a mouth to speak we must have an ear to hear; we all must, for 
 we are all concerned in what is delivered. "<I>Hear, you people" (all 
 of them,</I> so the margin reads it), "all you that are now within 
 hearing, and all others that hear it at second hand." It is an unusual 
 construction; but those words with which Micah begins his prophecy are 
 the very same in the original with those wherewith Micaiah ended his, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+22:28">1 Kings xxii. 28</A>.

 2. The earth is called upon, with <I>all that therein is,</I> to hear
 what the prophet has to say: <I>Hearken, O earth!</I> The earth shall 
 be made to shake under the stroke and weight of the judgments coming; 
 sooner will the earth hear than this stupid senseless people; but God 
 will be heard when he pleads. If the church, and those in it, will not 
 hear, the earth, and those in it, shall, and shame them. 

 3. God himself is appealed to, and his omniscience, power, and justice,
 are vouched in testimony against this people: "<I>Let the Lord God be 
 witness against you,</I> a witness that you had fair warning given you, 
 that your prophets did their duty faithfully as watchmen, but you would 
 not take the warning; let the accomplishment of the prophecy be a 
 witness against your contempt and disbelief of it, and prove, to your 
 conviction and confusion, that it was the word of God, and no word of 
 his shall fall to the ground." Note, God himself will be a witness, by 
 the judgments of his hand, against those that would not receive his 
 testimony in the judgments of his mouth. He will be a witness <I>from 
 his holy temple</I> in heaven, when he comes down to execute judgment

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 against those that turned a deaf ear to his oracles, wherein he 
 witnessed to them, out of his holy temple at Jerusalem.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A terrible prediction of destroying judgments which should come 
 upon Judah and Israel, which had its accomplishment soon after in 
 Israel, and at length in Judah; for it is foretold, 

 1. That God himself will appear against them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 They boasted of themselves and their relation to God, as if that would 
 secure them; but, though God never deceives the faith of the upright, 
 he will disappoint the presumption of the hypocrites, for, <I>behold, 
 the Lord comes forth out of his place,</I> quits his mercy-seat, where 
 they thought they had him fast, and prepares his throne for judgment; 
 his glory departs, for they drive it from them. God's way towards this 
 people had long been a way of mercy, but now he changes his way, he 
 <I>comes out of his place,</I> and will come down. He had seemed to 
 retire, as one regardless of what was done, but now he will show 
 himself, he will <I>rend the heavens,</I> and will <I>come down,</I> 
 not as sometimes, in surprising mercies, but in surprising judgments, 
 to do things not for them, but against them, which they <I>looked not 
 for,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:1,26:21">Isa. lxiv. 1; xxvi. 21</A>.

 2. That when the Creator appears against them it shall be in vain for
 any creature to appear for them. He will <I>tread</I> with contempt and 
 disdain <I>upon the high places of the</I> earth, upon all the powers 
 that are advanced in competition with him or in opposition to him; and 
 he will so tread upon them as to tread them down and level them. High 
 places, set up for the worship of idols or for military fortifications, 
 shall all be trodden down and trampled into the dust. Do men trust to 
 the height and strength of the mountains and rocks, as if they were 
 sufficient to bear up their hopes and bear off their fears? They shall 
 be <I>molten under him,</I> melted down <I>as wax before the fire,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:2">Ps. lxviii. 2</A>.

 Do they trust to the fruitfulness of the valleys, and their products?
 They <I>shall be cleft,</I> or rent, with those <I>fiery streams</I> 
 that shall come pouring down from the mountains when they are melted. 
 They shall be ploughed and washed away as the ground is by <I>the 
 waters that are poured down a steep place.</I> God is said to <I>cleave 
 the earth with rivers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:9">Hab. iii. 9</A>.

 Neither men of <I>high degree,</I> as the mountains, nor <I>men of low
 degree,</I> as the valleys, shall be able to secure either themselves 
 or the land from judgments of God, when they are sent with commission 
 to lay all waste, and, like <I>a sweeping rain,</I> to <I>leave no 
 food,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:3">Prov. xxviii. 3</A>.

 This is applied particularly to the head city of Israel, which they 
 hoped would be a protection to the kingdom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 I <I>will make Samaria,</I> that is now a rich and populous city, as 
 <I>a heap of the field,</I> as a heap of dung laid there to be spread, 
 or as a heap of stones gathered together to be carried away, and <I>as 
 plantings of a vineyard,</I> as hillocks of earth raised to plant vines 
 in. God will make of that <I>city a heap,</I> of that <I>defenced city 
 a ruin,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:2">Isa. xxv. 2</A>.

 Their <I>altars</I> had been as <I>heaps in the furrows of the
 fields</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:11">Hos. xii. 11</A>)

 and now their houses shall be so, as ruinous heaps. The <I>stones of
 the city</I> are <I>poured down into the valley</I> by the fury of the 
 conqueror, who will thus be revenged on those walls that so long held 
 out against him. They shall be quite pulled down, so that the very
 <I>foundations</I> shall be <I>discovered,</I> that had been covered by 
 the superstructure; and not one stone shall be left upon another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. A charge of sin upon them, as the procuring cause of these 
 desolating judgments 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>For the transgression of Jacob is all this.</I> If it be asked, "Why 
 is God so angry, and why are Jacob and Israel thus brought to ruin by 
 his anger?" the answer is ready: Sin has done all the mischief; sin has 
 laid all waste; all the calamities of Jacob and Israel are owing to 
 their transgressions; if they had not gone away from God, he would 
 never have appeared thus against them. Note, External privileges and
 professions will not secure a sinful people from the judgments of God. 
 If sin be found in the <I>house of Israel,</I> if Jacob be guilty of 
 transgression and rebellion, God will not spare them; no, he will 
 punish them first, for their sins are of all others most provoking to 
 him, for they are most reproaching. But it is asked, <I>What is the 
 transgression of Jacob?</I> Note, When we feel the smart of sin it 
 concerns us to enquire what the sin is which we smart for, that we may 
 particularly war against that which wars against us. And what is it? 

 1. It is idolatry; it is the <I>high places;</I> that is the
 transgression, the great transgression which reigns in Israel; that is 
 spiritual whoredom, the violation of the marriage-covenant, which 
 merits a divorce. Even the <I>high places of Judah,</I> though not so 
 bad as the transgression of Jacob, were yet offensive enough to God, 
 and a remaining blemish upon some of the good reigns. <I>Howbeit the 
 high places were not taken away.</I> 

 2. It is the idolatry of Samaria and Jerusalem, the royal cities of
 those two kingdoms. These were the most populous places, and where 
 there were most people there was most wickedness, and they made one 
 another worse. These were the most pompous places; there men lived
 most in wealth and pleasure, and they forgot God. These were the places 
 that had the greatest influence upon the country, by authority and 
 example; so that from them idolatry and <I>profaneness went forth 
 throughout all the land,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:15">Jer. xxiii. 15</A>.

 Note, Spiritual distempers are most contagious in persons and places
 that are most conspicuous. If the head city of a kingdom, or the chief 
 family in a parish, be vicious and profane, <I>many will follow their 
 pernicious ways,</I> and write after a bad copy when great ones set it 
 for them. The vices of leaders and rulers are leading ruling vices, and 
 therefore shall be surely and sorely punished. Those have a great deal 
 to answer for indeed that not only sin, but <I>make Israel to sin.</I> 
 Those must expect to be made examples that have been examples of 
 wickedness. If the transgression of Jacob is Samaria, therefore shall 
 <I>Samaria become a heap.</I> Let the ringleaders in sin hear this and 
 fear.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The punishment made to answer the sin, in the particular destruction 
 of the idols, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 1. The gods they worshipped shall be destroyed: <I>The graven images 
 shall be beaten to pieces</I> by the army of the Assyrians, <I>and all 
 the idols shall be laid desolate. Samaria and her idols</I> were ruined 
 together by Sennacherib 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:11">Isa. x. 11</A>),

 and <I>their gods cast into the fire,</I> for <I>they were no gods</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:19">Isa. xxxvii. 19</A>);

 and this was the Lord's doing: <I>I will lay the idols desolate.</I>
 Note, If the law of God prevail not to make men in authority destroy 
 idols, God will take the work into his own hands, and will do it 
 himself. 

 2. The gifts that passed between them and their gods shall be
 destroyed; for <I>all the hires thereof shall be burnt with fire,</I> 
 which may be meant either of the presents they made to their idols for 
 the replenishing of their altars, and the adorning of their statues and 
 temples (these shall become a prey to the victorious army, which shall 
 rifle not only private houses, but the houses of their gods), or of the 
 corn, and wine, and oil, which they called the <I>rewards,</I> or 
 <I>hires,</I> which <I>their idols,</I> their <I>lovers,</I> gave them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:12">Hos. ii. 12</A>);
 
 these shall be taken from them by him whom (by ascribing them to their
 dear idols) they had defrauded of the honour due to him. Note, That 
 cannot prosper by which men either are hired to sin or hire others to 
 sin; for <I>the wages of sin</I> will be <I>death. She gathered it of 
 the hire of the harlot,</I> and <I>it shall return to the hire of a 
 harlot.</I> They enriched themselves by their leagues with the 
 idolatrous nations, who gave them advantages, to court them into the 
 service of their idols, and their idols' temples were enriched with 
 gifts by those who went a whoring after them. And all this wealth shall 
 become a prey to the idolatrous nations, and so be the <I>hire of a 
 harlot</I> again, wages to an army of idolaters, who shall take it as a 
 reward given them by their gods. <I>It shall be a present to king
 Jareb,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:6">Hos. x. 6</A>.

 What they gave to their idols, and what they thought they got by them,
 shall be as the hire of a harlot; the curse of God shall be upon it, 
 and it shall never prosper, nor do them any good. It is common that 
 what is squeezed out by one lust is squandered away upon another.</P>

 houses of Achzib <I>shall be</I> a lie to the kings of Israel.
 &nbsp; 15 Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of
 Mareshah: he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel.

 enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into
 captivity from thee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a long train of mourners attending the funeral of a ruined 
 kingdom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The prophet is himself chief mourner 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+1:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>):

 <I>I will wail and howl; I will go stripped and naked,</I> as a man 
 distracted with grief. The prophets usually expressed their own grief
 for the public grievances, partly to mollify the predictions of them, 
 and to make it appear that is was not out of ill-will that they 
 denounced the judgments of God (so far were they from desiring the 
 woeful day that they dreaded it more than any thing), partly to show 
 how very dreadful and mournful the calamities would be, and to stir up 
 in the people a holy fear of them, that by repentance they might turn 
 away the wrath of God. Note, We ought to lament the punishments of 
 sinners as well as the sufferings of saints in this world; the weeping 
 prophet did so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:1">Jer. ix. 1</A>);

 so did this prophet. He <I>makes a wailing like the dragons,</I> or
 rather the <I>jackals,</I> ravenous beasts that in those countries used 
 to meet in the night, and <I>howl,</I> and make <I>hideous noises;</I> 
 he mourns <I>as the owls,</I> the <I>screech-owls,</I> or 
 <I>ostriches,</I> as some read it. Two things the prophet here thus 
 dolefully laments:--

 1. That Israel's case is desperate: <I>Her wound is incurable;</I> it
 is ruin without remedy; man cannot help her; God will not, because she 
 will not by repentance and reformation help herself. There is indeed
 balm in Gilead and a physician there; but they will not apply to the 
 physician, nor apply the balm to themselves, and therefore <I>the wound 
 is incurable.</I> 

 2. That Judah likewise is in danger. The cup is going round, and is
 now put into Judah's hand: <I>The enemy has come to the gate of 
 Jerusalem.</I> Soon after the destruction of Samaria and the ten 
 tribes, the Assyrian army, under Sennacherib, laid siege to Jerusalem, 
 came to the gate, but could not force their way any further; however, 
 it was with great concern and trouble that the prophet foresaw the 
 fright, so dearly did he love the peace of Jerusalem.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Several places are here brought in mourning, and are called upon to 
 mourn; but with this proviso, that they should not let the Philistines 
 hear them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>Declare it not in Gath;</I> this is borrowed from David's 
 lamentation for Saul and Jonathan 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:20">2 Sam. i. 20</A>),

 <I>Tell it not in Gath,</I> for the uncircumcised will triumph in
 Israel's tears. Note, One would not, if it could be helped, gratify
 those that make themselves and their companions merry with the sins or 
 with the sorrows of God's Israel. David was silent, and stifled his 
 griefs, when <I>the wicked were before him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:1">Ps. xxxix. 1</A>.

 But, though it may be prudent not to give way to a noisy sorrow, yet it
 is duty to admit a silent one when the church of God is in distress. 
 "<I>Roll thyself in the dust</I>" (as great mourners used to do) "and 
 so let the house of Judah and every house in Jerusalem become a 
 <I>house of Aphrah,</I> a <I>house of dust,</I> covered with dust, 
 crumbled into dust." When God makes the house dust it becomes us to 
 humble ourselves under his mighty hand, and to put our mouths in the 
 dust, thus accommodating ourselves to the providences that concern us.
 Dust we are; God brings us to the dust, that we may know it, and own 
 it. Divers other places are here named that should be sharers in this 
 universal mourning, the names of some of which we do not find 
 elsewhere, whence it is conjectured that they are names put upon them 
 by the prophet, the signification of which might either indicate or 
 aggravate the miseries coming upon them, thereby to awaken this secure 
 and stupid people to a holy fear of divine wrath. We find Sennacherib's 
 invasion thus described, in the prediction of it, by the impressions of 
 terror it should make upon the several cities that fell in his way,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:28,29">Isa. x. 28, 29</A>,

 &c. Let us observe the particulars here, 

 1. <I>The inhabitants of Saphir,</I> which signifies <I>neat</I> and
 <I>beautiful (thou that dwellest fairly,</I> so the margin reads it), 
 shall <I>pass away</I> into captivity, or be forced to flee, stripped 
 of all their ornaments <I>and having their shame naked.</I> Note, Those 
 who appear ever so fine and delicate know not what contempt they may be 
 exposed to; and the more grievous will the shame be to those who have 
 been inhabitants of Saphir. 

 2. <I>The inhabitants of Zaanan,</I> which signifies the <I>country of
 flocks,</I> a populous country, where the people are as numerous and 
 thick as flocks of sheep, shall yet be so taken up with their own 
 calamities, felt or feared, that they shall <I>not come forth in the 
 mourning of Bethezel,</I> which signifies a <I>place near,</I> shall 
 not condole with, nor bring any succour to, their next neighbours in 
 distress; for <I>he shall receive of you his standing;</I> the enemy 
 shall encamp among you, O inhabitants of Zaanan! shall take up a 
 station there, shall find footing among you. Those may well think
 themselves excused from helping their neighbours who find they have 
 enough to do to help themselves and to hold their own. 

 3. As for <I>the inhabitants of Maroth</I> (which, some think, is put
 for Ramoth, others that it signifies the <I>rough places</I>), they 
 <I>waited carefully for good,</I> and were grieved for the want of it, 
 but were disappointed; for <I>evil came from the Lord unto the gate of 
 Jerusalem,</I> when the Assyrian army besieged it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 The inhabitants of Maroth might well overlook their own particular 
 grievances when they saw the holy city itself in danger, and might well 
 overlook the Assyrian, that was the instrument, when they saw the evil 
 coming <I>from the Lord.</I> 

 4. Lachish was a city of Judah, which Sennacherib laid siege to,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+36:1,2">Isa. xxxvi. 1,2</A>.

 The inhabitants of that city are called to <I>bind the chariot to the
 swift beast,</I> to prepare for a speedy flight, as having no other way 
 left to secure themselves and their families; or it is spoken 
 ironically: "You have had your chariots and your swift beasts, but 
 where are they now?" God's quarrel with Lachish is that she is <I>the 
 beginning of sin,</I> probably the sin of idolatry, <I>to the daughter 
 of Zion</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 they had learned it from the ten tribes, their near neighbours, and so 
 infected the two tribes with it. Note, Those that help to bring sin 
 into a country do but thereby prepare for the throwing of themselves 
 out of it. Those must expect to be first in the punishment who have
 been ringleaders in sin. <I>The transgressions of Israel were found in 
 thee;</I> when they came to be traced up to their original they were 
 found to take rise very much from that city. God knows at whose door to 
 lay the blame of the transgressions of Israel, and whom to find guilty.
 Lachish, having been so much accessory to the sin of Israel, shall 
 certainly be reckoned with: <I>Thou shalt give presents to 
 Moresheth-gath,</I> a city of the Philistines, which perhaps had a 
 dependence upon Gath, that famous Philistine city; thou shalt send to 
 court those of that city to assist thee, but it shall be in vain, for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)

 <I>the houses of Achzib</I> (a city which joined to Mareshah, or 
 Moresheth, and is mentioned with it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:44">Josh. xv. 44</A>)

 <I>shall be a lie to the kings of Israel;</I> though they depend upon
 their strength, yet they shall fail them. Here there is an allusion to 
 the name. <I>Achzib</I> signifies <I>a lie,</I> and so it shall prove
 to those that trust in it. 

 5. Mareshah, that could not, or would not, help Israel, shall herself
 be made a prey

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 "<I>I will bring a heir</I> (that is, an enemy) that shall take 
 possession of thy lands, with as much assurance as if he were heir at 
 law to them, and <I>he shall come to Adullam,</I> and <I>to the glory 
 of Israel,</I> that is, to Jerusalem the head city;" or "<I>The glory 
 of Israel</I> shall come to be as Adullam, a poor despicable place;" 
 or, "The king of Assyria, whom Israel had gloried in, shall come to 
 Adullam, in laying the country waste." 

 6. The whole land of Judah seems to be spoken to

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+1:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 and called to weeping and mourning: "<I>Make thee bald,</I> by tearing 
 thy hair and shaving thy head; <I>poll thee for thy delicate 
 children,</I> that had been tenderly and nicely brought up; <I>enlarge 
 thy baldness as the eagle</I> when she casts her feathers and is all 
 over bald; <I>for they have gone into captivity from thee,</I> and are 
 not likely to return; and their captivity will be the more grievous to 
 them because they have been brought up delicately and have not been 
 inured to hardship." Or this is directed particularly to the 
 inhabitants of <I>Mareshah,</I> as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 That was the prophet's own city, and yet he denounces the judgments of 
 God against it; for it shall be an aggravation of its sin that it had 
 such a prophet, and knew not the day of its visitation. Its being thus 
 privileged, since it improved not the privilege, shall not procure 
 favour for it either with God or with his prophet.</P>
