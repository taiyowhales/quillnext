 This long chapter (as before 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:1-62,20:1-44"><I>ch.</I> xvi. and xx.</A>)

 is a history of the apostasies of God's people from him and the
 aggravations of those apostasies under the similitude of corporal 
 whoredom and adultery. Here the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, the ten 
 tribes and the two, with their capital cities, Samaria and Jerusalem, 
 are considered distinctly. Here is,

 I. The apostasy of Israel and Samaria from God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>)

 and their ruin for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:9,10">ver. 9, 10</A>.

 II. The apostasy of Judah and Jerusalem from God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:11-21">ver. 11-21</A>)

 and sentence passed upon them, that they shall in like manner be
 destroyed for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:22-35">ver. 22-35</A>.

 III. The joint wickedness of them both together 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:36-44">ver. 36-44</A>)

 and the joint ruin of them both, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:45-49">ver. 45-49</A>.

 And all that is written for warning against the sins of idolatry, and 
 confidence in an arm of flesh, and sinful leagues and confederacies 
 with wicked people (which are the sins here meant by committing 
 whoredom), is that others may hear and fear, and not sin after the
 similitude of the transgressions of Israel and Judah.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came again unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one
 mother:
 &nbsp; 3  And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed
 whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and
 there they bruised the teats of their virginity.
 &nbsp; 4  And the names of them <I>were</I> Aholah the elder, and Aholibah
 her sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters.
 Thus <I>were</I> their names; Samaria <I>is</I> Aholah, and Jerusalem
 Aholibah.
 &nbsp; 5  And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted
 on her lovers, on the Assyrians <I>her</I> neighbours,
 &nbsp; 6  <I>Which were</I> clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of
 them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.
 &nbsp; 7  Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them
 <I>that were</I> the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she
 doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.
 &nbsp; 8  Neither left she her whoredoms <I>brought</I> from Egypt: for in
 her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her
 virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her.
 &nbsp; 9  Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers,
 into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.
 &nbsp; 10  These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her
 daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous
 among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God had often spoken to Ezekiel, and by him to the people, to this 
 effect, but now his word <I>comes again;</I> for <I>God speaks</I> the 
 same thing <I>once, yea, twice,</I> yea, many a time, and all little 
 enough, and too little, for <I>man perceives it not.</I> Note, To 
 convince sinners of the evil of sin, and of their misery and danger by 
 reason of it, there is need of <I>line upon line,</I> so loth we are to 
 know the worst of ourselves. The sinners that are here to be exposed 
 are <I>two women,</I> two kingdoms, sister-kingdoms, Israel and Judah, 
 <I>daughters of one mother,</I> having been for a long time but <I>one 
 people.</I> Solomon's kingdom was so large, so populous, that 
 immediately after his death it divided into two. Observe, 

 1. Their character when they were one

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>They committed whoredoms in Egypt,</I> for there they were guilty of 
 idolatry, as we read before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:8"><I>ch.</I> xx. 8</A>.

 The representing of those sins which are most provoking to God and most
 ruining to a people by the sin of whoredom plainly intimates what an 
 exceedingly sinful sin uncleanness is, how offensive, how destructive. 
 Doubtless it is itself one of the worst of sins, for the worst of other 
 sins are compared to it here and often elsewhere, which should increase 
 our detestation and dread of all manner of <I>fleshly lusts,</I> all 
 appearances of them and approaches to them, as <I>warring against the 
 soul,</I> infatuating sinners, bewitching them, alienating their minds 
 from God and all that is good, debauching conscience, rendering them 
 odious in the eyes of the pure and holy God, and drowning them at last 
 in destruction and perdition. 
 
 2. Their names when they became two,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 The kingdom of Israel is called the <I>elder sister,</I> because that 
 first made the breach, and separated from the family both of kings and 
 priests that God had appointed--the <I>greater sister</I> (so the word 
 is), for ten tribes belonged to that kingdom and only two to the other. 
 God says of them both, <I>They were mine,</I> for they were the seed of 
 Abraham <I>his friend</I> and of Jacob <I>his chosen;</I> they were in 
 covenant with God, and carried about with them the sign of <I>their 
 circumcision,</I> the seal of the covenant. <I>They were mine;</I> and 
 therefore their apostasy was the highest injustice. It was alienating 
 God's property, it was the basest ingratitude to the best of 
 benefactors, and a perfidious treacherous violation of the most sacred 
 engagements. Note, Those who have been in profession the people of God, 
 but have revolted from him, have a great deal to answer for more than 
 those who never made any such profession. "<I>They were mine;</I> they
 were espoused tome, and to me <I>they bore sons and daughters;</I>" 
 there were many among them that were devoted to God's honour, and 
 employed in his service, and were the strength and beauty of these 
 kingdoms, as children are of the families they are born in. In this 
 parable Samaria and the kingdom of Israel shall bear the name of 
 <I>Aholah--her own tabernacle,</I> because the places of worship which 
 that kingdom had were of their own devising, their own choosing, and 
 the worship itself was their own invention; God never owned it. <I>Her
 tabernacle to herself</I> (so some render it); "let her take it to 
 herself, and make her best of it." Jerusalem and the kingdom of Judah 
 bear the name of <I>Aholibah--my tabernacle is in her,</I> because 
 <I>their</I> temple was the place which God himself had <I>chosen</I> 
 to <I>put his name there.</I> He acknowledged it to be his, and 
 honoured them with the tokens of his presence in it. Note, Of those 
 that stand in relation to God, and make profession of his name, some 
 have greater privileges and advantages than others; and, as those who 
 have greater are thereby rendered the more inexcusable if they revolt 
 from God, so those who have less will not thereby be rendered 
 inexcusable. 

 3. The treacherous departure of the kingdom of Israel from God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Aholah played the harlot when she was mine.</I> Though the ten 
 tribes had deserted the house of David, yet God owned them for 
 <I>his</I> still; though Jeroboam, in setting up the golden calves, 
 <I>sinned, and made Israel to sin,</I> yet, as long as they worshipped 
 the God of Israel only, though by images, he did not quite cast them 
 off. But they way of sin is down-hill. Aholah played the harlot, 
 brought in the worship of Baal 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+16:31">1 Kings xvi. 31</A>),

 set up that other god, that dunghill-god, in competition with Jehovah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:21">1 Kings xviii. 21</A>),

 as a vile adulteress <I>dotes on her lovers,</I> because they are well
 dressed and make a figure, because they are young and handsome

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 <I>clothed with blue, captains and rulers, desirable young</I> men, 
 genteel, and that pass for men of honour, so she doted upon her 
 neighbours, particularly the Assyrians, who had extended their 
 conquests near them; she admired their idols and worshipped them, 
 admired the pomp of their courts and their military strength and 
 courted alliances with them upon any terms, as if her own God were not 
 sufficient to be depended upon. We find one of the kings of Israel 
 giving a <I>thousand talents</I> to the <I>king of Assyria,</I> to 
 engage him in his interests, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:19">2 Kings xv. 19</A>.

 She doted on the <I>chosen men of Assyria,</I> as worthy to be trusted
 and employed in the service of the state

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 and <I>on all their idols with which she defiled herself.</I> Note, 
 Whatever creature we dote upon, pay homage to, and put a confidence in, 
 we make an idol of that creature; and whatever we make an idol of we 
 defile ourselves with. And now again the conviction looks back as far 
 as the original of their nation: <I>Neither left she her whoredoms 
 which she brought from Egypt,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Their being idolaters in Egypt was a thing never to be forgotten--that 
 they should be in love with Egypt's idols even when they were 
 continually in fear of Egypt's tyrants and task-masters! But (as some 
 have observed) therefore, at that time, when Satan boasted of his 
 having <I>walked through the earth</I> as all his own, to disprove his 
 pretensions God did not say, Hast thou considered <I>my people Israel 
 in Egypt?</I> (for they had become idolaters, and were not to be 
 boasted of), but, <I>Hast thou considered my servant Job in the land of 
 Uz?</I> And this corrupt disposition in them, when they were first 
 formed into a people, is an emblem of that original corruption which is 
 born with us and is woven into our constitution, a strong bias towards 
 the world and the flesh, like that in the Israelites towards idolatry; 
 it was <I>bred in the bone</I> with them, and was charged upon them 
 long after, that they <I>left not their whoredoms brought from 
 Egypt.</I> It would never <I>out of the flesh,</I> though Egypt had 
 been a house of bondage to them. Thus the corrupt affections and 
 inclinations which we brought into the world with us we have not lost, 
 nor got clear of, but still retain them, though the iniquity we were 
 born in was the source of all the calamities which human life is liable 
 to. 

 4. The destruction of the kingdom of Israel for their apostasy from God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>):

 <I>I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers.</I> God first 
 justly gave her up to her lust (<I>Ephraim is joined to idols, let him 
 alone</I>), and then gave her up <I>to her lovers.</I> The neighbouring 
 nations, whose idolatries she had conformed to and whose friendship she 
 had confided in, and in both had affronted God, are now made use of as 
 the instruments of her destruction. The <I>Assyrians, on whom she 
 doted,</I> soon spied out the <I>nakedness of the land,</I> discovered 
 her blind side, on which to attack her, stripped her of all her 
 ornaments and all her defences, and so <I>uncovered</I> her, and 
 <I>made her naked and bare,</I> carried her <I>sons and daughters</I> 
 into captivity, <I>slew her with the sword,</I> and quite destroyed 
 that kingdom and put an end to it. We have the story at large

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:6">2 Kings xvii. 6</A>,

 &c., where the cause of the ruin of that once flourishing kingdom by
 the Assyrians is shown to be their forsaking the God of Israel, 
 <I>fearing other gods,</I> and <I>walking in the statutes of the 
 heathen;</I> it was for this that God was very <I>angry with them and 
 removed them out of his sight,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 And that the Assyrians, whom they had been so fond of, should be 
 employed in <I>executing judgments</I> upon them was very remarkable, 
 and shows how God, in a way of righteous judgment, often makes that a 
 scourge to sinners which they have inordinately set their hearts upon. 
 The devil will for ever be a tormentor to those impenitent sinners who 
 now hearken to him and comply with him as a tempter. Thus Samaria 
 became <I>famous among women,</I> or <I>infamous</I> rather; she 
 <I>became a name</I> (so the word is); not only she came to be the 
 subject of discourse, and much talked of, as the desolations of cities 
 and kingdoms fill the newspapers, but she was thus ruined for her 
 idolatries <I>in terrorem--for warning</I> to all people to take heed 
 of doing likewise; as the public execution of notorious malefactors 
 makes them such <I>a name,</I> such an ill name, as may serve to 
 frighten others from those wicked courses which have brought them to a 
 miserable and shameful end.

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  And when her sister Aholibah saw <I>this,</I> she was more
 corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms
 more than her sister in <I>her</I> whoredoms.
 &nbsp; 12  She doted upon the Assyrians <I>her</I> neighbours, captains and
 rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all
 of them desirable young men.
 &nbsp; 13  Then I saw that she was defiled, <I>that</I> they <I>took</I> both one
 way,
 &nbsp; 14  And <I>that</I> she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men
 portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed
 with vermilion,
 &nbsp; 15  Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed
 attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after
 the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their
 nativity:
 &nbsp; 16  And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon
 them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.
 &nbsp; 17  And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and
 they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with
 them, and her mind was alienated from them.
 &nbsp; 18  So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her
 nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind
 was alienated from her sister.
 &nbsp; 19  Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance
 the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the
 land of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 20  For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh <I>is as</I> the
 flesh of asses, and whose issue <I>is like</I> the issue of horses.
 &nbsp; 21  Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth,
 in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet Hosea, in his time, observed that the two tribes retained 
 their integrity, in a great measure, when the ten tribes had 
 apostatized 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:12">Hos. xi. 12</A>,

 <I>Ephraim indeed compasses me about with lies, but Judah yet rules 
 with God and is faithful with the saints;</I> and this was justly 
 expected from them: 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:15">Hos. iv. 15</A>,

 <I>Though thou Israel play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend</I>);
 but this lasted not long. By some unhappy matches made between the 
 house of David and the house of Ahab the worship of Baal had been 
 brought into the kingdom of Judah, but had been by the reforming kings 
 worked out again; and at the time of the captivity of the ten tribes, 
 which was in the reign of Hezekiah, things were in a good posture: but 
 it lasted not long. In the reign of Manasseh, soon after the kingdom of 
 Judah had seen the destruction of the kingdom of Israel, they became 
 more corrupt than Israel had been in their inordinate love of idols,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Instead of being made better by the warning which that destruction gave 
 them, they were made worse by it, as if they were <I>displeased because 
 the Lord had made that breach upon Israel,</I> and for that reason 
 became disaffected to him and to his service. Instead of being made to 
 stand in awe of him as a <I>jealous God,</I> they therefore grew 
 strange to him, and liked those gods better that would admit of 
 partners with them. Note, Those may justly expect God's judgments upon 
 themselves who do not take warning by his judgments upon others, who 
 see in others what is the end of sin and yet continue to make a light 
 matter of it. But it is bad indeed with those who are made worse by
 that which should make them better, and have their lusts irritated and 
 exasperated by that which was designed to suppress and subdue them.
 Jerusalem grew worse <I>in her whoredoms</I> than her sister Samaria 
 had been <I>in her whoredoms.</I> This was observed before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:51"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 51</A>),

 <I>Neither has Samaria committed half of thy sins.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Jerusalem, that had been a <I>faithful city, became a harlot,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:21">Isa. i. 21</A>.
 
 She also <I>doted upon the Assyrians</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 joined in league with them, joined in worship with them, grew to be in
 love with their <I>captains and rulers,</I> and cried them up as finer 
 and more accomplished gentlemen than any that ever the land of Israel 
 produced. "See how richly, how neatly, they are dressed, <I>clothed
 most gorgeously;</I> how well they sit a horse; they are <I>horsemen 
 riding on horses;</I> how charmingly they look, <I>all of them 
 desirable young men.</I>" And thus they grew to affect every thing that 
 was foreign and to despise their own nation; and even the religion of 
 it was mean and homely, and not to be compared with the curiosity and 
 gaiety of the heathen temples. Thus she <I>increased her whoredoms;</I> 
 she fell in love, fell in league, with the Chaldeans. Hezekiah himself 
 was faulty this way when he was proud of the court which the king of 
 Babylon made to him and complimented his ambassadors with the sight of 
 all his treasures, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+39:2">Isa. xxxix. 2</A>.
 
 And the humour increased
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);

 she doted upon the pictures of the Babylonian captains 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>),
 
 joined in alliance with that kingdom, invited them to come and settle 
 in Jerusalem, that they might refine the genius of the Jewish nation 
 and make it more polite; nay, they sent for patterns of their images, 
 altars, and temples, and made use of them in their worship. Thus was 
 she <I>polluted with her whoredoms</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 and thereby she <I>discovered her own whoredom</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 her own strong inclination to idolatry. And when she had had enough of 
 the Chaldeans, and grew tired of them and disposed to break her league 
 with them, as Jehoiakim and Zedekiah did, <I>her mind being alienated 
 from them,</I> she courted the <I>Egyptians, doted upon their 
 paramours</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 would come into an alliance with them, and, to strengthen the alliance, 
 would join with them in their idolatries and then depend upon them to 
 be their protectors from all other nations; for so wise, so rich, so 
 strong, was the Egyptian nation, and came to such perfection in 
 idolatry, that there was no nation now which they could take such 
 satisfaction in as in Egypt. Thus they <I>called to remembrance the 
 days of their youth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),
 
 the <I>lewdness of their youth,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 1. They pleased themselves with the remembrance of it. When they began 
 to set their affections upon Egypt, they encouraged themselves to put a 
 confidence in that kingdom, because of the old acquaintance they had 
 with it, as if they still retained the gust and relish of the <I>leeks 
 and onions</I> they ate there, or rather of the idolatrous worship they 
 learned there, and brought up with them thence. When they began an 
 acquaintance with Egypt they remembered how merrily their fathers 
 worshipped the golden calf, what music and dancing they had at that 
 sport, which they learned in Egypt; and they hoped they should now have 
 a fair pretence to come to that again. Thus <I>she multiplied her 
 whoredoms,</I> repeated her former whoredoms, and encouraged herself to 
 close with present temptations, by calling <I>to remembrance the days 
 of her youth.</I> Note, Those who, instead of reflecting upon their 
 former sins with sorrow and shame, reflect upon them with pleasure and 
 pride, contract new guilt thereby, strengthen their own corruptions, 
 and in effect bid defiance to repentance. This is returning <I>with the 
 dog to his vomit.</I> 

 2. They called it <I>God's remembrance,</I> and provoked him to 
 remember it against them. God had said indeed that he would reckon
 with them for <I>the golden calf,</I> that <I>idol of Egypt</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:34">Exod. xxxii. 34</A>);

 but such was his patience that he seemed to have forgotten it till
 they, by their league now with the Egyptians against the Chaldeans, 
 did, as it were, put him in mind of it; and in the day <I>when he 
 visits he will now,</I> as he has said, <I>visit for that.</I> It is 
 very observable how this adulteress changes her lovers: she dotes first 
 on the Assyrians; then she thought the Chaldeans finer and courted 
 them; after a while her mind was alienated from them, and she thought 
 the Egyptians more powerful

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>)

 and she must contract an intimacy with them. This shows the folly, 

 (1.) Of fleshly lusts; when they are indulged they grow humoursome and 
 fickle, are soon surfeited but never satisfied; they must have variety, 
 and what is loved one day is loathed the next. <I>Unius adulterium
 matrimonium vocant--One adultery is called marriage,</I> as Seneca 
 observes. 

 (2.) Of idolatry. Those who think one God too little will not think a 
 hundred sufficient, but will still be for trying more, as finding all 
 insufficient. 

 (3.) Of seeking to creatures for help; we go from one to another, but 
 are disappointed in them all, and can never rest till we have made the 
 God of Israel our help.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The faithful God justly gives a bill of divorce to this now 
 faithless city, that has <I>become a harlot.</I> His jealousy soon 
 discovered her lewdness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>I saw that she was defiled,</I> that she was debauched, and saw 
 which way her inclination was, that the <I>two sisters both took one 
 way,</I> and that Jerusalem grew worse than Samaria. For, <I>if we 
 stretch out our hand to a strange god, will not God search this 
 out?</I> No doubt he will; and when he has found it can he be pleased 
 with it? No 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>Then my mind was alienated from her, as it was from her sister.</I> 
 How could the pure and holy God any longer take delight in such a lewd 
 generation? Note, Sin alienates God's mind from the sinner, and justly, 
 for it is the alienation of the sinner's mind from God; but woe, and a 
 thousand woes, to those from whom God's mind is alienated; for whom he 
 turns from he will turn against.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>22  Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Behold, I
 will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is
 alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side;
 &nbsp; 23  The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and
 Koa, <I>and</I> all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable
 young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of
 them riding upon horses.
 &nbsp; 24  And they shall come against thee with chariots, waggons, and
 wheels, and with an assembly of people, <I>which</I> shall set against
 thee buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set
 judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to
 their judgments.
 &nbsp; 25  And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal
 furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine
 ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take
 thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by
 the fire.
 &nbsp; 26  They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away
 thy fair jewels.
 &nbsp; 27  Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy
 whoredom <I>brought</I> from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not
 lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.
 &nbsp; 28  For thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Behold, I will deliver thee
 into the hand <I>of them</I> whom thou hatest, into the hand <I>of them</I>
 from whom thy mind is alienated:
 &nbsp; 29  And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away
 all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the
 nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness
 and thy whoredoms.
 &nbsp; 30  I will do these <I>things</I> unto thee, because thou hast gone a
 whoring after the heathen, <I>and</I> because thou art polluted with
 their idols.
 &nbsp; 31  Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I
 give her cup into thine hand.
 &nbsp; 32  Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Thou shalt drink of thy sister's
 cup deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in
 derision; it containeth much.
 &nbsp; 33  Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the
 cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister
 Samaria.
 &nbsp; 34  Thou shalt even drink it and suck <I>it</I> out, and thou shalt
 break the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I
 have spoken <I>it,</I> saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 35  Therefore thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Because thou hast
 forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou
 also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Jerusalem stands indicted by the name of <I>Aholibah,</I> for that she, 
 as a false traitor to her sovereign Lord the God of heaven, not having 
 his fear before her eyes, but moved by the instigation of the devil, 
 had revolted from her allegiance to him, had compassed and imagined to 
 shake off his government, had kept up a correspondence had joined in 
 confederacy with his enemies, and the pretenders to a deity, in 
 contempt of his crown and dignity. To this indictment she has pleaded, 
 Not guilty: <I>I am not polluted; I have not gone after Baalim.</I> But 
 it is found against her by the notorious evidence of the fact, and she 
 stands convicted of it, nor has any thing material to offer why 
 judgment should not be given and execution awarded according to law.
 In these verses, therefore, we have the sentence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Her old confederates must be her executioners; and those whom she 
 had courted to be her leaders in sin are now to be employed as 
 instruments of her punishment 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 "<I>I will raise up thy lovers against thee,</I> the Chaldeans, whom 
 formerly thou didst so much admire and covet an acquaintance with, but 
 from whom thy mind is since alienated and with whom thou hast 
 perfidiously broken covenant." They are called <I>thy lovers</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>)
 
 and yet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>)

 <I>those whom thou hatest.</I> Note, It is common for sinful love soon 
 to turn into hatred; as Amnon's to Tamar. Those of headstrong and
 unreasonable passions are often very hot against those persons and 
 things that a little before they were as hot for. Fools run into 
 extremes; nay, and wise men may see cause to change their sentiments. 
 And therefore, as we should rejoice and weep as if we rejoiced not and 
 wept not, so we should love and hate as if we loved not and hated not. 
 <I>Ita ama tanquam osurus--Love as one who may have cause to feel 
 aversion.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The execution to be done upon her is very terrible.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Her enemies shall come against her <I>on every side</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),
 
 those of the several nations that constituted the Chaldean army 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 all of them <I>great lords and renowned,</I> whose pomp, and grandeur, 
 and splendid appearance made them look the more amiable when they came 
 as friends to protect and patronise Jerusalem, but the more formidable 
 when they came to chastise its treachery and aimed at no less than its 
 ruin. 
 
 (1.) They shall come with a great deal of military force 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 with <I>chariots and wagons</I> furnished with all necessary provisions
 for a camp, with arms and ammunition, bag and baggage, with a vast 
 army, and well armed. 

 (2.) They shall have justice on their side: "<I>I will set judgment 
 before them</I>" (they shall have right with them as well as might; for 
 the king of Babylon had just cause to make war upon the king of Judah, 
 because he had broken his league with him), "and therefore they 
 <I>shall judge thee,</I> not only according to God's judgments, as the 
 instruments of his justice, to punish thee for the indignities done to 
 him, but <I>according to their judgments,</I> according to the law of 
 nations, to punish thee for thy perfidious dealings with them." 

 (3.) They shall prosecute the war with a great deal of fury and 
 resentment. It being a war of revenge, <I>they shall deal with thee
 hatefully,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 This will make the execution the more severe that their swords will be 
 dipped in poison. Thou hatest them, and they shall deal hatefully with 
 thee; those that hate will be hated and will be hatefully dealt with. 
 
 (4.) God himself will lead them on, and his anger shall be mingled with
 theirs

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>I will set my jealousy against thee;</I> that shall kindle this 
 fire, and then <I>they shall deal furiously with thee.</I> If men deal 
 ever so hatefully, ever so furiously, with us, yet, if we have God on 
 our side, we need not fear them; they can do us no real hurt. But if 
 men deal furiously with us, and God set his jealousy against us too, 
 what will become of us?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The particulars of the sentence here passed upon this notorious 
 adulteress are, 

 (1.) That all she has shall be seized on. The <I>clothes</I> and the 
 <I>fair jewels,</I> with which she had endeavoured to recommend herself 
 to her lovers, these she shall be stripped of,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 All those things that were the ornaments of their state shall be taken 
 away: "<I>They shall take away all thy labour,</I> all that thou hast 
 gotten by thy labour, and shall <I>leave thee naked and bare,</I>" 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 Both city and country shall be impoverished and all the wealth of both 
 swept away. 

 (2.) That her children shall go into captivity. "They shall <I>take
 thy sons and thy daughters,</I> and make slaves of them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>);

 for they are <I>children of whoredoms,</I> unworthy the dignities and 
 privileges of Israelites," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:4">Hos. ii. 4</A>.

 (3.) That she shall be stigmatized and deformed: "They shall <I>take 
 away thy nose and thy ears,</I> shall mark thee for a harlot, and 
 render thee for ever odious,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 This intimates the many cruelties of the Chaldean soldiers towards the 
 Jews that fell into their hands, whom, it is probable, they used 
 barbarously. Some will have this to be understood figuratively; and by 
 the nose they think is meant the kingly dignity, and by the ears that 
 of the priesthood. 

 (4.) That she shall be exposed to shame: <I>Thy lewdness and thy 
 whoredoms shall be discovered</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 as, when a malefactor is punished, all his crimes are ripped up, and 
 repeated to his disgrace; what was secret then comes to light, and what 
 was done long since is then called to mind. 

 (5.) That she shall be quite cut off and ruined: "The <I>remnant</I> of 
 thy people that have escaped the famine and pestilence shall fall <I>by 
 the sword;</I> and the residue of thy houses that have not been 
 battered down about thy ears shall be <I>devoured by the fire,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 And this shall be the end of Jerusalem.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Because she has trod in the steps of Samaria's sins, she must 
 expect no other than Samaria's fate. It is common, in giving judgment, 
 to have an eye to precedents; so has God in passing this sentence on 
 Jerusalem 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>,

 &c.): "<I>Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister,</I>
 notwithstanding the warning thou hast had given thee, by the fatal 
 consequences of her wickedness; and therefore I <I>will give her 
 cup,</I> her portion of miseries, <I>into thy hand,</I> the cup of the 
 Lord's fury, which will be to thee a <I>cup of trembling.</I>" Now, 

 1. This cup is said to be <I>deep and large,</I> and to <I>contain
 much</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),

 abundance of God's wrath and abundance of miseries, the fruits of that 
 wrath. It is such a cup as that which we read of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:15,16">Jer. xxv. 15, 16</A>.

 The cup of divine vengeance holds a great deal, and so those will find
 into whose hand it shall be put.

 2. They shall be made to drink the very dregs of this cup, as the 
 <I>wicked</I> are said to do 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+75:8">Ps. lxxv. 8</A>):

 "<I>Thou shalt drink it and suck it out,</I> not because it is
 pleasant, but because it is forced upon thee

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>);

 <I>thou shalt break the shreds thereof,</I> and <I>pluck off thy own 
 breasts,</I> for indignation at the extreme bitterness of this cup, 
 being <I>full of the fury of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:20">Isa. li. 20</A>),

 as men in great anguish tear their hair, and throw every thing from
 them. Finding there is no remedy, but it must be drank (for <I>I have 
 spoken it, saith the Lord God</I>), thou shalt have no manner of 
 patience in the drinking of it."

 3. They shall be intoxicated by it, made sick, and be at their wits'
 end, as men in drink are, staggering, and stumbling, and ready to fall

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>):

 <I>Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow.</I> Note, 
 Drunkenness has sorrow attending it, to such a degree that the utmost 
 confusion and astonishment are here represented by it. Who would think 
 that that which is such a force upon nature, such a scandal to it, 
 which deprives men of their reason, disorders them to the last degree, 
 and is therefore expressive of the greatest misery, should yet be with 
 many a beloved sin, that they should damn their own souls to distemper 
 their own bodies? <I>Who has woe</I> and <I>sorrow</I> like them? 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:29">Prov. xxiii. 29</A>.

 4. Being so intoxicated, they shall become, as drunkards deserve to be, 
 a laughing-stock to all about them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):

 <I>Thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision,</I> as acting 
 ridiculously in every thing thou goest about. When God is about to ruin 
 a people he <I>makes their judges fools</I> and <I>pours contempt on 
 their princes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:17,21">Job xii. 17, 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. In all this God will be justified, and by all this they will be 
 reformed; and so the issue even of this will be God's glory and their 
 good. 

 1. They have been bad, very bad, and that justifies God in all that is
 brought upon them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 <I>I will do these things unto thee because thou hast gone a whoring 
 after the heathen,</I> and 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>)

 <I>because thou hast forgotten me and cast me behind thy back.</I> 
 Note, Forgetfulness of God, and a contempt of him, of his eye upon us 
 and authority over us, are at the bottom of all our treacherous 
 adulterous departures from him. <I>Therefore</I> men wander after
 idols, because they forget <I>God,</I> and their obligations to him; 
 nor could they look with so much desire and delight upon the baits of 
 sin if they did not first cast God <I>behind their back,</I> as not 
 worthy to be regarded. And those who put such an affront upon God, how 
 can they think but that it should turn upon themselves at last?
 <I>Therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms;</I> that 
 is, thou shalt <I>suffer the punishment</I> of them, and thou alone 
 must <I>bear the blame.</I> Men need no more to sink them than the 
 weight of their own sins; and those who will not part with their 
 lewdness and their whoredoms must bear them. 

 2. They shall be better, much better, and this fire, though consuming
 to many, shall be refining to a remnant

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee.</I> The judgments 
 which were brought upon them by their sins parted between them and 
 their sins, and taught them at length to say, <I>What have we to do any 
 more with idols?</I> Observe, 

 (1.) How inveterate the disease was: <I>Thy whoredoms were brought from 
 the land of Egypt.</I> Their disposition to idolatry was early and 
 innate, their practice of it was ancient, and had gained a sort of 
 prescription by long usage. 

 (2.) How complete the cure was notwithstanding: "Though it has taken 
 root, yet it shall be made to cease, so that thou shalt not so much as 
 <I>lift up thy eyes</I> to the idols again, nor <I>remember Egypt</I> 
 with pleasure <I>any more.</I>" They shall avoid the occasions of this 
 sin, for they shall not so much as look upon an idol, lest their hearts 
 should unawares <I>walk after their eyes.</I> And they shall abandon 
 all inclinations to it: "They shall <I>not remember Egypt;</I> they 
 shall not retain any of that affection for idols which they had from 
 the very infancy of their nation." They got it, through the corruption 
 of nature, in their bondage in Egypt, and lost it, through the grace of 
 God, in their captivity in Babylon, which this was the blessed fruit 
 of, even <I>the taking away of sin,</I> of <I>that</I> sin; so that 
 whereas, before the captivity, no nation (all things considered) was 
 more impetuously bent upon idols and idolatry than they were, after 
 that captivity no nation was more vehemently set against idols and 
 idolatry than they were, insomuch that at this day the image-worship 
 which is practised in the church of Rome confirms the Jews as much as 
 any thing in their prejudices against the Christian religion.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>36  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge
 Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations;
 &nbsp; 37  That they have committed adultery, and blood <I>is</I> in their
 hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and
 have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for
 them through <I>the fire,</I> to devour <I>them.</I>
 &nbsp; 38  Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my
 sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.
 &nbsp; 39  For when they had slain their children to their idols, then
 they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo,
 thus have they done in the midst of mine house.
 &nbsp; 40  And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far,
 unto whom a messenger <I>was</I> sent; and, lo, they came: for whom
 thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself
 with ornaments,
 &nbsp; 41  And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before
 it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.
 &nbsp; 42  And a voice of a multitude being at ease <I>was</I> with her: and
 with the men of the common sort <I>were</I> brought Sabeans from the
 wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful
 crowns upon their heads.
 &nbsp; 43  Then said I unto <I>her that was</I> old in adulteries, Will they
 now commit whoredoms with her, and she <I>with them?</I>
 &nbsp; 44  Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that
 playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto
 Aholibah, the lewd women.
 &nbsp; 45  And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the
 manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed
 blood; because they <I>are</I> adulteresses, and blood <I>is</I> in their
 hands.
 &nbsp; 46  For thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; I will bring up a company upon
 them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.
 &nbsp; 47  And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch
 them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their
 daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.
 &nbsp; 48  Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that
 all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.
 &nbsp; 49  And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye
 shall bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I <I>am</I>
 the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 After the ten tribes were carried into captivity, and that kingdom was 
 made quite desolate, the remains of it by degrees incorporated with the 
 kingdom of Judah, and gained a settlement (many of them) in Jerusalem; 
 so that the <I>two sisters</I> had in effect become <I>one</I> again; 
 and therefore, in these verses, the prophet takes those to task jointly 
 who were thus conjoined: "<I>Wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah</I> 
 together? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 Wilt thou go about to frame an excuse for them? Thou seest the matter 
 is so bad as not to bear an excuse." Or, rather, "Thou shalt now be 
 employed, in God's name, to <I>judge them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:4"><I>ch.</I> xx. 4</A>.
 
 The matter is rather worse than better since the union."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Let them be made to see the sins they are guilty of: <I>Declare unto 
 them</I> openly and boldly <I>their abominations.</I> 

 1. They have been guilty of gross idolatry, here called <I>adultery.
 With their idols they have committed adultery</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>),

 have broken their marriage-covenant with God, have lusted after the 
 gratifications of a carnal sensual mind in the worship of God. This is 
 the first and worst of the abominations he is to charge them with. 

 2. They have committed the most barbarous murders, in sacrificing
 their children to Moloch, a sin so unnatural that they deserve to hear 
 of it upon all occasions: <I>Blood is in their hands,</I> innocent 
 blood, the blood of their own children, which they have <I>caused to 
 pass through the fire</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>),

 not that they might be dedicated to the idols, but that they might be 
 devoured, a sign that they loved their idols better than that which was 
 dearest to them in the world. 

 3. They have profaned the sacred things with which God had dignified
 and distinguished them: This <I>they have done unto me,</I> this 
 indignity, this injury,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 Every contempt put upon that which is holy reflects upon him who is the 
 fountain of holiness, and from a relation to whom whatever is called 
 holy has its denomination. God had set up his sanctuary among them,
 but they defiled it, by making it a house of merchandise, a den of 
 thieves; nay, and much worse; there they set up their idols and 
 worshipped them, and there they shed the blood of God's prophets. God 
 had revealed to them his holy sabbaths, but they profaned them, by 
 doing all manner of servile work therein, or perhaps by sports and 
 recreations on that day, not only practised, but allowed and encouraged 
 by authority. They <I>defiled the sanctuary</I> on <I>the same day</I> 
 that they <I>profaned the sabbath.</I> To defile the sanctuary was bad 
 enough on any day, but to do it on the sabbath day was an aggravation.
 We commonly say, <I>The better day the better deed;</I> but here, the 
 better day the worse deed. God takes notice of the circumstances of sin 
 which add to the guilt. He shows 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>)

 what was their profanation both of the sanctuary and of the sabbath. 
 <I>They slew their children,</I> and sacrificed them <I>to their 
 idols,</I> to the great dishonour both of God and of human nature; and 
 then came, on <I>the same day,</I> their hands imbrued with the blood 
 of their children and their clothes stained with it, to attend in 
 <I>God's sanctuary,</I> not to ask pardon for what they had done, but 
 to present themselves before him, as other Israelites did, expecting 
 acceptance with him, notwithstanding these villanies which they were 
 guilty of; as if God either did not know their wickedness or did not 
 hate it. Thus they <I>profaned the sanctuary,</I> as if that were a 
 protection to the worst of malefactors; for thus they did <I>in the 
 midst of his house.</I> Note, It is a profanation of God's solemn 
 ordinances when those that are grossly and openly profane and vicious 
 impudently and impenitently so intrude upon the services and privileges 
 of them. <I>Give not that which is holy unto dogs. Friend, how camest
 thou in hither?</I> 

 4. They have courted foreign alliances, been proud of them, and reposed 
 a confidence in them. This also is represented by the sin of adultery, 
 for it was a departure from God, not only <I>to whom</I> alone they 
 ought to pay their homage and not to idols, but <I>in</I> whom alone 
 they ought to put their trust, and not in creatures. Israel was a 
 peculiar people, must <I>dwell alone</I> and not be <I>reckoned among 
 the nations;</I> and they profane their crown, and lay their honour in 
 the dust, when they covet to be like them or in <I>league</I> with 
 them. But this they have now done; they have entered into strict 
 alliances with the Assyrians, Chaldeans, and Egyptians, the most 
 renowned and potent kingdoms at that time; but they scorned alliances 
 with the petty kingdoms and states that lay near them, which yet might 
 have been of more real service to them. Note, Affecting an acquaintance 
 and correspondence with great people has often been a snare to good 
 people. Let us see how Jerusalem courts her high allies, thinking 
 thereby to make herself considerable.

 (1.) She privately requested that a public embassy might be sent to her

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>):

 You <I>sent a messenger for men to come from far.</I> It seems, then, 
 that the neighbours had no desire to come into a confederacy with 
 Jerusalem, but she thrust herself upon them, and sent under-hand to 
 desire them to court her: and, <I>lo, they came.</I> The wisest and 
 best may be drawn unavoidably into company and conversation with 
 profane and wicked people: but it is no sign either of wisdom or 
 goodness to covet an intimacy with such and to court it. 

 (2.) Great preparation was made for the reception of these foreign 
 ministers, for their public entry and public audience, which is 
 compared to the pains that an adulteress takes to make herself look 
 handsome. Jezebel-like, thou <I>paintedst thy face</I> and <I>deckedst 
 thyself with ornaments,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.

 The king and princes made themselves new clothes, fitted up the rooms 
 of state, beautified the furniture, and made it look fresh. Thou 
 <I>sattest upon a stately bed</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>),

 a stately throne; <I>a table was prepared, whereon thou has set my oil 
 and my incense.</I> This was either,

 [1.] A feast for the ambassadors, a noble treat, agreeable to the other 
 preparations. There was incense to perfume the room and oil to anoint 
 their heads. Or,

 [2.] An altar already furnished for the ambassadors' use in the worship 
 of their idols, to let them know that the Israelites were not so 
 strait-laced but that they could allow foreigners the free exercise of 
 their religion among them, and furnish them with chapels, yea, and 
 complimented them so far as to join with them in their devotions; 
 though the law of their God was against it, yet they could easily 
 dispense with themselves to oblige a friend. The oil and incense God 
 calls <I>his,</I> not only because they were the gift of his 
 providence, but because they should have been offered at his altar, 
 which was an aggravation of their sin in serving idols and idolaters 
 with them. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:8">Hos. ii. 8</A>.

 (3.) There was great joy at their coming, as if it were such a blessing 
 as never happened to Jerusalem before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>):

 <I>A voice of a multitude being at east was with her.</I> The people 
 were very easy, for they thought themselves very safe and happy now 
 that they had such powerful allies; and therefore attended the 
 ambassadors with loud huzzas and acclamations of joy. A great 
 confluence of people there was to the court upon this occasion. The 
 <I>men of the common sort</I> were there to grace the solemnity, and to 
 increase the crowd; and <I>with them were brought Sabeans from the 
 wilderness.</I> The margin reads it <I>drunkards from the 
 wilderness,</I> that would drink healths to the prosperity of this 
 grand alliance, and force them upon others, and be most noisy in 
 shouting upon this occasion. Whoever they were, in honour of the 
 ambassadors they put <I>bracelets upon their hands and beautiful crowns 
 upon their heads,</I> which made the cavalcade appear very splendid.
 
 (4.) God by his prophets warned them against making these dangerous 
 leagues with foreigners 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>):

 "<I>Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries,</I> that from the 
 first was fond of leagues with the heathen, of matching with their 
 families 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+3:6">Judg. iii. 6</A>),

 and afterwards of making alliances with their kingdoms, and, though
 often disappointed therein, would never be dissuaded from it (this was 
 the adultery she was old in), I said, <I>Will they now commit whoredoms 
 with her and she with them?</I> Surely experience and observation will 
 by this time have convinced both them and her that an alliance between 
 the nation of the Jews and a heathen nation can never be for the 
 advantage of either." They are <I>iron and clay,</I> that will not mix, 
 nor will God bless such an alliance, or smile upon it. But, it seems, 
 her being old in these adulteries, instead of weaning her from them, as 
 one would expect, does but make her the more impudent and insatiable in 
 them; for, though she was thus admonished of the folly of it, <I>yet 
 they went in unto her,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>.

 A bargain was soon clapped up, and a league made, first with this, and 
 then with the other, foreign state. Samaria did so, Jerusalem did so,
 like lewd women. They could not rest satisfied in the embraces of God's 
 laws and care, and the assurances of protection he gave them; they 
 could not think his covenant with them security enough. But they must
 by treaties and leagues, politic ones (they thought) and 
 well-concerted, throw themselves into the arms of foreign princes, and 
 put their interests under their protection. Note, Those hearts go a 
 whoring from God that take a complacency in the pomp of the world and 
 put a confidence in its wealth, and in an <I>arm of flesh,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:5">Jer. xvii. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Let them be made to foresee the judgments that are coming upon them 
 for these sins 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>):

 <I>The righteous men, they shall judge them.</I> Some make the 
 instruments of their destruction to be the righteous men that shall 
 judge them. The Assyrians that destroyed Samaria, the Chaldeans that 
 destroyed Jerusalem, those were comparatively righteous, had a sense of 
 justice between man and man and justly resented the treachery of the 
 Jewish nation; however, they executed God's judgments, which, we are 
 sure, are all righteous. Others understand it of the prophets, whose 
 office it was, in God's name, to judge them and pass sentence upon 
 them. Or we may take it as an appeal to all righteous men, to all that 
 have a sense of equity; they shall all judge concerning these cities, 
 and agree in their verdict, that forasmuch as they have been 
 notoriously guilty of adultery and murder, and the guilt is national, 
 therefore they ought to suffer the pains and penalties which by law are 
 inflicted upon women in their personal capacity that shed blood and are 
 adulteresses. Righteous men will say, "Why should bloody filthy cities 
 escape any better than bloody filthy persons? <I>Judge, I pray 
 thee,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:3">Isa. v. 3</A>.

 This judgment being given by the righteous men, the righteous God will
 award execution. See here,

 1. What the execution will be,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:46,47"><I>v.</I> 46, 47</A>.
 
 The same as before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>,

 &c. God will <I>bring a company</I> of enemies <I>upon them,</I> who
 shall be made to serve his holy purposes even when they are serving 
 their own sinful appetites and passions. These enemies shall easily 
 prevail, for God will <I>give them</I> into their hands <I>to be 
 removed and spoiled;</I> this company shall <I>stone them with 
 stones</I> as malefactors, shall <I>single them out</I> and <I>dispatch 
 them with their swords;</I> and, as was sometimes done in severe 
 executions (witness that of Achan), they shall <I>slay their children 
 and burn their houses.</I> 
 
 2. What will be the effects of it.

 (1.) Thus they shall suffer for their sins: Their <I>lewdness shall be 
 recompensed upon them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>);

 and they shall <I>bear the sins of their idols,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:35,39"><I>v.</I> 35, 49</A>.

 Thus God will assert the honour of his broken law and injured 
 government, and let the world know what a just and jealous God he is. 
 
 (2.) Thus they shall be broken off from their sins: <I>I will cause 
 lewdness to cease out of the land,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:27,48"><I>v.</I> 27, 48</A>.

 The destruction of God's city, like the death of God's saints, shall do 
 that for them which ordinances and providences before could not do; it 
 shall quite take away their sin, so that Jerusalem shall rise out of 
 its ashes a new lump, as gold comes out of the furnace purified from 
 its dross.

 (3.) Thus other cities and nations will have fair warning given them to 
 keep themselves from idols. That <I>all women may be taught not to do 
 after your lewdness.</I> This is the end of the punishment of 
 malefactors, that they may be made examples to others, who will <I>see 
 and fear. Smite the scorner and the simple will beware.</I> The 
 judgments of God upon some are designed to teach others, and happy are 
 those who receive instruction from them not to tread in the steps of 
 sinners, lest they be taken in their snares; those who would be taught 
 this must <I>know God is the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>),

 that he is the governor of the world, a God that judges in the earth, 
 and with whom there is <I>no respect of persons.</I></P>
