 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Ezekiel was now among the captives in Babylon, but they there had 
 Jerusalem still upon their hearts; the pious captives looked towards it 
 with an eye of faith (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:10">Daniel vi. 10</A>),

 the presumptuous ones looked towards it with an eye of pride, and
 flattered themselves with a conceit that they should shortly return 
 thither again; those that remained corresponded with the captives, and, 
 it is likely, bouyed them up with hopes that all would be well yet, as 
 long as Jerusalem was standing in its strength, and perhaps upbraided 
 those with their folly who had surrendered at first; therefore, to take 
 down this presumption, God gives the prophet, in this chapter, a very 
 clear and affecting foresight of the besieging of Jerusalem by the 
 Chaldean army and the calamities which would attend that siege. Two 
 things are here represented to him in vision:--

 I. The fortifications that should be raised against the city; this is
 signified by the prophet's laying siege to the portraiture of Jerusalem
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>)

 and laying first on one side and then on the other side before it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:4-8">ver. 4-8</A>.

 II. The famine that should rage within the city; this is signified by 
 his eating very coarse fare, and confining himself to a little of it, 
 so long as this typical representation lasted,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before
 thee, and portray upon it the city, <I>even</I> Jerusalem:
 &nbsp; 2  And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and
 cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set
 <I>battering</I> rams against it round about.
 &nbsp; 3  Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it <I>for</I> a
 wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face against
 it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against
 it. This <I>shall be</I> a sign to the house of Israel.
 &nbsp; 4  Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the
 house of Israel upon it: <I>according</I> to the number of the days
 that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity.
 &nbsp; 5  For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity,
 according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety
 days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.
 &nbsp; 6  And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right
 side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah
 forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year.
 &nbsp; 7  Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of
 Jerusalem, and thine arm <I>shall be</I> uncovered, and thou shalt
 prophesy against it.
 &nbsp; 8  And, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not
 turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days
 of thy siege.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet is here ordered to represent to himself and others by signs 
 which would be proper and powerful to strike the fancy and to affect 
 the mind, <I>the siege of Jerusalem;</I> and this amounted to a 
 prediction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He was ordered to engrave a draught of Jerusalem upon a tile, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+4:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 
 It was Jerusalem's honour that while she kept her integrity God had
 <I>graven her upon the palms of his hands</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:16">Isa. xlix. 16</A>),

 and the names of the tribes were engraven in precious stones on the
 breast-plate of the high priest; but, now that <I>the faithful city has 
 become a harlot,</I> a worthless brittle tile or brick is thought good 
 enough to <I>portray it upon.</I> This the prophet must lay before him, 
 that the eye may affect the heart.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He was ordered to build little forts against this portraiture of 
 the city, resembling the batteries raised by the besiegers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 Between the city that was besieged and himself that was the besieger he
 was to set up an <I>iron pan,</I> as an <I>iron wall,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 This represented the inflexible resolution of both sides; the Chaldeans 
 resolved, whatever it cost them, that they would make themselves 
 masters of the city and would never quit it till they had conquered it; 
 on the other side, the Jews resolved never to capitulate, but to hold 
 out to the last extremity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He was ordered to lie upon his side before it, as it were to 
 surround it, representing the Chaldean army lying before it to block it 
 up, to keep the meat from going in and the mouths from going out. He 
 was to lie on his left side 390 <I>days</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+4:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 about thirteen months; the siege of Jerusalem is computed to last 
 eighteen months 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:4-6">Jer. lii. 4-6</A>),

 but if we deduct from that five months' interval, when the besiegers
 withdrew upon the approach of Pharaoh's army

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+37:5-8">Jer. xxxvii. 5-8</A>),

 the number of the days of the close siege will be 390. Yet that also
 had another signification. The 390 days, according to the prophetic 
 dialect, signified 390 years; and, when the prophet lies so many days 
 on his side, he bears the guilt of that iniquity which <I>the house of 
 Israel,</I> the ten tribes, had borne 390 years, reckoning from their 
 first apostasy under Jeroboam to the destruction of Jerusalem, which 
 completed the ruin of those small remains of them that had incorporated 
 with Judah. He is then to lie forty days <I>upon his right side,</I> 
 and so long to bear <I>the iniquity of the house of Judah,</I> the 
 kingdom of the two tribes, because the measure-filling sins of that 
 people were those which they were guilty of during the last forty years 
 before their captivity, since the thirteenth year of Josiah, when 
 Jeremiah began to prophesy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:1,2">Jer. i. 1, 2</A>),

 or, as some reckon it, since the eighteenth, when the book of the law
 was found and the people renewed their covenant with God. When they 
 persisted in their impieties and idolatries, notwithstanding they had 
 such a prophet and such a prince, and were brought into the bond of 
 such a covenant, what could be expected but ruin without remedy? Judah, 
 that had such helps and advantages for reformation, fills the measure 
 of its iniquity in less time than Israel does. Now we are not to think 
 that the prophet lay constantly night and day upon his side, but every 
 day, for so many days together, at a certain time of the day, when he 
 received visits, and company came in, he was found lying 390 <I>days on 
 his left side</I> and <I>forty days on his right side</I> before his 
 portraiture of Jerusalem, which all that saw might easily understand to 
 mean the close besieging of that city, and people would be flocking in 
 daily, some for curiosity and some for conscience, at the hour 
 appointed, to see it and to take their different remarks upon it. His 
 being found constantly on the same side, as if <I>bands were laid upon 
 him</I> (as indeed they were by the divine command), so that he could 
 not <I>turn himself from one side to another till he had ended the days 
 of the siege,</I> did plainly represent the close and constant 
 continuance of the besiegers about the city during that number of days, 
 till they had gained their point.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He was ordered to prosecute the siege with vigour 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Thou shalt set thy face towards the siege of Jerusalem,</I> as 
 wholly intent upon it and resolved to carry it; so the Chaldeans would 
 be, and neither bribed nor forced to withdraw from it. Nebuchadnezzar's 
 indignation at Zedekiah's treachery in breaking his league with him 
 made him very furious in pushing on this siege, that he might chastise 
 the insolence of that faithless prince and people; and his army 
 promised themselves a rich booty of that pompous city; so that both set 
 their faces against it, for they were very resolute. Nor were they less 
 active and industrious, exerting themselves to the utmost in all the 
 operations of the siege, which the prophet was to represent by the 
 <I>uncovering of his arm,</I> or, as some read it, the <I>stretching 
 out</I> of his arm, as it were to deal blows about without mercy. When 
 God is about to do some great work he is said to <I>make bare his 
 arm,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:10">Isa. lii. 10</A>.

 In short, The Chaldeans will go about their business, and go on in it,
 as men in earnest, who resolve to go through with it. Now,

 1. This is intended to be a <I>sign to the house of Israel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 both to those in Babylon, who were eye-witnesses of what the prophet 
 did, and to those also who remained in their own land, who would hear 
 the report of it. The prophet was <I>dumb</I> and <I>could not 
 speak</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:26"><I>ch.</I> iii. 26</A>);

 but as his silence had a voice, and upbraided the people with their
 deafness, so even then God <I>left not himself without witness,</I> but 
 ordered him to make signs, as dumb men are accustomed to do, and as 
 Zacharias did when he was dumb, and by them to <I>make known his 
 mind</I> (that is, the mind of God) to the people. And thus likewise 
 the people were upbraided with their stupidity and dulness, that they 
 were not capable of being taught as men of sense are, by words, but 
 must be taught as children are, by pictures, or as deaf men are, by 
 signs. Or, perhaps, they are hereby upbraided with their malice against 
 the prophet. Had he spoken in words at length what was signified by 
 these figures, they would have entangled him in his talk, would have 
 indicted him for treasonable expressions, for they knew how to <I>make 
 a man an offender for a word</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:21">Isa. xxix. 21</A>),

 to avoid which he is ordered to make use of signs. Or the prophet made
 use of signs for the same reason that Christ made use of parables, that 
 <I>hearing they might hear and not understand,</I> and <I>seeing they 
 might see and not perceive,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:14,15">Matt. xiii. 14, 15</A>.

 They would not understand what was plain, and therefore shall be taught
 by that which is difficult; and herein the Lord was righteous.

 2. Thus the prophet <I>prophesies against Jerusalem</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 and there were those who not only understood it so, but were the more 
 affected with it by its being so represented, for images to the eye 
 commonly make deeper impressions upon the mind than words can, and for 
 this reason sacraments are instituted to represent divine things, that 
 we might see and believe, might see and be affected with those things; 
 and we may expect this benefit by them, and a blessing to go along with 
 them, while (as the prophet here) we make use only of such signs as God 
 himself has expressly appointed, which, we must conclude, are the 
 fittest. Note, The power of imagination, if it be rightly used, and
 kept under the direction and correction of reason and faith, may be of 
 good use to kindle and excite pious and devout affections, as it was 
 here to Ezekiel and his attendants. "<I>Methinks I see</I> so and so, 
 myself dying, time expiring, the world on fire, the dead rising, the 
 great tribunal set, and the like, may have an exceedingly good 
 influence upon us: for fancy is like fire, a <I>good servant, but a bad 
 master.</I>" 

 3. This whole transaction has that in it which the prophet might, with
 a good colour of reason, have hesitated at and excepted against, and 
 yet, in obedience to God's command, and in execution of his office, he 
 did it according to order.

 (1.) It seemed childish and ludicrous, and beneath his gravity, and 
 there were those that would ridicule him for it; but he knew the divine 
 appointment put honour enough upon that which otherwise seemed mean to 
 save his reputation in the doing of it. 

 (2.) It was toilsome and tiresome to do as he did; but our ease as well 
 as our credit must be sacrificed to our duty, and we must never call 
 God's service in any instance of it a hard service.

 (3.) It could not but be very much against the grain with him to appear 
 thus against Jerusalem, the city of God, the holy city, to act as an 
 enemy against a place to which he was so good a friend; but he is a 
 prophet, and must follow his instructions, not his affections, and must 
 plainly preach the ruin of a sinful place, though its welfare is what 
 he passionately desires and earnestly prays for. 

 4. All this that the prophet sets before the children of his people
 concerning the destruction of Jerusalem is designed to bring them to 
 repentance, by showing them sin, the provoking cause of this 
 destruction, sin the ruin of that once flourishing city, than which 
 surely nothing could be more effectual to make them hate sin and turn 
 from it; while he thus in lively colours describes the calamity with a 
 great deal of pain and uneasiness to himself, he is <I>bearing the 
 iniquity of Israel and Judah.</I> "Look here" (says he) "and see what 
 work sin makes, what an <I>evil and bitter thing it is to depart form 
 God;</I> this comes of sin, your sins and the sin of your fathers; let 
 that therefore be the daily matter of your sorrow and shame now in your 
 captivity, that you may make your peace with God and he may return in 
 mercy to you." But observe, It is a day of punishment for a year of 
 sin: <I>I have appointed thee each day for a year.</I> The siege is a 
 calamity of 390 days, in which God reckons for the iniquity of 390 
 years; justly therefore d they acknowledge that God had <I>punished 
 them less than their iniquity deserved,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+9:13">Ezra ix. 13</A>.

 But let impenitent sinners know that, though now God is long-suffering
 towards them, in the other world there is an everlasting punishment. 
 When God <I>laid bands</I> upon the prophet, it was to show them how 
 they were <I>bound with the cords of their own transgression</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+1:14">Lam. i. 14</A>),

 and therefore they were now <I>holden in the cords of affliction.</I>
 But we may well think of the prophet's case with compassion, when God 
 laid upon him the bands of duty, as he does on all his ministers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:16">1 Cor. ix. 16</A>,

 <I>Necessity is laid upon me, and woe unto me if I preach not the
 gospel</I>); and yet men laid upon him bonds of restraint

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:25"><I>ch.</I> iii. 25</A>);

 but under both it is satisfaction enough that they are serving the
 interests of God's kingdom among men.</P>

 polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of
 that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came
 there abominable flesh into my mouth.
 &nbsp; 15  Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow's dung for
 man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith.
 &nbsp; 16  Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break
 the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by
 weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and
 with astonishment:
 &nbsp; 17  That they may want bread and water, and be astonied one with
 another, and consume away for their iniquity.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The best exposition of this part of Ezekiel's prediction of Jerusalem's 
 desolation is Jeremiah's lamentation of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:3,4,5:10">Lam. iv. 3, 4, &c., 
 and v. 10</A>,

 where he pathetically describes the terrible famine that was in
 Jerusalem during the siege and the sad effects of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The prophet here, to affect the people with the foresight of it, 
 must confine himself for 390 days to coarse fare and short commons, and 
 that ill-dressed, for they should want both food and fuel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His meat, for the quality of it, was to be of the worst bread, made 
 of but little wheat and barley, and the rest of beans, and lentiles, 
 and millet, and fitches, such as we feed horses or fatted hogs with, 
 and this mixed, as mill corn, or as that in the beggar's bag, that has 
 a dish full of one sort of corn at one house and of another at another 
 house; of such corn as this must the prophet's bread be made while he 
 underwent the fatigue of lying on his side, and needed something better 
 to support him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Note, It is our wisdom not to be too fond of dainties and pleasant 
 bread, because we know not what hard meat we may be tied to, nay, and 
 may be glad of, before we die. The meanest sort of food is better than 
 we deserve, and therefore must not be despised nor wasted, nor must 
 those that use it be looked upon with disdain, because we know not what 
 may be our own lot.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. For the quantity of it, it was to be of the least that a man could 
 be kept alive with, to signify that the besieged should be reduced to 
 short allowance and should hold out till all <I>the bread in the city 
 was spent,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+37:21">Jer. xxxvii. 21</A>.

 The prophet must eat but twenty <I>shekels'</I> weight of bread a day

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 that was about ten ounces; and he must drink but the <I>sixth part of a 
 hin of water,</I> that was half a pint, about eight ounces, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+4:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 The stint of the Lessian diet is fourteen ounces of meat and sixteen of 
 drink. The prophet in Babylon had bread enough and to spare, and was by 
 the river side, where there was plenty of water; and yet, that he might 
 confirm his own prediction and be a sign to the children of Israel, God 
 obliges him to live thus sparingly, and he submits to it. Note, God's 
 servants must learn to endure hardness, and to deny themselves the use 
 of lawful delights, when they may thereby serve the glory of God, 
 evidence the sincerity of their faith, and express their sympathy with 
 their brethren in affliction. The body must be <I>kept under and 
 brought into subjection.</I> Nature is content with a little, grace 
 with less, but lust with nothing. It is good to stint ourselves of 
 choice, that we may the better bear it if ever we should come to be 
 stinted by necessity. And in times of public distress and calamity it
 ill becomes us to make much of ourselves, as those that <I>drank wine 
 in bowls</I> and <I>were not grieved for the affliction of Joseph,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:4-6">Amos vi. 4-6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. For the dressing of it, he must <I>bake it with a man's dung</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 that must be dried, and serve for fuel to heat his oven with. The 
 thought of it would almost turn one's stomach; yet the coarse bread, 
 thus baked, he must <I>eat as barley-cakes,</I> as freely as if it were 
 the same bread he had been used to. This nauseous piece of cookery he 
 must exercise publicly <I>in their sight,</I> that they might be the 
 more affected with the calamity approaching, which was signified by it, 
 that in the extremity of the famine they should not only have nothing 
 that was dainty, but nothing that was cleanly, about them; they must 
 take up with what they could get. <I>To the hungry soul every bitter 
 thing is sweet.</I> This circumstance of the sign, the baking of his 
 bread with man's dung, the prophet with submission humbly desired might 
 be dispensed with 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);

 it seemed to have in it something of a ceremonial pollution, for there 
 was a law that man's dung should <I>be covered with earth,</I> that God 
 might <I>see no unclean thing in their camp,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:13,14">Deut. xxiii. 13, 14</A>.

 And must he go and gather a thing so offensive, and use it in the
 dressing of his meat in the sight of the people? "<I>Ah! Lord God,</I>" 
 says he, "<I>behold, my soul has not been polluted,</I> and I am afraid 
 lest by this it be polluted." Note, The pollution of the soul by sin is 
 what good people dread more than any thing; and yet sometimes tender 
 consciences fear it without cause, and perplex themselves with scruples 
 about lawful things, as the prophet here, who had not yet learned that 
 it is not that which <I>goes into the mouth that defiles the man,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:11">Matt. xv. 11</A>.

 But observe he does not plead, "Lord, from my youth I have been brought
 up delicately and have never been used to any thing but what was clean 
 and nice" (and there were those who were so brought up, who in the 
 siege of Jerusalem did <I>embrace dunghills,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:5">Lam. iv. 5</A>),
 
 but that he had been brought up conscientiously, and had never eaten
 any thing that was forbidden by the law, that <I>died of itself</I> or 
 was <I>torn in pieces;</I> and therefore, "Lord, do not put this upon 
 me now." Thus Peter pleaded 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:14">Acts x. 14</A>),

 <I>Lord, I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.</I>
 Note, it will be comfortable to us, when we are reduced to hardships, 
 if our hearts can witness for us that we have always been careful to 
 abstain from sin, even from little sins, and the <I>appearances of 
 evil.</I> Whatever God commands us, we may be sure, is good; but, if we 
 be put upon any thing that we apprehend to be evil, we should argue 
 against it, from this consideration, that hitherto we have preserved 
 our purity--and shall we lose it now? Now, because Ezekiel with a 
 manifest tenderness of conscience made this scruple, God dispensed with 
 him in this matter. Note, Those who have power in their hands should
 not be rigorous in pressing their commands upon those that are 
 dissatisfied concerning them, yea, though their dissatisfactions be 
 groundless or arising from education and long usage, but should recede 
 from them rather than grieve or offend the weak, or put a 
 stumbling-block before them, in conformity to the example of God's 
 condescension to Ezekiel, though we are sure his authority is 
 incontestable and all his commands are wise and good. God allowed
 Ezekiel to use <I>cow's dung</I> instead of <I>man's dung,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+4:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 This is a tacit reflection upon man, as intimating that he being 
 polluted with sin his filthiness is more nauseous and odious than that 
 of any other creature. <I>How much more abominable and filthy is 
 man!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+15:16">Job xv. 16</A>.</P>

 II. Now this sign is particularly explained here; it signified,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That those who remained in Jerusalem should be brought to extreme 
 misery for want of necessary food. All supplies being cut off by the 
 besiegers, the city would soon find the want of the country, for <I>the 
 king himself is served of the field;</I> and thus <I>the staff of 
 bread</I> would be <I>broken in Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+4:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 God would not only take away from the bread its power to nourish, so 
 that <I>they should eat and not be satisfied</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:26">Lev. xxvi. 26</A>),

 but would take away the bread itself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:1">Isa. iii. 1</A>),

 so that what little remained should be <I>eaten by weight,</I> so much 
 a day, so much a head, that they might have an equal share and might 
 make it last as long as possible. But to what purpose, when they could 
 not make it last always, and the besieged must be tired out before the 
 besiegers? They should eat and drink <I>with care,</I> to make it go as 
 far as might be, and with <I>astonishment,</I> when they saw it almost 
 spent and knew not which way to look for a recruit. They should <I>be 
 astonished one with another;</I> whereas it is ordinarily some 
 alleviation of a calamity to have others share with us in it 
 (<I>Solamen miseris socios habuisse doloris</I>), and some ease to the 
 spirit to complain of the burden, it should be an aggravation of the 
 misery that it was universal, and their complaining to one another 
 should but make them all the more uneasy and increase the 
 <I>astonishment.</I> And the event shall be as bad as their fears; they 
 cannot make it worse than it is, for <I>they shall consume away for 
 their iniquity;</I> multitudes of them shall die of famine, a lingering 
 death, worse than that by <I>the sword</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:9">Lam. iv. 9</A>);

 they shall dies so as to <I>feel themselves die.</I> And it is sin that
 brings all this misery upon them: <I>They shall consume away in their 
 iniquity</I> (so it may be read); they shall continue hardened and 
 impenitent, and shall die in their sins, which is more miserable than 
 to die on a dunghill. Now,

 (1.) Let us see here what woeful work sin makes with a people, and 
 acknowledge the righteousness of God herein. Time was when <I>Jerusalem 
 was filled with the finest of the wheat</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:14">Ps. cxlvii. 14</A>);

 but now it would be glad of the coarsest, and cannot have it.
 <I>Fulness of bread,</I> as it was one of Jerusalem's mercies, so it 
 had become one of her sins, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:49">Ezek. xvi. 49</A>.

 The plenty was abused to luxury and excess, which were therefore thus
 justly punished with famine. It is a righteous thing with God to 
 deprive us of those enjoyments which we have made the food and fuel of 
 our lusts.

 (2.) Let us see what reason we have to bless God for plenty, not only 
 for the fruits of the earth, but for the freedom of commerce, that the 
 husbandman can have money for his bread and the tradesman bread for his 
 money, that there is abundance not only in the field, but in the 
 market, that those who live in cities and great towns, though they 
 <I>sow not,</I> neither do they <I>reap,</I> are yet fed from day to 
 day with food convenient.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It signified that those who were carried into captivity should be 
 forced to <I>eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 to eat meat made up by Gentile hands otherwise than according to the 
 law of the Jewish church, which they were always taught to call 
 <I>defiled,</I> and which they would have as great an aversion to as a 
 man would have to bread prepared with dung, that is (as perhaps it may 
 be understood) kneaded and moulded with dung. Daniel and his fellows 
 confined themselves to <I>pulse and water,</I> rather than they would 
 <I>eat the portion of the king's meat</I> assigned them, because they 
 apprehended it would defile them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:8">Dan. i. 8</A>.

 Or they should be forced to eat putrid meat, such as their oppressors
 would allow them in their slavery, and such as formerly they would have 
 scorned to touch. Because they <I>served not God</I> with cheerfulness 
 in the abundance of all things, God will make them serve their enemies 
 in the want of all things.</P>
