 The waters of the sanctuary which this prophet saw in vision 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+47:1"><I>ch.</I> xlvii. 1</A>)

 are a proper representation of this prophecy. Hitherto the waters have
 been sometimes but to the ankles, in other places to the knees, or to 
 the loins, but now the waters have risen, and have become "a river 
 which cannot be passed over." Here is one continued vision, beginning 
 at this chapter, to the end of the book, which is justly looked upon to 
 be one of the most difficult portions of scripture in all the book of 
 God. The Jews will not allow any to read it till they are thirty years 
 old, and tell those who do read it that, though they cannot understand 
 every thing in it, "when Elias comes he will explain it." Many 
 commentators, both ancient and modern, have owned themselves at a loss 
 what to make of it and what use to make of it. But because it is hard 
 to be understood we must not therefore throw it by, but humbly search 
 concerning it, get as far as we can into it and as much as we can out 
 of it, and, when we despair of satisfaction in every difficulty we meet 
 with, bless God that our salvation does not depend upon it, but that 
 things necessary are plain enough, and wait till God shall reveal even 
 this unto us. These chapters are the more to be regarded because the 
 last two chapters of the Revelation seem to have a plain allusion to 
 them, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:1-15">Rev. xx.</A>

 has to the foregoing prophecy of Gog and Magog. Here is the vision of a
 glorious temple (in this chapter and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+41:1-42:20"><I>ch.</I> xli. and xlii.</A>),

 of God's taking possession of it
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:1-27"><I>ch.</I> xliii.</A>),

 orders concerning the priests that are to minister in this temple

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:1-31"><I>ch.</I> xliv.</A>),

 the division of the land, what portion should be allotted for the
 sanctuary, what for the city, and what for the prince, both in his 
 government of the people and his worship of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:1-25"><I>ch.</I> xlv.</A>),

 and further instructions for him and the people,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+46:1-24"><I>ch.</I> xlvi.</A>

 After the vision of the holy waters we have the borders of the holy
 land, and the portions assigned to the tribes, and the dimensions and 
 gates of the holy city,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+47:1-48:35"><I>ch.</I> xlvii., xlviii.</A>

 Some make this to represent what had been during the flourishing state
 of the Jewish church, how glorious Solomon's temple was in its best 
 days, that the captives might see what they had lost by sin and might 
 be the more humbled. But that seems not probable. The general scope of 
 it I take to be, 

 1. To assure the captives that they should not only return to their own
 land, and be settled there, which had been often promised in the 
 foregoing chapters, but that they should have, and therefore should be 
 encouraged to build, another temple, which God would own, and where he 
 would meet them and bless them, that the ordinances of worship should 
 be revived, and the sacred priesthood should there attend; and, though 
 they should not have a king to live in such splendour as formerly, yet 
 they should have a prince or ruler (who is often spoken of in this 
 vision), who should countenance the worship of God among them and
 should himself be an example of diligent attendance upon it, and that 
 prince, priests, and people, should have a very comfortable settlement 
 and subsistence in their own land. 

 2. To direct them to look further than all this, and to expect the 
 coming of the Messiah, who had before been prophesied of under the name 
 of David because he was the man that projected the building of the 
 temple and that should set up a spiritual temple, even the 
 gospel-church, the glory of which should far exceed that of Solomon's 
 temple, and which should continue to the end of time. The dimensions
 of these visionary buildings being so large (the new temple more 
 spacious than all the old Jerusalem and the new Jerusalem of greater 
 extent than all the land of Canaan) plainly intimates, as Dr. Lightfoot 
 observes, that these things cannot be literally, but must spiritually, 
 understood. At the gospel-temple, erected by Christ and his apostles, 
 was so closely connected with the second material temple, was erected 
 so carefully just at the time when that fell into decay, that it might 
 be ready to receive its glories when it resigned them, that it was 
 proper enough that they should both be referred to in one and the same 
 vision. Under the type and figure of a temple and altar, priests and 
 sacrifices, is foreshown the spiritual worship that should be performed 
 in gospel times, more agreeable to the nature both of God and man, and 
 that perfected at last in the kingdom of glory, in which perhaps these 
 visions will have their full accomplishment, and some think in some 
 happy and glorious state of the gospel-church on this side heaven, in 
 the latter days.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the
 beginning of the year, in the tenth <I>day</I> of the month, in the
 fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame
 day the hand of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was upon me, and brought me thither.
 &nbsp; 2  In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel,
 and set me upon a very high mountain, by which <I>was</I> as the frame
 of a city on the south.
 &nbsp; 3  And he brought me thither, and, behold, <I>there was</I> a man,
 whose appearance <I>was</I> like the appearance of brass, with a line
 of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the
 gate.
 &nbsp; 4  And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes,
 and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I
 shall shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew <I>them</I> unto
 thee <I>art</I> thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to
 the house of Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The date of this vision. It was in the twenty-fifth year of
 Ezekiel's captivity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 which some compute to be the thirty-third year of the first captivity, 
 and is here said to be the <I>fourteenth year after the city was 
 smitten.</I> See how seasonably the clearest and fullest prospects of 
 their deliverance were given, when they were in the depth of their 
 distress, and an assurance of the return of the morning when they were 
 in the midnight of their captivity: "Then <I>the hand of the Lord was 
 upon me</I> and <I>brought me thither</I> to Jerusalem, now that it was 
 in ruins, desolate and deserted"--a pitiable sight to the prophet. 

 2. The scene where it was laid. The prophet was brought, <I>in the
 visions of God, to the land of Israel,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 And it was not the first time that he had been brought thither in 
 vision. We had him carried to Jerusalem to see it in its iniquity and
 shame

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:3"><I>ch.</I> viii. 3</A>);

 here he is carried thither to have a pleasing prospect of it in its
 glory, though its present aspect, now that it was quite depopulated, 
 was dismal. He was set <I>upon a very high mountain,</I> as Moses upon 
 the top of Pisgah, to view this land, which was now a second time a 
 <I>land of promise,</I> not yet in possession. From the top of this 
 mountain he saw <I>as the frame of a city,</I> the plan and model of 
 it; but this city was a temple as large as a city. The <I>New 
 Jerusalem</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:22">Rev. xxi. 22</A>)

 had <I>no temple therein;</I> this which we have here is <I>all 
 temple,</I> which comes much to one. It is a city for men to dwell in;
 it is a temple for God to dwell in; for in the church on earth God 
 dwells with men, in that in heaven men dwell with God. Both these are 
 framed in the counsel of God, framed by infinite wisdom, and all very 
 good. 

 3. The particular discoveries of this city (which he had at first a
 general view of) were made to him by <I>a man whose appearance was like
 the appearance of brass</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 not a created angel, but Jesus Christ, who should be found in fashion 
 as a man, that he might both discover and build the gospel-temple. He 
 brought him to this city, for it is through Christ that we have both 
 acquaintance with and access to the benefits and privileges of God's 
 house. He it is that <I>shall build the temple of the Lord,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:13">Zech. vi. 13</A>.

 His appearing like brass intimates both his brightness and his
 strength. John, in vision, saw <I>his feet like unto fine brass,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:15">Rev. i. 15</A>.

 4. The dimensions of this city or temple, and the several parts of it, 
 were taken with a <I>line of flax</I> and a <I>measuring reed,</I> or 
 <I>rod</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 as carpenters have both their line and a wooden measure. The temple of 
 God is built by line and rule; and those that would let others into the 
 knowledge of it must do it by that line and rule. The church is formed 
 according to the scripture, <I>the pattern in the mount.</I> That is 
 the line and the measuring reed that is in the hand of Christ. With 
 that doctrine and laws ought to be measured, and examined by that; for 
 then peace is upon the Israel of God when they <I>walk according to 
 that rule.</I> 

 5. Directions are here given to the prophet to receive this revelation
 from the Lord and transmit it pure and entire to the church,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 (1.) He must carefully observe every thing that was said and done in 
 this vision. His attention is raised and engaged 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>Behold with thy eyes</I> all that is <I>shown thee</I> (do not only 
 see it, but look intently upon it), and <I>hear with thy ears</I> all 
 that is <I>said to thee;</I> diligently hearken to it, and be sure 
 <I>to set thy heart upon it;</I> attend with a fixedness of thought and 
 a close application of mind." What we see of the works of God, and what 
 we hear of the word of God, will do us no good unless we set out hearts 
 upon it, as those that reckon ourselves nearly concerned in it, and 
 expect advantage to our souls by it. 

 (2.) He must faithfully <I>declare it to the house of Israel,</I> that 
 they may have the comfort of it. Therefore he receives, that he may
 give. Thus the <I>Revelation of Jesus Christ</I> was lodged in the
 hands of John, that he might signify it to the churches,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:1">Rev. i. 1</A>.

 And, because he is to declare it as a message from God, he must 
 therefore be fully apprised of it himself and much affected with it. 
 Note, Those who are to preach God's word to others ought to study it 
 well themselves and set their hearts upon it. Now the reason given why
 he must both observe it himself and declare it to the house of Israel 
 is because to this intent he is brought hither, and has it shown to 
 him. Note, When the things of God are shown to us it concerns us to 
 consider to what intent they are shown to us, and, when we are sitting 
 under the ministry of the word, to consider to what intent we are 
 brought thither, that we may answer the end of our coming, and may not 
 receive the grace of God, in showing us such things, in vain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about,
 and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits <I>long</I> by
 the cubit and a hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the
 building, one reed; and the height, one reed.
 &nbsp; 6  Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and
 went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the
 gate, <I>which was</I> one reed broad; and the other threshold <I>of the
 gate, which was</I> one reed broad.
 &nbsp; 7  And <I>every</I> little chamber <I>was</I> one reed long, and one reed
 broad; and between the little chambers <I>were</I> five cubits; and
 the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within <I>was</I>
 one reed.
 &nbsp; 8  He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.
 &nbsp; 9  Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the
 posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate <I>was</I>
 inward.
 &nbsp; 10  And the little chambers of the gate eastward <I>were</I> three on
 this side, and three on that side; they three <I>were</I> of one
 measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that
 side.
 &nbsp; 11  And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten
 cubits; <I>and</I> the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.
 &nbsp; 12  The space also before the little chambers <I>was</I> one cubit
 <I>on this side,</I> and the space <I>was</I> one cubit on that side: and
 the little chambers <I>were</I> six cubits on this side, and six
 cubits on that side.
 &nbsp; 13  He measured then the gate from the roof of <I>one</I> little
 chamber to the roof of another: the breadth <I>was</I> five and twenty
 cubits, door against door.
 &nbsp; 14  He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post
 of the court round about the gate.
 &nbsp; 15  And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face
 of the porch of the inner gate <I>were</I> fifty cubits.
 &nbsp; 16  And <I>there were</I> narrow windows to the little chambers, and
 to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the
 arches: and windows <I>were</I> round about inward: and upon <I>each</I>
 post <I>were</I> palm trees.
 &nbsp; 17  Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, <I>there
 were</I> chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about:
 thirty chambers <I>were</I> upon the pavement.
 &nbsp; 18  And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the
 length of the gates <I>was</I> the lower pavement.
 &nbsp; 19  Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower
 gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, a hundred
 cubits eastward and northward.
 &nbsp; 20  And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the
 north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof.
 &nbsp; 21  And the little chambers thereof <I>were</I> three on this side
 and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches
 thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length
 thereof <I>was</I> fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty
 cubits.
 &nbsp; 22  And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees,
 <I>were</I> after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the
 east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches
 thereof <I>were</I> before them.
 &nbsp; 23  And the gate of the inner court <I>was</I> over against the gate
 toward the north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate
 to gate a hundred cubits.
 &nbsp; 24  After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate
 toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the
 arches thereof according to these measures.
 &nbsp; 25  And <I>there were</I> windows in it and in the arches thereof
 round about, like those windows: the length <I>was</I> fifty cubits,
 and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
 &nbsp; 26  And <I>there were</I> seven steps to go up to it, and the arches
 thereof <I>were</I> before them: and it had palm trees, one on this
 side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The measuring-reed which was in the hand of the surveyor-general was 
 mentioned before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 Here we are told 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 what was the exact length of it, which must be observed, because the 
 house was measured by it. It was <I>six cubits long,</I> reckoning, not 
 by the common cubit, but the <I>cubit of the sanctuary,</I> the sacred 
 cubit, by which it was fit that this holy house should be measured, and 
 that was a hand-breadth (that it, four inches) longer than the common 
 cubit: the common cubit was eighteen inches, this twenty-two, see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:13"><I>ch.</I> xliii. 13</A>.

 Yet some of the critics contend that this <I>measuring-reed</I> was but
 six common cubits in length, and one handbreadth added to the whole. 
 The former seems more probable. Here is an account,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Of the outer wall of the house, which encompassed it round, which 
 was three yards thick and three yards high, which denotes the 
 separation between the church and the world on every side and the 
 divine protection which the church is under. If a wall of this vast 
 thickness will not secure it, God himself will be <I>a wall of fire 
 round about it;</I> whoever attack it will do so at their peril.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Of the several gates with the chambers adjoining to them. Here is 
 no mention of the outer court of all, which was called the <I>court of 
 the Gentiles,</I> some think because in gospel-times there should be 
 such a vast confluence of Gentiles to the church that their court 
 should be left unmeasured, to signify that the worshippers in that 
 court should be unnumbered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:9,11,12">Rev. vii. 9, 11, 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He begins with the <I>east gate,</I> because that was the usual way 
 of entering into the lower end of the temple, the holy of holies being 
 at the west end, in opposition to the idolatrous heathen that 
 worshipped towards the east. Now, in the account of this gate, observe, 
 
 (1.) That he went up to it by <I>stairs</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 for the gospel-church was exalted above that of the Old Testament, and 
 when we go to worship God we must ascend; so is the call, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:1">Rev. iv. 1</A>.
 
 Come up hither. <I>Sursum corda--Up with your hearts.</I> 

 (2.) That the chambers adjoining to the gates were but <I>little 
 chambers,</I> about ten feet square,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 These were for those to lodge in who attended the service of the house. 
 And it becomes such as are made spiritual priests to God to content 
 themselves with little chambers and not to seek great things to 
 themselves; so that we may but have a place within the verge of God's 
 court we have reason to be thankful though it be in a little chamber, a 
 mean apartment, though we be but door-keepers there. 

 (3.) The chambers, as they were each of them four-square, denoting 
 their stability and due proportion and their exact agreement with the 
 rule (for they were each of them one reed long and one reed broad), so 
 they were all of <I>one measure,</I> that there might be an equality 
 among the attendants on the service of the house. 

 (4.) The chambers were very many; for in our Father's house there are 
 <I>many mansions</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:2">John xiv. 2</A>),

 in his house above, and in that here on earth. In the secret of his
 tabernacle shall those be hid, and in a safe pavilion, whose desire is 
 to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of their life,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:4,5">Ps. xxvii. 4, 5</A>.

 Some make these chambers to represent the particular congregations of
 believers, which are parts of the great temple, the universal church, 
 which are, and must be, framed by the scripture-line and rule, and 
 which Jesus Christ takes the measure of, that is, takes cognizance of, 
 for he walks in the midst of the seven golden candle-sticks.

 (5.) It is said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 <I>He made also the posts.</I> He that now measured them was the same 
 that made them; for Christ is the builder of his church and therefore 
 is best able to give us the knowledge of it. And his reducing them to 
 the rule and standard is called his making them, for no account is made 
 of them further than they agree with that. <I>To the law and to the 
 testimony.</I> 

 (6.) Here are posts of sixty cubits, which, some think, was literally 
 fulfilled when Cyrus, in his edict for rebuilding the temple at 
 Jerusalem, ordered that the height thereof should be sixty cubits, that 
 is, thirty yards and more, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:3">Ezra vi. 3</A>.

 (7.) Here were windows to the little chambers, and windows to <I>the 
 posts and arches</I> (that is, to the cloisters below), and <I>windows 
 round about</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 to signify the light from heaven with which the church is illuminated; 
 divine revelation is let into it for instruction, direction, and 
 comfort, to those that dwell in God's house, light to work by, light to 
 walk by, light to see themselves and one another by. There were lights 
 to the little chambers; even the least, and least considerable, parts 
 and members of the church, shall have light afforded them. <I>All thy 
 children shall be taught of the Lord.</I> But they are <I>narrow 
 windows,</I> as those in the temple, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:4">1 Kings vi. 4</A>.

 The discoveries made to the church on earth are but narrow and scanty
 compared with what shall be in the future state, when we shall no 
 longer <I>see through a glass darkly.</I>

 (8.) Divers courts are here spoken of, an outermost of all, then an 
 outer court, then an inner, and then the innermost of all, into which 
 the priests only entered, which (some think) may put us in mind "of the 
 diversities of gifts, and graces, and offices, in the several members 
 of Christ's mystical body here, as also of the several degrees of glory 
 in the courts and mansions of heaven, as there are stars in several 
 spheres and stars of several magnitudes in the fixed firmament." 
 <I>English Annotations.</I> Some draw nearer to God than others and 
 have a more intimate acquaintance with divine things; but to a child of 
 God a day in any of his courts is <I>better than a thousand</I> 
 elsewhere. These courts had porches, or piazzas, round them, for the 
 shelter of those that attended in them from wind and weather; for when 
 we are in the way of our duty to God we may believe ourselves to be 
 under his special protection, that he will graciously provide for us, 
 nay, that he will himself be to us <I>a covert from the storm and 
 tempest,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+4:5,6">Isa. iv. 5, 6</A>.
 
 (9.) On the posts were palm-trees engraven

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 to signify that <I>the righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree</I> 
 in the courts of God's house, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:12">Ps. xcii. 12</A>.

 The more they are depressed with the burden of affliction the more
 strongly do they grow, as they say of the palm-trees. It likewise 
 intimates the saints' victory and triumph over their spiritual enemies; 
 they have <I>palms in their hands</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:9">Rev. vii. 9</A>);

 but lest they should drop these, or have them snatched out of their 
 hands, they are here engraven upon the posts of the temple as perpetual 
 monuments of their honour. <I>Thanks be to God, who always causes us
 to triumph.</I> Nay, believers shall themselves be made pillars in the 
 temple of our God, and shall <I>go no more out,</I> and shall have his 
 name engraven on them, which will be their brightest ornament and 
 honour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:12">Rev. iii. 12</A>.

 (10.) Notice is here taken of the pavement of the court,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.

 The word intimates that the pavement was made of 
 <I>porphyry--stone,</I> which was of the colour of <I>burning 
 coals;</I> for the brightest and most sparkling glories of this world 
 should be put and kept under our feet when we draw near to God and are 
 attending upon him. The stars are, as it were, the <I>burning 
 coals,</I> or stones of a <I>fiery colour,</I> with which the pavement 
 of God's celestial temple is laid; and, if the pavement of the court be 
 so bright and glittering, how glorious must we conclude the mansions of 
 that house to be!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The gates that looked towards the north 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>)

 and towards the south 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 with their appurtenances, are much the same with that towards the east, 
 <I>after the measure of the first gate,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 But the description is repeated very particularly. And thus largely
 was the structure of the tabernacle related in Exodus, and of the 
 temple in the books of Kings and Chronicles, to signify the special 
 notice God does take, and his ministers should take, of all that belong 
 to his church. His delight is in them; his eye is upon them. He knows 
 all that are his, all his living temples and all that belongs to them. 
 Observe, 

 (1.) This temple had not only a gate towards the east, to let into it 
 the <I>children of the east,</I> that were famous for their wealth and 
 wisdom, but it had a gate to the north, and another to the south, for 
 the admission of the poorer and less civilized nations. The new 
 Jerusalem has <I>twelve gates,</I> three towards each quarter of the 
 world

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:13">Rev. xxi. 13</A>);

 for many shall come from all parts to sit down there,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:11">Matt. viii. 11</A>.

 (2.) To those gates they went up by steps, <I>seven steps</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:22-26"><I>v.</I> 22-26</A>),

 which, as some observe, may remind us of the necessity of advancing in 
 grace and holiness, adding one grace to another, going from step to 
 step, <I>from strength to strength,</I> still pressing forward towards 
 perfection--upward, upward, towards heaven, the temple above.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have a delineation of the inner court. The survey of 
 the outer court ended with the south side of it. This of the inner 
 court begins with the south side 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),
 
 proceeds to the east 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),
 
 and so to the north 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>);

 for here is no gate either of the outer or inner court towards the 
 <I>west.</I> It should seem that in Solomon's temple there were gates 
 westward, for we find porters towards the west, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:24,26:8">1 Chron. ix. 24; xxvi. 8</A>.

 But Josephus says that in the second temple there was no gate on the
 west side. Observe,

 1. These gates into the inner court were exactly uniform with those
 into the outer court, the dimensions the same, the chambers adjoining 
 the same, the galleries or rows round the court the same, and the very 
 engravings on the posts the same. The work of grace, and its workings, 
 are the same, for substance, in grown Christians that they are in young 
 beginners, only that the former have got so much nearer their 
 perfection. The faith of all the saints is alike precious, though it be 
 not alike strong. There is a great resemblance between one child of God 
 and another; for <I>all they are brethren</I> and bear the same image. 

 2. The ascent into the outer court at each gate was by <I>seven 
 steps,</I> but the ascent into the inner court at each gate was by 
 <I>eight steps.</I> This is expressly taken notice of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:31,34,37"><I>v.</I> 31, 34, 37</A>),
 
 to signify that the nearer we approach to God the more we should rise 
 above this world and the things of it. The people, who worshipped in
 the outer court, must rise seven steps above other people, but the 
 priests, who attended in the inner court, must rise eight steps above 
 them, must exceed them at least one step more than they exceed other 
 people.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>39  And in the porch of the gate <I>were</I> two tables on this side,
 and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering
 and the sin offering and the trespass offering.
 &nbsp; 40  And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the
 north gate, <I>were</I> two tables; and on the other side, which <I>was</I>
 at the porch of the gate, <I>were</I> two tables.
 &nbsp; 41  Four tables <I>were</I> on this side, and four tables on that
 side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew
 <I>their sacrifices.</I>
 &nbsp; 42  And the four tables <I>were</I> of hewn stone for the burnt
 offering, of a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half
 broad, and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the
 instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the
 sacrifice.
 &nbsp; 43  And within <I>were</I> hooks, a hand broad, fastened round
 about: and upon the tables <I>was</I> the flesh of the offering.
 &nbsp; 44  And without the inner gate <I>were</I> the chambers of the
 singers in the inner court, which <I>was</I> at the side of the north
 gate; and their prospect <I>was</I> toward the south: one at the side
 of the east gate <I>having</I> the prospect toward the north.
 &nbsp; 45  And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect <I>is</I>
 toward the south, <I>is</I> for the priests, the keepers of the charge
 of the house.
 &nbsp; 46  And the chamber whose prospect <I>is</I> toward the north <I>is</I>
 for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these
 <I>are</I> the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near
 to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> to minister unto him.
 &nbsp; 47  So he measured the court, a hundred cubits long, and an
 hundred cubits broad, four-square; and the altar <I>that was</I> before
 the house.
 &nbsp; 48  And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured
 <I>each</I> post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five
 cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate <I>was</I> three
 cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.
 &nbsp; 49  The length of the porch <I>was</I> twenty cubits, and the breadth
 eleven cubits; and <I>he brought me</I> by the steps whereby they went
 up to it: and <I>there were</I> pillars by the posts, one on this
 side, and another on that side.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have an account,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Of the tables that were in the porch of the gates of the inner 
 court. We find no description of the altars of burnt-offerings in the 
 midst of that court till 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:43:13"><I>ch.</I> xliii. 13</A>.

 But, because the one altar under the law was to be exchanged for a
 multitude of tables under the gospel, here is <I>early notice</I> taken 
 of the tables, at our entrance into the inner court; for till we come 
 to partake of the <I>table of the Lord</I> we are but professors at 
 large; our admission to that is our entrance into the inner court. But 
 in this gospel-temple we meet with no altar till after the glory of the 
 Lord has taken possession of it, for Christ is our altar, that 
 sanctifies every gift. Here were eight tables provided, whereon to 
 <I>slay the sacrifices,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>.

 We read not of any tables for this purpose either in the tabernacle or 
 in Solomon's temple. But here they are provided, to intimate the 
 multitude of spiritual sacrifices that should be brought to God's house 
 in gospel-times, and the multitude of hands that should be employed in 
 offering up those sacrifices. Here were the shambles for the altar; 
 here were the dressers on which they laid the flesh of the sacrifice, 
 the knives with which they cut it up, and the hooks on which they hung 
 it up, that it might be ready to be offered on the altar 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>),

 and there also they washed the burnt-offerings 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>),

 to intimate that before we draw near to God's altar we must have every 
 thing in readiness, must wash our hands, our hearts, those spiritual 
 sacrifices, and so <I>compass God's altar.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The use that some of the chambers mentioned before were put to. 

 1. Some were for the <I>singers,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>.

 It should seem they were first provided for before any other that 
 attended this temple-service, to intimate, not only that the singing of 
 psalms should still continue a gospel-ordinance, but that the gospel 
 should furnish all that embrace it with abundant matter for joy and 
 praise, and give them occasion to <I>break forth into singing,</I> 
 which is often foretold concerning gospel times, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+96:1,98:1">Ps. xcvi. 1; xcviii. 1</A>.
 
 Christians should be singers. <I>Blessed are those that dwell in God's
 house,</I> they will be <I>still praising him.</I> 

 2. Others of them were for <I>the priests,</I> both those that kept 
 <I>the charge of the house,</I> to cleanse it, and to see that none 
 came into it to pollute it, and to keep it in good repair

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>),

 and those that <I>kept the charge of the altar</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>),

 that <I>came near to the Lord to minister to him.</I> God will find 
 convenient lodging for all his servants. Those that do the work of his
 house shall enjoy the comforts of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Of the inner court, the court of the priests, which was fifty 
 yards square, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>.

 The altar that <I>was before the house</I> was placed in the midst of 
 this court, over-against the three gates, and, standing in a direct 
 line with the three gates of the outer court, when the gates were set 
 open all the people in the outer court might through them be spectators 
 of the service done at the altar. Christ is both our altar and our 
 sacrifice, to whom we must look with an eye of faith in all our 
 approaches to God, and he is salvation in the midst of the earth 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:12">Ps. lxxiv. 12</A>),
 
 to be looked unto from all quarters.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Of the porch of the house. The temple is called the house, 
 emphatically, as if no other house were worthy to be called so. Before 
 this house there was a porch, to teach us not to rush hastily and 
 inconsiderately into the presence of God, but gradually, that is, 
 gravely, and with solemnity, passing first through the outer court,
 then the inner, then the porch, ere we enter into the house. Between 
 this porch and the altar was a place where the priests used to pray, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:17">Joel ii. 17</A>.

 In the porch, besides the posts on which the doors were hung, there
 were pillars, probably for state and ornament, like <I>Jachin</I> and 
 <I>Boaz--He will establish; in him is strength,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>.

 In the gospel church every thing is strong and firm, and every thing
 ought to be kept in its place and to be done decently and in order.</P>
