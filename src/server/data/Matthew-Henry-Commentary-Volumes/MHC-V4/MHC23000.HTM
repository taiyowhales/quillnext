 P<FONT SIZE=-1>ROPHET</FONT> is a title that sounds very great to those 
 that understand it, though, in the eye of the world, many of those that 
 were dignified with it appeared very mean. A prophet is one that has a 
 great intimacy with Heaven and a great interest there, and consequently 
 a commanding authority upon earth. Prophecy is put for all divine 
 revelation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:20,21">2 Pet. i. 20, 21</A>),

 because that was most commonly by dreams, voices, or visions,
 communicated to prophets first, and by them to the children of men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:6">Num. xii. 6</A>.

 Once indeed God himself spoke to all the thousands of Israel from the
 top of Mount Sinai; but the effect was so intolerably dreadful that 
 they entreated God would for the future speak to them as he had done 
 before, by men like themselves, <I>whose terror should not make them 
 afraid, nor their hands be heavy upon them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:7">Job xxxiii. 7</A>.

 God approved the motion (<I>they have well said,</I> says he,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+5:27,28">Deut. v. 27, 28</A>),

 and the matter was then settled by consent of parties, that we must
 never expect to hear from God any more in that way, but by prophets, 
 who received their instructions immediately from God, with a charge to 
 deliver them to his church. Before the sacred canon of the Old 
 Testament began to be written there were prophets, who were instead of 
 Bibles to the church. Our Saviour seems to reckon Abel among the 
 prophets, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:31,35">Matt. xxiii. 31, 35</A>.

 Enoch was a prophet; and by him <I>that</I> was first in prediction
 which is to be last in execution--the judgment of the great day. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:14">Jude 14</A>,

 <I>Behold, the Lord comes with his holy myriads.</I> Noah was a
 preacher of righteousness. God said of Abraham, He <I>is a prophet,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:7">Gen. xx. 7</A>.
 
 Jacob foretold things to come,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:1">Gen. xlix. 1</A>.
 
 Nay, all the patriarchs are called <I>prophets.</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:15">Ps. cv. 15</A>,

 <I>Do my prophets no harm.</I> Moses was, beyond all comparison, the
 most illustrious of all the Old-Testament prophets, for with him the 
 Lord spoke <I>face to face,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+34:10">Deut. xxxiv. 10</A>.

 He was the first writing prophet, and by his hand the first foundations
 of holy writ were laid. Even those that were called to be his
 assistants in the government had the spirit of prophecy, such a 
 plentiful effusion was there of that spirit at that time,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:25">Num. xi. 25</A>.

 But after the death of Moses, for some ages, the Spirit of the Lord
 appeared and acted in the church of Israel more as a martial spirit 
 than as a spirit of prophecy, and inspired men more for acting than 
 speaking. I mean in the time of the judges. We find the Spirit of the 
 Lord coming upon Othniel, Gideon, Samson, and others, for the service 
 of their country, with their swords, not with their pens. Messages were 
 then sent from heaven by angels, as to Gideon and Manoah, and to the 
 people,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:1">Judges ii. 1</A>.

 In all the book of judges there is never once mention of a prophet,
 only Deborah is called a prophetess. Then the word of the Lord was 
 precious; there was no open vision,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:1">1 Sam. iii. 1</A>.

 They had the law of Moses, recently written; let them study that. But
 in Samuel prophecy revived, and in him a famous epocha, or period of 
 the church began, a time of great light in a constant uninterrupted 
 succession of prophets, till some time after the captivity, when the 
 canon of the Old Testament was completed in Malachi, and then prophecy 
 ceased for nearly 400 years, till the coming of the great prophet and 
 his forerunner. Some prophets were divinely inspired to write the 
 histories of the church. But they did not put their names to their 
 writings; they only referred for proof to the authentic records of 
 those times, which were known to be drawn up by prophets, as Gad, Iddo, 
 &c. David and others were prophets, to write sacred songs for the use 
 of the church. After them we often read of prophets sent on particular 
 errands, and raised up for special public services, among whom the most 
 famous were Elijah and Elisha in the kingdom of Israel. But none of 
 these put their prophecies in writing, nor have we any remains of them 
 but some fragments in the histories of their times; there was nothing 
 of their own writing (that I remember) but one epistle of Elijah's, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+21:12">2 Chron. xxi. 12</A>.

 But towards the latter end of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel, it
 pleased God to direct his servants the prophets to write and publish 
 some of their sermons, or abstracts of them. The dates of many of their 
 prophecies are uncertain, but the earliest of them was in the days of 
 Uzziah king of Judah, and Jeroboam the second, his contemporary, king 
 of Israel, about 200 years before the captivity, and not long after 
 Joash had slain Zechariah the son of Jehoiada in the courts of the 
 temple. If they begin to murder the prophets, yet they shall not murder 
 their prophecies; these shall remain as witnesses against them. Hosea 
 was the first of the writing prophets; and Joel, Amos, and Obadiah, 
 published their prophecies about the same time. Isaiah began some time
 after, and not long; but his prophecy is placed first, because it is 
 the largest of them all, and has most in it of him to whom all the 
 prophets bore witness; and indeed so much of Christ that he is justly 
 styled the <I>Evangelical Prophet,</I> and, by some of the ancients, 
 <I>a fifth Evangelist.</I> We shall have the general title of this book

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)

 and therefore shall here only observe some things,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Concerning the prophet himself. He was (if we may believe the 
 tradition of the Jews) of the royal family, his father being (they say)
 brother to king Uzziah. He was certainly much at court, especially in 
 Hezekiah's time, as we find in his story, to which many think it is 
 owing that his style is more curious and polite than that of some other 
 of the prophets, and, in some places, exceedingly lofty and soaring. 
 The Spirit of God sometimes served his own purpose by the particular 
 genius of the prophet; for prophets were not speaking trumpets, 
 <I>through</I> which the Spirit spoke, but speaking men, <I>by</I> whom 
 the Spirit spoke, making use of their natural powers, in respect both 
 of light and flame, and advancing them above themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Concerning the prophecy. It is transcendently excellent and useful; 
 it was so to the church of God then, serving for conviction of sin, 
 direction in duty, and consolation in trouble. Two great distresses of 
 the church are here referred to, and comfort prescribed in reference to 
 them, that by Sennacherib's invasion, which happened in his own time, 
 and that of the captivity in Babylon, which happened long after; and in 
 the supports and encouragements laid up for each of these times of need 
 we find abundance of the grace of the gospel. There are not so many 
 quotations in the gospels out of any, perhaps not out of all, the 
 prophecies of the Old Testament, as out of this; nor such express 
 testimonies concerning Christ, witness that of his being born of a 
 virgin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:1-25"><I>ch.</I> vii.</A>)

 and that of his sufferings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:1-12"><I>ch.</I> liii</A>.

 The beginning of this book abounds most with reproofs for sin and
 threatenings of judgment; the latter end of it is full of wood words 
 and comfortable words. This method the Spirit of Christ took formerly 
 in the prophets and does still, first to convince and then to comfort; 
 and those that would be blessed with the comforts must submit to the 
 convictions. Doubtless Isaiah preached many sermons, and delivered
 many messages to the people, which are not written in this book, as 
 Christ did; and probably these sermons were delivered more largely and 
 fully than they are here related, but so much is left on record as 
 Infinite Wisdom thought fit to convey to us <I>on whom the ends of the 
 world have come;</I> and these prophecies, as well as the histories of 
 Christ, are written <I>that we might believe on the name of the Son of 
 God, and that, believing, we might have life through his name; for to 
 us is the gospel here preached as well as unto those</I> that lived 
 then, and more clearly. O that it may be mixed with faith!</P>
