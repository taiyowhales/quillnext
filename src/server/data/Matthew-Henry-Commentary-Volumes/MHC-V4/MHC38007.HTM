 We have done with the visions, but not with the revelations of this 
 book; the prophet sees no more such signs as he had seen, but still 
 "the word of the Lord came to him." In this chapter we have, 

 I. A case of conscience proposed to the prophet by the children of the
 captivity concerning fasting, whether they should continue their solemn 
 fasts which they had religiously observed during the seventy years of 
 their captivity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+7:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. The answer to this question, which is given in this and the next
 chapter; and this answer was given not all at once, but by piece-meal,
 and, it should seem, at several times, for here are four distinct
 discourses which have all of them reference to this case, each of them
 prefaced with "the word of the Lord came,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:8,8:1,18">ver. 4-8 
 and ch. viii. 1, 18</A>.

 The method of them is very observable. In this chapter, 

 1. The prophet sharply reproves them for the mismanagements of their
 fasts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+7:4-7">ver. 4-7</A>.

 2. He exhorts them to reform their lives, which would be the best way
 of fasting, and to take heed of those sins which brought those
 judgments upon them which they kept these fasts in memory of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+7:8-14">ver. 8-14</A>.

 And then in the next chapter, having searched the wound, he binds it 
 up, and heals it, with gracious assurances of great mercy God had yet 
 in store for them, by which he would turn their fasts into feasts.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, <I>that</I>
 the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto Zechariah in the fourth <I>day</I> of
 the ninth month, <I>even</I> in Chisleu;
 &nbsp; 2 When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and
 Regem-melech, and their men, to pray before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 &nbsp; 3 <I>And</I> to speak unto the priests which <I>were</I> in the house of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in
 the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many
 years?
 &nbsp; 4 Then came the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 5 Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests,
 saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh
 <I>month,</I> even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me,
 <I>even</I> to me?
 &nbsp; 6 And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat
 <I>for yourselves,</I> and drink <I>for yourselves?</I>
 &nbsp; 7 <I>Should ye</I> not <I>hear</I> the words which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath cried by
 the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in
 prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, when <I>men</I>
 inhabited the south and the plain?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This occasional sermon, which the prophet preached, and which is 
 recorded in this and the next chapter, was above two years after the 
 former, in which he gave them an account of his visions, as appears by 
 comparing the date of this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+7:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 in the <I>ninth month</I> of the <I>fourth year</I> of Darius, with the 
 date of that

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:1"><I>ch.</I> i. 1</A>),

 in the eighth month of the second year of Darius; not that Zechariah
 was idle all that while (it is expressly said that he and Haggai 
 continued <I>prophesying</I> till the temple was finished in the sixth 
 year of Darius; 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:14,15">Ezra vi. 14, 15</A>),

 but during that time he did not preach any sermon that was afterwards
 published, and left upon record, as this is. God may be honoured, his
 work done, and his interest served, by word of mouth as well as by 
 writing; and by inculcating and pressing what has been taught, as well 
 as by advancing something new. Now here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A case proposed concerning fasting. Some persons were sent to
 enquire of the priests and prophets whether they should continue to 
 observe their yearly fasts, particularly that in the fifth month, as 
 they had done. It is uncertain whether the case was put by those that 
 yet remained in Babylon, who, being deprived of the benefit of the 
 solemn feasts which God's ordinance appointed them, made up the want by 
 the solemn fasts which God's providences called them to; or by those 
 that had returned, but lived in the country, as some rather incline to 
 think, because they are called the <I>people of the land,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+7:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 But, as to that, the answer given to the messengers of the captive Jews 
 might be directed, not to them only, but to <I>all the people.</I> 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Who they were that came with this enquiry--<I>Sherezer</I> and
 <I>Regem-melech,</I> persons of some rank and figure, for they came 
 <I>with their men,</I> and did not think it below them, or any 
 disparagement to them, to be sent on this errand, but rather an 
 addition to their honour to be, 

 (1.) Attendants in God's house, there to do duty and receive orders. 
 The greatest of men are less than the least of the ordinances of Jesus 
 Christ. 

 (2.) Agents for God's people, to negotiate their affairs. Men of 
 estates, having more leisure than men of business, ought to employ 
 their time in the service of the public, and by doing good they make 
 themselves truly great; the <I>messengers of the churches</I> were the 
 <I>glory of Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:23">2 Cor. viii. 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What the errand was upon which they came. They were sent perhaps not 
 with <I>gold and silver</I> (as those, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:10,11"><I>ch.</I> vi. 10, 11</A>),

 or, if they were, that is not mentioned, but upon the two great errands
 which should bring us all to the house of God, 

 (1.) to intercede with God for his mercy. They were sent to <I>pray 
 before the Lord,</I> and, some think (according to the usage then), to 
 <I>offer sacrifice,</I> with which they offered up their prayers. The 
 Jews, in captivity, prayed towards the temple (as appears 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:10">Dan. vi. 10</A>);
 
 but now that it was in a fair way to be rebuilt they sent their
 representatives to pray in it, remembering that God had said that his 
 house should be called <I>a house of prayer for all people,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:7">Isa. lvi. 7</A>.

 In prayer we must set ourselves as <I>before the Lord,</I> must see his 
 eye upon us and have our eye up to him.

 (2.) To enquire of God concerning his mind. Note, When we offer up our
 requests to God it must be with a readiness to receive instructions 
 from him; for, if we turn away our ear from hearing his law, we cannot 
 expect that our prayers should be acceptable to him. We must therefore 
 desire to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of our life 
 <I>that we may enquire</I> there 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:4">Ps. xxvii. 4</A>),

 asking, not only, Lord, what wilt thou do for me? but, Lord <I>what
 wilt thou have me to do?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Whom they consulted. They spoke <I>to the priests that were in the 
 house of the Lord and to the prophets;</I> the former were an oracle 
 for ordinary cases, the latter for extraordinary; they were blessed 
 with both, and would try if either could acquaint them with the mind of 
 God in this case. Note, God having given diversities of gifts to men, 
 and all to profit with, we should make use of all as there is occasion. 
 They were not so wedded to the priests, their stated ministers, as to 
 distrust the prophets, who appeared, by the gifts given them, well 
 qualified to serve the church; nor yet were they so much enamoured with 
 the prophets as to despise the priests, but they spoke both to the 
 priests and to the prophets, and, in consulting both, gave glory to the 
 God of Israel, and that one Spirit who <I>works all in all.</I> God 
 might speak to them either by <I>urim</I> or <I>by prophets</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:6">1 Sam. xxviii. 6</A>),

 and therefore they would not neglect either. The priests and the
 prophets were not jealous one of another, nor had any difference among 
 themselves; let not the people then make differences between them, but 
 thank God they had both. The prophets did indeed reprove what was amiss 
 in the priests, but at the same time told the people that the 
 <I>priest's lips</I> should <I>keep knowledge,</I> and they must 
 <I>enquire the law at his mouth,</I> for <I>he is the messenger of the 
 Lord of hosts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:7">Mal. ii. 7</A>.

 Note, Those that would know God's mind should consult God's ministers,
 and in doubtful cases ask advice of those whose special business it is 
 to <I>search the scriptures.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. What the case was which they desired satisfaction in 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+7:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):
 
 <I>Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done 
 these so many years.</I> Observe, 

 (1.) What had been their past practice, not only during the seventy 
 years of the captivity but to this time, which was twenty years after 
 the liberty proclaimed them; they kept up solemn stated fasts for 
 humiliation and prayer, which they religiously observed, according as 
 their opportunities were, in their closets, families, or such 
 assemblies for worship as they had. In the case here, they mention only 
 one, that of the fifth month; but it appears, by

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:19"><I>ch.</I> viii. 19</A>,

 that they observed four anniversary fasts, one in the fourth month
 (<I>June</I> 17), in remembrance of the breaking up of the wall of 
 Jerusalem 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:6">Jer. lii. 6</A>),

 another in the fifth month (<I>July</I> 4), in remembrance of the
 burning of the temple

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:12,13">Jer. lii. 12, 13</A>),

 another in the seventh month (<I>September</I> 3), in remembrance of
 the killing of Gedaliah, which completed their dispersion, and another 
 in the tenth month (<I>December</I> 10), in remembrance of the 
 beginning of the siege of Jerusalem,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+25:1">2 Kings xxv. 1</A>.

 Now it was very commendable in them to keep those fasts, thus to humble
 themselves under those humbling providences, by which God called them 
 to weeping and mourning, thus to accommodate themselves to their 
 troubles, and prepare themselves for deliverance. It would likewise be 
 a means of possessing their children betimes with a due sense of the 
 hand of the Lord gone out against them.

 (2.) What was their present doubt-whether they should continue these 
 fasts or no. The case is put as by a single person: <I>Should I 
 weep?</I> But it was the case of many, and the satisfaction of one 
 would be a satisfaction to the rest. Or perhaps many had left it off,
 but the querist will not be determined by the practice of others; if 
 God will have him continue it, he will, whatever others do. His fasting 
 is described by his <I>weeping, separating himself.</I> A religious 
 fast must be solemnized, not only by abstinence, here called a 
 separating ourselves from the ordinary lawful comforts of life, but by 
 a godly sorrow for sin, here expressed by weeping. "Should I still keep 
 such <I>days to afflict the soul</I> as <I>I have done these so many 
 years?</I>" It is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+7:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 to be seventy years, computed from the last captivity, as before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:12"><I>ch.</I> i. 12</A>.

 The enquiry intimates a readiness to continue it, if God so appoint, 
 though it be a mortification to the flesh. 

 [1.] Something is to be said for the continuance of these fasts. 
 Fasting and praying are good work at any time, and do good; we have 
 always both cause enough and need enough to humble ourselves before 
 God. To throw off these fasts would be an evidence of their being too 
 secure, and a cause of their being more so. They were still in 
 distress, and under the tokens of God's displeasure; and it is unwise 
 for the patient to break off his course of physic while he is sensible 
 of such remains of his distemper. But, 

 [2.] There is something to be said for the letting fall of these fasts.
 God had changed the method of his providences concerning them, and 
 returned in ways of mercy to them; and ought not they then to change 
 the method of their duties? Now that the bridegroom has returned, why 
 should the <I>children of the bride-chamber fast?</I> Every thing is 
 beautiful in its season. And as to the fast of the fifth month (which 
 is that they particularly enquire about), that, being kept in 
 remembrance of the burning of the temple, might seem to be superseded 
 rather than any of the other, because the temple was now in a fair way 
 to be rebuilt. But, having long kept up this fast, they would not leave 
 it off without advice, and without asking and knowing God's mind in the 
 case. Note, A good method of religious services, which we have found 
 beneficial to ourselves and others, ought not to be altered without 
 good reason, and therefore not without mature deliberation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. An answer given to this case. It should seem that, though the 
 question looked plausible enough, those who proposed it were not 
 conscientious in it, for they were more concerned about the ceremony 
 than about the substance; they seemed to boast of their fasting, and to 
 upbraid God Almighty with it, that he had not sooner returned in mercy 
 to them; "for we have done it <I>these so many years.</I>" As those, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:3">Isa. lviii. 3</A>,

 <I>Wherefore have we fasted, and thou seest not?</I> And some think 
 that unbelief, and distrust of the promises of God, were at the bottom 
 of their enquiry; for, if they had given them the credit that was due 
 to them, they needed not to doubt but that their fasts ought to be laid 
 aside, now that the occasion of them was over. And therefore the first 
 answer to their enquiry is a very sharp reproof of their hypocrisy, 
 directed, not only to the <I>people of the land,</I> but to <I>the 
 priests,</I> who had set up these fasts, and perhaps some of them were 
 for keeping them up, to serve some purpose of their own. Let them all
 take notice that, whereas they thought they had made God very much 
 their debtor by these fasts, they were much mistaken, for they were not 
 acceptable to him, unless they had been observed in a better manner and 
 to better purpose.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What they did that was good was not done aright 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+7:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>You fasted and mourned.</I> They were not chargeable with the 
 omission or neglect of the duty, though it was displeasing to the body 
 (thy fasts were <I>continually before me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:8">Ps. l. 8</A>),

 but they had not managed them aright. Note, Those that come to enquire
 of their duty must be willing first to be told of their faults. And 
 those that seem zealous for the outside of a duty ought to examine 
 themselves faithfully whether they have the regard they ought to have 
 to the inside of it.

 (1.) They had not an eye to God in their fasting: <I>Did you at all 
 fast unto me, even to me?</I> He appeals to their own consciences; they 
 will witness against them that they had not been sincere in it, much 
 more will God, who is greater than the heart and knows all things. You 
 know very well that <I>you did not at all fast to me; in fasting did 
 you fast to me?</I> There was the carcase and form of the duty, but 
 none of the life, and soul, and power of it. Was it <I>to me, even to 
 me?</I> The repetition intimates what a great deal of stress is laid 
 upon this as the main matter, in that and other holy exercises, that 
 they be done to God, even to him, with an eye to his word as our rule, 
 and his glory as our end, in them, seeking to please him and to obtain 
 his favour, and studious by the sincerity of our intention to approve 
 ourselves to him. When this was wanting every fast was but a jest. To 
 fast, and not fast to God, was to mock him and provoke him, and could 
 not be pleasing to him. Those that make fasting a cloak for sin, as 
 Jezebel's fast, or by it make their court to men for their applause, as 
 the Pharisees, or that rest in outward expressions of humiliation while 
 their hearts are unhumbled, as Ahab, do they <I>fast to God, even to 
 him? Is this the fast that God has chosen?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:5">Isa. lviii. 5</A>.

 If the solemnities of our fasting, though frequent, long, and severe, 
 do not serve to put an edge upon devout affections, to quicken prayer, 
 to increase godly sorrow, and to alter the temper of our minds and the 
 course of our lives for the better, they do not at all answer the 
 intention, and God will not accept them as performed to him, even to 
 him.

 (2.) They had the same eye to themselves in their fasting that they had
 in their eating and drinking

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+7:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>When you did eat, and when you did drink,</I> on other days (nay,
 perhaps on your fast-days, in the observation of which you could, when 
 you saw cause, dispense with yourselves, and take a liberty to eat and 
 drink), did you not <I>eat for yourselves and drink for yourselves?</I> 
 Have you not always done as you had a mind yourselves? Why then do you
 now pretend a desire to know the mind of God? In your religious feasts 
 and thanksgivings you have had no more an eye to God than in your 
 fasts." Or, rather, it refers to their common meals; they did no more 
 design the honour of God in their fasting and praying than they did in 
 their eating and drinking; but self was still the centre in which the 
 lines of all their actions, natural, civil, and religious, met. They 
 needed not be in such care about the continuance of their fasts, unless 
 they had kept them better. Note, We miss our end in eating and drinking 
 when we eat to ourselves and drink to ourselves, whereas we should 
 <I>eat and drink to the glory of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:31">1 Cor. x. 31</A>),

 that our bodies may be fit to serve our souls in his service.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The principal good thing they should have done was left undone 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+7:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "<I>Should you not hear the words which the Lord has cried by the 
 former prophets?</I> Yes, that you should have done on your fast-days; 
 it was not enough to <I>weep</I> and <I>separate yourselves</I> on your 
 fast-days, in token of your sorrow for the judgments you were under, 
 but you should have <I>searched the scriptures</I> of the prophets, 
 that you might have seen what was the ground of God's controversy with 
 your fathers, and might have taken warning by their miseries not to 
 tread in the steps of their iniquities. You ask, Shall we do as we have 
 done, in fasting? No, you must do that which you have not yet done; you 
 must repent of your sins and reform you lives. This is what we now call 
 you to, and it is the same that the former prophets called your fathers 
 to." To affect them the more with the mischief that sin had done them, 
 that they might be brought to repent of it, he puts them in mind of the 
 former flourishing state of their country: Jerusalem <I>was</I> then 
 <I>inhabited and in prosperity,</I> that is now desolate and in 
 distress. The <I>cities round about,</I> that are now in ruins, were 
 then inhabited too and <I>in peace.</I> The country likewise was very 
 populous: <I>Men inhabited the south of the plain,</I> which was not at 
 all fortified, and yet they lived safely, and which was fruitful, and 
 so they lived plentifully. But then God <I>by the prophets cried</I> to 
 them, as one in earnest, and importunate with them, to amend their ways 
 and doings, or else their prosperity would soon be at an end. "Now," 
 says the prophet, "you should have taken notice of that, and have 
 inferred that what was required of them for the preventing of the 
 judgments, and which they did not, is required of you for the removal 
 of the judgments; and, if you do it not, all your fasting and weeping 
 signify nothing." Note, The words of the later prophets agree with 
 those of the former; and, whether people are in prosperity or 
 adversity, they must be called upon to leave their sins and do their 
 duty; this must still be the burden of every song.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8 And the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto Zechariah, saying,

 judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his
 brother:
 &nbsp; 10 And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger,

 &nbsp; 11 But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder,
 and stopped their ears, that they should not hear.
 &nbsp; 12 Yea, they made their hearts <I>as</I> an adamant stone, lest they
 should hear the law, and the words which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts hath
 sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great
 wrath from the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts.

 whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 What was said 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+7:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>,

 that they <I>should have heard the words of the former prophets,</I> is 
 here enlarged upon, for warning to these hypocritical enquirers, who 
 continued their sins when they asked with great preciseness whether 
 they should continue their fasts. This prophet had before put them in 
 mind of their fathers' disobedience to the calls of the prophets, and 
 what was the consequence of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:4-6"><I>ch.</I> i. 4-6</A>),

 and now here again; for others' harms should be our warnings. God's
 judgments upon Israel of old for their sins were written for admonition 
 to us Christians 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:11">1 Cor. x. 11</A>),

 and the same use we should make of similar providences in our own
 day.</P>

 I. This prophet here repeats the heads of the sermons which the former 
 prophets preached to their fathers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+7:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>),

 because the very same things were required of them now. "Thus does the 
 <I>Lord of hosts speak</I> to you now, and thus he did speak to your 
 fathers, saying, <I>Execute true judgment.</I>" The duties here 
 required of them, which would have been the lengthening of the 
 tranquillity of their fathers and must be the restoring of their 
 tranquillity, are not keeping fasts and offering sacrifices, but 
 <I>doing justly</I> and <I>loving mercy,</I> duties which they were 
 bound to by the light and law of nature, though there had been no 
 prophets sent to insist upon them, duties which had a direct tendency 
 to the public welfare and peace, and which they themselves would be the 
 gainers by, and not God. 

 1. Magistrates must administer justice impartially, according to the
 maxims of the law and the merits of the cause, without respect of 
 persons: "<I>Judge judgment of truth,</I> and execute it when you have 
 judged it."

 2. Neighbours must have a tender concern for one another, and must not
 only do one another no wrong, but must be ready to do one another all 
 the good offices that lie in their power. They must <I>show mercy and 
 compassion every man to his brother,</I> as the case called for it. The 
 infirmities of others, as well as their calamities, are to be looked 
 upon with compassion. <I>Hanc veniam petimusque damusque
 vicissim--This kindness we ask and exercise.</I>

 3. They must not bear hard upon those whom they have advantage against,
 and who, they know, are not able to help themselves. They must not,
 either in commerce or in course of law, oppress <I>the widow, the 
 fatherless, the stranger, and the poor,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+7:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 The weakest must not be thrust to the wall because they are weakest. No
 thanks to men not to deny right to those who are in a capacity to 
 demand it and recover it; but we must, not only for wrath, but also for 
 conscience' sake, give those their own who have not power to force it 
 from us. Or it intimates that that which is but exactness with others 
 is exaction upon the widows and the fatherless; nay, that not relieving 
 and helping them as we ought is, in effect, oppressing them. 

 4. They must not only not do wrong to any, but they must not so much as
 desire it nor think of it: "<I>Let none of you imagine evil against his 
 brother in your heart.</I> Do not project it; do not wish it; nay do 
 not so much as please yourself with the fancy of it." The law of God 
 lays a restraint upon the heart, and forbids the entertaining, forbids 
 the admitting, of a malicious, spiteful, ill-natured thought. 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:9">Deut. xv. 9</A>,

 <I>Beware that there be not a thought in thy Belial heart against thy
 brother.</I></P>

 II. He describes the wilfulness and disobedience of their fathers, who 
 persisted in all manner of wickedness and injustice, notwithstanding 
 these exhortations and admonitions frequently given them in God's name; 
 various expressions to this purport are here heaped up 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+7:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>),
 
 setting forth the stubbornness of that carnal mind which is <I>enmity 
 against God, and is not in subjection to the law of God, neither indeed 
 can be.</I> They were obstinate and refractory, and persisted in their 
 transgressions of the law purely from a spirit of contradiction to the 
 law. 

 1. They would not, if they could help it, come within hearing of the
 prophets, but kept at a distance; or, if they could not avoid hearing 
 what they said, yet they resolved they would not heed it: <I>They 
 refused to hearken,</I> and looked another way as if they had not been 
 spoken to. 

 2. If they did hear what was said to them, and, as it seemed, inclined
 at first to comply with it, yet they flew off when it came to the 
 setting to, and, like a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke, <I>they 
 pulled away the shoulder,</I> and would not submit to the <I>easy yoke 
 and the light burden</I> of God's commandments. <I>They gave a 
 withdrawing shoulder</I> (so the word is); they seemed to lay their 
 shoulder to the work, but they presently withdrew it again, as those

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:10,11">Jer. xxxiv. 10, 11</A>.

 They were like a deceitful bow, as that son that said, <I>I go, sir,
 but went not.</I> 

 3. They filled their own minds with prejudices against the word of God,
 and had some objection or other ready wherewith to fortify themselves 
 against every sermon they heard. <I>They stopped their ears, that they
 should not hear,</I> as the deaf adder

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:4">Ps. lviii. 4</A>),

 and none are so deaf as those that will not hear, that <I>make their
 own ear heavy,</I> as the word is. 

 4. They resolved that nothing which was said to them, for the enforcing
 of these injunctions, should make any impression upon them: <I>They 
 made their hearts as an adamant-stone,</I> as a <I>diamond,</I> the 
 hardest of stones to be wrought upon, or as a <I>flint,</I> which the 
 mason cannot hew into shape as he can other stone out of the quarry. 
 Nothing is so hard, so unmalleable, so inflexible, as the heart of a 
 presumptuous sinner; and those whose hearts are hard may thank 
 themselves; they are of their own hardening, and it is just with God to 
 give them over to a reprobate sense, to the hardness and impenitence of 
 their own hearts. These stubborn sinners hardened their hearts on 
 purpose <I>lest they should hear</I> what God said to them by the 
 written word, <I>by the law of Moses,</I> and by the <I>words of the 
 prophets</I> that preached to them; they had <I>Moses and the 
 prophets,</I> but resolved they would hear neither, nor would they have 
 been persuaded though one had been sent to them from the dead. The 
 <I>words of the prophet</I> were not regarded by them, though they were 
 words which the Lord of hosts sent and directed to them, though he sent 
 them immediately <I>by his Spirit</I> in the prophets; so that in 
 despising them they affronted God himself and <I>resisted the Holy 
 Ghost.</I> Note, The reason why men are not good is because they will 
 not be so; they will not consider, will not comply; and therefore, 
 <I>if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He shows the fatal consequences of it to their fathers: 
 <I>Therefore came great wrath from the Lord of hosts.</I> God was 
 highly displeased with them, and justly; he required nothing of them 
 but what was reasonable in itself and beneficial to them; and yet they 
 refused, and in a most insolent manner too. What master could bear to 
 be so abused by his own servant? Such an implacable enmity to the 
 gospel as this was to the law and the prophets was that which brought 
 <I>wrath to the uttermost</I> upon the last generation of the Jewish 
 church, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:16">1 Thess. ii. 16</A>.

 Great sins against <I>the Lord of hosts,</I> whose authority is
 incontestable, bring <I>great wrath from the Lord of hosts,</I> whose 
 power is irresistible. And the effect was,

 1. As they had turned a deaf ear to God's word, so God turned a deaf
 ear to their prayers,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+7:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 <I>As he cried</I> to them in their prosperity to leave their sins, 
 <I>and they would not hear,</I> but persisted in their iniquities, so 
 <I>they cried to him</I> in the day of their trouble to remove his 
 judgments, and he would not hear, but lengthened out their calamities. 
 Those that set God at defiance, in the height of their pride, when 
 pangs came upon them cried unto him. <I>Lord, in trouble have they 
 visited thee.</I> But God has said it, and will abide by it, <I>He that 
 turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be an 
 abomination,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:9,Pr+1:24">Prov. xxviii. 9; i. 24</A>,

 &c. Iniquity, regarded in the heart, will certainly spoil the success
 of prayer,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:18">Ps. lxvi. 18</A>.

 2. As they flew off from their duty and allegiance to God, and were of
 desultory and unsettled spirits, so God dissipated them and threw them 
 about as chaff before a whirlwind: <I>He scattered them among all the 
 nations whom they knew not,</I> and whom therefore they could not 
 expect to receive any kindness from, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+7:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 3. As they violated all the laws of their land, so God took away all
 the glories of it: <I>Their land was desolate after them, and no man 
 passed through or returned.</I> All that country that was the kingdom 
 of the two tribes, after the dispersion of the remaining Jews, upon the 
 slaughter of Gedaliah, was left utterly uninhabited; there was not man, 
 woman, or child, in it, till the Jews returned at the end of seventy 
 years' captivity; nay, it should seem, the very roads that lay through 
 the country were deserted (none passed or repassed), which, as it had 
 an intimation of mercy in it (though they were cast out of it, yet it 
 was kept empty for their return), so for the present it made the 
 judgment appear much the more dismal; for what a horrid wilderness must 
 a land be that had been so many years uninhabited! And they might thank 
 themselves; it was they that by their own wickedness laid <I>the 
 pleasant land desolate.</I> It was not so much the Chaldeans that did 
 it. No; they did it themselves. The desolations of a land are owing to 
 the wickedness of its inhabitants, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:34">Ps. cvii. 34</A>.

 This came of their wilful disobedience to the law of God. And the
 present generation saw how desolate sin had made that pleasant land, 
 and yet would not take warning.</P>
