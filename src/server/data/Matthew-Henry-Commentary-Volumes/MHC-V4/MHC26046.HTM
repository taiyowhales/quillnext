 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; The gate of the inner court that
 looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but
 on the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon
 it shall be opened.
 &nbsp; 2  And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of <I>that</I>
 gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the
 priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings,
 and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall
 go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.
 &nbsp; 3  Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of
 this gate before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in the sabbaths and in the new moons.
 &nbsp; 4  And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in the sabbath day <I>shall be</I> six lambs without blemish, and
 a ram without blemish.
 &nbsp; 5  And the meat offering <I>shall be</I> an ephah for a ram, and the
 meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and an
 hin of oil to an ephah.
 &nbsp; 6  And in the day of the new moon <I>it shall be</I> a young bullock
 without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be without
 blemish.
 &nbsp; 7  And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock,
 and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his hand
 shall attain unto, and a hin of oil to an ephah.
 &nbsp; 8  And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of
 the porch of <I>that</I> gate, and he shall go forth by the way
 thereof.
 &nbsp; 9  But when the people of the land shall come before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in
 the solemn feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north
 gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he
 that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the
 way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate
 whereby he came in, but shall go forth over against it.
 &nbsp; 10  And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall
 go in; and when they go forth, shall go forth.
 &nbsp; 11  And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering
 shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to the
 lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.
 &nbsp; 12  Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering
 or peace offerings voluntarily unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>one</I> shall then
 open him the gate that looketh toward the east, and he shall
 prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he did on
 the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his going
 forth <I>one</I> shall shut the gate.
 &nbsp; 13  Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>of</I>
 a lamb of the first year without blemish: thou shalt prepare it
 every morning.
 &nbsp; 14  And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning,
 the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of a hin of oil,
 to temper with the fine flour; a meat offering continually by a
 perpetual ordinance unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 15  Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and
 the oil, every morning <I>for</I> a continual burnt offering.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Whether the rules for public worship here laid down were designed to be 
 observed, even in those things wherein they differed from the law of 
 Moses, and were so observed under the second temple, is not certain; we 
 find not in the history of that latter part of the Jewish church that 
 they governed themselves in their worship by these ordinances, as one 
 would think they should have done, but only by law of Moses, looking 
 upon this <I>then</I> in the next age after as mystical, and not 
 literal. We may observe, in these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That the place of worship was fixed, and rules were given concerning 
 that, both to prince and people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The east gate, which was kept shut at other times, was to be opened 
 on the sabbath days, on the moons 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+46:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 and whenever the prince offered a voluntary offering, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+46:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Of the keeping of this gate ordinarily shut we read before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:2"><I>ch.</I> xliv. 2</A>);

 whereas the other gates of the court were opened every day, this was
 opened only on high days and on special occasions, when it was opened 
 for the prince, who was to <I>go in by the way of the porch of that 
 gate,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+46:2,8"><I>v.</I> 2, 8</A>.

 Some think he went in with the priests and Levites into the <I>inner 
 court</I> (for into that court this gate was the entrance), and they 
 observe that magistrates and ministers should join forces, and go the 
 same way, hand in hand, in promoting the service of God. But it should 
 rather seem that he did not go <I>through</I> the gate (as the glory of 
 the Lord had done), though it was open, but he went <I>by the way of 
 the porch of the gate,</I> stood <I>at the post of the gate,</I> and 
 <I>worshipped at the threshold of the gate</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+46:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 where he had a full view of the priests' performances at the altar, and 
 signified his concurrence in them, for himself and for the people of 
 the land, that stood behind him <I>at the door of that gate,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+46:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 Thus must every prince show himself to be of David's mind, who would
 very willingly be a <I>door-keeper in the house of his God,</I> and, as 
 the word there is, <I>lie at the threshold,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:10">Ps. lxxxiv. 10</A>.

 Note, The greatest of men are less than the least of the ordinances of
 God. Even princes themselves, when they draw near to God, must worship 
 <I>with reverence and godly fear,</I> owning that even they are 
 unworthy to approach to him. But Christ is <I>our prince,</I> whom God 
 causes to <I>draw near</I> and <I>approach to him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:21">Jer. xxx. 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. As to the north gate and south gate, by which they entered into the 
 <I>court of the people</I> (not into the inner court), there was this 
 rule given, that whoever came in at the <I>north gate</I> should go out 
 at the <I>south gate,</I> and whoever came in at the <I>south gate</I> 
 should go out at the <I>north gate,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+46:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Some think this was to prevent thrusting and jostling one another; for 
 God is <I>the God of order, and not of confusion.</I> We may suppose 
 that they came in at the gate that was next their own houses, but, when 
 they went away, God would have them go out at that gate which would 
 lead them <I>the furthest way about,</I> that they might have time for 
 meditation; being thereby obliged to go a great way round the 
 sanctuary, they might have an opportunity <I>to consider the 
 palaces</I> of it, and, if they improved their time well in fetching 
 this circuit, they would call it the nearest way home. Some observe 
 that this may remind us, in the service of God, to be still pressing 
 forward 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:13">Phil. iii. 13</A>)

 and not to <I>look back,</I> and, in our attendance upon ordinances,
 not to go back as we came, but more holy, and heavenly, and 
 spiritual.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. It is appointed that <I>the people shall worship at the door of the 
 east gate,</I> where the prince does, he at the head and they attending 
 him, both <I>on the sabbath and on the new moons</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+46:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and that, when they come in and go out, the prince shall be <I>in the 
 midst of them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+46:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Note, Great men should, by their constant and reverent attendance on 
 God in public worship, give a good example to their inferiors, both 
 engaging them and encouraging them to do likewise. It is a very 
 graceful becoming thing for persons of quality to go to church with 
 their servants, and tenants, and poor neighbours about them, and to 
 behave themselves there with an air of seriousness and devotion; and 
 those who thus honour God with their honour he will delight to 
 honour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That the ordinances of worship were fixed. Though the prince is 
 supposed himself to be a very hearty zealous friend to the sanctuary, 
 yet it is not left to him, no, not in concert with the priests, to 
 appoint what sacrifices shall be offered, but God himself appoints 
 them; for it is his prerogative to institute the rites and ceremonies 
 of religious worship. 

 1. Every morning, as duly as the morning came, they must offer <I>a
 lamb</I> for a <I>burnt-offering,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+46:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 It is strange that no mention is made of the evening sacrifice; but 
 Christ having come, and having offered himself now <I>in the end of the 
 world</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:26">Heb. ix. 26</A>),

 we are to look upon him as the evening sacrifice, about the time of the
 offering up of which he died.

 2. On the sabbath days, whereas by the law of Moses four lambs were to 
 be offered 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+28:9">Num. xxviii. 9</A>),

 it is here appointed that (at the prince's charge) there shall be
 <I>six lambs</I> offered, <I>and a ram</I> besides

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+46:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 to intimate how much we should abound in sabbath work, now in 
 gospel-time, and what plenty of the spiritual sacrifices of prayer and 
 praise we should offer up to God on that day; and, if <I>with such 
 sacrifice God is well-pleased,</I> surely we have a great deal of 
 reason to be so. 

 3. On the new moons, in the beginning of their months, there was over
 and above the usual sabbath-sacrifices the additional offering of a 
 young bullock,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+46:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Those who do much for God and their souls, statedly and constantly, 
 must yet, upon some occasions, do still more. 

 4. All the sacrifices were to be <I>without blemish;</I> so Christ, the 
 great sacrifice, was 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:19">1 Pet. i. 19</A>),

 and so Christians, who are to present themselves to God as living
 sacrifices, should aim and endeavour to be--<I>blameless, and harmless, 
 and without rebuke.</I>

 5. All the sacrifices were to have their meat-offerings annexed to
 them, for so the law of Moses had appointed, to show what a good table 
 God keeps in his house and that we ought to honour him with the fruit 
 of our ground as well as with the fruit of our cattle, because in both 
 he has blessed us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:4">Deut. xxviii. 4</A>.

 In the beginning, Cain offered the one and Abel the other. Some observe
 that the meat-offerings here are much larger in proportion than they 
 were by the law of Moses. Then the proportion was <I>three tenth-deals 
 to a bullock,</I> and <I>two to a ram</I> (so many tenth parts of an 
 ephah) and half a hin of oil at the most

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+15:6-9">Num. xv. 6-9</A>);

 but here, for every bullock and every ram, a whole ephah and a whole
 hin of oil

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+46:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 which intimates that under the gospel, the great atoning sacrifice
 having been offered, these unbloody sacrifices shall be more abounded 
 in; or, in general, it intimates that as now, under the gospel, God 
 abounds in the gifts of his grace to us, more than under the law, so we 
 should abound in the returns of praise and duty to him. But it is 
 observable that in the meat-offering <I>for the lambs</I> the prince is 
 allowed to offer <I>as he shall be able to give</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+46:5,6,11"><I>v.</I> 5, 7, 11</A>),
 
 <I>as his hand shall attain unto.</I> Note, Princess themselves must 
 spend as they can afford; and even in that which is laid out in works 
 of piety God expects and requires but that we should do according to 
 our ability, every man <I>as God has prepared him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+16:2">1 Cor. xvi. 2</A>.

 God has not <I>made us to serve with an offering</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:23">Isa. xliii. 23</A>),

 but considers our frame and state. Yet this will not countenance those
 who pretend a disability that is not real, or those who by their 
 extravagances in other things disable themselves to do the good they 
 should. And we find those praised who, in an extraordinary case of 
 charity, went not <I>only to their power,</I> but <I>beyond their 
 power.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; If the prince give a gift unto any
 of his sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons'; it
 <I>shall be</I> their possession by inheritance.
 &nbsp; 17  But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his
 servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; after it
 shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shall be his
 sons' for them.
 &nbsp; 18  Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's
 inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of their
 possession; <I>but</I> he shall give his sons inheritance out of his
 own possession: that my people be not scattered every man from
 his possession.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a law for the limiting of the power of the prince in the 
 disposing of the crown-lands. 

 1. If he have a <I>son</I> that is a favourite, or has merited well, he
 may, if he please, as a token of his favour and in recompence for his 
 services, settle some parts of his lands upon him and his heirs for 
 ever

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+46:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 provided it do not go out of the family. There may be a cause for 
 parents, when their children have grown up, to be more kind to one than 
 to another, as Jacob gave to Joseph one portion <I>above his 
 brethren,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:22">Gen. xlviii. 22</A>.

 2. Yet, if he have a servant that is a favourite, he may not in like
 manner settle lands upon him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+46:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 The servant might have the rents, issues, and profits, for such a term, 
 but the inheritance, the <I>jus proprietarium--the right of 
 proprietorship,</I> shall remain in the prince and his heirs. It was 
 fit that a difference should be put between a child and a servant, like 
 that 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:35">John viii. 35</A>.

 <I>The servant abides not in the house for ever,</I> as the son does.

 3. What estates he gives his children must be of his own
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+46:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 He <I>shall not take of the people's inheritance,</I> under pretence of 
 having many children to provide for; he shall not find ways to make 
 them forfeit their estates, or to force them to sell them and so 
 <I>thrust his subjects out of their possession;</I> but let him and his 
 sons be content with their own. It is far from being a prince's honour 
 to increase the wealth of his family and crown by encroaching upon the 
 rights and properties of his subjects; nor will he himself be a gainer 
 by it at last, for he will be but a poor prince when the people are 
 <I>scattered every man from his possession,</I> when they quit their 
 native country, being forced out of it by oppression, choosing rather 
 to live among strangers that are free people, and where what they have 
 they can call their own, be it ever so little. It is the interest of 
 princes to rule in the hearts of their subjects, and then all they have 
 is, in the best manner, at their service. It is better for themselves 
 to gain their affections by protecting their rights than to gain their 
 estates by invading them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  After he brought me through the entry, which <I>was</I> at the
 side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which
 looked toward the north: and, behold, there <I>was</I> a place on the
 two sides westward.
 &nbsp; 20  Then said he unto me, This <I>is</I> the place where the priests
 shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they
 shall bake the meat offering; that they bear <I>them</I> not out into
 the utter court, to sanctify the people.
 &nbsp; 21  Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me
 to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every
 corner of the court <I>there was</I> a court.
 &nbsp; 22  In the four corners of the court <I>there were</I> courts joined
 of forty <I>cubits</I> long and thirty broad: these four corners
 <I>were</I> of one measure.
 &nbsp; 23  And <I>there was</I> a row <I>of building</I> round about in them,
 round about them four, and <I>it was</I> made with boiling places
 under the rows round about.
 &nbsp; 24  Then said he unto me, These <I>are</I> the places of them that
 boil, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice
 of the people.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a further discovery of buildings about the temple, which 
 we did not observe before, and those were places to boil the flesh of 
 the offerings in, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+46:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 He that kept such a plentiful table at his altar needed large kitchens; 
 and a wise builder will provide conveniences of that kind. Observe, 

 1. Where those boiling-places were situated. There were some at the
 entry into the inner court

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+46:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>)

 and others under the rows, in the four corners of the outer court, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+46:21-23"><I>v.</I> 21-23</A>.

 These were the places where, it is likely, there was most room to spare 
 for this purpose; and this purpose was found for the spare room, that 
 none might be lost. It is a pity that holy ground should be waste 
 ground. 

 2. What use they were put to. In those places they were to <I>boil the 
 trespass-offering and the sin-offering,</I> those parts of them which 
 were allotted to the priests and which were more sacred than the flesh 
 of the peace-offerings, of which the offerer also had a share. There 
 also they were to <I>bake the meat-offering,</I> their share of it, 
 which they had from the altar for their own tables,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+46:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 
 Care was taken that they should not <I>bear them out into the outer 
 court, to sanctify the people.</I> Let them not pretend to sanctify the 
 people with this holy flesh, and so impose upon them; or let not the 
 people imagine that by touching those sacred things they were 
 sanctified, and made any the better or more acceptable to God. It 
 should seem (from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:12">Hag. ii. 12</A>)

 that there were those who had such a conceit; and therefore the priests
 must not carry any of the holy flesh away with them, lest they should 
 encourage that conceit. Ministers must take heed of doing any thing to
 bolster up ignorant people in their superstitious vanities.</P>
