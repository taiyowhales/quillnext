 The sermon which we have in this and the following chapter is of a very 
 different complexion from all those before. The prophet does indeed, by 
 direction from God, change his voice. Most of what he had said hitherto 
 was by way of reproof and threatening; but these two chapters are 
 wholly taken up with precious promises of a return out of captivity, 
 and that typical of the glorious things reserved for the church in the 
 days of the Messiah. The prophet is told not only to preach this, but 
 to write it, because it is intended for the comfort of the generation 
 to come, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 It is here promised, 

 I. That they should hereafter have a joyful restoration. 

 1. Though they were now in a great deal of pain and terror, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:4-7">ver. 4-7</A>.

 2. Though their oppressors were very strong,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:8-10">ver. 8-10</A>.

 3. Though a full end was made of other nations, and they were not 
 restored, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:11">ver. 11</A>.

 4. Though all means of their deliverance seemed to fail and be cut off,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:12-14">ver. 12-14</A>.

 5. Though God himself had sent them into captivity, and justly, for
 their sins, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:15,16">ver. 15, 16</A>.

 6. Though all about them looked upon their case as desperate,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:17">ver. 17</A>.
 
 II. That after their joyful restoration they should have a happy
 settlement, that their city should be rebuilt 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:18">ver. 18</A>),

 their numbers increased

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:19">ver. 19, 20</A>),

 their government established

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:21">ver. 21</A>),

 God's covenant with them renewed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:22">ver. 22</A>),

 and their enemies destroyed and cut off,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:23,24">ver. 23, 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The word that came to Jeremiah from the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Thus speaketh the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel, saying, Write thee all
 the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.
 &nbsp; 3  For, lo, the days come, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that I will bring
 again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to
 their fathers, and they shall possess it.
 &nbsp; 4  And these <I>are</I> the words that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake concerning
 Israel and concerning Judah.
 &nbsp; 5  For thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; We have heard a voice of trembling,
 of fear, and not of peace.
 &nbsp; 6  Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child?
 wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a
 woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?
 &nbsp; 7  Alas! for that day <I>is</I> great, so that none <I>is</I> like it: it
 <I>is</I> even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out
 of it.
 &nbsp; 8  For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of
 hosts, <I>that</I> I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will
 burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of
 him:
 &nbsp; 9  But they shall serve the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> their God, and David their
 king, whom I will raise up unto them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, I. Jeremiah is directed to <I>write</I> what God had spoken to 
 him, which perhaps refers to all the foregoing prophecies. He must 
 write them and publish them, in hopes that those who had not profited 
 by what he said upon once hearing it might take more notice of it when 
 in reading it they had leisure for a more considerate review. Or, 
 rather, it refers to the promises of their enlargement, which had been 
 often mixed with his other discourses. He must collect them and put 
 them together, and God will now add unto them many like words. He must 
 write them for the generations to come, who should see them 
 accomplished, and thereby have their faith in the prophecy confirmed. 
 He must write them not <I>in a letter,</I> as that in the chapter 
 before to the captives, but <I>in a book,</I> to be carefully preserved 
 in the archives, or among the public rolls or registers of the state. 
 Daniel understood by these books when the captivity was about coming to 
 an end, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:2">Dan. ix. 2</A>.

 He must write them in a book, not in loose papers: "<I>For the days
 come,</I> and are yet at a great distance, when <I>I will bring again 
 the captivity of Israel and Judah,</I> great numbers of the ten tribes, 
 with those of the two,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 And this prophecy must be written, that it may be read then also, that 
 so it may appear how exactly the accomplishment answers the prediction, 
 which is one end of the writing of prophecies. It is intimated that 
 they shall be <I>beloved for their fathers' sake</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:28">Rom. xi. 28</A>);

 for <I>therefore</I> God will bring them again to Canaan, because it
 was <I>the land that he gave to their fathers,</I> which therefore 
 <I>they shall possess.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He is directed what to write. The very words are such as the Holy 
 Ghost teaches, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 These are the words which God ordered to be written; and those promises 
 which are written by his order are as truly his word as the ten 
 commandments which were written with his finger. 

 1. He must write a description of the fright and consternation which
 the people were now in, and were likely to be still in upon every 
 attack that the Chaldeans made upon them, which will much magnify both 
 the wonder and the welcomeness of their deliverance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>We have heard a voice of trembling</I>--the shrieks of terror 
 echoing to the alarms of danger. The false prophets told them that
 they should have <I>peace,</I> but <I>there is fear and not peace,</I> 
 so the margin reads it. No marvel that when <I>without are fightings 
 within are fears.</I> The men, even the men of war, shall be quite 
 overwhelmed with the calamities of their nation, shall sink under them, 
 and yield to them, and shall look like <I>women in labour,</I> whose 
 pains come upon them in great extremity and they know that they cannot 
 escape them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 You never heard of a man travailing with child, and yet here you find 
 not here and there a timorous man, but <I>every man with his hands on 
 his loins,</I> in the utmost anguish and agony, <I>as women in 
 travail,</I> when they see their cities burnt and their countries laid 
 waste. But this pain is compared to that of a woman in travail, not to 
 that of a death-bed, because it shall end in joy at last, and the pain, 
 like that of a travailing woman, shall be forgotten. <I>All faces</I> 
 shall be <I>turned into paleness.</I> The word signifies not only such 
 paleness as arises from a sudden fright, but that which is the effect 
 of a bad habit of body, the jaundice, or the green sickness. The 
 prophet laments the calamity upon the foresight of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Alas! for that day is great,</I> a day of judgment, which is called
 the <I>great day,</I> the <I>great and terrible day of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:31,Jude+1:6">Joel ii. 31, Jude 6</A>),

 great, so that <I>there has been none like it.</I> The last destruction
 of Jerusalem is thus spoken of by our Saviour as unparalleled,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:21">Matt. xxiv. 21</A>.

 <I>It is even the time of Jacob's trouble,</I> a sad time, when God's
 professing people shall be in distress above other people. The whole 
 time of the captivity was a time of Jacob's trouble; and such times 
 ought to be greatly lamented by all that are concerned for the welfare 
 of Jacob and the honour of the God of Jacob.

 2. He must write the assurances which God had given that a happy end 
 should at length be put to these calamities.

 (1.) Jacob's troubles shall cease: <I>He shall be saved out of
 them.</I> Though the afflictions of the church may last long, they 
 shall not last always. <I>Salvation belongs to the Lord,</I> and shall
 be wrought for his church.

 (2.) Jacob's troublers shall be disabled from doing him any further 
 mischief, and shall be reckoned with for the mischief they have done 
 him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 <I>The Lord of hosts,</I> who has all power in his hand, undertakes to 
 do it: "<I>I will break his yoke from off thy neck,</I> which has long 
 lain so heavy, and has so sorely galled thee. <I>I will burst thy
 bonds</I> and restore thee to liberty and ease, and thou shalt no more 
 be at the beck and command of strangers, shalt no more serve them, nor 
 shall they any more <I>serve themselves of thee;</I> they shall no more 
 enrich themselves either by thy possessions or by thy labours." And, 
 
 (3.) That which crowns and completes the mercy is that they shall be 
 restored to the free exercise of their religion again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 They shall be delivered from serving their enemies, not that they may 
 live at large and do what they please, but that they may <I>serve the 
 Lord their God and David their king,</I> that they may come again into 
 order, under the established government both in church and state.
 <I>Therefore</I> they were brought into trouble and made to <I>serve 
 their enemies</I> because they had not <I>served the Lord their God</I> 
 as they ought to have done, <I>with joyfulness and gladness of 
 heart,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:47">Deut. xxviii. 47</A>.

 But, when the time shall come that they should be <I>saved out of their
 trouble,</I> God will prepare and qualify them for it by giving them a 
 <I>heart to serve him,</I> and will make it doubly comfortable by 
 giving them opportunity to serve him. <I>Therefore</I> we are
 <I>delivered out of the hands of our enemies,</I> that we may <I>serve 
 God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:74,75">Luke i. 74, 75</A>.

 And <I>then</I> deliverances out of temporal calamities are mercies
 indeed to us when by them we find ourselves engaged to and enlarged in 
 the service of God. They shall serve their own God, and neither be 
 inclined, as they had been of old in the day of their apostasy, nor 
 compelled, as they had been of late in the day of their captivity, to 
 serve other gods. They shall serve <I>David their king,</I> such
 governors as God should from time to time set over them, of the line of 
 David (as Zerubbabel), or at least sitting on the <I>thrones of 
 judgment, the thrones of the house of David,</I> as Nehemiah. But 
 certainly this has a further meaning. The Chaldee paraphrase reads it, 
 <I>They shall obey</I> (or <I>hearken to</I>) <I>the Messiah</I> (or 
 <I>Christ</I>), the <I>Son of David, their king.</I> To him the Jewish 
 interpreters apply it. That dispensation which commenced at their 
 return out of captivity brought them to the Messiah. He is called 
 <I>David their King</I> because he was the <I>Son of David</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:42">Matt. xxii. 42</A>)

 and he answered to the name, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:31,32">Matt. xx. 31, 32</A>.

 David was an illustrious type of him both in his humiliation and in his
 exaltation. The covenant of royalty made with David had principal
 reference to him, and in him the promises of that covenant had their 
 full accomplishment. God gave him the <I>throne of his father
 David;</I> he <I>raised him up unto them, set him upon the holy hill of 
 Zion.</I> God is often in the New Testament said to have <I>raised up 
 Jesus,</I> raised him up as a King,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:26,13:23,33">Acts iii. 26; xiii. 23, 33</A>.
 
 Observe,

 [1.] Those that serve the Lord as their God must also serve <I>David 
 their King,</I> must give up themselves to Jesus Christ, to be ruled by 
 him. For all men must <I>honour the Son as they honour the Father,</I> 
 and come into the service and worship of God by him as Mediator.

 [2.] Those that are delivered out of spiritual bondage must make it 
 appear that they are so by giving up themselves to the service of 
 Christ. Those to whom he gives rest must take his yoke upon them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>;
 neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from
 afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob
 shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall
 make <I>him</I> afraid.
 &nbsp; 11  For I <I>am</I> with thee, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to save thee: though I
 make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet
 will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in
 measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.
 &nbsp; 12  For thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Thy bruise <I>is</I> incurable, <I>and</I>
 thy wound <I>is</I> grievous.
 &nbsp; 13  <I>There is</I> none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be
 bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.
 &nbsp; 14  All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for
 I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the
 chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity;
 <I>because</I> thy sins were increased.
 &nbsp; 15  Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow <I>is</I>
 incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: <I>because</I> thy sins
 were increased, I have done these things unto thee.
 &nbsp; 16  Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and
 all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into
 captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all
 that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.
 &nbsp; 17  For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of
 thy wounds, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; because they called thee an Outcast,
 <I>saying,</I> This <I>is</I> Zion, whom no man seeketh after.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses, as in those foregoing, the deplorable case of the Jews 
 in captivity is set forth, but many precious promises are given them 
 that in due time they should be relieved and a glorious salvation 
 wrought for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God himself appeared against them: he <I>scattered</I> them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);
 
 he did <I>all these things unto them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 All their calamities came from his hands; whoever were the instruments, 
 he was the principal agent. And this made their case very sad that God, 
 even their own God, spoke concerning them, to pull down and to destroy. 
 Now, 

 1. This was intended by him as a fatherly chastisement, and no other

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 "<I>I will correct thee in measure,</I> or <I>according to 
 judgment,</I> with discretion, no more than thou deservest, nay, no 
 more than thou canst well bear." What God does against his people is in 
 a way of correction, and that correction is always moderated and always 
 proceeds from love: "<I>I will not leave thee altogether 
 unpunished,</I> as thou art ready to think I should, because of thy 
 relation to me." Note, A profession of religion, though ever so 
 plausible, will be far from securing to us impunity in sin. God is no 
 respecter of persons, but will show his hatred of sin wherever he finds 
 it, and that he hates it most in those that are nearest to him. God 
 here corrects his people <I>for the multitude of their iniquity,</I> 
 and <I>because their sins were increased,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 Are our sorrows multiplied at any time and do they increase? We must 
 acknowledge that it is because our sins have been multiplied and they 
 have increased. Iniquities grow in us, and therefore troubles grow upon 
 us. But, 

 2. What God intended as a fatherly chastisement they and others 
 interpreted as an act of hostility; they looked upon him as having 
 <I>wounded them with the wound of an enemy</I> and <I>with the 
 chastisement of a cruel one</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 as if he had designed their ruin, and neither mitigated the correction 
 nor had any mercy in reserve for them. It did indeed seem as if God
 had dealt thus severely with them, as if he had turned to be their 
 enemy and had fought against them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:10">Isa. lxiii. 10</A>.

 Job complains that God had become cruel to him and <I>multiplied his
 wounds.</I> When troubles are great and long we have need carefully to
 watch over our own hearts, that we entertain not such hard thoughts as 
 these of God and his providence. His are the chastisements of a 
 merciful one, not of a cruel one, whatever they may appear.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Their friends forsook them, and were shy of them. None of those who 
 had courted them in their prosperity would take notice of them now in 
 their distress, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 It is commonly thus when families go to decay; those hang off from them 
 that had been their hangers-on. In two cases we are glad of the 
 assistance of our friends and need their service:--

 1. If we be impeached, accused, or reproached, we expect that our
 friends should appear in vindication of us, should speak a good word 
 for us when we cannot put on a face to speak for ourselves; but here 
 <I>there is none to plead thy cause,</I> none to stand up in thy 
 defence, none to intercede for thee with thy oppressors; therefore God 
 will <I>plead their cause,</I> for he might well wonder there was none 
 to uphold a people that had been so much the favourites of Heaven,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:5">Isa. lxiii. 5</A>.

 2. If we be sick, or sore, or wounded, we expect our friends should 
 attend us, advise us, sympathize with us, and, if occasion be, lend a 
 hand for the applying of healing medicines; but here there is none to 
 do that, none to bind up thy wounds, and by counsels and comforts to 
 make proper applications to thy case; nay

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 <I>All thy lovers have forgotten thee;</I> out of sight out of mind; 
 instead of seeking thee, they forsake thee. Such as this has often been 
 the case of religion and serious godliness in the world; those that 
 from their education, profession, and hopeful beginnings, one might 
 have expected to be its friends and lovers, its patrons and protectors, 
 desert it, forget it, and have nothing to say in its defence, nor will 
 do any thing towards the healing of its wounds. Observe, <I>Thy lovers 
 have forgotten thee, for I have wounded thee.</I> When God is against a 
 people who will be for them? Who can be for them so as to do them any 
 kindness? See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:11">Job xxx. 11</A>.

 Now, upon this account, their case seemed desperate and past relief

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>Thy bruise is incurable, thy wound grievous,</I> and 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 <I>thy sorrow is incurable.</I> The condition of the Jews in captivity 
 was such as no human power could redress the grievances of; there they 
 were like a valley full of <I>dead and dry bones,</I> which nothing 
 less than Omnipotence can put life into. Who could imagine that a 
 people so diminished, so impoverished, should ever be restored to their 
 own land and re-established there? So many were the aggravations of 
 their calamity that their sorrow would not admit of any alleviation, 
 but they seemed to be hardened in it, and their souls refused to be 
 comforted, till divine consolations proved strong ones, too strong to 
 be borne down even by the floods of grief that overwhelmed them. <I>Thy 
 sorrow is incurable because thy sins,</I> instead of being repented of 
 and forsaken, <I>were increased.</I> Note, Incurable griefs are owing 
 to incurable lusts. Now in this deplorable condition they are looked 
 upon with disdain 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>They called thee an outcast,</I> abandoned by all, abandoned to 
 ruin; they said, <I>This is Zion, whom no man seeks after.</I> When 
 they looked on the place where the city and temple had been built they 
 called that an outcast; now all was in ruins, there was no resort to 
 it, no residence in it, none asked the way to Zion, as formerly; <I>no 
 man seeks after</I> it. When they looked on the people that formerly 
 dwelt in Zion, but were now in captivity (and we read of <I>Zion 
 dwelling with the daughter of Babylon,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:7">Zech. ii. 7</A>),

 they called them outcasts; these are those who belong to Zion, and are
 wont to talk much of it and weep at the remembrance of it, but <I>no 
 man seeks after</I> them, or enquires concerning them. Note, It is 
 often the lot of Zion to be deserted and despised by those about 
 her.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. For all this God will work deliverance and salvation for them in 
 due time. Though no other hand, nay, <I>because</I> no other hand, can 
 cure their wound, his will, and shall. 

 1. Though he seemed to stand at a distance from them, yet he assures
 them of his presence with them, his powerful and gracious presence: 
 <I>I will save thee,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 <I>I am with thee, to save thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 When they are in their troubles he is with them, to save them from 
 sinking under them; when the time has come for their deliverance he is 
 with them, to be ready upon the first opportunity, to save them out of 
 their trouble. 

 2. Though they were at a distance, remote from their own land,
 <I>afar</I> off <I>in the land of their captivity,</I> yet there shall 
 salvation find them out, thence shall it fetch them, them and their 
 <I>seed,</I> for they also shall be known among the Gentiles, and 
 distinguished from them, that they may <I>return,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 3. Though they were now full of fears, and continually alarmed, yet
 the time shall come when they <I>shall be in rest and quiet,</I> safe 
 and easy, <I>and none shall make them afraid,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 4. Though the nations into which they were dispersed should be brought 
 to ruin, yet they should be preserved from that ruin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):
 
 <I>Though I make a full end of the nations whither I have scattered 
 thee,</I> and there might be danger of thy being lost among them, 
 <I>yet I will not make a full end of thee.</I> It was promised that in 
 the peace of these nations they should <I>have peace</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:7"><I>ch.</I> xxix. 7</A>),

 and yet in the destruction of these nations they should escape
 destruction. God's church may sometimes be brought very low, but he 
 <I>will not make a full end of</I> it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:10,18"><I>ch.</I> v. 10, 18</A>.

 5. Though God correct them, and justly, for their sins, their manifold
 transgressions and mighty sins, yet he will return in mercy to them, 
 and even their sin shall not prevent their deliverance when God's time 
 shall come. 

 6. Though their adversaries were mighty, God will bring them down, and 
 break their power

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>All that devour thee shall be devoured,</I> and thus Zion's cause 
 will be pleaded and will be made to appear to all the world a righteous 
 cause. Thus Zion's deliverance will be brought about by the destruction 
 of her oppressors; and thus her enemies will be recompensed for all the 
 injury they have done her; for <I>there is a God that judges in the 
 earth,</I> a God <I>to whom vengeance belongs.</I> "They <I>shall every 
 one of them,</I> without exception, <I>go into captivity,</I> and the 
 day will come when <I>those that</I> now <I>spoil thee shall be a 
 spoil.</I>" Those that <I>lead into captivity shall go into 
 captivity,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:10">Rev. xiii. 10</A>.

 This might serve to oblige the present conquerors to use their captives 
 well, because the wheel would turn round, and the day would come when 
 they also should be captives, and let them do now as they would then be 
 done by. 
 
 7. Though the wound seem incurable, God will make a cure of it
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>I will restore health unto thee.</I> Be the disease ever so 
 dangerous, the patient is safe if God undertakes the cure.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Upon the whole matter, they are cautioned against inordinate fear 
 and grief, for in these precious promises there is enough to silence 
 both. 

 1. They must not tremble as those that have no hope in the apprehension
 of future further trouble that might threaten them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>Fear thou not, O my servant Jacob! neither be dismayed.</I> Note, 
 Those that are God's servants must not give way to disquieting fears, 
 whatever difficulties and dangers may be before them. 

 2. They must not sorrow as those that have no hope for the troubles 
 which at present they lie under,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 "<I>Why criest thou for thy affliction?</I> It is true thy carnal 
 confidences fail thee, creatures are physicians of no value, but <I>I 
 will heal thy wound,</I> and therefore, <I>Why criest thou?</I> Why 
 dost thou fret and complain thus? It is <I>for thy sin</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>),
 
 and therefore, instead of repining, thou shouldest be repenting. 
 <I>Wherefore should a man complain for the punishment of his sins?</I> 
 The issue will be good at last, and therefore <I>rejoice in 
 hope.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Behold, I will bring again the
 captivity of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwelling-places;
 and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace
 shall remain after the manner thereof.
 &nbsp; 19  And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of
 them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall
 not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be
 small.
 &nbsp; 20  Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their
 congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish
 all that oppress them.
 &nbsp; 21  And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor
 shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to
 draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who <I>is</I> this that
 engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 22  And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.
 &nbsp; 23  Behold, the whirlwind of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> goeth forth with fury, a
 continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of
 the wicked.
 &nbsp; 24  The fierce anger of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall not return, until he have
 done <I>it,</I> and until he have performed the intents of his heart:
 in the latter days ye shall consider it.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here further intimations of the favour God had in reserve for 
 them after the days of their calamity were over. It is promised,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That the city and temple should be rebuilt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 <I>Jacob's tents,</I> and <I>his dwelling places,</I> felt the effects 
 of <I>the captivity,</I> for they lay in ruins when the inhabitants 
 were carried away captives; but, when they have returned, the 
 habitations shall be repaired, and raised up out of their ruins, and 
 therein God will <I>have mercy upon their dwelling places,</I> that had 
 been monuments of his justice. Then <I>the city</I> of Jerusalem 
 <I>shall be built upon her own heap,</I> her own hill, though now it be 
 no better than a ruinous heap. The situation was unexceptionable, and 
 therefore it shall be rebuilt upon the same spot of ground. He that can 
 <I>make of a city a heap</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:2">Isa. xxv. 2</A>)

 can when he pleases <I>make of a heap a city</I> again. <I>The
 palace</I> (the temple, God's palace) <I>shall remain after the manner 
 thereof;</I> it shall be built after the old model; and the service of 
 God shall be constantly kept up there and attended as formerly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That the sacred feasts should again be solemnized 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>Out of</I> the city, and the temple, and all the dwelling-places of 
 Jacob, <I>shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of those that make 
 merry.</I> They shall go with expressions of joy to the temple service, 
 and with the like shall return from it. Observe, The voice of 
 <I>thanksgiving</I> is the same with <I>the voice of those that make 
 merry;</I> for whatever is the matter of our joy should be the matter 
 of our praise. <I>Is any merry? Let him sing psalms.</I> What makes us 
 cheerful should make us thankful. <I>Serve the Lord with 
 gladness.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That the people should be multiplied, and increased, and made 
 considerable: <I>They shall not be few, they shall not be small,</I> 
 but shall become numerous and illustrious, and make a figure among the 
 nations; for <I>I will multiply them</I> and <I>I will glorify 
 them.</I> It is for the honour of the church to have many added to it 
 that shall be saved. This would make them be of some weight among their 
 neighbours. Let a people be ever so much diminished and despised, God 
 can multiply and glorify them. They shall be restored to their former 
 honour: <I>Their children shall be as aforetime,</I> playing in the 
 streets 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:5">Zech. viii. 5</A>);

 they shall inherit their parents' estates and honours as formerly;
 <I>and their congregation shall,</I> both in civil and sacred things, 
 <I>be established before me.</I> There shall be a constant succession 
 of faithful magistrates in the congregation of the elders, to establish 
 that, and of faithful worshippers in the congregation of the saints. As 
 one generation passes away another shall be raised up, and so the 
 <I>congregation shall be established before</I> God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That they shall be blessed with a good government 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>Their nobles</I> and judges <I>shall be of themselves,</I> of their 
 own nation, and they shall no longer be ruled by strangers and enemies; 
 <I>their governor shall proceed from the midst of them,</I> shall be 
 one that has been a sharer with them in the afflictions of their 
 captive state; and this has reference to Christ our <I>governor, David 
 our King</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 he is of ourselves, <I>in all things made like unto his brethren. And I 
 will cause him to draw near;</I> this may be understood either, 

 1. Of the people, Jacob and Israel: "<I>I will cause</I> them <I>to
 draw near</I> to me in the temple service, as formerly, to come in to 
 covenant with me, as <I>my people</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 to <I>approach to me</I> in communion; <I>for who</I> hath <I>engaged 
 his heart,</I> made a covenant with it, and brought it into bonds, 
 <I>to approach unto me?</I>" How few are there that do so! None can do 
 it but by the special grace of God <I>causing them to draw near.</I> 
 Note, Whenever we approach to God in any holy ordinance we must engage 
 our hearts to do it; the heart must be prepared for the duty, employed 
 in it, and kept closely to it. The heart is the main thing that God 
 looks at and requires; but it is deceitful, and will start aside of a 
 great deal of care and pains be not taken to engage it, to bind this 
 <I>sacrifice with cords.</I> Or, 

 2. It may be understood of the governor; for it is a single person that 
 is spoken of: <I>Their governor shall</I> be duly called to his office, 
 shall <I>draw near</I> to God to consult him upon all occasions. God 
 <I>will cause him to approach to</I> him, for, otherwise, who would 
 engage to take care of so weak a people, and let this ruin come under 
 their hand? But when God has work to do, though attended with many 
 discouragements, he will raise up instruments to do it. But it looks 
 further, to Christ, to him as Mediator. Note,

 (1.) The proper work and office of Christ, as Mediator, is <I>to draw 
 near and approach unto</I> God, not for himself only, but for us, and 
 in our name and stead, as the high priest of our profession. The 
 priests are said to draw nigh to God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+10:3,21:17">Lev. x. 3; xxi. 17</A>.
 
 <I>Moses drew near,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:21">Exod. xx. 21</A>.

 (2.) God the Father did <I>cause</I> Jesus Christ thus <I>to draw near 
 and approach to</I> him as Mediator. He commanded and appointed him to
 do it; he sanctified and sealed him, anointed him for this purpose, 
 accepted him, and declared himself well pleased in him.

 (3.) Jesus Christ, being caused by the Father to approach unto him as 
 Mediator, did <I>engage his heart to</I> do it, that is, he bound and 
 obliged himself to it, <I>undertook for his heart</I> (so some read 
 it), for his soul, that, in the fullness of time, it should be <I>made 
 an offering for sin.</I> His own voluntary undertaking, in compliance 
 with his Father's will and in compassion to fallen man, engaged him, 
 and then his own honour kept him to it. It also intimates that he was 
 hearty and resolute, free and cheerful, in it, and made nothing of the 
 difficulties that lay in his way,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:3-5">Isa. lxiii. 3-5</A>.

 (4.) Jesus Christ was, in all this, truly wonderful. We may well ask,
 with admiration, <I>Who is this that</I> thus <I>engages his heart</I> 
 to such an undertaking?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. That they shall be taken again into covenant with God, according to 
 the covenant made with their fathers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>You shall be my people;</I> and it is God's good work in us that 
 makes us <I>to him a people, a people for his name,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:14">Acts xv. 14</A>.
 
 <I>I will be your God.</I> It is his good-will to us that is the
 summary of that part of the covenant.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. That their enemies shall be reckoned with and brought down 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):
 
 <I>I will punish all</I> those <I>that oppress them,</I> so that it 
 shall appear to all a dangerous thing to <I>touch God's anointed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:15">Ps. cv. 15</A>.

 The
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:23,24">last two verses</A>

 come under this head: <I>The whirlwind of the Lord shall fall with pain
 upon the head of the wicked.</I> These two verses we had before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:19,20"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 19, 20</A>);

 <I>there</I> they were a denunciation of God's wrath against the wicked
 hypocrites in Israel; <I>here</I> against the wicked oppressors of 
 Israel. The expressions, exactly agreeing, speak the same with that 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:22,23">Isa. li. 22, 23</A>),

 <I>I will take the cup of trembling out of thy hand and put it into the
 hand of those that afflict thee.</I> The wrath of God against the 
 wicked is here represented to be. 

 1. Very terrible, like a whirlwind, surprising and irresistible.

 2. Very grievous. It <I>shall fall with pain upon their heads;</I> they
 shall be as much hurt as frightened. 

 3. It shall pursue them. Whirlwinds are usually short, but this shall
 be <I>a continuing whirlwind.</I> 

 4. It shall accomplish that for which it is sent: <I>The anger of the 
 Lord shall not return till he have done it.</I> The purposes of his 
 wrath, as well as the purposes of his love, will all be fulfilled; he 
 will <I>perform the intents of his heart.</I> 

 5. Those that will not lay this to heart now will then be unable to put
 off the thoughts of it: <I>In the latter days you shall consider 
 it,</I> when it will be too late to prevent it.</P>
