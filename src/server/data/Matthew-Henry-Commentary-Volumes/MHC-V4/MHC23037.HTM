 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have a further repetition of the story which we had 
 before in the book of Kings concerning Sennacherib. In the foregoing 
 chapter we had him conquering and threatening to conquer. In this 
 chapter we have him falling, and at last fallen, in answer to prayer, 
 and in fulfillment of many of the prophecies which we have met with in 
 the foregoing chapters. Here we have, 

 I. Hezekiah's pious reception of Rabshakeh's impious discourse, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:1">ver. 1</A>.
 
 II. The gracious message he sent to Isaiah to desire his prayers, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:2-5">ver.  2-5</A>.

 III. The encouraging answer which Isaiah sent to him from God, assuring
 him that God would plead his cause against the king of Assyria, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>.

 IV. An abusive letter which the king of Assyria sent to Hezekiah, to
 the same purport with Rabshakeh's speech, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:8-13">ver. 8-13</A>.

 V.  Hezekiah's humble prayer to God upon the receipt of this letter, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:14-20">ver.  14-20</A>.

 VI.  The further full answer which God sent him by Isaiah, promising
 him that his affairs should shortly take a happy turn, that the storm
 should blow over and every thing should appear bright and serene,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:21-35">ver.  21-35</A>.

 VII. The immediate accomplishment of this prophecy in the ruin of his
 army

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:36">ver. 36</A>)

 and the murder of himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:37,38">
 ver. 37, 38</A>.

 All this was largely opened,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard <I>it,</I> that he
 rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went
 into the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 2  And he sent Eliakim, who <I>was</I> over the household, and Shebna
 the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth,
 unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
 &nbsp; 3  And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day <I>is</I> a
 day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children
 are come to the birth, and <I>there is</I> not strength to bring
 forth.
 &nbsp; 4  It may be the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh,
 whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the
 living God, and will reprove the words which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God
 hath heard: wherefore lift up <I>thy</I> prayer for the remnant that
 is left.
 &nbsp; 5  So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
 &nbsp; 6  And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your
 master, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Be not afraid of the words that thou
 hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have
 blasphemed me.
 &nbsp; 7  Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a
 rumour, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall
 by the sword in his own land.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may observe here, 

 1. That the best way to baffle the malicious designs of our enemies 
 against us is to be driven by them to God and to our duty and so to 
 fetch meat out of the eater. Rabshakeh intended to frighten Hezekiah 
 from the Lord, but it proves that he frightens him to the Lord. The 
 wind, instead of forcing the traveller's coat from him, makes him wrap 
 it the closer about him. The more Rabshakeh reproaches God the more 
 Hezekiah studies to honour him, by rending his clothes for the 
 dishonour done to him and attending in his sanctuary to know his mind. 
 
 2. That it well becomes great men to desire the prayers of good men and
 good ministers. Hezekiah sent messengers, and honourable ones, those of 
 the first rank, to Isaiah, to desire his prayers, remembering how much 
 his prophecies of late had plainly looked towards the events of the 
 present day, in dependence upon which, it is probable, he doubted not 
 but that the issue would be comfortable, yet he would have it to be so 
 in answer to prayer: <I>This is a day of trouble,</I> therefore let it 
 be a day of prayer. 

 3. When we are most at a plunge we should be most earnest in prayer:
 Now that the <I>children are brought to the birth,</I> but <I>there is 
 not strength to bring forth,</I> now let prayer come, and help at a 
 dead lift. When pains are most strong let prayers be most lively; and, 
 when we meet with the greatest difficulties, then is a time to stir up 
 not ourselves only, but others also, to take hold on God. Prayer is the 
 midwife of mercy, that helps to bring it forth. 

 4. It is an encouragement to pray though we have but some hopes of
 mercy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>It may be the Lord thy God will hear; who knows but he will return
 and repent?</I> The <I>it may be</I> of the prospect of the haven of 
 blessings should quicken us with double diligence to ply the oar of 
 prayer. 

 5. When there is a remnant left, and but a remnant, it concerns us to
 lift up a prayer for that remnant,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 The prayer that reaches heaven must be lifted up by a strong faith, 
 earnest desires, and a direct intention to the glory of God, all which 
 should be quickened when we come to the last stake. 

 6. Those that have made God their enemy we have no reason to be afraid 
 of, for they are marked for ruin; and, though they may hiss, they 
 cannot hurt.  Rabshakeh has blasphemed God, and therefore let not 
 Hezekiah be afraid of him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 He has made God a party to the cause by his invectives, and therefore 
 judgment will certainly be given against him. God will certainly plead 
 his own cause.  

 7.  Sinners' fears are but prefaces to their falls. He shall <I>hear
 the rumour</I> of the slaughter of his army, which shall oblige him to 
 retire to his own land, and there he shall be slain,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:7"><I>v.</I>  7</A>.

 The terrors that pursue him shall bring him at last to the <I>king of 
 terrors,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:11,14">Job xviii. 11, 14</A>.

 The curses that come upon sinners shall overtake them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring
 against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from
 Lachish.
 &nbsp; 9  And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is
 come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard <I>it,</I> he sent
 messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
 &nbsp; 10  Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let
 not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying,
 Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of
 Assyria.
 &nbsp; 11  Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done
 to all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be
 delivered?
 &nbsp; 12  Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers
 have destroyed, <I>as</I> Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the
 children of Eden which <I>were</I> in Telassar?
 &nbsp; 13  Where <I>is</I> the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and
 the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?
 &nbsp; 14  And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the
 messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and spread it before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 15  And Hezekiah prayed unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, saying,
 &nbsp; 16  O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest <I>between</I> the
 cherubims, thou <I>art</I> the God, <I>even</I> thou alone, of all the
 kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth.
 &nbsp; 17  Incline thine ear, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and hear; open thine eyes, O
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath
 sent to reproach the living God.
 &nbsp; 18  Of a truth, L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all
 the nations, and their countries,
 &nbsp; 19  And have cast their gods into the fire: for they <I>were</I> no
 gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they
 have destroyed them.
 &nbsp; 20  Now therefore, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God, save us from his hand, that
 all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou <I>art</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 <I>even</I> thou only.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may observe here, 

 1. That, if God give us inward satisfaction in his promise, this may 
 confirm us in our silently bearing reproaches. God answered Hezekiah, 
 but it does not appear that he, after deliberation, sent any answer to 
 Rabshakeh; but, God having taken the work into his own hands, he 
 quietly left the matter with him. <I>So Rabshakeh returned</I> to the 
 king his master for fresh instructions. 

 2. Those that delight in war shall have enough of it. Sennacherib,
 without provocation given to him or warning given by him, went forth to 
 war against Judah; and now with as little ceremony the king of Ethiopia 
 goes forth to war against him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Those that are quarrelsome may expect to be quarrelled with; and God 
 sometimes checks the rage of his enemies by giving it a powerful 
 diversion. 

 3. It is bad to talk proudly and profanely, but it is worse to write
 so, for this argues more deliberation and design, and what is written
 spreads further, lasts longer, and does the more mischief.  Atheism and
 irreligion, written, will certainly be reckoned for another day. 

 4.  Great successes often harden sinners' hearts in their sinful ways
 and make them the more daring. Because the kings of Assyria have 
 destroyed all lands (though, in fact, they were but a few that fell 
 within their reach), therefore they doubt not but to destroy God's 
 land; because the gods of the nations were unable to help they conclude 
 the God of Israel is so; because the idolatrous kings of Hamath and 
 Arphad became an easy prey to them therefore they doubt not but to 
 destroy God's land; because the idolatrous kings of Hamath and Arphad 
 became an easy prey to them therefore the religious reforming king of 
 Judah must needs be so too.  Thus is this proud man ripened for ruin by 
 the sunshine of prosperity.  

 5. Liberty of access to the throne of grace, and liberty of speech
 there, are the unspeakable privilege of the Lord's people at all times, 
 especially in times of distress and danger. Hezekiah took Sennacherib's 
 letter, and spread it before the Lord, not designing to make any 
 complaints against him but those grounded upon his own handwriting. Let 
 the thing speak itself; here it is in black and white: <I>Open thy 
 eyes, O Lord! and see.</I> God allows his praying people to be humbly 
 free with him, to utter all their words, as Jephthah did, before him, 
 to spread the letter, whether of a friend or an enemy, before him, and 
 leave the contents, the concern of it, with him. 

 6. The great and fundamental principles of our religion, applied by
 faith and improved in prayer, will be of sovereign use to us in our 
 particular exigencies and distresses, whatever they are; to them 
 therefore we must have recourse, and abide by them; so Hezekiah did 
 here. He encouraged himself with this, that the God of Israel is <I>the 
 Lord of hosts,</I> of all hosts, of the hosts of Israel, to animate 
 him, of the hosts of their enemies, to dispirit and restrain 
 them,--that he is God <I>alone,</I> and there is none that can stand in 
 competition with him,--that he is the <I>God of all the kingdoms of the 
 earth,</I> and disposes of them all as he pleases; for he made heaven 
 and earth, and therefore both can do any thing and does every thing. 

 7.  When we are afraid of men that are great destroyers we may with
 humble boldness appeal to God as the great Saviour. They have indeed 
 destroyed the nations, who had thrown themselves out of the protection 
 of the true God by worshipping false gods, but the Lord, the God alone, 
 is our God, our King, our lawgiver, and he will save us, who is <I>the 
 Saviour of those that believe.</I> 

 8. We have enough to take hold of, in our wrestling with God by prayer,
 if we can but plead that his glory is interested in our case, that his 
 name will be profaned if we are run down and glorified if we are 
 relieved.  Thence therefore will our most prevailing pleas be drawn: 
 "Do it for thy glory's sake."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus
 saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me
 against Sennacherib king of Assyria:
 &nbsp; 22  This <I>is</I> the word which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath spoken concerning
 him; The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, <I>and</I>
 laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her
 head at thee.
 &nbsp; 23  Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom
 hast thou exalted <I>thy</I> voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high?
 <I>even</I> against the Holy One of Israel.
 &nbsp; 24  By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast
 said, By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height
 of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down
 the tall cedars thereof, <I>and</I> the choice fir trees thereof: and
 I will enter into the height of his border, <I>and</I> the forest of
 his Carmel.
 &nbsp; 25  I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet
 have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.
 &nbsp; 26  Hast thou not heard long ago, <I>how</I> I have done it; <I>and</I> of
 ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to
 pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities <I>into</I>
 ruinous heaps.
 &nbsp; 27  Therefore their inhabitants <I>were</I> of small power, they were
 dismayed and confounded: they were <I>as</I> the grass of the field,
 and <I>as</I> the green herb, <I>as</I> the grass on the housetops, and <I>as
 corn</I> blasted before it be grown up.
 &nbsp; 28  But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in,
 and thy rage against me.
 &nbsp; 29  Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into
 mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my
 bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which
 thou camest.
 &nbsp; 30  And this <I>shall be</I> a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat <I>this</I>
 year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which
 springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap,
 and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.
 &nbsp; 31  And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall
 again take root downward, and bear fruit upward:
 &nbsp; 32  For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that
 escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts shall do
 this.
 &nbsp; 33  Therefore thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> concerning the king of
 Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow
 there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against
 it.
 &nbsp; 34  By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and
 shall not come into this city, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 35  For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake,
 and for my servant David's sake.
 &nbsp; 36  Then the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> went forth, and smote in the camp
 of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and
 when they arose early in the morning, behold, they <I>were</I> all
 dead corpses.
 &nbsp; 37  So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and
 returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.
 &nbsp; 38  And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of
 Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him
 with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and
 Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may here observe, 

 1. That those who receive messages of terror from men with patience, 
 and send messages of faith to God by prayer, may expect messages of 
 grace and peace from God for their comfort, even when they are most 
 cast down. Isaiah sent a long answer to Hezekiah's prayer in God's 
 name, sent it in writing (for it was too long to be sent by word of 
 mouth), and sent it by way of return to his prayer, relation being
 thereunto had: "<I>Whereas thou hast prayed to me,</I> know, for thy 
 comfort, that thy prayer is heard." Isaiah might have referred him to 
 the prophecies he had delivered (particularly that

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:1-34"><I>ch.</I> x.</A>)

 and bid him pick out an answer from thence; but, that he might have
 abundant consolation, a message is sent him on purpose. The 
 correspondence between earth and heaven is never let fall on God's 
 side. 

 2. Those who magnify themselves, especially who magnify themselves
 against God and his people, do really vilify themselves, and made 
 themselves contemptible, in the eyes of all wise men: <I>"The virgin, 
 the daughter of Zion, has despised</I> Sennacherib, and all his 
 impotent malice and menaces; she knows that, while she preserves her 
 integrity, she is sure of the divine protection, and that though the 
 enemy may bark he cannot bite. All his threats are a jest; it is all 
 but <I>brutum fulmen--a mere flash,</I>" 

 3. Those who abuse the people of God affront God himself; and he takes
 what is said and done against them as said and done against himself: 
 "<I>Whom hast thou reproached?</I> Even <I>the Holy One of Israel,</I> 
 whom thou hast <I>therefore</I> reproached because he is a Holy One." 
 And it aggravated the indignity Sennacherib did to God that he not only 
 reproached him himself, but set his servants on to do the same: <I>By 
 thy servants,</I> the abjects, <I>thou hast reproached me.</I> 

 4. Those who boast of themselves and their own achievements reflect
 upon God and his providence: "<I>Thou hast said, I have digged, and 
 drunk water;</I> I have done mighty feats, and will do more; and wilt 
 not own that <I>I have done it,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:24-26"><I>v.</I> 24-26</A>.

 The most active men are no more than God makes them, and God makes them 
 no more than of old he designed to make them: "<I>What I have formed of 
 ancient times,</I> in an eternal counsel, <I>now have I brought to 
 pass</I>" (for God does all according to the counsel of his will), 
 "<I>that thou shouldst be to lay waste defenced cities;</I> it is 
 therefore intolerable arrogance to make it thy own doing." 

 5. All the malice, and all the motions and projects, of the church's
 enemies, are under the cognizance and check of the church's God. 
 Sennacherib was active and quick, here, and there, and every where, but 
 God knew his going out and coming in, and had always an eye upon him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 And that was not all; he had a hand upon him too, a strict hand, a 
 strong hand, <I>a hook in his nose and a bridle in his lips,</I> with 
 which, though he was very headstrong and unruly, he could and would 
 <I>turn him back by the way which he came,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:29"><I>v.</I>  29</A>.

 <I>Hitherto he shall come and no further.</I> God had signed 
 Sennacherib's commission against Judah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:6"><I>ch.</I> x. 6</A>);

 here he supersedes it. He has frightened them, but he must not hurt
 them, and therefore is discharged from going any further; nay, his 
 commitment is here signed, by which he is clapped up, to answer for 
 what he had done beyond his commission. 

 6. God is his people's bountiful benefactor, as well as their powerful
 protector, both a sun and a shield to those that trust in him. 
 Jerusalem shall be defended

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>),

 the besiegers shall not come into it, no, nor come before it with any 
 regular attack, but they shall be routed before they begin the siege, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 But this is not all; God will return in mercy to his people, and will 
 do them good.  Their land shall be more than ordinarily fruitful, so 
 that their losses shall be abundantly repaired; they shall not feel any 
 of the ill effects either of the enemies' wasting the country or of 
 their own being taken off from husbandry. But the earth, as at first, 
 shall bring forth of itself, and they shall live and live plentifully 
 upon its spontaneous productions. The blessing of the Lord can, when he 
 pleases, make rich without the hand of the diligent. And let them not 
 think that the desolations of their country would excuse them from 
 observing the sabbatical year, which happened (as it should seem) the 
 year after, and when they were not to plough or sow; no, though they 
 had not now their usual stock beforehand for that year, yet they must 
 religiously observe it, and depend upon God to provide for them. God 
 must be trusted in the way of duty. 

 7.  There is no standing before the judgments of God when they come
 with commission.

 (1.) The greatest numbers cannot stand before them: one angel shall, in 
 one night, lay a vast army of men dead upon the spot, when God 
 commissions him so to do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 Here are 185,000 brave soldiers in an instant turned into so many dead 
 corpses.  Many think the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:1-12">76th Psalm</A>

 was penned upon occasion of this defeat, where from <I>the spoiling of
 the stout-hearted,</I> and sending them to sleep their long sleep

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:5"><I>v.</I>  5</A>),

 it is inferred that God is <I>more glorious and excellent than the 
 mountains of prey</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 and that <I>he, even he, is to be feared,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Angels are employed, more than we are aware of, as ministers of God's 
 justice, to punish the pride and break the power of wicked men.

 (2.) The greatest men cannot stand before them: <I>The great king, the 
 king of Assyria,</I> looks very little when he is forced to return, not 
 only with shame, because he cannot accomplish what he had projected 
 with so much assurance, but with terror and fear, lest the angel that 
 had destroyed his army should destroy him; yet he is made to look less 
 when his own sons, who should have guarded him, sacrificed him to his 
 idol, whose protection he sought, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:37,38"><I>v.</I> 37, 38</A>.

 God can quickly stop their breath who <I>breathe out threatenings and
 slaughter</I> against his people, and will do it when they have filled 
 up the measure of their iniquity; and <I>the Lord is known by</I> these 
 <I>judgments which he executes,</I> known to be a God that resists the 
 proud. Many prophecies were fulfilled in this providence, which should 
 encourage us, as far as they look further, and are designed as common 
 and general assurances of the safety of the church and of all that 
 trust in God, to depend upon God for the accomplishment of them. He 
 that has delivered does and will deliver.  Lord, forgive our enemies; 
 but, <I>so let all thy enemies perish, O Lord!</I></P>
