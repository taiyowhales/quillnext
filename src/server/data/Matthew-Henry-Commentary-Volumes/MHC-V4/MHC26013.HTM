 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Mention had been made, in the chapter before, of the vain visions and
 flattering divinations with which the people of Israel suffered
 themselves to be imposed upon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:24">ver. 24</A>);

 now this whole chapter is levelled against them. God's faithful
 prophets are nowhere so sharp upon any sort of sinners as upon the 
 false prophets, not because they were the most spiteful enemies to 
 them, but because the put the highest affront upon God and did the 
 greatest mischief to his people. The prophet here shows the sin and 
 punishment,

 I. Of the false prophets, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:1-16">ver. 1-16</A>.

 II. Of the false prophetesses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:17-23">ver. 17-23</A>.

 Both agreed to sooth men up in their sins, and, under pretence of
 comforting God's people, to flatter them with hopes that they should
 yet have peace; but the prophets shall be proved liars, their
 prophecies mere shams, and the expectations of the people illusions;
 for God will let them know that "the deceived and the deceiver are
 his," are both accountable to him,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that
 prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own
 hearts, Hear ye the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>;
 &nbsp; 3  Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Woe unto the foolish prophets, that
 follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!
 &nbsp; 4  O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.
 &nbsp; 5  Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge
 for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 6  They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 saith: and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath not sent them: and they have made
 <I>others</I> to hope that they would confirm the word.
 &nbsp; 7  Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a
 lying divination, whereas ye say, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> saith <I>it;</I> albeit I
 have not spoken?
 &nbsp; 8  Therefore thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Because ye have spoken
 vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I <I>am</I> against you,
 saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 9  And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and
 that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people,
 neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of
 Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye
 shall know that I <I>am</I> the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.

 The false prophets, who are here prophesied against, were some of them 
 at Jerusalem 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:14">Jer. xxiii. 14</A>):

 <I>I have seen in the prophets at Jerusalem a horrible thing;</I> some
 of them among the captives in Babylon, for to them Jeremiah writes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:8">Jer. xxix. 8</A>),

 <I>Let not your diviners, that be in the midst of you, deceive you.</I>
 And as God's prophets, though at a distance from each other in place or 
 time, yet preached the same truths, which was an evidence that they 
 were guided by one and the same good Spirit, so the false prophets 
 prophesied the same lies, being actuated by one and the same spirit of 
 error. There were little hopes of bringing them to repentance, they 
 were so hardened in their sin; yet Ezekiel must prophesy against them, 
 in hopes that the people might be cautioned not to hearken to them; and 
 thus a testimony will be left upon record against them, and they will 
 thereby be left inexcusable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Ezekiel had express orders to <I>prophesy against the prophets of 
 Israel;</I> so they called themselves, as if none but they had been 
 worthy of the name of Israel's prophets, who were indeed Israel's
 deceivers. But it is observable that Israel was never imposed upon by 
 pretenders to prophecy till after they had rejected and abused the true 
 prophets; as, afterwards, they were never deluded by counterfeit 
 messiahs till after they had refused the true Messiah and rejected him. 
 These false prophets must be required to <I>hear the word of the 
 Lord.</I> They took upon them to speak what concerned others as from 
 God; let them now hear what concerned themselves as from him. And two 
 things the prophet is directed to do:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To discover their sin to them, and to convince them of that if 
 possible, or thereby to prevent their proceeding any further, by making 
 <I>manifest their folly unto all men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:9">2 Tim. iii. 9</A>.

 They are here called <I>foolish prophets</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 men that did not at all understand the business they pretended to; to 
 make fools of the people they made fools of themselves, and put the 
 greatest cheat upon their own souls. Let us see what is here laid to 
 their charge. 

 1. They pretend to have a commission from God, whereas he never sent
 them. They thrust themselves into the prophetic office, without warrant 
 from him who is <I>the Lord God</I> of the holy prophets, which was a 
 foolish thing; for how could they expect that God should own them in a 
 work to which he never called them? They are <I>prophets out of their 
 own hearts</I> (so the margin reads it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),
 
 prophets of their own making, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 <I>They say, The Lord saith;</I> they pretend to be his messengers, but 
 <I>the Lord has not sent them,</I> has not given them any orders. They 
 counterfeit the broad seal of heaven, than which they cannot do a 
 greater indignity to mankind, for hereby they put a reproach upon 
 divine revelation, lessen its credit, and weaken its credibility. When 
 these pretenders are found to be deceivers atheists and infidels will 
 thence infer, They are all so. <I>The Lord has not sent them;</I> for 
 though crafty enough in other things <I>like the foxes,</I> and very 
 wise for the world, yet they are <I>foolish prophets</I> and have no 
 experimental acquaintance with the things of God. Note, Foolish 
 prophets are not of God's sending, for whom he sends he either finds 
 fit or makes fit. Where he gives warrant he gives wisdom. 

 2. They pretend to have instructions from God, whereas he never made 
 himself and his mind known to them: <I>They followed their own 
 spirit</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 they delivered that as a message from God which was the product either 
 of their subtle invention, to serve a turn for themselves, or of their 
 own crazed and heated imagination, to give vent to a fancy. For <I>they 
 have seen nothing,</I> they have not really had any heavenly vision; 
 they pretend that what they say <I>the Lord saith it,</I> but God 
 disowns it: "<I>I have not spoken it,</I> I never said it, never meant 
 any such thing." What they delivered was not what they had seen or 
 heard, as that is which the ministers of Christ deliver 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:1">1 John i. 1</A>),
 
 but either what they had dreamed or what they thought would please
 those they coveted to make an interest in; this is called their
 <I>seeing vanity and lying divination</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 they pretended to have seen that which they did not see, and produced 
 that as a divine truth which they knew to be false. To the same purport 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>You have see a vain vision and spoken a lying divination,</I> which 
 had no divine original and would have no effect, but would certainly be 
 disproved by the event; the words are changed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>You have spoken vanity and seen lies;</I> what they saw and what 
 they said was all alike, a mere sham; they saw nothing, they said 
 nothing, to the purpose, nothing that could be relied on or that 
 deserved regard. Again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 They <I>see vanity and divine lies;</I> they pretended to have had 
 visions, as the true prophets had, whereas really they had none, but 
 either it was the creature of their own fancy (they thought they had a 
 vision, as men in a delirium do, that was <I>seeing vanity</I>) or it 
 was a fiction of their own politics, and they knew they had none, and 
 then they <I>saw lies, and divined lies.</I> See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:16">Jer. xxiii. 16</A>,

 &c. Note, Since the devil is universally know to be the father of
 lies, those put the highest affront imaginable upon God who tell lies, 
 and then father them upon him. But those that had put God's character 
 upon Satan, in worshipping devils, arrived at length at such a pitch of 
 impiety as to put Satan's character upon God. 

 3. They took no care to prevent the judgments of God that were breaking
 in upon the kingdom. They are like <I>the foxes in the deserts,</I>
 running to and fro, and seeming to be in a great hurry, but it was to 
 get away and shift for their own safety, not to do any good: <I>The 
 hireling flees, and leaves the sheep.</I> They are like foxes that are 
 greedy of prey for themselves, crafty and cruel to feed themselves.
 But

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 "You <I>have not gone up into the gaps, nor made up the hedge of the 
 house of Israel.</I> A breach is made in their fences, at which 
 judgments are ready to pour in upon them, and then, if ever, is the 
 time to do them service; but you have done nothing to help them." They 
 should have made intercession for them, to turn away the wrath of God; 
 but they were not praying prophets, had no interest in heaven nor 
 intercourse with heaven (as prophets used to have, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:7">Gen. xx. 7</A>)

 and so could do them no service that way. They should have made it
 their business by preaching and advice to bring people to repentance 
 and reformation, and so have <I>made up the hedge,</I> and put a stop 
 to the judgments of God; but this was none of their care: they 
 contrived how to pleased people, not how to profit them. They saw a 
 deluge of profaneness and impiety breaking in upon the land, waging war 
 with virtue and holiness, and threatening to crush them and bear them 
 down, and then they should have come in <I>to the help of the Lord, to 
 the help of the Lord against the mighty,</I> by witnessing against the 
 wickedness of the time and place they lived in; but they thought that 
 would be as dangerous a piece of service as standing in a breach to 
 make it good against the besiegers, and therefore they declined it, did 
 nothing to stem the tide, stood not in the battle against vice and 
 immorality, but basely deserted the cause of religion and reformation, 
 <I>in the day of the Lord,</I> when it was proclaimed, <I>Who is on the 
 Lord's side? Who will rise up for me against the evil-doers?</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+94:16">Ps. xciv. 16</A>.

 Those were unworthy the name of prophets that could think so favourably
 of sin, and had so little zeal for God and the public welfare.

 4. They flattered people into a vain hope that the judgments God had 
 threatened would never come, whereby they hardened those in sin whom 
 they should have endeavoured to turn from sin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>They have made others to hope</I> that all should be well, and they 
 should have peace, though they went on still in their trespasses, and 
 that the event would confirm the word. They were still ready to say, 
 "We will warrant you that these troubles will be at an end quickly, and 
 we shall be in prosperity again." as if their warrants would confirm 
 false prophecies, in defiance of God himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He is directed to denounce the judgments of God against them for 
 these sins, from which their pretending to the character of prophets 
 would not exempt them. 
 
 1. In general, here is a <I>woe</I> against them
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and what that woe is we are told 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>).

 <I>Behold, I am against you, saith the Lord God.</I> Note, Those are in 
 a woeful condition that have God against them. Woe, and a thousand 
 woes, to those that have made him their enemy. 

 2. In particular, they are sentenced to be excluded from all the 
 privileges of the commonwealth of Israel, for they are adjudged to have 
 forfeited them all

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 God's <I>hand shall be upon them,</I> to seize them and bring them to 
 his bar, to shut them out from his presence, and they will find it a 
 <I>fearful thing to fall into his hands.</I> They pretend to be 
 prophets, particular favourites of heaven, and authorized to preside in 
 the congregation of his church on earth; but, by pretending to the 
 honours they were not entitled to, they lost those that otherwise they 
 might have enjoyed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:19">Matt. v. 19</A>.
 
 Their doom is,

 (1.) To be expelled from the communion of saints, and not to be looked 
 upon as belonging to it: <I>They shall not be in the secret of my 
 people;</I> their folly shall be so clearly manifested that they shall 
 never be consulted, nor their advice asked; they shall not be present 
 at any debates about public affairs. Or, rather, they shall not be in 
 the assembly of God's people for religious worship, for they shall be 
 ashamed to show their heads there, when they are proved by the events 
 to be false prophets, and, like Cain, shall <I>go out from the presence 
 of the Lord.</I> The people that are deceived by them shall abandon 
 them, and resolve to have no more to do with them. Those that usurped 
 Moses's chair shall not be allowed so much as a door-keeper's place. In 
 the great day they shall <I>not stand in the congregation of the 
 righteous</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:5">Ps. i. 5</A>),

 when God <I>gathers his saints together to him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:5,16">Ps. l. 5, 16</A>),
 
 <I>to be for ever with him.</I>

 (2.) To be expunged out of the book of the living. They shall die in 
 their captivity, and shall die childless, shall leave no posterity to 
 take their denomination from them, and so their names shall not be 
 found among those who either themselves or their posterity returned out 
 of Babylon, of whom a particular account was kept in a public register, 
 which was called <I>the writing of the house of Israel,</I> such as we 
 have 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:1-70">Ezra ii.</A>

 They shall not be found among the living in Jerusalem,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+4:3">Isa. iv. 3</A>.

 Or they shall not be found written among those whom God has from
 eternity chosen to be vessels of his mercy to eternity. We read of 
 those who <I>prophesied in Christ's name,</I> and yet he will tell them 
 that he <I>never knew them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:22,23">Matt. vii. 22, 23</A>),

 because they were not among those that were <I>given to him.</I> The
 Chaldee paraphrase reads it, <I>They shall not be written in the 
 writing of eternal life, which is written for the righteous of the 
 house of Israel.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:28">Ps. lxix. 28</A>.

 (3.) To be for ever excluded from the land of Israel. God has <I>sworn
 in his wrath</I> concerning them that <I>they shall never enter</I> 
 with the returning captives into the land of Canaan, which a second 
 time remains a rest for them. Note, Those who oppose the design of
 God's threatenings, and will not be awed and influenced by them, 
 forfeit the benefit of his promises, and cannot expect to be comforted 
 and encouraged by them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying,
 Peace; and <I>there was</I> no peace; and one built up a wall, and,
 lo, others daubed it with untempered <I>mortar:</I>
 &nbsp; 11  Say unto them which daub <I>it</I> with untempered <I>mortar,</I> that
 it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O
 great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 12  Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you,
 Where <I>is</I> the daubing wherewith ye have daubed <I>it?</I>
 &nbsp; 13  Therefore thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; I will even rend <I>it</I>
 with a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing
 shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in <I>my</I> fury to
 consume <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 14  So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with
 untempered <I>mortar,</I> and bring it down to the ground, so that the
 foundation thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and ye
 shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I
 <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 15  Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them
 that have daubed it with untempered <I>mortar,</I> and will say unto
 you, The wall <I>is</I> no <I>more,</I> neither they that daubed it;
 &nbsp; 16  <I>To wit,</I> the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning
 Jerusalem, and which see visions of peace for her, and <I>there is</I>
 no peace, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here more plain dealing with the false prophets, and some 
 further articles of their doom. We have seen the people made ashamed of 
 the false prophets (though sometimes they had been fond of them) and 
 casting them away, as they shall do their false gods, with indignation; 
 now here we find them as much ashamed of their false prophecies, which 
 they had sometimes depended upon with much assurance. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How the people are deceived by the false prophets. Those flatterers 
 seduce them, saying, <I>Peace, and there was no peace,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 They pretended to have <I>seen visions of peace,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 But that could not be, for <I>there was no peace, saith the Lord 
 God.</I> There was no prosperity designed for them, and therefore there 
 could be no ground for their security; yet they told them that God was 
 at peace with them, and had mercy in reserve for them, and that the war 
 they were engaged in with the Chaldeans should soon end in an 
 honourable peace, and their land should enjoy a happy repose and 
 tranquillity. They told the idolaters and other sinners that there was
 neither harm nor danger in the way they were in. Thus they <I>seduced 
 God's people;</I> they put a cheat upon them, led them into mistakes, 
 and drew them aside out of that way of repentance and reformation which 
 the other prophets were endeavouring to bring them into. Note, Those 
 are the most dangerous seducers who suggest to sinners that which tends 
 to lessen their dread of sin and their fear of God. Now this is 
 compared to the building of a slight rotten wall, or, according to our 
 Saviour's similitude, which is to the same purport with this 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:26">Matt. vii. 26</A>),

 the <I>building of a house upon the sand,</I> which seems to be a
 shelter and protection for a while, but will fall when a storm comes.
 One false prophet built the wall, set up the notion that God was not at 
 all displeased with Jerusalem, but that the city should be confirmed in 
 its flourishing state, and be victorious over the powers that now 
 threatened it. This notion was very pleasing, and he that started it 
 made himself very acceptable by it and was caressed by every body, 
 which invited others to say the same. They made the matter look yet 
 more plausible and promising; they <I>daubed the wall,</I> which the 
 first had built, but it was with <I>untempered mortar,</I> sorry stuff, 
 that will not bind nor hold the bricks together; they had no ground for 
 what they said, nor had it any consistency with itself, but was like 
 ropes of sand. They did not strengthen the wall, were in no care to
 make it firm, to see that they went upon sure grounds; they only daubed 
 it to hide the cracks and make it look well to the eye. And the wall 
 thus built, when it comes to any stress, much more to any distress, 
 will bulge and totter, and come down by degrees. Note, Doctrines that 
 are groundless, though ever so grateful, that are not built upon a 
 scripture foundation nor fastened with a scripture cement, though ever 
 so plausible, ever so pleasing, are not of any worth, nor will stand 
 men in any stead; and those hopes of peace and happiness which are not 
 warranted by the word of God will but cheat men, like a wall that is 
 well daubed indeed, but ill-built.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How they will be soon undeceived by the judgment of God, which, we 
 are sure, is according to truth. 

 1. God will in anger bring a terrible storm that shall beat fiercely
 and furiously upon the wall. The descent which the Chaldean army shall 
 make upon Judah, and the siege which they shall lay to Jerusalem, will 
 be as <I>an overflowing shower,</I> or inundation (such as Solomon 
 calls a <I>sweeping rain that leaves no food,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:3">Prov. xxviii. 3</A>),

 will bear down all before it, as the deluge did in Noah's time: <I>You, 
 O great hailstones! shall fall,</I> the artillery of heaven, every 
 hailstone like a cannon-ball, battering this wall, and with these a 
 <I>stormy wind,</I> which is sometimes so strong as to <I>rend the 
 rocks</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:11">1 Kings xix. 11</A>),
 
 much more an ill-built wall,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 But that which makes this <I>rain,</I> and <I>hail,</I> and
 <I>wind,</I> most terrible is that they arise from the wrath of God, 
 and are enforced by that; it is that which sends them; it is that which 
 gives them the setting on 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 it is <I>a stormy wind in my fury,</I> and <I>an overflowing shower in 
 my anger,</I> and <I>great hailstones in my fury.</I> The fury of 
 Nebuchadnezzar and his princes, who highly resented Zedekiah's 
 treachery, made the invasion very formidable, but that was nothing in 
 comparison with God's displeasure. <I>The staff in their hand is my
 indignation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:5">Isa. x. 5</A>.

 Note, An angry God has winds and storms at command wherewith to alarm
 secure sinners; and his wrath makes them frightful and forcible indeed; 
 for <I>who can stand before him when he is angry?</I>

 2. This storm shall overturn the wall: <I>it shall fall,</I> and the 
 wind shall <I>rend it</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 the <I>hailstones shall consume it</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 I will <I>break it down</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)

 and <I>bring it to the ground,</I> so that the <I>foundation thereof 
 shall be discovered;</I> it will appear how false, how rotten it was, 
 to the prophetical reproach of the builders. When the Chaldean army
 has made Judah and Jerusalem desolate then this credit of the prophets, 
 and the hopes of the people, will both sink together; the former will 
 be found false in flattering the people and the latter foolish in 
 suffering themselves to be imposed upon by them, and so exposed to so 
 much the greater confusion, when the judgment shall surprise them in 
 their security. Note, Whatever men think to shelter themselves with 
 against the judgments of God, while they continue unreformed, will 
 prove but a <I>refuge of lies</I> and will not profit them <I>in the 
 day of wrath.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:17">Isa. xxviii. 17</A>.

 Men's anger cannot shake that which God has built (for <I>the blast of
 the terrible ones is but as a storm against the wall,</I> which makes a 
 great noise, but never stirs the wall; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:4">Isa. xxv. 4</A>),

 but God's anger will overthrow that which men have built in opposition
 to him. They and all their attempts, they and all the securities 
 wherein they intrench themselves, shall be <I>as a bowing wall and as a 
 tottering fence</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:3,10">Ps. lxii. 3, 10</A>);

 and when their vain predictions are disproved, and their vain
 expectations disappointed, then it will be discovered that there was no 
 ground for either,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:13">Hab. iii. 13</A>.

 The <I>day will declare</I> what every man's work is, and <I>the fire 
 will try</I> it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:13">1 Cor. iii. 13</A>.

 3. The builders of the wall, and those that daubed it, will themselves
 be buried in the ruins of it: <I>It shall fall, and you shall</I> be 
 <I>consumed in the midst thereof,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 And thus the threatenings of God's wrath, and all the just intentions 
 of it, shall be accomplished to the uttermost, both upon <I>the 
 wall</I> and upon those <I>that have daubed it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 The same judgments that will prove the false prophets to be false will 
 punish them for their falsehood; and they themselves shall be involved 
 in the calamity which they made the people believe there was no danger 
 of, and become monuments of that justice which they bade defiance to.
 Thus, if <I>the blind lead the blind,</I> both the blind leaders and 
 the blind followers will <I>fall together into the ditch.</I> Note, 
 Those that deceive others will in the end prove to have deceived 
 themselves; and no doom will be more fearful than that of unfaithful 
 ministers, that flattered sinners in their sins. 

 4. Both the deceivers and the deceived, when they thus perish together, 
 will justly be ridiculed and triumphed over

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>When the wall has fallen shall it not be said unto you,</I> by those 
 that gave credit to the true prophets, and feared the word of the Lord, 
 "Now <I>where is the daubing wherewith you have daubed the wall?</I> 
 What has become of all the fine soft words and fair promises wherewith 
 you flattered your wicked neighbours, and all the assurances you gave 
 them that the troubles of the nation should soon be at an end?" The 
 <I>righteous shall laugh at them,</I> the righteous God shall, 
 righteous men shall, saying, <I>Lo, this is the man that made not God 
 his strength,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+52:6,7">Ps. lii. 6, 7</A>.

 <I>I also will laugh at your calamity,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:26">Prov. i. 26</A>.

 They will say unto you 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 "<I>The wall is no more, neither he that daubed it;</I> your hopes have 
 vanished, and those that supported them, even <I>the prophets of 
 Israel,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Note, Those that usurp the honours that do not belong to them will 
 shortly be filled with the shame that does.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the
 daughters of thy people, which prophesy out of their own heart;
 and prophesy thou against them,

 sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of

 &nbsp; 19  And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of
 barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As God has promised that when he pours out his Spirit upon his people 
 both <I>their sons and their daughters shall prophesy,</I> so the 
 devil, when he acts as a spirit of lies and falsehood, is so in the 
 mouth not only of false prophets, but of false prophetesses too, and 
 those are the deceivers whom the prophet is here directed to prophesy 
 against; for they are not such despicable enemies to God's truths as 
 deserve not to be taken notice of, nor yet will either the weakness of 
 their sex excuse their sin or the tenderness and respect that are owing 
 to it exempt them from the reproaches and threatenings of the word of 
 God. No: <I>Son of man, set they face against the daughters of thy 
 people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 God takes no pleasure in owning them for his people. They are <I>thy
 people,</I> as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:7">Exod. xxxii. 7</A>.

 The women pretend to a spirit of prophecy, and are in the same song
 with the men, as Ahab's prophets were: <I>Go on, and prosper.</I> They 
 <I>prophesy out of their own heart</I> too; they say what comes 
 uppermost and what they know nothing of. Therefore <I>prophesy against 
 them</I> from God's own mouth. The prophet must <I>set his face against 
 them,</I> and try if they can look him in the face and stand to what 
 they say. Note, When sinners grow very impudent it is time for 
 reprovers to be very bold. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How the sin of these false prophetesses is described, and what are 
 the particulars of it. 

 1. They told deliberate lies to those who consulted them, and came to
 them to be advised, and to be told their fortune: "You do mischief 
 <I>by your lying to my people that hear your lies</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);

 they come to be told the truth, but you tell them lies; and, because 
 you humour them in their sins, they are willing to hear you." Note, It 
 is ill with those people who can better hear pleasing lies than 
 unpleasing truths; and it is a temptation to those who lie in wait to 
 deceive to tell lies when they find people willing to hear them and to 
 excuse themselves with this, <I>Si populus vult decipi, decipiatur--If 
 the people will be deceived, let them.</I> 

 2. They profaned the name of God by pretending to have received those
 lies from him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):
 
 "<I>You pollute my name among my people,</I> and make use of that for 
 the patronising of your lies and the gaining of credit to them." Note, 
 Those greatly pollute God's holy name that make use of it to give 
 countenance to falsehood and wickedness. Yet this they did <I>for 
 handfuls of barley and pieces of bread.</I> They did it for gain; they 
 cared not what dishonour they did to God's name by their lying, so they 
 could but make a hand of it for themselves. There is nothing so sacred 
 which men of mercenary spirits, in whom the love of this world reigns, 
 will not profane and prostitute, if they can but get money by the 
 bargain. But they did it for poor gain; if they could get no more for 
 it, rather than break they would sell you a false prophecy that should 
 please you to a nicety for the beggar's dole, a <I>piece of bread</I> 
 or <I>a handful of barley;</I> and yet that was more than it was worth. 
 Had they asked it as an alms, for God's sake, surely they might have 
 had it, and God would have been honoured; but, taking it as a fee for a 
 false prophecy, God's name if polluted, and the smallness of the reward 
 heightens the offence. <I>For a piece of bread that man will 
 transgress,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:21">Prov. xxviii. 21</A>.

 Had their poverty been their temptation to <I>steal, and so to take the 
 name of the Lord in vain,</I> it would not have been nearly so bad as 
 when it tempted them to <I>prophesy lies in his name</I> and so to 
 profane it. 

 3. They kept people in awe, and terrified them with their pretensions:
 "<I>You hunt the souls of my people</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 <I>hunt them to make them flee</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 <I>hunt them into gardens</I> (so the margin reads it); you use all the 
 arts you have to court or compel them into those places where you 
 deliver your pretended predictions, or you have got such an influence 
 upon them that you make them do just as you would have them to do, and 
 tyrannise over them." It was indeed the people's fault that they did 
 regard them, but it was their fault by lies and falsehoods to command 
 that regard; they pretended to <I>save the souls alive that came to 
 them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 If they would but be hearers of them, and contributors to them, they 
 might be sure of salvation; thus they beguiled unstable souls that had 
 a concern about salvation as their end but did not rightly understand 
 the way, and therefore hearkened to those who were most confident in 
 promising it to them. "But will you pretend to save souls, or secure 
 salvation to your party?" Those are justly suspected that make such 
 pretensions. 

 4. They discouraged those that were honest and good, and encouraged 
 those that were wicked and profane: <I>You slay the souls that should 
 not die, and save those alive that should not live,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 This is explained 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>You have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made 
 sad;</I> because they would not, they durst not, countenance your 
 pretensions, you thundered out the judgments of God against them, to 
 their great grief and trouble; you put them under invidious characters, 
 to make them either despicable or odious to the people, and pretended 
 to do it in God's name, which made them go many a time with a sad 
 heart; whereas it was the will of God that they should be comforted, 
 and by having respect put upon them should have encouragement given 
 them. But on the other side, and which is still worse, you have 
 <I>strengthened the hands of the wicked</I> and emboldened them to go 
 on in their <I>wicked ways</I> and not to return from them, which was 
 the thing the true prophets with earnestness called them to. "You have 
 promised sinners life in their sinful ways, have told them that they 
 shall have peace though they go on, by which their <I>hands have been 
 strengthened</I> and their hearts hardened." Some think this refers to 
 the severe censures they passed upon those who had already gone into 
 captivity (who were humbled under their affliction, by <I>which their 
 hearts were made sad</I>), and the commendations they gave to those who 
 rebelled against the king of Babylon, who were hardened in their 
 impieties, by which their <I>hands were strengthened;</I> or by their 
 polluting the name of God they saddened the hearts of good people who 
 have a value and veneration for the word of God, and confirmed atheists 
 and infidels in their contempt of divine revelation and furnished them 
 with arguments against it. Note, Those have a great deal to answer for
 who grieve the spirits, and weaken the hands, of good people, and who 
 gratify the lusts of sinners, and animate them in their opposition to 
 God and religion. Nor can any thing strengthen the hands of sinners 
 more than to tell them that they may be saved in their sins without 
 repentance, or that there may be repentance though they do not return 
 from their wicked ways. 

 5. They mimicked the true prophets, by giving signs for the
 illustrating of their false predictions (as Hananiah did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+28:10">Jer. xxviii. 10</A>),
 
 and they were signs agreeable to their sex; they <I>sewed little
 pillows to the people's arm-holes,</I> to signify that they might be 
 easy and repose themselves, and needed not be disquieted with the 
 apprehensions of trouble approaching. And they <I>made kerchiefs upon 
 the head of every stature,</I> of persons of every age, young and old, 
 distinguishable by their stature,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 These kerchiefs were badges of liberty or triumph, intimating that they 
 should not only be delivered from the Chaldeans, but be victorious over 
 them. Some think these were some superstitious rites which they used 
 with those to whom they delivered their divinations, preparing them for 
 the reception of them by putting enchanted pillows under their arms and 
 handkerchiefs on their heads, to raise their fancies and their 
 expectations of something great. Or perhaps the expressions are 
 figurative: they did all they could to make people secure, which is 
 signified by laying them easy, and to make people proud, which is 
 signified by dressing them fine with handkerchiefs, perhaps laid or 
 embroidered on their heads.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How the wrath of God against them is expressed. Here is a woe to 
 them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 and God declares himself against the methods they took to delude and 
 deceive, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 But what course will God take with them? 

 1. They shall be confounded in their attempts, and shall proceed no
 further; for

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>)

 you shall <I>see no more vanity nor divine revelations;</I> not that 
 they shall themselves lay down their pretensions in a way of 
 repentance, but when the event gives them the lie they shall be silent 
 for shame; or their fancies and imaginations shall not be disposed to 
 receive impressions which assist them in their divinations as they have 
 been; or they themselves shall be cut off. 

 2. God's people shall be delivered out of their hands. When they see
 themselves deluded by them into a false peace and a fool's paradise, 
 and that though they would not leave their sin their sin has left them, 
 and they <I>see no more vanity nor divine divinations,</I> they shall 
 turn their back upon them, shall slight their predictions. The 
 righteous shall be no more saddened by them, no, nor the wicked 
 strengthened: The <I>pillows shall be torn from their arms,</I> and the 
 <I>kerchiefs from their heads;</I> the fallacies shall be discovered, 
 their frauds detected, and the people of God shall no more be in their 
 hand, to be hunted as they had been. Note, It is a great mercy to be 
 delivered from a servile regard to, and fear of, those who, under 
 colour of a divine authority, impose upon and tyrannise over the 
 consciences of men, and say to their souls, <I>Bow down, that we may go 
 over.</I> But it is a sore grief to those who delight in such 
 usurpations to have their power broken and the prey delivered; such was 
 the reformation to the church of Rome. And, when God does this, he 
 makes it to appear that he is the Lord, that it is his prerogative to 
 give law to souls.</P>
