 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The contents of this chapter are much the same with those of the 
 foregoing chapter, looking at the release of the Jews out of their 
 captivity, but looking through that, and beyond that, to the great work 
 of man's redemption by Jesus Christ, and the grace of the gospel, which 
 through him believers partake of. Here are, 

 I. Precious promises made to God's people in their affliction, of his
 presence with them, for their support under it, and their deliverance 
 out of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 II. A challenge to idols to vie with the omniscience and omnipotence of
 God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:8-13">ver. 8-13</A>.

 III. Encouragement given to the people of God to hope for their
 deliverance out of Babylon, from the consideration of what God did for
 their fathers when he brought them out of Egypt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:14-21">ver. 14-21</A>.

 IV. A method taken to prepare the people for their deliverance, by
 putting them in mind of their sins, by which they had provoked God to 
 send them into captivity and continue them there, that they might 
 repent and seek to God for pardoning mercy,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  But now thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> that created thee, O Jacob, and
 he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed
 thee, I have called <I>thee</I> by thy name; thou <I>art</I> mine.
 &nbsp; 2  When thou passest through the waters, I <I>will be</I> with thee;
 and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou
 walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall
 the flame kindle upon thee.
 &nbsp; 3  For I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy
 Saviour: I gave Egypt <I>for</I> thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for
 thee.
 &nbsp; 4  Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been
 honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for
 thee, and people for thy life.
 &nbsp; 5  Fear not: for I <I>am</I> with thee: I will bring thy seed from
 the east, and gather thee from the west;
 &nbsp; 6  I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not
 back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of
 the earth;
 &nbsp; 7  <I>Even</I> every one that is called by my name: for I have
 created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made
 him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter has a plain connexion with the close of the foregoing 
 chapter, but a very surprising one. It was there said that Jacob and 
 Israel would not walk in God's ways, and that when he corrected them 
 for their disobedience they were stubborn and laid it not to heart; and 
 now one would think it should have followed that God would utterly 
 abandon and destroy them; but no, the next words are, <I>But now, fear 
 not, O Jacob! O Israel! I have redeemed thee, and thou art mine.</I> 
 Though many among them were untractable and incorrigible, yet God would 
 continue his love and care for his people, and the body of that nation 
 should still be reserved for mercy. God's goodness takes occasion from 
 man's badness to appear so much the more illustrious. <I>Where sin 
 abounded, grace did much more abound</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:20">Rom. v. 20</A>),

 and mercy <I>rejoices against judgment,</I> as having prevailed and
 carried the day, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:13">Jam. ii. 13</A>.

 Now the sun, breaking out thus of a sudden from behind a thick and dark
 cloud, shines the brighter, and with a pleasing surprise. The 
 expressions of God's favour and good-will to his people here are very 
 high, and speak abundance of comfort to all the spiritual seed of 
 upright Jacob and praying Israel; for <I>to us is this gospel preached 
 as well as unto those</I> that were captives in Babylon,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:2">Heb. iv. 2</A>.
 
 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The grounds of God's care and concern for his people and the 
 interests of his church and kingdom among men. Jacob and Israel, though 
 in a sinful miserable condition, shall be looked after; for, 

 1. They are God's <I>workmanship, created by him unto good works,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:10">Eph. ii. 10</A>.

 He has created them and formed them, not only given them a being, but
 this being, formed them into a people, constituted their government, 
 and incorporated them by the charter of his covenant. The new creature, 
 wherever it is, is of God's forming, and <I>he will not forsake the 
 work of his own hands.</I>

 2. They are the people of his purchase: he has redeemed them. Out of 
 the land of Egypt he first redeemed them, and out of many another 
 bondage, <I>in his love, and in his pity</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:9"><I>ch.</I> lxiii. 9</A>);

 much more will he take care of those who are redeemed with the blood of
 his Son. 

 3. They are his peculiar people, whom he has distinguished from others,
 and set apart for himself: he has called them by name, as those he has 
 a particular intimacy with and concern for, and they are his, are 
 appropriated to him and he has a special interest in them. 

 4. He is their God in covenant

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>I am the Lord thy God,</I> worshipped by thee and engaged by promise 
 to thee, <I>the Holy One of Israel,</I> the God of Israel; for the true 
 God is a holy one, and holiness becomes his house. And upon all these 
 accounts he might justly say, <I>Fear not</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),
 
 and again 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>,
 
 <I>Fear not.</I> Those that have God for them need not fear who or what
 can be against them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The former instances of this care. 

 1. God has purchased them dearly: <I>I gave Egypt for thy ransom;</I>
 for Egypt was quite laid waste by one plague after another, all their 
 first-born were slain and all their men of war drowned; and all this to 
 force a way for Israel's deliverance from them. Egypt shall be 
 sacrificed rather than Israel shall continue in slavery, when the time 
 has come for their release. The Ethiopians had invaded them in Asa's
 time; but they shall be destroyed rather than Israel shall be 
 disturbed. And if this was reckoned so great a thing, to give Egypt for 
 their ransom, what reason have we to admire God's love to us in giving 
 his own Son to be a <I>ransom for us!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+4:10">1 John iv. 10</A>.

 What are Ethiopia and Seba, all their lives and all their treasures,
 compared with the blood of Christ?

 2. He had prized them accordingly, and they were very dear to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Since thou hast been precious in my sight thou hast been 
 honourable.</I> Note, True believers are precious in God's sight; they 
 are his jewels, his peculiar treasure 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:5">Exod. xix. 5</A>);

 he loves them, his delight is in them, above any people. His church is
 his vineyard. And this makes God's people truly honourable, and their 
 name great; for men are really what they are in God's eye. When the 
 forces of Sennacherib, that they might be diverted from falling upon 
 Israel, were directed by Providence to fall upon Egypt, Ethiopia, and 
 Seba, then God gave those countries for Israel, and showed how precious 
 his people were in his sight. So so me understand it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The further instances God would yet give them of his care and 
 kindness. 

 1. He would be present with them in their greatest difficulties and
 dangers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>When thou passest</I> through the waters and the rivers, through 
 the fire and the flame, <I>I will be with thee,</I> and that shall be 
 thy security; when dangers are very imminent and threatening, thou 
 shalt be delivered out of them." Did they, in their journey, pass 
 through deep water? They should not perish in them: "<I>The rivers 
 shall not overflow thee.</I>" Should they by their persecutors be cast 
 into a fiery furnace, for their constant adherence to their God, yet 
 then the flame should not kindle upon them, which was fulfilled in the 
 letter in the wonderful preservation of the three children, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:1-30">Dan. iii.</A>
 
 Though they went through fire and water, which would be to them as the
 <I>valley of the shadow of death,</I> yet, while they had God with 
 them, they need fear no evil, they should be borne up, and <I>brought 
 out into a wealthy place,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:12">Ps. lxvi. 12</A>.

 2. He would still, when there was occasion, make all the interests of 
 the children of men give way to the interests of his own children: 
 "<I>I will give men for thee,</I> great men, mighty men, and men of 
 war, <I>and people</I> (men by wholesale) <I>for thy life.</I> Nations 
 shall be sacrificed to thy welfare." All shall be cut off rather than 
 God's Israel shall, so precious are they in his sight. The affairs of 
 the world shall all be ordered and directed so as to be most for the 
 good of the church, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+16:9">2 Chron. xvi. 9</A>.

 3. Those of them that were scattered and dispersed in other nations
 should all be gathered in and share in the blessings of the public,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:5-7"><I>v.</I> 5-7</A>.

 Some of the seed of Israel were dispersed into all countries, east, 
 west, north, and south, or into all the parts of the country of 
 Babylon; but those whose spirits God stirred up to go to Jerusalem 
 should be fetched in from all parts; divine grace should reach those 
 that lay most remote, and at the greatest distance from each other; 
 and, when the time should come, nothing should prevent their coming 
 together to return in a body, in answer to that prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:47">Ps. cvi. 47</A>),
 
 <I>Gather us from among the heathen,</I> and in performance of that
 promise 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:4">Deut. xxx. 4</A>),

 <I>If any of thine be driven to the utmost parts of heaven, thence will
 the Lord thy God gather thee,</I> which we find pleaded on behalf of 
 the children of the captivity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:9">Neh. i. 9</A>.

 But who are the seed of Israel that shall be thus carefully gathered
 in? He tells us

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>)

 they are such as God has marked for mercy; for, 

 (1.) They are called by his name; they make profession of religion, and 
 are distinguished from the rest of the world by their covenant-relation 
 to God and denomination from him. 

 (2.) They are created for his glory; the spirit of Israelites is 
 created in them, and they are formed according to the will of God, and 
 these shall be gathered in. Note, Those only are fit to be called by 
 the name of God that are created by his grace for his glory; and those 
 whom God has created and called shall be gathered in now to Christ as 
 their head and hereafter to heaven as their home. <I>He shall gather
 in his elect from the four winds.</I> This promise points at the 
 gathering in of the dispersed of the Gentiles, and the strangers 
 scattered, by the gospel of Christ, who died to <I>gather together in 
 one</I> the children of God that were scattered abroad; for the promise 
 was to all that were afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall 
 call and create. God is with the church, and therefore let her not 
 fear; none that belong to her shall be lost.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf
 that have ears.
 &nbsp; 9  Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people
 be assembled: who among them can declare this, and show us former
 things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be
 justified: or let them hear, and say, <I>It is</I> truth.
 &nbsp; 10  Ye <I>are</I> my witnesses, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and my servant whom I
 have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that
 I <I>am</I> he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God here challenges the worshippers of idols to produce such proofs of 
 the divinity of their false gods as even this very instance (to go no 
 further) of the redemption of the Jews out of Babylon furnished the 
 people of Israel with, to prove that their God is the true and living 
 God, and he only.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The patrons of idolatry are here called to appear, and say what they 
 have to say in defence of their idols, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 Their gods have <I>eyes and see not, ears and hear not,</I> and those 
 that make them and trust in them are like unto them; so David had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115+8">Ps. cxv. 8</A>),

 to which the prophet seems here to refer when he calls idolaters
 <I>blind people that have eyes, and deaf people that have ears.</I> 
 They have the shape, capacities, and faculties, of men; but they are, 
 in effect, destitute of reason and common sense, or they would never 
 worship gods of their own making. "<I>Let all the nations therefore be 
 gathered together,</I> let them help one another, and with a combined 
 force plead the cause of their dunghill gods; and, if they have nothing 
 to say in their own justification, let them hear what the God of Israel 
 has to say for their conviction and confutation."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God's witnesses are subpoenaed, or summoned to appear, and give in 
 evidence for him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "<I>You, O Israelites!</I> all you that are <I>called by my name,</I> 
 you <I>are all my witnesses, and so</I> is <I>my servant whom I have 
 chosen.</I>" It was Christ himself that was so described

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:1"><I>ch.</I> xlii. 1</A>),
 
 <I>My servant and my elect.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. All the prophets that testified to Christ, and Christ himself, the 
 great prophet, are here appealed to as God's witnesses. 

 (1.) God's people are witnesses for him, and can attest, upon their own 
 knowledge and experience, concerning the power of his grace, the 
 sweetness of his comforts, the tenderness of his providence, and the 
 truth of his promise. They will be forward to witness for him that he 
 is gracious and that no word of his has fallen to the ground. 

 (2.) His prophets are in a particular manner witnesses for him, with 
 whom his secret is, and who know more of him than others do. But the 
 Messiah especially is given to be a witness for him to the people; 
 having lain in his bosom from eternity, he has declared him. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Let us see what the point is which these witnesses are called to 
 prove 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>You are my witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am God.</I> Note, Those 
 who do themselves acknowledge that the Lord is God should be ready to 
 testify what they know of him to others, that they also may be brought 
 to the acknowledgement of it. <I>I believed, therefore have I 
 spoken.</I> Particularly, "Since you cannot but know, and believe, and 
 understand, you must be ready to bear record, 

 (1.) That I am he, the only true God, that I am a being self-existent 
 and self-sufficient; I am he whom you are to fear, and worship, and 
 trust in. Nay

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),
 
 <I>before the day was</I> (before the first day of time, before the 
 creation of the light, and, consequently, from eternity) <I>I am 
 he.</I>" The idols were but of yesterday, <I>new gods that came newly 
 up</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:17">Deut. xxxii. 17</A>);
 
 but the God of Israel was from everlasting.

 (2.) That <I>there was no God formed before me, nor shall be after 
 me.</I> The idols were gods formed (<I>dii facti--made gods,</I> or 
 rather <I>fictitii--fictitious</I>); <I>by nature they were no 
 gods,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:8">Gal. iv. 8</A>.

 But God has a being from eternity, yea, and a religion in this world
 before there were either idols or idolaters (truth is more ancient than 
 error); and he will have a being to eternity, and will be worshipped 
 and glorified when idols are famished and abolished and idolatry shall 
 be no more. True religion will keep its ground, and survive all 
 opposition and competition. <I>Great is the truth, and will 
 prevail.</I>

 (3.) That <I>I, even I, am the Lord,</I> the great Jehovah, who is, and 
 was, and is to come; and <I>besides me there is no Saviour,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 See what it is that the great God glories in, not so much that he is 
 the only ruler as that he is the only Saviour; for he <I>delights to do 
 good:</I> he is the <I>Saviour of all men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:10">1 Tim. iv. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Let us see what the proofs are which are produced for the 
 confirmation of this point. It appears,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That the Lord is God, by two proofs: 

 [1.] He has an infinite and infallible knowledge, as is evident from
 <I>the predictions of his word</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 "<I>I have declared and I have shown</I> that which has without fail 
 come to pass; nay, I never declared nor showed any thing but it has 
 been accomplished. <I>I showed when there was no strange god among 
 you,</I> that is, when you pretended not to consult any oracles but 
 mine, nor to have any prophets but mine." It is said, when they came 
 out of Egypt, that <I>the Lord alone did lead him, and there was no 
 strange god with him.</I> 

 [2.] He has an infinite and irresistible power, as is evident from the 
 performances of his providence. He pleads not only, I have 
 <I>shown,</I> but, I have <I>saved,</I> not only foretold what none 
 else could foresee, but done what none else could do; for

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 "<I>None can deliver out of my hand</I> those whom I will punish; not 
 only no man can, but none of all the gods of the heathen can protect." 
 It is therefore a <I>fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living 
 God,</I> because there is no getting out of them again. "I will work 
 what I have designed, both in mercy and judgment, and who shall either 
 oppose or retard it?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That the gods of the heathen, who are rivals with him, are not
 only inferior to him, but no gods at all, which is proved 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 by a challenge: <I>Who among them can declare this</I> that I now 
 declare? Who can foretel things to come? Nay, which of them can
 <I>show us former things?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:22"><I>ch.</I> xli. 22</A>.

 They cannot so much as inspire an historian, much less a prophet. They
 are challenged to join issue upon this: <I>Let them bring forth their 
 witnesses,</I> to prove their omniscience and omnipotence. And, 

 [1.] If they do prove them, they shall be justified, the idols in
 demanding homage and the idolaters in paying it. 

 [2.] If they do not prove them, <I>let them say, It is truth;</I> let 
 them own the true God, and receive the truth concerning him, that he is 
 God alone. The cause of God is not afraid to stand a fair trial; but it 
 may reasonably be expected that those who cannot justify themselves in 
 their irreligion should submit to the power of the truth and true 
 religion.</P>

 path in the mighty waters;
 &nbsp; 17  Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the
 power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they
 are extinct, they are quenched as tow.
 &nbsp; 18  Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the
 things of old.
 &nbsp; 19  Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth;
 shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness,
 <I>and</I> rivers in the desert.
 &nbsp; 20  The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the
 owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, <I>and</I> rivers in
 the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.
 &nbsp; 21  This people have I formed for myself; they shall show forth
 my praise.

 To so low an ebb were the faith and hope of God's people in Babylon 
 brought that there needed line upon line to assure them that they 
 should be released out of their captivity; and therefore, that they 
 might have strong consolation, the assurances of it are often repeated, 
 and here very expressly and encouragingly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God here takes to himself such titles of his honour as were very 
 encouraging to them. He is <I>the Lord their Redeemer,</I> not only he 
 will redeem them, but will take it upon him as his office and make it 
 his business to do so. If he be their God, he will be all that to them 
 which they need, and therefore, when they are in bondage, he will be 
 their Redeemer. He is the <I>Holy One of Israel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),
 
 and again
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 <I>their Holy One,</I> and therefore will make good every word he has 
 spoken to them. He is <I>the Creator of Israel,</I> that made them a 
 people out of nothing (for that is creation), nay, worse than nothing; 
 and he is their <I>King,</I> that owns them as his people and presides 
 among them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He assures them he will find out a way to break the power of their 
 oppressors that held them captives and filled up the measure of their 
 own iniquity by their resolution never to let them go, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:17"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 17</A>.

 God will take care to send a victorious prince and army to Babylon,
 that shall <I>bring down all their nobles,</I> and lay their honour in 
 the dust, and all their people too, even <I>the Chaldeans, whose cry is 
 in the ships</I> (for seamen are apt to be noisy), or whose cry is 
 <I>to the ships,</I> as their refuge when the city is taken, that they 
 may escape by the benefit of their great river. Note, The destruction 
 of Babylon must make way for the enlargement of God's people. And in 
 the prediction of the fall of the New-Testament Babylon we meet with 
 the cries and lamentations of the sailors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:17,18">Rev. xviii. 17, 18</A>.

 And observe, It is for Israel's sake that Babylon is ruined, to make
 way for their deliverance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He reminds them of the great things he did for their fathers when 
 he brought them out of the land of Egypt; for so it may be read 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>):

 "<I>Thus saith the Lord, who did make a way in the sea,</I> the Red 
 Sea, and did <I>bring forth</I> Pharaoh's <I>chariot and horse,</I> 
 that they might lie down together in the bottom of the sea, and never 
 rise, but be extinct. He that did this can, if he please, make a way 
 for you in the sea when you return out of Babylon, and will do so 
 rather than leave you there." Note, For the encouragement of our faith 
 and hope, it is good for us often to remember what God has done 
 formerly for his people against his and their enemies. Think 
 particularly what he did at the Red Sea, how he made it, 

 1. A road to his people, a straight way, a near way, nay, a refuge to
 them, into which they fled and were safe the waters being a wall unto 
 them. 

 2. A grave to his enemies. The chariot and horse were drawn out by him 
 who is Lord of all hosts, on purpose that they might fall together; 
 howbeit, <I>they meant not so,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+4:11,12">Mic. iv. 11, 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He promises to do yet greater things for them than he had done in 
 the days of old; so that they should not have reason to ask, in a way 
 of complaint, as Gideon did, <I>Where are all the wonders that our 
 fathers told us of?</I> for they should see them repeated, nay, they 
 should see them outdone 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "<I>Remember not the former things,</I> from them to take occasion, as 
 some do, to undervalue the present things, as if <I>the former days 
 were better than these;</I> no, you may, if you will, comparatively 
 forget them, and yet know enough by the events of your own day to 
 convince you that the Lord is God alone; for, <I>behold, the Lord will 
 do a new thing,</I> no way inferior, both for the wonder and the worth 
 of the mercy, to the things of old." The best exposition of this is, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:14,15,23:7,8">Jer. xvi. 14, 15; xxiii. 7, 8</A>.

 <I>It shall no more be said, The Lord liveth that brought up the
 children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;</I> that is an old thing, 
 the remembrance of which will be in a manner lost in the new thing, in 
 the new proof that the Lord liveth, for he <I>brought up the children 
 of Israel out of the land of the north.</I> Though former mercies must 
 not be forgotten, fresh mercies must in a special manner be improved. 
 <I>Now it springs forth,</I> as it were a surprise upon you; you are 
 like those that dream. <I>Shall you now know it?</I> And will you not 
 own God's hand in it?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He promises not only to deliver them out of Babylon, but to conduct 
 them safely and comfortably to their own land 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>):

 <I>I will make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert;</I> 
 for, it seems, the way from Babylon to Canaan, as well as from Egypt, 
 lay through a desert land, which, while the returning captives passed 
 through, God would provide for them, that their camp should be both 
 well victualled and under a good conduct. The same power that made <I>a 
 way in the sea</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 can make a <I>way in the wilderness,</I> and will force its passage 
 through the greatest difficulties. And he that made dry land in the 
 waters can produce waters in the dryest land, in such abundance as not 
 only to <I>give drink to his people, his chosen,</I> but to the 
 <I>beasts of the field,</I> also <I>the dragons and the ostriches,</I> 
 who are therefore said to honour God for it; it is such a sensible 
 refreshment, and yields them so much satisfaction, that, if they were 
 capable of doing it, they would praise God for it, and shame man, who 
 is made capable of praising his benefactor and does not. Now, 

 1. This looks back to what God did for Israel when he led them through
 the wilderness from Egypt to Canaan, and fetched water out of a rock to 
 follow them; what God did for them formerly he would do again, for he 
 is still the same. And, though we do not find that the miracle was 
 repeated in their return out of Babylon, yet the mercy was, in the 
 common course of Providence, for which it became them to be no less 
 thankful to God. 

 2. It looks forward, not only to all the instances of God's care of the 
 Jewish church in the latter ages of it, between their return from 
 Babylon and the coming of Christ, but to the grace of the gospel, 
 especially as it is manifested to the Gentile world, by which a way is 
 opened in the wilderness and rivers in the desert; the world, which lay 
 like a desert, in ignorance and unfruitfulness, was blessed with divine 
 direction and divine comforts, and, in order to both, with a plentiful 
 effusion of the Spirit. The sinners of the Gentiles, who had been as 
 the beasts of the field, running wild, fierce as the dragons, stupid as 
 the owls or ostriches, shall be brought to honour God for the extent of 
 his grace to his chosen among them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. He traces up all these promised blessings to their great original, 
 the purposes and designs of his own glory 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>This people have I formed for myself,</I> and therefore I do all 
 this for them, that they may <I>show forth my praise.</I> Note, 

 1. The church is of God's forming, and so are all the living members of
 it. The new heaven, the new earth, the new man, are the work of God's
 hand, and are no more, no better, than he makes them; they are 
 fashioned according to his will.

 2. He forms it for himself. He that is the first cause is the highest 
 end both of the first and of the new creation. <I>The Lord has made all 
 things for himself,</I> his Israel especially, to be to him for <I>a 
 people, and for a name, and for a praise;</I> and no otherwise can they 
 be for him, or serviceable to him, than as his grace is glorified in 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:11,Eph+1:6,12,14">Jer. xiii. 11; Eph. i. 6, 12, 14</A>.

 3. It is therefore our duty to show forth his praise, not only with our
 lips, but in our lives, by giving up ourselves to his service. As he
 formed us, so he feeds us, and keeps us, and leads us, and all for 
 himself; for every instance therefore of his goodness we must praise 
 him, else we answer not the end of the beings and blessings we 
 have.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>22  But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast
 been weary of me, O Israel.
 &nbsp; 23  Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt
 offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I
 have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee
 with incense.
 &nbsp; 24  Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast
 thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made
 me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine
 iniquities.
 &nbsp; 25  I, <I>even</I> I, <I>am</I> he that blotteth out thy transgressions

 &nbsp; 26  Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou,
 that thou mayest be justified.
 &nbsp; 27  Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have
 transgressed against me.
 &nbsp; 28  Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and
 have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This charge (and a high charge it is which is here exhibited against 
 Jacob and Israel, God's professing people) comes in here, 

 1. To clear God's justice in bringing them into captivity, and to
 vindicate that. Were they not in covenant with him? Had they not his
 sanctuary among them? <I>Why then did the Lord deal thus with his 
 land?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:24">Deut. xxix. 24</A>.

 Here is a good reason given: they had neglected God and had cast him
 off, and therefore he justly rejected them and <I>gave them to the 
 curse</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>);

 and they must be brought to own this before they are prepared for 
 deliverance; and they did so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:5,Ne+9:33">Dan. ix. 5; Neh. ix. 33</A>.

 2. To advance God's mercy in their deliverance and to make that appear 
 more glorious. Many things are before observed to magnify the power of 
 God in it; but this magnifies his goodness, that he should do such 
 great and kind things for a people that had been so very provoking to 
 him and were now suffering the just punishment of their iniquity. The 
 pardoning of their sin was as great an instance of God's power (for so 
 Moses reckons it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:17">Num. xiv. 17</A>,

 &c.) as the breaking of the yoke of their captivity. Now observe
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What the sins are which they are here charged with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Omissions of the good which God had commanded; and this part of the 
 charge is here much insisted upon. Observe how it comes in with a 
 <I>but;</I> compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>,

 where God tells them what favours he had bestowed upon them and what 
 his just expectations were from them. He had formed them for himself, 
 intending they should show forth his praise. But they had not done so; 
 they had frustrated God's expectations from them, and made very ill 
 returns to him for his favours. For, 

 (1.) They had cast off prayer: <I>Thou hast not called upon me, O 
 Jacob!</I> Jacob was a man famous for prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:4">Hosea xii. 4</A>);

 his seed bore his name, but did not tread in his steps, and therefore
 are justly upbraided with it. God takes it ill when children degenerate 
 from the virtue and devotion of their pious ancestors. To boast of the 
 name of Jacob, and yet live without prayer, is to mock God and deceive 
 ourselves. If Jacob does not call upon God, who will?

 (2.) They had grown weary of their religion: "Thou art Israel, the seed 
 not only of a praying but of a prevailing father, that was a prince 
 with God; and yet, not valuing his experiences any more than his 
 example, <I>thou hast been weary of me.</I>" They had been in relation 
 to God, employed in his service and in communion with him; but they 
 began to snuff at it, and to say, <I>Behold, what a weariness is 
 it!</I> Note, Those who neglect to call upon God do in effect tell him 
 they are weary of him and have a mind to change their Master. 

 (3.) They grudged the expense of their devotion, and were niggardly and 
 penurious in it. They were for a cheap religion; and in those acts of 
 devotion that were costly they desired to be excused. They had <I>not 
 brought,</I> no, not their <I>small cattle,</I> the lambs and kids, 
 which God required for <I>burnt-offerings</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 much less did they bring their greater cattle, pretending they could 
 not spare them, they must have them for the maintenance of their 
 families. So little sense had they of the greatness of God and their 
 obligations to him that they could not find in their hearts to part 
 with a lamb out of their flock for his honour, though he called for it 
 and would graciously have accepted it. <I>Sweet cane,</I> or 
 <I>calamus,</I> was used for the holy oil, incense, and perfume; but 
 they were not willing to be at the charge of that, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 What they had must serve, though it was old and good for nothing; they 
 would not buy fresh. Perhaps it was usual for devout pious persons to 
 bring free-will incense as well as other free-will offerings; but they 
 were not so generous, nor did they fill the altar of God, nor moisten 
 it abundantly, as they should have done, <I>with the fat of their 
 sacrifices;</I> what sacrifices they did bring were of the lean and 
 refuse of their cattle, that had no fat in them to regale the altar 
 with. 

 (4.) What sacrifices they did offer they did not honour God with them, 
 and so they were, in effect, as no sacrifices

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>Neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices.</I> Some of them 
 offered their sacrifices to false gods; others, who offered them to the 
 true God, were either careless in the manner of offering them or 
 hypocritical in their intentions, so that they might be truly said not 
 to honour God with them, but rather to dishonour him. 

 (5.) That which aggravated their neglect of sacrificing was that, as 
 God had appointed it, it was no burdensome thing; it was not a service 
 that they had any reason at all to complain of: "<I>I have not caused 
 thee to serve with an offering;</I> I have not made it a task and 
 drudgery to you, whatever you, through the corruption of your natures, 
 have made it yourselves. I have <I>not wearied thee with incense.</I>" 
 None of God's commandments are grievous, no, not those concerning 
 sacrifice and incense. They were not more costly than might be afforded 
 by those that lived in such a plentiful country, nor did their 
 attendance on them require any more time than they could well spare. 
 But that which especially forbade them to call it <I>a wearisome 
 service</I> was that they were required to be cheerful and pleasant, 
 and to rejoice before God in all their approaches to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:12">Deut. xii. 12</A>.
 
 They had many feasts and good days, but only one day in all the year in
 which they were to afflict their souls. The ordinances of the 
 ceremonial law, though, in comparison with Christ's easy yoke, they are 
 spoken of as heavy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:10">Acts xv. 10</A>),

 yet, in comparison with the service that idolaters did to their false
 gods, they were light, and not to be called <I>services</I> nor found 
 fault with as wearisome. God did not require them to sacrifice their 
 children, as Moloch did.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Commissions of the evil which God had forbidden; and omissions 
 commonly make way for commissions: <I>Thou hast made me to serve with 
 thy sins.</I> When we make God's gifts the food and fuel for our lusts, 
 and his providence the patron of our wicked projects, especially when 
 we encourage ourselves to continue in sin because grace has abounded, 
 then we make God to serve with our sins. Or it may denote what a grief 
 and burden sin is to God; it not only wearies men and makes the 
 creation groan, but it <I>wearies my God also</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:13"><I>ch.</I> vii. 13</A>)

 and makes the Creator complain that he is <I>grieved</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:10">Ps. xcv. 10</A>),
 
 that he is <I>broken</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+6:9">Ezek. vi. 9</A>),

 that he is pressed with sinners <I>as a cart is pressed that is full of
 sheaves</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:13">Amos ii. 13</A>),

 and to cry out, <I>Ah! I will ease me of my adversaries,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:24"><I>ch.</I> i. 24</A>.

 The antithesis is observable: God had not made them to serve with their
 sacrifices, but they had made him to serve with their sins. The master 
 had not tired the servants with his commands, but they had tired him 
 with their disobedience. Those are wicked servants indeed that behave 
 so ill to so good a Master. God is tender of our comfort, but we are 
 careless of his honour. Let <I>this</I> engage us to keep close to our 
 duty, that it is easy and reasonable, and no disparagement to us, nor 
 too hard for us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What were the aggravations of their sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 1. That they were children of disobedience; for their <I>first 
 father</I> (that is, their forefathers) <I>had sinned;</I> and they had 
 not only sinned in their loins, but sinned like them. Ezra confesses
 this: <I>Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great
 trespass,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+9:7"><I>ch.</I> ix. 7</A>.

 But their forefathers are called their <I>first father</I> to put us in
 mind of the apostasy and rebellion of our first father Adam, to which 
 corrupt fountain we must trace up the streams of all our 
 transgressions. 

 2. That they were scholars of disobedience too: for <I>their teachers
 had transgressed against God,</I> were guilty of gross scandalous sins, 
 and the people, no doubt, would learn to do as they did. It is ill with 
 a people when their leaders cause them to err, and their teachers, who 
 should reform them, corrupt them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What were the tokens of God's displeasure against them for their 
 sins, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 He brought ruin both upon church and state. 

 1. The honour of their church was laid in the dust and trampled on:
 <I>I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary,</I> that is, the 
 priests and Levites who presided with great dignity and power in the 
 temple-service; they profaned themselves, and made themselves vile, by 
 their enormities, and then God profaned them and made them vile, by 
 their calamities and the contempt they fell into, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:9">Mal. ii. 9</A>.

 2. The honour of their state was ruined likewise: "<I>I have given 
 Jacob to the curse,</I> that is, to be cursed, and hated, and abused by 
 all their neighbours, <I>and Israel to reproach,</I> to be insulted, 
 ridiculed, and triumphed over by their enemies." They reproached them 
 perhaps for that in them that was good; they <I>mocked at their 
 sabbaths</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+1:7">Lam. i. 7</A>);

 but God gave them up to reproach, to correct them for what was amiss.
 Note, The dishonour which men at any time do us should humble us for 
 the dishonour we have done to God; and we must bear it patiently 
 because we suffer it justly, and must acknowledge that to us belongs 
 confusion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. What were the riches of God's mercy towards them notwithstanding 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>I even I, am he who</I> notwithstanding all this <I>blotteth out thy 
 transgressions.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. This gracious declaration of God's readiness to pardon sin comes in 
 very strangely. The charge ran very high: <I>Thou hast wearied me with 
 thy iniquities,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Now one would think it would follow: "<I>I, even I, am he</I> that will 
 destroy thee, and burden myself no longer with care about thee." No, 
 <I>I, even I, am he that will forgive thee;</I> as if the great God 
 would teach us that forgiving injuries is the best way to make 
 ourselves easy and to keep ourselves from being wearied with them. This 
 comes in here to encourage them to repent, because there is forgiveness 
 with God, and to show the freeness of divine mercy; where sin has been 
 exceedingly sinful grace appears exceedingly gracious. Apply this, 

 (1.) To the forgiving of the sins of Israel as a people, in their 
 national capacity. When God stopped the course of threatening 
 judgments, and saved them from utter ruin, even then when he had them 
 under severe rebukes, then he might be said to <I>blot out their 
 transgressions.</I> Though he corrected them, he was reconciled to them 
 again, and did not cut them off from being a people. This he did many
 a time, till they rejected Christ and his gospel, which was a sin 
 against the remedy, and then he would forgive them no more as a nation, 
 but utterly destroyed them. 

 (2.) To the forgiving of the sins of every particular believing 
 penitent--<I>transgressions and sins,</I> infirmities though ever so 
 numerous, backslidings though ever so heinous. Observe here, 

 [1.] How the pardon is expressed; he will <I>blot them out,</I> as a
 cloud is blotted out by the beams of the sun

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:22"><I>ch.</I> xliv. 22</A>),

 as a debt is blotted out not to appear against the debtor (the book is
 crossed as if the debt were paid, because it is pardoned upon the 
 payment which the surety has made), or as a sentence is blotted out 
 when it is reversed, as the curse was blotted out with the waters of 
 jealousy, which made it of no effect to the innocent, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+5:23">Num. v. 23</A>.

 He <I>will not remember</I> the sin, which intimates not only that he
 will remit the punishment of what is past, but that it shall be no 
 diminution to his love for the future. When God forgives he forgets.

 [2.] What is the ground and reason of the pardon. It is not for the 
 sake of any thing in us, but for his own sake, for his mercies'-sake, 
 his promise-sake, and especially for his Son's sake, and that he may 
 himself be glorified in it. 

 [3.] How God glories in it: <I>I, even I, am he.</I> He glories in it 
 as his prerogative. None can forgive sin but God only, and he will do 
 it; it is his settled resolution. He will do it willingly and with 
 delight; it is his pleasure; it is his honour; so he is pleased to 
 reckon it.</P>

 2. Those words 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 <I>Put me in remembrance,</I> may be understood either

 (1.) As a rebuke to a proud Pharisee, that stands upon his own
 justification before God, and expects to find favour for his merits and 
 not to be beholden to free grace: "If you have any thing to say in your 
 own justification, any thing to offer for the sake of which you should 
 be pardoned, and not for my sake, put me in remembrance of it. I will 
 give you leave to plead your own cause with me; declare what your 
 merits are, that you may be justified by them:" but those who are thus 
 challenged will be speechless. Or, 

 (2.) As a publican. Is God thus ready to pardon sin, and, when he 
 pardons it, will he remember it no more? Let us then put him in 
 remembrance, mention before him those sins which he has forgiven; for 
 they must be ever before us, to humble us, though they are pardoned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:3">Ps. li. 3</A>.

 Put him in remembrance of the promises he has made to penitents, and
 the satisfaction his Son has made for them. Plead these with him in 
 wrestling for pardon, and declare these things, in order that thou 
 mayest be justified freely by his grace. This is the only way, and it 
 is a sure way, to peace. <I>Only acknowledge thy transgression.</I></P>
