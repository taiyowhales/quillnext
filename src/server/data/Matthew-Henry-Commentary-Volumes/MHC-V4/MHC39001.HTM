 Thus prophet is sent first to convince and then to comfort, first to 
 discover sin and to reprove for that and then to promise the coming of 
 him who shall take away sin. And this method the blessed Spirit takes 
 in dealing with souls, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:8">John xvi. 8</A>.

 He first opens the wound and then applies the healing balm. God had 
 provided (and one would think effectually) for the engaging of Israel 
 to himself by providences and ordinances; but it seems, by the 
 complaints here made of them, that they received the grace of God in 
 both these in vain. 

 I. They were very ungrateful to God for his favours to them, and 
 rendered not again according to the benefit they received, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. They were very careless and remiss in the observance of his
 institutions; the priests especially were so, who were in a particular 
 manner charged with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:6-14">ver. 6-14</A>.

 And what shall we say of those whom neither providences nor ordinances 
 work upon, and who affront God in those very things wherein they should 
 honour him?</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 The burden of the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> to Israel by Malachi.
 &nbsp; 2 I have loved you, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>. Yet ye say, Wherein hast
 thou loved us? <I>Was</I> not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 yet I loved Jacob,
 &nbsp; 3 And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage
 waste for the dragons of the wilderness.
 &nbsp; 4 Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return
 and build the desolate places; thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, They
 shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The
 border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath
 indignation for ever.

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophecy of this book is entitled, <I>The burden of the word of the
 Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),
 
 which intimates, 

 1. That it was of great weight and importance; what the false prophets 
 said was light as the chaff, what the true prophets said was ponderous 
 as the wheat, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:38">Jer. xxiii. 28</A>.

 2. That it ought to be often repeated to them and by them, as the
 burden of a song. 

 3. That there were those to whom it was a burden and a reproach; they
 were weary of it, and found themselves so aggrieved by it that they
 were not able to bear it. 

 4. That to them it would prove a burden indeed, to sink them to the
 lowest hell, unless they repented.

 5. That to those who loved it and embraced it, and bade it welcome,
 though it was a light burden, as our Saviour calls it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:30">Matt. xi. 30</A>),
 
 yet it was a burden.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This <I>burden of the word of the Lord</I> was sent, 

 1. To Israel, for to them pertained the lively oracles of prophecy as 
 well as those of the written word. Many prophets God had sent to 
 Israel, and now he will try them with one more.

 2. <I>By Malachi, by the hand of Malachi,</I> as if it were not a
 message by word of mouth, but a letter put into his hand, for the 
 greater certainty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses, they are charged with ingratitude, in that they were
 not duly sensible of God's distinguishing goodness to them; and such a 
 charge as this may well be called a burden, for it is a heavy one.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God asserts the great kindness he had, and had often expressed, for 
 them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>I have loved you, saith the Lord.</I> Thus abruptly does the sermon 
 begin, as if God intended, whatever reproofs should be given them, to 
 reconcile them to his love, and to take care that they should still 
 have good thoughts of him. <I>As many as I love I rebuke and 
 chasten.</I> Thus kindly does the sermon begin. God will have his 
 people satisfied that he loves them and is ever mindful of his love.
 This is the same with what he said of old to the virgin of Israel, that 
 he might engage her affections to himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:3,4">Jer. xxxi. 3, 4</A>):

 <I>Yea I have loved thee with an everlasting love.</I> In this one word
 God sums up all his gracious dealings with them; love was the spring of
 all; he loved them because he would <I>love them</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:7,8">Deut. vii. 7, 8</A>),
 
 loved them in their childhood,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:1">Hos. xi. 1</A>.

 His delight was in them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:4">Isa. lxii. 4</A>.

 "<I>I have loved you,</I> but you have not loved me, nor made any
 suitable returns for my love." Note, God's people need to be often 
 reminded of his love to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They question his love, and diminish the instances of it, and seem 
 to quarrel with him for telling them of it: <I>Yet you say, Wherein 
 hast thou loved us?</I> As God traces up all his favours to them to the 
 fountain, which was his love, so he traces up all their sins against 
 him to the fountain, which was their contempt of his love. Instead of 
 acknowledging his kindness, and studying what they shall render, they 
 scorn to own that they have been beholden to him, challenge him to 
 produce proofs of his love that are material, and think and speak very 
 slightly of the instances they have had of his kindness, as if they 
 were so few, so small, as not to be worth taking notice of, and no more 
 than what they had sufficiently made returns for, or at least than he 
 had sufficiently balanced with instances of his wrath. "Have we not 
 been wasted, impoverished, and carried captive; and wherein then 
 <I>hast thou loved us?</I>" Note, God justly takes it very ill to have 
 his favours slighted, as not worth speaking of; and it is very absurd 
 for us to ask wherein he has loved us, when, which way soever we look, 
 we meet with the proofs and instances of his love to us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He makes it out, beyond contradiction, that he has loved them, 
 loved them in a distinguishing way, which was in a special manner 
 obliging. For proof of this he shows the difference he had made, and 
 would still make, between Jacob and Esau, between Israelites and 
 Edomites. Some read their question, <I>Wherefore hast thou loved 
 us?</I> as if they did indeed own that he had loved them, but withal 
 insinuate that there was a reason for it--that he loved them because
 their father Abraham had loved him, so that it was not a free love, but 
 a love of debt, to which he replies, "<I>Was not Esau</I> as near akin 
 to Abraham as you are? Was he not <I>Jacob's own brother,</I> his elder 
 brother? And therefore, if there were any right to a recompence for 
 Abraham's love, Esau had it, and yet <I>I hated Esau</I> and <I>loved 
 Jacob.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Let them see what a difference God had made between Jacob and Esau. 
 Esau was Jacob's brother, his twin-brother: "<I>Yet I loved Jacob</I> 
 and <I>I hated Esau,</I> that is, took Jacob into covenant, and 
 entailed the blessing on him and his, but refused and rejected Esau." 
 Note, Those that are taken into covenant with God, that have the lively 
 oracles and the means of grace committed to them, have reason to look 
 upon these as tokens of his love. Jacob is loved, for he has these, 
 Esau hated, for he has not. The apostle quotes this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:13">Rom. ix. 13</A>),

 and compares it with what the oracle said to Rebecca concerning her
 twins

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:23">Gen. xxv. 23</A>),

 <I>The elder shall serve the younger,</I> to illustrate the doctrine of
 God's sovereignty in dispensing his favours; for <I>may he not do what 
 he will with his own?</I> Esau was justly hated, but Jacob freely 
 loved; even so, Father, <I>because it seemed good in thy eyes,</I> and 
 it is not for us to ask why or wherefore.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Let them see what he was now doing and would do with them, pursuant 
 to this original difference.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The Edomites shall be made the monuments of God's justice, and he 
 will be glorified in their utter destruction: For <I>Esau have I 
 hated;</I> I <I>laid his mountains waste,</I> the mountains of Seir, 
 which were <I>his heritage.</I> When all that part of the world was 
 ravaged by the Chaldean army the country of Edom was, among the rest, 
 laid in ruins, and became a habitation <I>for the dragons of the 
 wilderness,</I> so perfectly desolate was it; as was foretold, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:6,11">Isa. xxxiv. 6, 11</A>.

 The Edomites had triumphed in Jerusalem's overthrow

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:7">Ps. cxxxvii. 7</A>),

 and therefore it was just with God to put the same cup of trembling
 into their hands. And, though Edom's ruins were last, yet they were 
 lasting, and the desolation perpetual; and in this the difference was 
 made between Jacob and Esau, and is made between the righteous and the 
 wicked, to whom otherwise all things come alike, and there seems to be 
 one event. Jacob's cities are laid waste, but they are rebuilt; Edom's 
 are laid waste, and never rebuilt. The sufferings of the righteous will 
 have an end and will end well; all their grievances will be redressed, 
 and their sorrow turned into joy; but the sufferings of the wicked will 
 be endless and remediless, as Edom's desolations,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 Observe here,

 [1.] The vain hopes of the Edomites, that they shall have their ruins
 repaired as well as Israel, though they had no promise to build their 
 hope upon. They say, "It is true, <I>we are impoverished;</I> it is the 
 common chance, and there is no remedy; but <I>we will return and build 
 the desolate places;</I> we are resolved we will" (not so much as 
 asking God leave); "<I>we will</I> whether he will or no; nay, we will 
 do it in defiance of God's curse, and that sentence pronounced upon 
 Edom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:10">Isa. xxxiv. 10</A>),

 <I>From generation to generation it shall lie waste.</I>" They build
 presumptuously, as Hiel built Jericho in direct contradiction to the 
 word of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+16:34">1 Kings xvi. 34</A>),

 and it shall speed accordingly. Note, It is common for those whose
 hearts are unhumbled under humbling providences to think to make their 
 part good against God himself, and to build, and plant, and flourish 
 again as much as ever, though God has said that they shall be 
 impoverished. But see,

 [2.] The dashing of these hopes and the disappointment of them: They 
 say, <I>We will build;</I> but what says <I>the Lord of hosts?</I> For 
 we are sure his word shall stand, and not theirs; and he says, 
 <I>First,</I> Their attempts shall be baffled: <I>They shall build, but 
 I will throw down.</I> Note, Those that walk contrary to God will find 
 that he will walk contrary to them; for <I>who ever hardened his heart 
 against God and prospered?</I> When the Jews had rejected Christ and 
 his gospel they became Edomites, and this word was fulfilled in them; 
 for when, in the time of the emperor Adrian, they attempted to rebuild 
 Jerusalem, God by earthquakes and eruptions of fire threw down what 
 they built, so that they were forced to quit the enterprise. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> They shall be looked upon by all as abandoned to utter 
 ruin. All that see them shall call them <I>the border of
 wickedness,</I> a sinful nation, incurably so, and therefore <I>the 
 people against whom the Lord has indignation for ever.</I> Since their 
 wickedness is such as will never be reformed, their desolations shall 
 be such as are never to be repaired. Against Israel God was a <I>little 
 displeased</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:15">Zech. i. 15</A>),

 but against Edom he has indignation, and will have for ever, for they
 are <I>the people of his curse,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:5">Isa. xxxiv. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The Israelites shall be made the monuments of his mercy, and he
 will be glorified in their salvation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 "The Edomites shall be stigmatized as a people hated of God, <I>but
 your eyes shall see</I> your doubts concerning his love to you for ever 
 silenced; for you shall say, and have cause to say, <I>The Lord</I> is 
 and <I>will be magnified from the border of Israel,</I> from every part 
 and border of the land of Israel." The border of Edom is a <I>border of 
 wickedness,</I> and therefore the Lord will have <I>indignation against 
 it for ever;</I> but the <I>border of Israel</I> is a <I>border of 
 holiness,</I> the <I>border of the sanctuary</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:54">Ps. lxxviii. 54</A>),

 and therefore God will make it to appear (though it may for a time lie
 desolate) that he has mercy in store for it, and thence <I>he will be 
 magnified;</I> he will give his people Israel both cause, and hearts, 
 to praise him. When the border of Edom still remains desolate, and the 
 border of Israel is repaired and replenished, then it will appear that 
 God has loved Jacob. Note,

 [1.] Those who doubt of God's love to his people shall, sooner or 
 later, have convincing and undeniable proofs given them of it: 
 "<I>your</I> own <I>eyes shall see</I> what you will not believe."

 [2.] Deliverances out of trouble are to be reckoned proofs of God's 
 good-will to his people, though they may be suffered to fall into 
 trouble,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:19">Ps. xxxiv. 19</A>.

 [3.] Distinguishing favours are very obliging. If God rear up again the
 border of Israel, but leave the border of Edom in ruins, let no 
 Israelite ask, for shame, <I>Wherein hast thou loved us?</I>

 [4.] The dignifying of Israel is the magnifying of the God of Israel,
 and, one way or other, God will have honour from his professing people.

 [5.] God's goodness being his glory, when he does us good we must
 proclaim him great, for that is magnifying him. It is an instance of
 his goodness that he has <I>pleasure in the prosperity of his
 servants,</I> and for this those that love his salvation say, <I>The
 Lord be magnified,</I>

 <I>is</I> dreadful among the heathen.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet is here, by a special commission, calling the priests to 
 account, though they were themselves appointed judges, to call the 
 people to an account. Let the rulers in the house of God know that 
 there is one above them, who will reckon with them for their 
 mal-administrations. Thus <I>saith the Lord of hosts to you, O 
 priests!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 God will have a saying to unfaithful ministers; and it concerns those 
 who speak from God to his people to hear and heed what he says to them, 
 that they may <I>save themselves</I> in the first place, otherwise how 
 should they help to <I>save those that hear them?</I> It is a severe, 
 and no doubt a just reproof, that is here given to the <I>priests,</I> 
 for the profanation of the holy things of God, with which they were 
 entrusted; and, if this was the crime of the priests, we have reason to 
 fear the people also were guilty of it: so that what is said to <I>the 
 priests</I> is <I>said to all,</I> nay, it is <I>said to us,</I> who, 
 as Christians, profess ourselves, not only the people of God, but 
 priests to him. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What it was that God expected from them, and with what good reason 
 he expected it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>A son honours his father,</I> because he is his father; nature has 
 written this law in the hearts of children, before God wrote it at 
 Mount Sinai; nay, <I>a servant,</I> though his obligation to his master 
 is not natural, but by voluntary compact, yet thinks it his duty to 
 honour him, to be observant of his orders, and true to his interests. 
 Children and servants pay respect to their parents and masters; every 
 one cries out shame on them if they do not, and their own hearts cannot 
 but reproach them too; the order of families is thus kept up, and it is 
 their beauty and advantage. But the priests, who are God's children and 
 his servants, do not fear and honour him. They were <I>fathers</I> and 
 <I>masters</I> to the people, and expected to be called so 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:19,Mt+22:7,10">Judges xviii. 19, Matt. xxii. 7, 10</A>)

 and to be reverenced and obeyed as such; but they forgot their Father
 and Master in heaven, and the duty they owed to him. We may each of us 
 charge upon ourselves what is here charged upon the priests. Note, 

 1. We are every one of us to look upon God as our Father and Master,
 and upon ourselves as his children and servants. 

 2. Our relation to God as our Father and Master strongly obliges us to
 fear and honour him. If we honour and fear the fathers of our flesh, 
 much more the Father and Master of our spirits, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:9">Heb. xii. 9</A>.

 3. It is a thing to be justly complained of, and lamented, that God is
 so little feared and honoured even by those that own him for their 
 Father and Master. <I>Where is his honour? Where is his fear?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What the contempt was which the priests put upon God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. This is that, in general, which is charged upon them:--

 (1.) They despised God's name; their familiarity with it, as priests, 
 bred contempt of it, and served them only to gain a veneration by it 
 for themselves and their own name, while God's name was of small 
 account with them. God's name is all that whereby he has made himself 
 known--his word and ordinances; these they had low thoughts of, and 
 vilified that which it was their business to magnify; and no wonder 
 that when they despised it themselves they did that which made it 
 despicable to others, causing even the <I>sacrifices of the Lord to be 
 abhorred,</I> as Eli's sons did. 
 
 (2.) They <I>profaned</I> God's name,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 They <I>polluted</I> it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 They not only made no account of sacred things, but they made an ill 
 use of them, and perverted them to the service of the worst and vilest 
 purposes--their own pride, covetousness, and luxury. There cannot be a 
 greater provocation to God than the profanation of his name; for it is 
 holy and reverend. His purity cannot be polluted by us, for he is 
 unspotted, but his name may be profaned; and nothing profanes it more 
 than the misconduct of priests, whose business it is to do honour to 
 it. This is the general charge exhibited against them. To this they 
 plead <I>Not guilty,</I> and challenge God to prove it upon them, and 
 to make good the charge, which added daring impudence to their daring 
 impiety: <I>You say, Wherein have we despised thy name?</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 and <I>wherein have we polluted thee?</I>

 It is common with proud sinners, when they are reproved, to stand thus 
 upon their own justification. These priests had most horridly profaned 
 sacred things, and yet, like the <I>adulterous woman,</I> they said 
 that they had <I>done no wickedness;</I> they were so inobservant of 
 themselves that they remembered not or reflected not upon their own 
 acts, or they were so ignorant of the divine law that they thought 
 there was no harm in them, and that what they did could not be 
 construed into despising God's name, or they were so atheistical as to 
 imagine that though they knew their own guilt yet God did not, or they 
 were so scornful in their conduct towards God and his prophets that 
 they took a pride in bantering a serious and just reproof, and turning 
 it off with a jest. They either laugh at the reproof, as those that
 despise it, and harden their hearts against it, or they laugh it off, 
 as those that resolve they will not be touched by it, or will not seem 
 to be so. Which way soever we take it, their defence was their offence, 
 and, in justifying themselves, their own tongues condemned them, and 
 their saying, <I>Wherein have we despised thy name?</I> proved them 
 proud and perverse. Had they asked this question with a humble desire 
 to be told more particularly where in they had offended, it would have 
 been an evidence of their repentance, and would have given hopes of 
 their reformation; but to ask it thus in disdain and defiance of the 
 word of God argues their hearts <I>fully set in them to do evil.</I> 
 Note, Sinners ruin themselves by studying to baffle their own 
 convictions; but they will find it <I>hard to kick against the 
 pricks.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Justly might they have been convicted and condemned upon the general 
 charge, and their plea thrown out as frivolous; but God will not only 
 overcome, but will be clear, will be justified when he judges, and 
 therefore he shows them very particularly wherein they had despised his 
 name, and what the contempt was that they cast upon him. As formerly, 
 when he charged them with idolatry, so now, when he charges them with 
 profaneness, he bids them <I>see their way in the valley</I> and 
 <I>know what they have</I> done, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:23">Jer. ii. 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They despised God's name in what they said, in the low opinion 
 they had of his institutions: "<I>You say</I> in your hearts, and 
 perhaps speak it out when you priests get together over your cups. out 
 of the hearing of the people, <I>The table of the Lord is 
 contemptible</I>" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),
 
 and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 "You say, <I>The table of the Lord is polluted;</I> it is to be no more 
 regarded than any other table." Either the table in the temple, on 
 which the show-bread was placed, is that which they reflect upon (not 
 understanding the mystery of it, they despised it as an insignificant 
 thing), or rather the altar of burnt-offerings is here called the 
 table, for there God, and his priests, and his people, did, as it were, 
 feast together upon the sacrifices, in token of friendship. This they 
 thought was contemptible. Formerly, in the days of superstition, it
 was thought contemptible in comparison with the idolatrous alters that 
 the heathen had, and was set aside to make room for a new-fashioned one 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:14,15">2 Kings xvi. 14, 15</A>);

 now it is thought contemptible in comparison with their own tables, and
 those of their great men: <I>The fruit thereof, even his meat, is 
 contemptible.</I> Those who served at the altar were to live upon the 
 altar; but they complained that they lived poorly and meanly, and that 
 it was not worth while to attend the service of the altar for the fruit 
 and meat of it, for it was very ordinary and always the same again; 
 they had no dainties, no varieties, no nice dishes. Nay, that part of
 the sacrifices which was given to God, the blood and the fat, they 
 looked upon with contempt, as not worthy the multitude of laws God had 
 made about it; they asked, "What need is there of so much ado about 
 burning the fat and pouring out the blood?" Note, Those greatly profane 
 and pollute God's name who despise the business of religion, though it 
 is very honourable, as not worth taking pains in, and the advantages of 
 religion, though highly valuable, as not worth taking pains for. Those 
 who live in a careless neglect of holy ordinances, who come to them and 
 attend on them irreverently, and go away from them never the better and 
 under no concern, do in effect say, "<I>The table of the Lord is 
 contemptible;</I> there is neither virtue nor value in it, neither 
 credit nor comfort from it."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They despised God's name in what they did, which was of a piece 
 with what they said, and flowed from it; corrupt principles and notions 
 are roots of bitterness, which bear the gall and wormwood of corrupt 
 practices. They looked upon the table and altar of the Lord as 
 contemptible, and then, 

 [1.] They thought any thing would serve for a sacrifice, though ever so 
 coarse and mean, and were so far from bringing the best, as they ought 
 to have done, that they picked out the worst they had, which was fit 
 neither for the market nor for their own tables, and offered that at 
 God's altar. With every sacrifice they were to bring a meat-offering of 
 <I>fine flour mingled with oil;</I> but they brought <I>polluted 
 bread</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 coarse bread, servants' bread, perhaps it was dry and mouldy, or made 
 of the refuse of the wheat, which they thought good enough to be burnt 
 upon the altar; for had it been better they would have said, <I>To what 
 purpose is this waste?</I> And as to the beasts they offered, though 
 the law was express that what was offered in sacrifice should not have 
 a blemish, yet they brought <I>the blind, and the lame, and the 
 sick</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),
 
 and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 <I>the torn, and the lame, and the sick,</I> that was ready to die of 
 itself. They looked no further than the burning of the sacrifice, and 
 they pleaded that it was a pity to burn it if it was good for any thing 
 else. The people were so far convinced of their duty that they would 
 bring sacrifices; they durst not wholly omit the duty, but they brought 
 vain oblations, mocked God, and deceived themselves, by bringing the 
 worst they had; and the priests, who should have taught them better, 
 accepted the gifts brought to the altar and offered them up there, 
 because, if they should refuse them, the people would bring none at 
 all, and then they would lose their perquisites; and therefore, having 
 more regard to their own profit than to God's honour, they accepted 
 that which they knew he would not accept. Some make 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>

 to be a continuation of what the priests profanely said 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>,

 <I>You say</I> to the people, <I>If you offer the blind for sacrifice, 
 it is not evil; or the lame and the sick, it is not evil.</I> Note, It 
 is a very evil thing, whether men think so or no, to offer the blind 
 and the lame, the torn and the sick, in sacrifice to God. If we worship 
 God ignorantly, and without understanding, we bring the blind for 
 sacrifice; if we do it carelessly, and without consideration, if we are 
 cold, and dull, and dead, in it, we bring the sick; if we rest in the 
 bodily exercise, and do not make heart-work of it, we bring the 
 <I>lame;</I> and, if we suffer vain thoughts and distractions to lodge 
 within us, we bring the torn. And <I>is not this evil?</I> Is it not a 
 great affront to God and a great wrong and injury to our own souls? Do 
 not our books tell us, nay, do not our own hearts tell us, that <I>this 
 is evil?</I> for God, who is the best, ought to be served with the best 
 we have. 

 [2.] They would do no more of their work than what they were paid for. 
 The priests would offer the sacrifices that were brought to the altar, 
 because they had their share of them; but as for any other service of 
 the temple, that had not a particular fee belonging to it, they would 
 not stir a step, nor lend a hand, to it; and this was the general 
 temper of them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 There is not a man among the priests that would <I>shut the doors,</I> 
 or <I>kindle a fire, for nought.</I> If he were required to do the 
 smallest piece of service, he would ask, how shall I be paid for it? 
 They would do nothing <I>gratis,</I> but were all for what they could 
 get, <I>every one for his gain, from his quarter,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:11">Isa. lvi. 11</A>.

 Note, Though God has given order that his servants be well paid in this
 world, yet those are no acceptable servants to him who are mercenary, 
 and would never do the work but for the wages.

 [3.] Their work was a perfect drudgery to them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>You said also, Behold, what a weariness is it!</I> Both priests and 
 people were of this mind, that they thought God imposed too hard a task 
 upon them; the people grudged the charge of providing the sacrifice and 
 the priests grudged the pains of offering it; they thought the feasts 
 of the Lord came too thick, and they were forced to attend too often, 
 and too long, in the courts of the Lord; the priests thought it a 
 severe penance imposed upon them to purify themselves as was required 
 when they attended the altar and ate of the holy things; they thought 
 the duty of their office toilsome and troublesome, and <I>snuffed at 
 it</I> as unreasonable, and bearing hard upon them; they did it, but it 
 was grudgingly and with reluctance. God speaks of it, in justification 
 of his law, that he had not <I>made them to serve with an offering, nor 
 wearied them with incense,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:23">Isa. xliii. 23</A>.

 <I>Wherein have I wearied thee?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:3">Mic. vi. 3</A>.

 But their own wicked hearts made it a weariness; and they were, as
 Doeg, <I>detained before the Lord;</I> they would rather have been any 
 where else. Note, Those are highly injurious, both to God and 
 themselves, who are weary of his service and worship, and snuff at 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Observe how God expostulates and reasons the case with them, for 
 their conviction and humiliation. 

 1. Would they, durst they, affront an earthly prince thus? "You offer
 to God <I>the lame and the sick; offer it now unto thy governor</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 either as tribute or as a present, when thou art entreating his favour, 
 or in gratitude for some favour received; <I>will he be pleased with 
 thee?</I> Or, rather, will he not take himself to be affronted by it?" 
 Note, Those who are careless and irreverent in the duties of religious 
 worship should consider what a shame it is to offer that to their God 
 which they would scorn to offer to their governor, to be more observant 
 of the laws of breeding and good manners than of the laws of religion, 
 and more afraid of being rude than of being profane. 

 2. Could they imagine that such sacrifices as these would be pleasing
 to God, or answer the end of sacrifices? "<I>Should I accept this at
 your hand, saith the Lord?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Have you any reason to think I should either not discern or not resent 
 the affront, that I should connive at the violation of my own laws? No 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);

 <I>I have no pleasure in you,</I> and therefore, <I>I will not accept 
 an offering,</I> such an offering, <I>at your hand.</I>" If God has no 
 pleasure in the person, if the person be not in a justified state, if 
 he be not sanctified, God will not accept the offering. God had respect 
 to Abel first and then to his sacrifice. Note, In order to our 
 acceptance with God it is not enough to do that which, for the matter 
 of it, is good, but we must do it from a right principle, in a right 
 manner, and for a right end. It was the ancient rule laid down 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:7">Gen. iv. 7</A>),

 <I>If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted?</I> Now, if we be
 not accepted of God, in vain do we worship him; it is all lost labour; 
 nay, we are all undone, for ever undone, if we come short of God's 
 acceptance. Those therefore make a bad bargain for themselves who, to 
 save charges in their religion, miss all the ends of it, and, by 
 thinking to go the nearest way to work, bring nothing to pass. Those 
 who make it the top of their ambition, as we all ought to do, 
 <I>whether present or absent, to be accepted of the Lord,</I> will not 
 dare to bring the <I>torn, and the lame, and the sick, for 
 sacrifice.</I> 

 3. How could they expect to prevail with God in their intercessions for
 the people when they thus affronted God in their sacrifices? So some 
 understand

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>,

 as spoken ironically, "<I>And now</I> if you will do the duty of
 priests, and stand in the gap to turn away the judgments of God that 
 you see ready to pour in upon us, <I>I pray you, beseech God that he 
 will be gracious to us,</I> and to our land which is almost eaten up 
 with locusts and caterpillars," as appears

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:11"><I>ch.</I> iii. 11</A>.

 "Try now what interest you have at the throne of grace; improve it for
 the removing of this plague, for <I>it has been by your means;</I> you 
 have provoked God to send it. But as you go on thus to profane his 
 sacred things <I>will he regard your persons</I> or your prayers? No, 
 you cannot prevail with him to command it away." For, <I>if we regard 
 iniquity in our hearts, God will not hear us,</I> either for ourselves 
 or for others. 

 4. Had God deserved this at their hands? No, he had provided
 comfortably for them, and had given them such encouragement in their 
 work as might have engaged them to do it cheerfully and well; so some 
 understand

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>,

 "<I>Who is there among you that shall shut a door, or kindle a fire, 
 for nought?</I> No, God does not expect you should serve him for 
 nothing; you are well paid for it, and shall be so; not a cup of cold 
 water, given for the honour of God, shall <I>lose its reward.</I>" 
 Note, The consideration of our constant receivings from God, and the 
 present rewards of obedience in obedience, very much aggravates our 
 slothfulness and niggardliness in our returns of duty to God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He calls them to repentance for their profanations of his holy
 name. So we may understand 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>,

 "<I>Now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious to us.</I> 
 Humble yourselves for your sin, cry mightily to God for pardon, and 
 make up in the faith and fervency of your prayers what has been wanting 
 in the worth and value of your sacrifices; for all the rebukes of 
 Providence we are under <I>are by your means.</I>" Note, Those who have 
 by their sins helped to kindle a fire are highly concerned by their 
 repentance, prayers, and the personal reformation, to help to quench 
 it. We must see how much God's judgments are by our means, and be 
 awakened thereby to be earnest with him to return in mercy; and, if we 
 take not this course, how can we think he should regard our 
 persons?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He declares his resolution both to secure the glory of his own name 
 and to reckon with those who profane it. Those who put contempt upon 
 God and religion, and think to run down sacred things, let them 
 know,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That they shall not gain their point. God will magnify his law and 
 make it honourable, though they vilify it and make it contemptible; for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)
 
 <I>from the rising of the sun to the going down of the same my
 name shall be great among the Gentiles.</I> It might be said, "If these 
 are not the worshippers whom God will accept, then he has no 
 worshippers." As if he must make the best of their service, or else he 
 would have no service done him; and then <I>what will he do for his 
 great name?</I> But let him alone for that; <I>though Israel</I> be not 
 faithful, <I>be not gathered,</I> yet God will be <I>glorious.</I> 
 Though these priests provoke him to take down the ceremonial economy, 
 and to abolish that <I>law of commandments,</I> which <I>could not make 
 the comers thereunto perfect,</I> yet he will be no loser by that, at 
 the long run; for, 

 (1.) Instead of those carnal ordinances, which they profaned, a 
 spiritual way of worship shall be introduced and established: 
 <I>Incense shall be offered to God's name</I> (which signifies prayer 
 and praise,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:2,Re+8:3">Ps. cxli. 2; Rev. viii. 3</A>),

 instead of the blood and fat of bulls and goats. And it shall be a 
 <I>pure offering,</I> refined, not only from the corruptions that were 
 in the priests' practice, but from the mere bodily exercise that was in 
 the institutions themselves, which are called <I>carnal ordinances, 
 imposed till the time of reformation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:10">Heb. ix. 10</A>.

 When the hour came in which <I>the true worshippers worshipped the
 Father in spirit and in truth,</I> then this <I>incense</I> was 
 <I>offered,</I> even this <I>pure offering.</I>

 (2.) Instead of his being worshipped and served among the Jews only, a 
 small people in a corner of the world, he will be served and worshipped 
 in all places, <I>from the rising of the sun to the going down of the 
 same; in every place,</I> in every part of the world, <I>incense shall 
 be offered to his name;</I> nations shall be discipled, and shall speak 
 of the wonderful works of God, and have them spoken to them in their 
 own language. This is a plain prediction of that great revolution in
 the kingdom of grace by which the Gentiles, who had been <I>strangers 
 and foreigners,</I> came to be <I>fellow-citizens with the saints and 
 of the household of God,</I> and as welcome to the throne of grace as 
 ever the Jews had been. It is twice said (for the thing was certain), 
 <I>My name shall be great among the Gentiles,</I> whereas hitherto in 
 Judah only he was <I>known,</I> and <I>his name was great,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:1">Ps. lxxvi. 1</A>.

 God's name shall be declared to them, the declaration of it shall be
 received and believed, and there shall be those among the Gentiles who 
 shall magnify and glorify the name of God better than ever the Jews had 
 done, even the priests themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That they shall not go unpunished, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Here is the doom of those who do like these priests, for the sentence 
 on them is a sentence on all such. Observe,

 (1.) The description of profane and careless worshippers. They are such
 as <I>vow and sacrifice to the Lord a corrupt thing</I> when they have
 <I>in their flock a male.</I> They have of the best, wherewith to serve
 and honour him, so bountiful has be been in his gifts to them, but they
 put him off with the worst, and think that good enough for him, so
 ungrateful are they in their returns to him. This was the fault of the
 people, but the priests connived at it, and indulged them in it. We
 find a distinction in the law which allowed <I>that</I> to be
 <I>offered for a free-will offering</I> which would <I>not be accepted
 for a vow,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+22:23">Lev. xxii. 23</A>.

 But the priests would accept it, though God would not, pretending to be
 more indulgent than he was, for which he will give them no thanks
 another day. 

 (2.) The character given of such worshippers. They are
 <I>deceivers;</I> they deal falsely and fraudulently with God; they 
 play the hypocrite with him; they pretend to honour him, in making the 
 vow, but, when it comes to be performed, they put an affront upon him, 
 to such a degree that it would have been <I>better not to have vowed 
 than to vow</I> and <I>thus to pay;</I> but let not such be themselves 
 deceived, for <I>God is not mocked.</I> Those who think to put a cheat 
 upon God will prove, in the end, to have put a damning cheat upon their 
 own souls. Hypocrites are deceivers, and they will prove
 self-deceivers, and so self-destroyers. 

 (3.) The doom passed upon them: They are <I>cursed;</I> they expect a 
 blessing, but will meet with a curse, the tokens of God's wrath, 
 according to the judgment written.

 (4.) The reason of this doom: "<I>For I am a great King, saith the Lord
 of hosts,</I> and therefore will reckon with those who deal with me but 
 as a man like themselves; <I>my name is dreadful among the heathen,</I> 
 and therefore I will not bear that it should be contemptible among my 
 own people." The heathen paid more respect to their gods, though idols, 
 than the Jews did to theirs, though the only true and living God. Note, 
 The consideration of God's universal dominion, and the universal 
 acknowledgment of it, should restrain us from all irreverence in his 
 service.</P>
