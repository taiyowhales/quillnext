 The vision in the foregoing chapter gave assurances of the 
 re-establishing of the civil interests of the Jewish nation, the 
 promises of which terminated in Christ. Now the vision in this chapter 
 concerns their church-state, and their ecclesiastical interests, and 
 assures them that they shall be put into a good posture again; and the 
 promises of this also have an eye to Christ, who is not only our 
 prince, but the high priest of our profession, of whom Joshua was a 
 type. Here is, 

 I. A vision relating to Joshua, as the representative of the church in
 his time, representing the disadvantages he laboured under, and the
 people in him, with the redress of the grievances of both. 

 1. He is accused by Satan, but is brought off by Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 2. He appears in filthy garments, but has them changed,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>.

 3. He is assured of being established in his office if he conduct
 himself well, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>.

 II. A sermon relating to Christ, who is here called "The branch," who 
 should be endued with all perfections for his undertaking, should be 
 carried triumphantly through it, and by whom we should have pardon and 
 peace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:8-10">ver. 8-10</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the
 angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist
 him.
 &nbsp; 2 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Satan, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> rebuke thee, O Satan;
 even the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: <I>is</I> not
 this a brand plucked out of the fire?
 &nbsp; 3 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before
 the angel.
 &nbsp; 4 And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him,
 saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he
 said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and
 I will clothe thee with change of raiment.
 &nbsp; 5 And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they
 set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments.
 And the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> stood by.
 &nbsp; 6 And the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> protested unto Joshua, saying,
 &nbsp; 7 Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways,
 and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my
 house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places
 to walk among these that stand by.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 There was a Joshua that was a principal agent in the first settling of 
 Israel in Canaan; here is another of the same name very active in their 
 second settlement there after the captivity; Jesus is the same name, 
 and it signifies <I>Saviour;</I> and they were both figures of him that 
 was to come, our chief captain and our chief priest. The angel that 
 talked with <I>Zechariah showed him Joshua the high priest;</I> it is 
 probable that the prophet saw him frequently, that he spoke to him, and 
 that there was a great intimacy between them; but, in his common views, 
 he only saw how he appeared before men; if he must know how he stands 
 before the Lord, it must be shown him in vision; and so it is shown 
 him. And men are really as they are with God, not as they appear in the 
 eye of the world. He stood <I>before the angel of the Lord,</I> that 
 is, before Christ, the Lord of the angels, to whom even the high 
 priests themselves, of Aaron's order, were accountable. He <I>stood 
 before the angel of the Lord</I> to execute his office, to minister to 
 God under the inspection of the angels. He stood to consult the oracle 
 on the behalf of Israel, for whom, as high priest, he was agent. Guilt 
 and corruption are our two great discouragements when we stand before 
 God. By the guilt of the sins committed by us we have become obnoxious 
 to the justice of God; by the power of the sin that dwells in us we 
 have become odious to the holiness of God. All God's Israel are in 
 danger upon these two accounts. Joshua was so here, for <I>the law made 
 men priests that had infirmity,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:28">Heb. vii. 28</A>.

 And, as to both, we have relief from Jesus Christ, who is made of God
 to us both <I>righteousness and sanctification.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Joshua is accused as a criminal, but is justified. 

 1. A violent opposition is made to him. <I>Satan stands at his right
 hand to resist him</I> to be a <I>Satan to him, a law-adversary.</I> He 
 stands at his right hand, as the prosecutor, or witness, at the right 
 hand of the prisoner. Note, The devil is the accuser of the brethren, 
 that <I>accuses them before God day and night,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:10">Rev. xii. 10</A>.

 Some think the chief priest was accused for the sin of many of the 
 inferior priests, in marrying strange wives, which they were much 
 guilty of after their return out of captivity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1,2,Ne+13:28">Ezra ix. 1, 2; Neh. xiii. 28</A>.
 
 When God is about to reestablish the priesthood Satan objects the sins
 that were found among the priests, as rendering them unworthy the 
 honour designed them. It is by our own folly that we give Satan
 advantage against us and furnish him with matter for reproach and 
 accusation; and if any thing be amiss, especially with the priests, 
 Satan will be sure to aggravate it and make the worst of it. He 
 <I>stood to resist him,</I> that is, to oppose the service he was doing 
 for the public good. He stood <I>at his right hand,</I> the hand of 
 action, to discourage him, and raise difficulties in his way. Note, 
 When we stand before God to minister to him, or stand up for God to 
 serve his interests, we must expect to meet with all the resistance 
 that Satan's subtlety and malice can give us. Let us then resist him 
 that resists us and he shall flee from us. 

 2. A victorious defence is made for him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>The Lord</I> (that is, the Lord Christ) <I>said unto Satan, The Lord
 rebuke thee.</I> Note, It is the happiness of the saints that the Judge 
 is their friend; the same that they are accused to is their patron and 
 protector, and an advocate for them, and he will be sure to bring them 
 off. 

 (1.) Satan is here checked by one that has authority, that has 
 conquered him, and many a time silenced him. <I>The accuser of the 
 brethren,</I> of the ministers and the ministry, <I>is cast out;</I> 
 his indictments are quashed, and his suggestions against them as well 
 as his suggestions to them, are shown to be malicious, frivolous, and 
 vexatious. <I>The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan! The Lord said</I> (that 
 is, the Lord our Redeemer), <I>The Lord rebuke thee,</I> that is, the 
 Lord the Creator. The power of God is engaged for the making of the
 grace of Christ effectual. "<I>The Lord</I> restrain thy malicious 
 rage, reject thy malicious charge, and revenge upon thee thy enmity to 
 a servant of his" Note, those that belong to Christ have him ready to 
 appear vigorously for them when Satan appears most vehement against 
 them. He does not parley with him, but stops his mouth immediately with 
 this sharp reprimand: <I>The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan!</I> This is the 
 best way of dealing with that furious enemy. <I>Get thee behind me,
 Satan.</I> 

 (2.) Satan is here argued with. He resists the priest, but let him know 
 that his resistance,

 [1.] Will be fruitless; it will be to no purpose to attempt any thing 
 against Jerusalem, for <I>the Lord has chosen</I> it, and he will abide 
 by his choice. Whatever is objected against God's people, God saw it; 
 he foresaw it when he chose them and yet he chose them, and therefore 
 that can be no inducement to him now to reject them; he knew the worst 
 of them when he chose them; and his election shall obtain.

 [2.] It is unreasonable; for <I>is not this a brand plucked out of the 
 fire?</I> Joshua is so, and the priesthood, and the people, whose 
 representative he is. Christ has not that to say for them for which 
 they are to be praised, but that for which they are to be pitied. Note, 
 Christ is ready to make the best of his people, and takes notice of 
 every thing that is pleadable in excuse of their infirmities, so far is 
 he from being extreme to mark what they do amiss. They have been lately 
 in the fire; no wonder that they are black and smoked, and have the 
 smell of fire upon them, but they are therefore to be excused, not to 
 be accused. One can expect no other than that those who but the other 
 day were captives in Babylon should appear very mean and despicable. 
 They have been lately brought out of great affliction; and is Satan so 
 barbarous as to desire to have them thrown into affliction again? They 
 have been wonderfully delivered out of the fire, that God might be 
 glorified in them; and will he then cast them off and abandon them? No, 
 he will not quench the smoking flax, the smoking fire-brand; for he 
 snatched it out of the fire because he intended to make use of it.
 Note, Narrow escapes from imminent danger are happy presages and 
 powerful pleas for more eminent favours. A converted soul is a <I>brand 
 plucked out of the fire</I> by a miracle of free grace, and therefore 
 shall not be left to be a prey to Satan.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Joshua appears as one polluted, but is purified; for he represents 
 the Israel of God, who are all <I>as an unclean thing,</I> till they 
 are washed and sanctified <I>in the name of the Lord Jesus</I> and 
 <I>by the Spirit of our God.</I> Now observe here, 

 1. The impurity wherein Joshua appeared

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>He was clothed,</I> not only in coarse, but in <I>filthy 
 garments,</I> such as did very ill become the dignity of his office and 
 the sanctity of his work. By the law of Moses the garments of the high 
 priest were to be <I>for glory and for beauty,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:2">Exod. xxviii. 2</A>.

 But Joshua's garments were a shame and reproach to him; yet in them
 <I>he stood before the angel of the Lord;</I> he had no clean linen
 wherein to minister and to do the duty of his place. Now this
 intimates, not only that the priesthood was poor and despised, and
 loaded with contempt, but that there was a great deal of iniquity
 cleaving to the holy things. The returned Jews were so taken up with
 their troubles that they thought they needed not complain of their
 sins, and were not aware that those were the great hindrances of the
 progress of God's work among them; because they were free from idolatry
 they thought themselves chargeable with no iniquity. But God showed
 them there were many things amiss in them, which retarded the advances
 of God's favours towards them. There were spiritual enemies warring
 against them, more dangerous than any of the neighbouring nations. The
 Chaldee paraphrase says, <I>Joshua had sons who took unto them wives
 which were not lawful for the priests to take;</I> and we find it was
 so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+10:18">Ezra x. 18</A>.

 And, no doubt, there were other things amiss in the priesthood, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:1">Mal. ii. 1</A>.

 Yet Joshua was permitted to <I>stand before the angel of the Lord.</I>
 Though his children did not as they should, yet the covenant of 
 priesthood was not broken. Note, Christ bears with his people, whose 
 hearts are upright with him, and admits them into communion with 
 himself, notwithstanding their manifold infirmities. 

 2. The provision that was made for his cleansing. Christ gave orders
 to the angels that attended him, and were ready to do his pleasure, to 
 put Joshua into a better state. Joshua presented himself before the 
 Lord in his filthy garments, as an object of his pity; and Christ 
 graciously looked upon him with compassion, and not, as justly he might 
 have done, with indignation. Christ loathed the filthiness of Joshua's 
 garments, yet did not put him away, but put them away. Thus God by his 
 grace does with those whom he chooses to be priests to himself; he 
 parts between them and their sins, and so prevents their sins parting 
 between them and their God; he reconciles himself to the sinner, but 
 not to the sin. Two things are here done for Joshua, representing a
 double work of divine grace wrought in and for believers:--

 (1.) His filthy garments are taken from him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 The meaning of this is given us in what Christ said, and he said it as 
 one having authority, <I>Behold, I have caused thy iniquity to pass 
 from thee.</I> The guilt of it is taken away by pardoning mercy, the 
 stench and stain of it by peace spoken to the conscience, and the power 
 of it broken by renewing grace. When God forgives our sins he <I>causes 
 our iniquity to pass from us,</I> that it may not appear against us, to 
 condemn us; it passes from us <I>as far as the east is from the 
 west.</I> When he sanctifies the nature he enables us to <I>put off the 
 old man,</I> to cast away from us the filthy rags of our corrupt 
 affections and lusts, as things we will never have any thing more to do 
 with, will never gird to us or appear in. Thus Christ <I>washes those 
 from their sins in his own blood</I> whom he <I>makes to our God kings 
 and priests,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:5,6">Rev. i. 5, 6</A>.

 Either we must be cleansed from the pollutions of sin or we shall,
 <I>as polluted, be put from</I> that <I>priesthood,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:62">Ezra ii. 62</A>.

 (2.) He is clothed anew, has not only the shame of his filthiness 
 removed, but the shame of his nakedness covered: <I>I will clothe thee 
 with change of raiment.</I> Joshua had no clean linen of his own, but 
 Christ will provide for him, for he will not let a priesthood of his 
 own instituting be lost, be either contemptible before men or 
 unacceptable before God. The change of raiment here is rich costly 
 raiment, such as is worn on high days. Joshua shall appear as lovely
 as ever he appeared loathsome. Those that minister in holy things shall 
 not only cease to do evil, but learn to do well; God will make them 
 wise, and humble, and diligent, and faithful, and examples of every 
 thing that is good; and then Joshua is clothed with change of raiment. 
 Thus those whom Christ makes spiritual priests are clothed with the 
 spotless robe of his righteousness and appear before God in that, and 
 with the graces of his Spirit, which are ornaments to them. <I>The 
 righteousness of saints,</I> both imputed and implanted, is the fine 
 linen, clean and white, with which <I>the bride, the Lamb's wife,</I> 
 is arrayed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:8">Rev. xix. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Joshua is in danger of being turned out of office; but, instead of 
 that, he is reinstalled and established in his office. He not only has 
 his sins pardoned, and is furnished with grace sufficient for himself, 
 but, as <I>rectus in curia--acquitted in court,</I> he is restored to
 his former honours and trusts. 

 1. The crown of the priesthood is put upon him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 This was done at the special instance and request of the prophet: I 
 said, "<I>Let them set a fair mitre upon his head,</I> as a badge of 
 his office. Now that he looks clean, let him also look great; let him 
 be dressed up in all the garments of the high priest." Note, When God 
 designs the restoring or reviving of religion he stirs up his prophets 
 and people to pray for it, and does it in answer to their prayers. 
 Zechariah prayed that the angels might be ordered to set the mitre on 
 Joshua's head, and they did it immediately, and <I>clothed him with</I> 
 the priestly <I>garments;</I> for no man took this honour to himself, 
 <I>but he that was called of God</I> to it. <I>The angel of the Lord 
 stood by,</I> as having the oversight of the work which the created 
 angels were employed in. He stood by, as one well pleased with it, and 
 resolved to stand by the orders he had given for the doing of it and to 
 continue his presence with that priesthood. 

 2. The covenant of the priesthood is renewed with him, which is called
 God's <I>covenant of peace,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:12">Num. xxv. 12</A>.

 Mr. Pemble calls it <I>the patent of his office,</I> which is here 
 declared and delivered to him before witnesses,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+3:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 The angel of the Lord, having taken care to make him fit for his office
 (and all that God calls to any office he either finds fit or makes so), 
 invests him in it. And though he is not <I>made a priest with an 
 oath</I> (that honour is reserved for him who is a priest after the 
 order of Melchisedek, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:21">Heb. vii. 21</A>),

 yet, being a type of him, he is inaugurated with a solemn declaration
 of the terms upon which he held his office. The angel of the Lord 
 protested to Joshua that, if he would be sure to do the duty of his 
 place, he should enjoy the dignity and reward of it. Now see,

 (1.) What the conditions are upon which he enters into his office. Let 
 him know that he is upon his good behaviour; he must <I>walk in God's 
 ways,</I> that is, he must live a good life and be holy in all manner 
 of conversation; he must go before the people in the paths of God's 
 commandments, and walk circumspectly. He must also <I>keep God's
 charge,</I> must carefully do all the services of the priesthood, and 
 must see to it that the inferior priests performed the duties of their 
 place decently and in order. He must <I>take heed to himself, and</I> 
 to <I>all the flock,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:28">Acts xx. 28</A>.

 Note, Good ministers must be good Christians; yet that is not enough:
 they have a trust committed to them, they are charged with it, and they 
 must keep it with all possible care, that they may give up their 
 account of it with joy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:14">1 Tim. vi. 14</A>.

 (2.) What the privileges are which we may expect, and be assured of, in
 the due discharge of his office. His patent runs, <I>Quamdiu se bene 
 gesserit--During good behaviour.</I> Let him be sure to do his part, 
 and God will own him.

 [1.] "<I>Thou shalt judge my house;</I> thou shalt preside in the 
 affairs of the temple, and the inferior priests shall be under thy 
 direction." Note, The power of the church, and of church rulers, is not 
 a legislative, but only a judicial power. The high priest might not 
 make any new laws for God's house, nor ordain any other rites of 
 worship than what God had ordained; but he must judge God's house, that 
 is, he must see to it that God's laws and ordinances were punctually 
 observed, must protect and encourage those that did observe them, and 
 enquire into and punish the violation of them. 

 [2.] "<I>Thou shalt also keep my courts;</I> thou shalt have oversight 
 of what is done in all the courts of the temple, and shalt keep them 
 pure and in good order for the worship to be performed in them." Note, 
 Ministers are God's stewards, and they are to keep his courts, in 
 honour of him who is the chief Lord and for the preserving of equity 
 and good order among his tenants.

 [3.] "<I>I will give thee places to walk among those that stand by,</I> 
 among these angels that are inspectors and assistants in this 
 instalment." They shall stand by while Joshua is at work for God, and 
 shall be as a guard to him, or he shall be highly honoured and 
 respected as an <I>angel of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:14">Gal. iv. 14</A>.

 Ministers are called <I>angels,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:20">Rev. i. 20</A>.

 Those that <I>walk in God's ways</I> may be said to <I>walk among the 
 angels</I> themselves, for they do the will of God as the angels do it 
 that are in heaven, and are their <I>fellow-servants,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:10">Rev. xix. 10</A>.
 
 Some make it a promise of eternal life, and of a reward of his fidelity 
 in the future state. Heaven is not only a palace, a place to repose in, 
 but a paradise, a garden, a place to walk in; and there are walks among 
 the angels, in society with that holy and glorious company. See

 As the promises made to David often slide insensibly into promises of 
 the Messiah, whose kingdom David's was a type of, so the promises here 
 made to Joshua immediately rise as far upward, and look as far forward, 
 as to Christ, whose priesthood Joshua's was now a shadow of, not only 
 in general, as it kept up the line of Aaron's priesthood, but 
 especially as it was the reviving of that happy method of 
 correspondence between heaven and earth, to which a great interruption 
 had been given by the iniquity and captivity of Israel. Christ is a 
 high priest, as Joshua was, for sinners and sufferers, to mediate for 
 those that have been under guilt and wrath. And it was fit that Joshua 
 should understand the priesthood of Christ, because all the virtue of 
 his priesthood, its value and usefulness to the church, depended upon 
 and was derived from the priesthood of Christ. See,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To whom this promise of Christ is directed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>Hear now, O Joshua!</I> Thou hast heard with pleasure what belongs 
 to thyself; but, behold, a greater than Joshua is at hand. <I>Hear 
 now</I> concerning him, <I>thou</I> and the rest of the priests, <I>thy 
 fellows, who sit before thee,</I> at thy feet, as learners, but whom 
 thou art to look upon as <I>thy fellows,</I> for all you are brethren; 
 let the high priest, and all the inferior priests, take notice of this, 
 for they are <I>men wondered at.</I>" They are set <I>for signs,</I> 
 for types and figures of Christ's priesthood. What God now did for 
 Joshua and his fellows was a happy omen of the coming of the Messiah 
 promised, and would be so interpreted, with a pleasing wonder, by all 
 that had understanding of the times. Or they are men <I>wondered at</I> 
 for their singularity, hooted at as strange sort of people, because 
 they <I>run not with others to the same excess of riot</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:4">1 Pet. iv. 4</A>),

 or for their strange afflictions and surprising deliverance out of 
 them, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:7">Ps. lxxi. 7</A>,

 <I>I am as a wonder unto many.</I> They are <I>men of wonder;</I> they
 are a wonder to themselves, are amazed to think how happily their
 condition is altered. God's people and ministers are, upon many
 accounts, men wondered at. The high priest and his fellows here (as the
 prophet and his children, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:18">Isa. viii. 18</A>)

 are for signs and for wonders. But men's wonder at them will cease when
 the Messiah comes, as the stars are eclipsed by the light of the sun; 
 for <I>his name shall be called Wonderful.</I></P>

 II. The promise itself, which consists of several parts, all designed 
 for the comfort and encouragement of Joshua and his friends in that 
 great good work of building the temple, which they were now engaged in. 
 An eye to Christ, and a believing dependence upon the promises relating 
 to him and his kingdom, would carry them through the difficulties they 
 met with in that and their other services. 

 1. The Messiah shall come: <I>Behold, I will bring forth my servant the
 branch.</I> He has been long hid, but the fulness of time is now at 
 hand, when he shall be brought forth into the world, brought forth 
 among his people Israel. God himself undertakes to bring him forth,
 and therefore, no doubt, he will own him and stand by him. He is God's 
 servant, employed in his work, obedient to his will, and entirely 
 devoted to his honour and glory. He is the branch; so he was called 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+4:2">Isa. iv. 2</A>,
 
 <I>The branch of the Lord.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:1">Isa. xi. 1</A>,

 <I>A branch out of the roots of Jesse.</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:5">Jer. xxiii. 5</A>,
 
 <I>A righteous branch;</I> and 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:15">Jer. xxiii. 15</A>,

 <I>The branch of righteousness.</I> His beginning was small, as a
 tender branch, but in time he should become a great tree and fill the 
 earth,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:2">Isa. liii. 2</A>.

 He is the branch from which all our fruit must be gathered.

 2. Many eyes shall be upon him. He is <I>the stone laid before
 Joshua,</I> alluding to the foundation or chief corner-stone, of the 
 temple, which probably was laid, with great solemnity, in the presence 
 of Joshua. Christ is not only the branch, which is the beginning of a 
 tree, but the foundation, which is the beginning of a building; and, 
 when he shall be brought forth, <I>seven eyes shall be upon him.</I> 
 The eye of his Father was upon him, to take care of him, and protect 
 him, especially in his sufferings; when he was buried in the grave, as 
 the foundation-stones are under ground, the eyes of Heaven were still 
 upon him, buried out of men's sight, but not out of God's. The eyes of 
 all the prophets and Old-Testament saints were upon this one stone; 
 Abraham rejoiced to see Christ's day, and he <I>saw it and was 
 glad.</I> The eyes of all believers are upon him; they look unto him 
 and are saved, as the eyes of the stung Israelites were upon the brazen 
 serpent. Some understand this <I>one stone</I> to have the seven eyes 
 in it as the wheels had in Ezekiel's vision, and think it denotes that 
 perfection of wisdom and knowledge which Jesus Christ was endued with, 
 for the good of his church. <I>His eyes run to and fro through the 
 earth.</I> 

 3. God himself will beautify him, and put honour upon him: <I>I will
 engrave the graving thereof, saith the Lord of hosts.</I> This stone 
 the builders refused, as rough and unsightly; but God undertakes to 
 smooth and polish it, nay, and to carve it so that it shall be the 
 <I>head stone of the corner,</I> the most beautiful in all the 
 building. Christ was God's workmanship; and abundance of his wisdom 
 appears in the contrivance of our redemption, which will appear when 
 the engraving is perfected. This stone is a <I>precious stone,</I> 
 though laid for a <I>foundation;</I> and the <I>graving</I> of it seems 
 to allude to the precious stones in the breast-plate of the high 
 priest, which had the names of the tribes <I>graven</I> upon them, as 
 the <I>engraving of a signet,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:21,22">Exod. xxviii. 21, 22</A>.

 In that breast-plate there were twelve stones laid before Aaron, and
 for aught that appears those were lost; but there shall be one worth 
 them all laid before Joshua, and that is Christ himself. This precious 
 stone shall sparkle as if it had seven eyes; there shall appear a 
 perfection of wisdom and prudence in the oracles that proceed from the 
 breast-plate of judgment. And God will <I>engrave the engraving 
 thereof;</I> he will entrust Christ with all his elect, and he shall 
 appear as their representative, and agent for them, as the high priest 
 did when he went in before the Lord with the names of all Israel 
 engraven in the precious stones of his breast-plate. When God gave a 
 remnant to Christ, to be brought through grace to glory, then he 
 <I>engraved the graving</I> of this <I>precious stone.</I> 

 4. By him sin shall be taken away, both the guilt and the dominion of
 it: <I>I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.</I> When the 
 high priest had the names of Israel engraven on the precious stones he 
 was adorned with he is said to <I>bear the iniquity of the holy 
 things</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:38">Exod. xxviii. 38</A>);

 but the law <I>made nothing perfect,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:1">Heb. x. 1</A>.

 He bore the iniquity of the land, as a type of Christ; but he could not
 remove it; the doing of that was reserved for Christ, that blessed
 <I>Lamb of God, that takes away the sin of the world;</I> and he did it
 <I>in one day,</I> that day in which he suffered and died; that was
 done by the sacrifice offered that day which could not be done by the
 sacrifices of ages before, no, not by all the days of atonement which
 from Moses to Christ returned every year. This agrees with the angel's
 prediction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:24">Dan. ix. 24</A>):

 He shall <I>finish transgression and make an end of sin.</I> And some
 make the engravings wherewith God engraved him to signify the wounds 
 and stripes which were given to his blessed body, which he underwent 
 for our <I>transgression,</I> for our <I>iniquity,</I> and <I>by which 
 we are healed.</I> 

 5. The effect of all this shall be the sweet enjoyment which all
 believers shall have of themselves, and the sweet communion they shall 
 have with one another

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>In that day you shall call every man his neighbour under the vine 
 and the fig-tree,</I> which yield most pleasant fruit, and whose leaves 
 also afford a refreshing shade for arbours. When iniquity is taken 
 away, 

 (1.) We reap precious benefits and privileges from our justification,
 more precious than the products of the vine or the fig-tree, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:1">Rom. v. 1</A>.

 (2.) We repose in a sweet tranquillity and are quiet from the fear of
 evil. What should terrify us when iniquity is taken away, when nothing
 can hurt us? We sit down under Christ's shadow with delight, and by it 
 are sheltered from the scorching heat of the curse of the law. We live 
 as Israel in the peaceable reign of Solomon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:24,25">1 Kings iv. 24, 25</A>);

 for he is the prince of peace.

 (3.) We ought to invite others to come to partake with us in the
 enjoyment of these privileges, to <I>call every man his neighbour</I> 
 to come and sit with him, for mutual converse, under the vine and 
 fig-tree, and to share with him in the fruits he is surrounded with. 
 Gospel-grace, as far as it comes with power, makes men neighbourly; and 
 those that have the comfort of acquaintance with Christ themselves, and 
 communion with God through him, will be forward to court others to it. 
 <I>Let us go unto the house of the Lord.</I></P>
