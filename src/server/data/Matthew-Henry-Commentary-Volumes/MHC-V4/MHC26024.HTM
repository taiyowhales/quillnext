 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here are two sermons in this chapter, preached on a particular 
 occasion, and they are both from Mount Sinai, the mount of terror, both 
 from Mount Ebal, the mount of curses; both speak the approaching fate 
 of Jerusalem. The occasion of them was the king of Babylon's laying 
 siege to Jerusalem, and the design of them is to show that in the issue 
 of that siege he should be not only master of the place, but destroyer 
 of it. 

 I. By the sign of flesh boiling in a pot over the fire are shown the
 miseries that Jerusalem should suffer during the siege, and justly, for 
 her filthiness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:1-14">ver. 1-14</A>.

 II. By the sign of Ezekiel's not mourning for the death of his wife is
 shown that the calamities coming upon Jerusalem were too great to be 
 lamented, so great that they should sink down under them into a silent 
 despair,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth
 <I>day</I> of the month, the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Son of man, write thee the name of the day, <I>even</I> of this
 same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this
 same day.
 &nbsp; 3  And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto
 them, Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Set on a pot, set <I>it</I> on, and
 also pour water into it:
 &nbsp; 4  Gather the pieces thereof into it, <I>even</I> every good piece,
 the thigh, and the shoulder; fill <I>it</I> with the choice bones.
 &nbsp; 5  Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under
 it, <I>and</I> make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it
 therein.
 &nbsp; 6  Wherefore thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Woe to the bloody city, to
 the pot whose scum <I>is</I> therein, and whose scum is not gone out
 of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it.
 &nbsp; 7  For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top
 of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with
 dust;
 &nbsp; 8  That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have
 set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be
 covered.
 &nbsp; 9  Therefore thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Woe to the bloody city! I
 will even make the pile for fire great.
 &nbsp; 10  Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice
 it well, and let the bones be burned.
 &nbsp; 11  Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of
 it may be hot, and may burn, and <I>that</I> the filthiness of it may
 be molten in it, <I>that</I> the scum of it may be consumed.
 &nbsp; 12  She hath wearied <I>herself</I> with lies, and her great scum
 went not forth out of her: her scum <I>shall be</I> in the fire.
 &nbsp; 13  In thy filthiness <I>is</I> lewdness: because I have purged thee,
 and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy
 filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon
 thee.
 &nbsp; 14  I the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> have spoken <I>it:</I> it shall come to pass, and I
 will do <I>it;</I> I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither
 will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy
 doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The notice God gives to Ezekiel in Babylon of Nebuchadnezzar's 
 laying siege to Jerusalem, just at the time when he was doing it 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>Son of man,</I> take notice, <I>the king of Babylon,</I> who is now 
 abroad with his army, thou knowest not where, <I>set himself against 
 Jerusalem this same day.</I>" It was many miles, it was many days' 
 journey, from Jerusalem to Babylon. Perhaps the last intelligence they 
 had from the army was that the design was upon Rabbath of the children 
 of Ammon and that the campaign was to be opened with the siege of that 
 city. But God knew, and could tell the prophet, "<I>This day,</I> at 
 this time, Jerusalem is invested, and the Chaldean army has sat down 
 before it." Note, As all times, so all places, even the most remote, 
 are present with God and under his view. He tells the prophet, that the 
 prophet might tell the people, that so when it proved to be punctually 
 true, as they would find by the public intelligence in a little time, 
 it might be a confirmation of the prophet's mission, and they might 
 infer that, since he was right in his news, he was so in his 
 predictions, for he owed both to the same correspondence he had with 
 Heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The notice which he orders him to take of it. He must enter it in 
 his book, <I>memorandum,</I> that <I>in the ninth year</I> of 
 Jehoiachin's captivity (for thence Ezekiel dated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:2"><I>ch.</I> i. 2</A>,

 which was also the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign, for he began to
 reign when Jehoiachin was carried off), in the tenth month, on the 
 tenth day of the month, the king of Babylon laid siege to Jerusalem; 
 and the date here agrees exactly with the date in the history, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+25:1">2 Kings xxv. 1</A>.

 See how God reveals things to his servants the prophets, especially
 those things which serve to confirm their word, and so to confirm their 
 own faith. Note, It is good to keep an exact account of the date of 
 remarkable occurrences, which may sometimes contribute to the 
 manifesting of God's glory so much the more in them, and the explaining 
 and confirming of scripture prophecies. <I>Known unto God are all his 
 works.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The notice which he orders him to give to the people thereupon, 
 the purport of which is that this siege of Jerusalem, now begun, will 
 infallibly end in the ruin of it. This he must say <I>to the rebellious 
 house,</I> to those of them that were in Babylon, to be by them 
 communicated to those that were yet in their own land. A rebellious 
 house will soon be a ruinous house.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He must show them this by a sign; for that stupid people needed to 
 be taught as children are. The comparison made use of is that of a 
 <I>boiling pot.</I> This agrees with Jeremiah's vision many years 
 before, when he first began to be a prophet, and probably was designed 
 to put them in mind of that 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:13">Jer. i. 13</A>,

 <I>I see a seething pot, with the face towards the north;</I> and the 
 explanation of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>,

 makes it to signify the besieging of Jerusalem by the <I>northern</I> 
 nations); and, as this comparison is intended to confirm Jeremiah's 
 vision, so also to confront the vain confidence of the princes of 
 Jerusalem, who had said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:3"><I>ch.</I> xi. 3</A>),

 <I>This city is the caldron and we are the flesh,</I> meaning, "We are
 as safe here as if we were surrounded with walls of brass." "Well," 
 says God, "it shall be so; you shall be boiled in Jerusalem, as the 
 <I>flesh in the caldron,</I> boiled to pieces; let the pot be set on 
 with water in it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 let it be filled with the flesh of the <I>choice of the flock</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),
 
 with the choice pieces 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 and the marrow-bones, and let the other bones serve for fuel, that, one 
 way or other, either in the pot or under it, the whole beast may be 
 made use of." A fire of bones, though it be a slow fire (for the siege 
 was to be long), is yet a sure and lasting fire; such was God's wrath 
 against them, and not like the <I>crackling of thorns under a pot,</I> 
 which has noise and blaze, but no intense heat. Those that from all 
 parts of the country fled into Jerusalem for safety would be sadly 
 disappointed when the siege laid to it would soon make the place too 
 hot for them; and yet there was not getting out of it, but they must be 
 forced to abide by it, as the flesh in a boiling pot.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He must give them a comment upon this sign. It is to be construed as 
 a <I>woe to the bloody city,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 And again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 being <I>bloody,</I> let it <I>go to pot,</I> to be boiled; that is the 
 fittest place for it. Let us here see,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What is the course God takes with it. Jerusalem, during the siege, 
 is like a pot boiling over the fire, all in a heat, all in a hurry. 
 
 [1.] Care is taken to keep a good fire under the pot, which signifies 
 the closeness of the siege, and the many vigorous attacks made upon the 
 city by the besiegers, and especially the continued wrath of God 
 burning against them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>I will make the pile for fire great.</I> Commission is given to the 
 Chaldeans 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>)

 to <I>heap on wood, and kindle the fire,</I> to make Jerusalem more and 
 more hot to the inhabitants. Note, The fire which God kindles for the 
 consuming of impenitent sinners shall never abate, much less go out, 
 for want of fuel. <I>Tophet has fire and much wood,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:33">Isa. xxx. 33</A>.

 [2.] The meat, as it is boiled, is taken out, and given to the 
 Chaldeans for them to feast upon. "<I>Consume the flesh;</I> let it be 
 thoroughly boiled, boiled to rags. <I>Spice it well,</I> and make it 
 savoury, for those that will fees sweetly upon it. <I>Let the bones be 
 burnt.</I>" either the bones <I>under</I> the pot ("let them be 
 consumed with the other fuel") or, as some think, the bones <I>in</I>
 the pot--"let it boil so furiously that not only the flesh may be 
 sodden, but even the bones softened; let all the inhabitants of 
 Jerusalem be by sickness, sword, and famine, reduced to the extremity 
 of misery." And then 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 "<I>Bring it out piece by piece;</I> let every man be delivered into 
 the enemy's hand, to be either put to the sword or made a prisoner. Let 
 them be an easy prey to them, and let the Chaldeans fall upon them as 
 eagerly as a hungry man does upon a good dish of meat when it is set 
 before him. <I>Let no lot fall upon it;</I> every piece in the pot 
 shall be fetched out and devoured, first or last, and therefore it is 
 no matter for casting lots which shall be fetched out first." It was a 
 very severe military execution when David measured Joab with <I>two 
 lines to put to death and one full line to keep alive,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:2">2 Sam. viii. 2</A>.
 
 But here is no line, no lot of mercy, made use of; all goes one way,
 and that is to destruction.

 [3.] When all the broth is boiled away the pot is set empty upon the 
 coals, that it may burn too, which signifies the setting of the city on 
 fire, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 The scum of the meat, or (as some translate it) <I>the rust of the 
 meat,</I> has so got into the pot that there is no making it clean by 
 washing or scouring it, and therefore it must be done by fire; so let 
 the filthiness be burnt out of it, or, rather, <I>melted in it</I> and 
 burnt with it. Let the vipers and their nest be consumed together.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What is the quarrel God has with it. He would not take these
 severe methods with Jerusalem but that he is provoked to it; she 
 deserves to be thus dealt with, for, 

 [1.] It is a bloody city 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>):

 <I>Her blood is in the midst of her.</I> Many a barbarous murder has 
 been committed in the very heart of the city; nay, and they have a 
 disposition to cruelty in their hearts; they inwardly delight in 
 blood-shed, and so it is <I>in the midst of them.</I> Nay, they commit 
 their murders in the face of the sun, and openly and impudently avow 
 them, in defiance of the justice both of God and man. She did not 
 <I>pour out</I> the blood she shed <I>upon the ground, to cover it with 
 dust,</I> as being ashamed of the sin or afraid of the punishment. She 
 did not look upon it as a filthy thing, proper to be concealed 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:13">Deut. xxiii. 13</A>),

 much less dangerous. Nay, she poured out the innocent blood she shed
 upon a rock, where it would not soak in, upon <I>the top of a rock,</I> 
 in despite of divine views and vengeance. They shed innocent blood
 under colour of justice; so that they gloried in it, as if they had 
 done God and the country good service, so put it, as it were, <I>on the 
 top of a rock.</I> Or it may refer to the sacrificing of their children 
 on their high places, perhaps on the top of rocks. Now thus they 
 <I>caused fury to come up and take vengeance,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 It could not be avoided but that God <I>must</I> in anger <I>visit for 
 these things; his soul must be avenged on such a nation as this.</I> It 
 is absolutely necessary that such a bloody city as this should have 
 blood given her to drink, for she is worthy, for the vindicating of the 
 honour of divine justice. And, the crime having been public and
 notorious, it is fit that the punishment should be so too: <I>I have 
 set her blood on the top of a rock.</I> Jerusalem was to be made an 
 example, and therefore was made a spectacle, to the world; God dealt 
 with her according to the law of retaliation. It is fit that those who 
 <I>sin before all</I> should be <I>rebuked before all;</I> and that the 
 reputation of those should not be consulted by the concealment of their 
 punishment who were so impudent as not to desire the concealment of 
 their sin.

 [2.] It is a filthy city. Great notice is taken, in this explanation of 
 the comparison, of the <I>scum of this pot,</I> which signifies the sin 
 of Jerusalem, working up and appearing when the judgments of God were 
 upon her. It is the pot <I>whose scum is therein</I> and has <I>not 
 gone out of it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 The <I>great scum</I> that <I>went not forth out of her</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),
 
 that stuck to the pot when all was boiled away, and was <I>molten in 
 it</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),
 
 some of this runs over <I>into the fire</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 inflames that, and makes it burn the more furiously, but <I>it shall 
 all be consumed</I> at last, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 When the hand of God had gone out against them, instead of humbling 
 themselves under it, repenting and reforming, and accepting the 
 punishment of their iniquity, they grew more impudent and outrageous in 
 sin, quarrelled with God, persecuted his prophets, were fierce to one 
 another, enraged to the last degree against the Chaldeans, snarled at 
 the stone, gnawed their chain, and were like a wild bull in a net. This 
 as <I>their scum;</I> in their distress they <I>trespassed yet more 
 against the Lord,</I> like <I>that king Ahaz,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:22">2 Chron. xxviii. 22</A>.

 There is little hope of those who are made worse by that which should
 make them better, whose corruptions are excited an exasperated by those 
 rebukes both of the word and of the providence of God which were 
 designed for the suppressing and subduing of them, or of those whose 
 scum boiled up once in convictions, and confessions of sin, as if it 
 would be taken off by reformation, but afterwards returned again, in a 
 revolt from their good overtures; and the heart that seemed softened is 
 hardened again. This was Jerusalem's case: <I>She has wearied with 
 lies,</I> wearied her God with purposes and promises of amendment, 
 which she never stood to, wearied herself with her carnal confidences, 
 which have all deceived her,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Note, Those that follow after lying vanities weary themselves with the 
 pursuit. Now see her doom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 Because she is incurably wicked she is abandoned to ruin, without 
 remedy. <I>First,</I> Methods and means of reformation had been tried
 in vain 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 "<I>In thy filthiness is lewdness;</I> thou hast become obstinate and 
 impudent in it; thou hast got a habit of it, which is confirmed by 
 frequent acts. <I>In thy filthiness</I> thee is a rooted lewdness; as
 appears by this, <I>I have purged thee and thou wast not purged.</I> I 
 have given thee medicine, but it has done thee no good. I have used the 
 means of cleansing thee, but they have been ineffectual; the intention 
 of them has not been answered." Note, It is sad to think how many there 
 are on whom ordinances and providences are all lost. <I>Secondly,</I>
 It is therefore resolved that no more such methods shall be sued: 
 <I>Thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more.</I> The fire 
 shall no longer be a refining fire, but a consuming fire, and therefore 
 shall not be mitigated and shortened, as it has been, but shall be 
 continued in extremity, till it has done its destroying work. Note, 
 Those that will not be healed are justly given up and their case 
 adjudged desperate. There is a day coming when it will be said, <I>He 
 that is filthy, let him be filthy still. Thirdly,</I> Nothing remains
 then but to bring them to utter ruin: <I>I will cause my fury to rest 
 upon thee.</I> This is the same with what is said of the later Jews, 
 that <I>wrath has come upon them to the uttermost,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:16">1 Thess. ii. 16</A>.

 They deserve it: <I>According to thy doings they shall judge thee,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 And God will do it. The sentence is bound on with repeated 
 ratifications, that they might be awakened to see how certain their 
 ruin was: "<I>I the Lord have spoken it,</I> who am able to make good 
 what I have spoken; <I>it shall come to pass,</I> nothing shall prevent 
 it, for <I>I will do it</I> myself, <I>I will not go back</I> upon any 
 entreaties; the decree has gone forth, and <I>I will not spare</I> in 
 compassion to them, <I>neither will I repent.</I>" He will neither 
 change his mind nor his way. Hereby the prophet was forbidden to 
 interceded for them, and they were forbidden to flatter themselves with 
 hopes of an escape. God hath said it, and he will do it. Note, The 
 declarations of God's wrath against sinners are as inviolable as the 
 assurances he has given of favour to his people; and the case of such 
 is sad indeed, who have brought it to this issue, that either God must 
 be false or they must be damned.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  Also the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 16  Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of
 thine eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep,
 neither shall thy tears run down.
 &nbsp; 17  Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire
 of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and
 cover not <I>thy</I> lips, and eat not the bread of men.
 &nbsp; 18  So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my
 wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.
 &nbsp; 19  And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what
 these <I>things are</I> to us, that thou doest <I>so?</I>
 &nbsp; 20  Then I answered them, The word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me,
 saying,
 &nbsp; 21  Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>;
 Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your
 strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul
 pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall
 fall by the sword.
 &nbsp; 22  And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover <I>your</I>
 lips, nor eat the bread of men.
 &nbsp; 23  And your tires <I>shall be</I> upon your heads, and your shoes
 upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine
 away for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another.

 hath done shall ye do: and when this cometh, ye shall know that I

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These verses conclude what we have been upon all along from the 
 beginning of this book, to wit, Ezekiel's prophecies of the destruction 
 of Jerusalem; for after this, though he prophesied much concerning 
 other nations, he said no more concerning Jerusalem, till he heard of 
 the destruction of it, almost three years after, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:21"><I>ch.</I> xxxiii. 21</A>.

 He had assured them, in the former part of this chapter, that there was
 no hope at all of the preventing of the trouble; here he assures them 
 that they should not have the ease of weeping for it. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The sign by which this was represented to them, and it was a sign 
 that cost the prophet very dear; the more shame for them that when he, 
 by a divine appointment, was at such an expense to affect them with 
 what he had to deliver, yet they were not affected by it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He must lose a good wife, that should suddenly be taken from him by 
 death. God gave him notice of it before, that it might be the less 
 surprise to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>Behold, I take away from thee the desire of thy eyes with a 
 stroke.</I> Note, 

 (1.) A married state may very well agree with the prophetical office; 
 it is <I>honourable in all,</I> and therefore not sinful in ministers. 
 
 (2.) Much of the comfort of human life lies in agreeable relations. No 
 doubt Ezekiel found a prudent tender yoke-fellow, that shared with him 
 in his griefs and cares, to be a happy companion in his captivity. 

 (3.) Those in the conjugal relation must be to each other not only a 
 <I>covering of the eyes</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:16">Gen. xx. 16</A>),

 to restrain wandering looks after others; but a <I>desire of the
 eyes,</I> to engage pleasing looks on one another. A beloved wife is 
 the <I>desire of the eyes,</I> which find not any object more grateful.

 (4.) That is least safe which is most dear; we know not how soon the 
 desire of our eyes may be removed from us and may become the sorrow of 
 our hearts, which is a good reason why those that <I>have wives</I> 
 should be <I>as though they had none,</I> and those <I>who rejoice</I> 
 in them <I>as though they rejoiced not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:29,30">1 Cor. vii. 29, 30</A>.

 Death is a stroke which the most pious, the most useful, the most
 amiable, are not exempted from.

 (5.) When the desire of our eyes is taken away with a stroke we must 
 see and own the hand of God in it: <I>I take away the desire of thy 
 eyes.</I> He takes our creature-comforts from us when and how he 
 pleases; he gave them to us, but reserved to himself a property in 
 them; and <I>may he not do what he will with his own?</I> 

 (6.) Under afflictions of this kind it is good for us to remember that 
 we are <I>sons of men;</I> for so God calls the prophet here. If thou 
 art a <I>son of Adam,</I> thy wife is a daughter of <I>Eve,</I> and 
 therefore a dying creature. It is an affliction which the children of 
 men are liable to; and <I>shall the earth be forsaken for us?</I> 
 According to this prediction, he tells us

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 <I>I spoke unto the people in the morning;</I> for God sent his 
 prophets, <I>rising up early</I> and sending them; then he thought, if 
 ever, they would be disposed to hearken to him. Observe,

 [1.] Though God had given Ezekiel a certain prospect of this affliction 
 coming upon him, yet it did not take him off from his work, but he 
 resolved to go on in that.

 [2.] We may the more easily bear an affliction if it find us in the way 
 of our duty; for nothing can hurt us, nothing come amiss to us, while 
 we keep ourselves in the love of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He must deny himself the satisfaction of mourning for his wife, 
 which would have been both an honour to her and an ease to the 
 oppression of his own spirit. He must not use the natural expressions 
 of sorrow, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 He must not give vent to his passion by <I>weeping,</I> or letting 
 <I>his tears run down,</I> though tears are a tribute due to the dead, 
 and, when the body is sown, it is fit that it should thus be watered. 
 But Ezekiel is not allowed to do this, though he thought he had as much 
 reason to do it as any man and would perhaps be ill thought of by the 
 people if he did it not. Much less might he use the customary 
 formalities of mourners. He must dress himself in his usual attire, 
 must bind his turban on him, here called the <I>tire of his head,</I> 
 must <I>put on his shoes,</I> and not go barefoot, as was usual in such 
 cases; he must not <I>cover his lips,</I> not throw a veil over his 
 face (as mourners were wont to do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+13:45">Lev. xiii. 45</A>),

 must not be of a <I>sorrowful countenance, appearing unto men to 
 fast,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:18">Matt. vi. 18</A>.

 He must not <I>eat the bread of men,</I> nor expect that his neighbours
 and friends should send him in provisions, as usually they did in such 
 cases, presuming the mourners had no heart to provide meat for 
 themselves; but, if it were sent, he must not eat of it, but go on in 
 his business as at other times. It could not but be greatly against the 
 grain to flesh and blood not to lament the death of one he loved so 
 dearly, but so God commands; and <I>I did in the morning as I was 
 commanded.</I> He appeared in public, in his usual habit, and looked as 
 he used to do, without any signs of mourning.

 (1.) Here there was something peculiar, and Ezekiel, to make himself a 
 sign to the people, must put a force upon himself and exercise an 
 extraordinary piece of self-denial. Note, Our dispositions must always 
 submit to God's directions, and his command must be obeyed even in that 
 which is most difficult and displeasing to us. 

 (2.) Though mourning for the dead be a duty, yet it must always be kept 
 under the government of religion and right reason, and we must not 
 <I>sorrow as those that have no hope,</I> nor lament the loss of any 
 creature, even the most valuable, and that which we could worst spare, 
 as if we had lost our God, or as if all our happiness were gone with 
 it; and, of this moderation in mourning, ministers, when it is their 
 case, ought to be examples. We must at such a time study to improve the 
 affliction, to accommodate ourselves to it, and to get our acquaintance 
 with the other world increased, by the removal of our dear relations, 
 and learn with holy Job <I>to bless the name of the Lord</I> even when 
 he takes as well as when he gives.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The explication and application of this sign. The people enquired 
 the meaning of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us that thou doest 
 so?</I> They knew that Ezekiel was an affectionate husband, that the 
 death of his wife was a great affliction to him, and that he would not 
 appear so unconcerned at it but for some good reason and for 
 instruction to them; and perhaps they were in hopes that it had a 
 favourable signification, and gave them an intimation that God would 
 now comfort them again according to the time he had afflicted them, and 
 make them look pleasant again. Note, When we are enquiring concerning 
 the things of God our enquiry must be, "What are those thing <I>to 
 us?</I> What are we concerned in them? What conviction, what counsel, 
 what comfort, do they speak to us? Wherein do they reach our case?" 
 Ezekiel gives them an answer <I>verbatim--word for word</I> as he had 
 received it from the Lord, who had told him what he must <I>speak to 
 the house of Israel.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Let them know that as Ezekiel's wife was taken from him by a stroke 
 so would God take from them all that which was dearest to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 
 If this was <I>done to the green tree, what shall be done to the 
 dry?</I> If a faithful servant of God was thus afflicted only for his 
 trial, shall such a generation of rebels against God go unpunished? By 
 this awakening providence God showed that he was in earnest in his 
 threatenings, and inexorable. We may suppose that Ezekiel prayed that, 
 if it were the will of God, his wife might be spared to him, but God 
 would not hear him; and should he be heard then in his intercessions 
 for this provoking people? No, it is determined: <I>God will take away 
 the desire of your eyes.</I> Note, The removal of the comforts of 
 others should awaken us to think of parting with ours too; for <I>are 
 we better than they?</I> We know not how soon the same cup, or a more 
 bitter one, may be put into our hands, and should therefore weep with 
 those that weep, as being ourselves also in the body. God will <I>take 
 away that which their soul pities,</I> that is, of which they say, What 
 a pity is it that it should be cut off and destroyed! That <I>for which 
 your souls are afraid</I> (so some read it); you shall lose that which 
 you most dread the loss of. And what is that? 

 (1.) That which was their public pride, the temple: "<I>I will profane 
 my sanctuary,</I> by giving that into the enemy's hand, to be plundered 
 and burnt." This was signified by the death of a wife, a dear wife, to 
 teach us that God's sanctuary should be dearer to us, and more <I>the 
 desire of our eyes,</I> than any creature-comfort whatsoever. Christ's 
 church, that is his spouse, should be ours too. Though this people were 
 very corrupt, and had themselves profaned the sanctuary, yet it is 
 called <I>the desire of their eyes.</I> Note, Many that are destitute 
 of <I>the power of godliness</I> are yet very fond of <I>the form</I> 
 of it; and it is just with God to punish them for their hypocrisy by 
 depriving them of that too. The sanctuary is here called the
 <I>excellency of their strength;</I> they had many strong-holds and 
 places of defence, but the temple excelled them all. It was the 
 <I>pride of their strength;</I> they prided in it as their strength 
 that they were <I>the temple of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:4">Jer. vii. 4</A>.

 Note, The church-privileges that men are proud of are profaned by their
 sins, and it is just with God to profane them by his judgments. And 
 with these God will take away,

 (2.) That which was their family-pleasure, which they looked upon with 
 delight: "<I>Your sons and your daughters</I> (which are the dearer to 
 you because they are but few left of many, the rest having perished by 
 famine and pestilence) shall <I>fall by the sword</I> of the 
 Chaldeans." What a dreadful spectacle would it be to see their own 
 children, pieces, pictures, of themselves, whom they had taken such 
 care and pains to bring up, and whom they loved as their own souls, 
 sacrificed to the rage of the merciless conquerors! This, this, was the 
 punishment of sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Let them know that as Ezekiel wept not for his affliction so neither 
 should they weep for theirs. He must say, <I>You shall do as I have 
 done,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 <I>You shall not mourn nor weep,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Jeremiah had told them the same, that men <I>shall not lament for the 
 dead nor cut themselves</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:6">Jer. xvi. 6</A>);

 not that there shall be any such merciful circumstance without, or any
 such degrees of wisdom and grace within, as shall mitigate and moderate 
 the sorrow; but they <I>shall not mourn,</I> for,

 (1.) Their grief shall be so great that they shall be quite overwhelmed 
 with it; their passions shall stifle them, and they shall have no power 
 to ease themselves by giving vent to it. 

 (2.) Their calamities shall come so fast upon them, one upon the neck 
 of another, that by long custom they shall be <I>hardened in their 
 sorrows</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:10">Job vi. 10</A>)

 and perfectly stupefied, and moped (as we say), with them.

 (3.) They shall not dare to express their grief, for fear of being 
 deemed disaffected to the conquerors, who would take their lamentations 
 as an affront and disturbance to their triumphs. 

 (4.) They shall not have hearts, nor time, nor money, wherewith to put 
 themselves in mourning, and accommodate themselves with the ceremonies 
 of grief: "You will be so entirely taken up with solid substantial 
 grief that you will have no room for the shadow of it." 

 (5.) Particular mourners shall not need to distinguish themselves by 
 <I>covering their lips,</I> and laying aside their ornaments, and 
 <I>going barefoot;</I> for it is well known that every body is a 
 mourner. 

 (6.) There shall be none of that sense of their affliction and sorrow 
 for it which would help to bring them to repentance, but that only 
 which shall drive them to despair; so it follows: "<I>You shall pine 
 away for your iniquities,</I> with seared consciences and reprobate 
 minds, and <I>you shall mourn,</I> not to God in prayer and confession 
 of sin, but <I>one towards another,</I>" murmuring, and fretting, and 
 complaining of God, thus making their burden heavier and their wound 
 more grievous, as impatient people do under their afflictions by 
 mingling their own passions with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. An appeal to the event, for the confirmation of all this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):
 
 "<I>When this comes,</I> as it is foretold, when Jerusalem, which is 
 this day besieged, is quite destroyed and laid waste, which now you 
 cannot believe will ever be, <I>then you shall know that I am the Lord 
 God,</I> who have given you this fair warning of it. Then you will 
 remember that Ezekiel was to you a sign." Note, Those who regard not 
 the threatenings of the word when they are preached will be made to 
 remember them when they are executed. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The great desolation which the siege of Jerusalem should end in 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>In that day,</I> that terrible day, when the city shall be broken 
 up, <I>I will take from them,</I> 

 (1.) That which they depended on--<I>their strength,</I> their walls, 
 their treasures, their fortifications, their men of war; none shall 
 stand them in stead. 

 (2.) That which they boasted of--the <I>joy of their glory,</I> that 
 which they looked upon as most their glory, and which they most 
 rejoiced in, the temple of their God and the palaces of their princes. 
 
 (3.) That which they delighted in, which was the <I>desire of their 
 eyes,</I> and on which they <I>set their minds.</I> Note, Carnal people 
 set their minds upon that on which they can set their eyes; they look 
 at, and dote upon, <I>the things that are seen;</I> and it is their 
 folly to <I>set their minds</I> upon that which they have no assurance 
 of and which may be taken from them in a moment,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:5">Prov. xxiii. 5</A>.

 <I>Their sons and their daughters</I> were all this--<I>their strength, 
 and joy, and glory;</I> and these shall go into captivity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The notice that should be brought to the prophet, not be revelation, 
 as the notice of the siege was brought to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 but in an ordinary way 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 "<I>He that escapes in that day</I> shall, by a special direction of 
 Providence, <I>come to thee,</I> to bring thee intelligence of it," 
 which we find was done,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:21"><I>ch.</I> xxxiii. 21</A>.

 The ill-news came slowly, and yet to Ezekiel and his fellow-captives it
 came too soon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The divine impression which he should be under upon receiving that 
 notice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Whereas, from this time to that, Ezekiel was thus far dumb that he 
 prophesied no more against the land of Israel, but against the 
 neighbouring nations, as we shall find in the following chapters, then 
 he shall have orders given him to <I>speak again to the children of his 
 people</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:2,22"><I>ch.</I> xxxiii. 2, 22</A>);

 then <I>his mouth shall be opened.</I> He was suspended from
 prophesying against them in the mean time, because, Jerusalem being 
 besieged, his prophecies could not be sent into the city,--because, 
 when God was speaking so loudly by the rod, there was the less need of 
 speaking by the word,--and because then the accomplishment of his 
 prophecies would be the full confirmation of his mission, and would the 
 more effectually clear the way for him to begin again. It being 
 referred to that issue, that issue must be waited for. Thus Christ 
 forbade his disciples to preach openly that he was Christ till after 
 his resurrection, because that was to be the full proof of it. "But 
 then <I>thou shalt speak</I> with the greater assurance, and the more 
 effectually, either to their conviction or to their confusion." Note, 
 God's prophets are never silenced but for wise and holy ends. And when 
 God gives them the opening of the mouth again (as he will in due time, 
 for even the witnesses that are <I>slain</I> shall <I>arise</I>) it 
 shall appear to have been for his glory that they were for a while 
 silent, that people may the more certainly and fully <I>know</I> that 
 <I>God is the Lord.</I></P>
