 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the close of the foregoing chapter we had a gracious promise of 
 deliverance in Mount Zion and Jerusalem; now this whole chapter is a 
 comment upon that promise, showing what that deliverance shall be, how 
 it shall be wrought by the destruction of the church's enemies, and how 
 it shall be perfected in the everlasting rest and joy of the church. 
 This was in part accomplished in the deliverance of Jerusalem from the 
 attempt that Sennacherib made upon it in Hezekiah's time, and 
 afterwards in the return of the Jews out of their captivity in Babylon, 
 and other deliverances wrought for the Jewish church between that and 
 Christ's coming. But it has a further reference, to the great 
 redemption wrought out for us by Jesus Christ, and the destruction of 
 our spiritual enemies and all their agents, and will have its full 
 accomplishment in the judgment of the great day. Here is a prediction, 
 
 I. Of God's reckoning with the enemies of his people for all the
 injuries and indignities that they had done them, and returning them 
 upon their own head, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>.

 II. Of God's judging all nations when the measure of their iniquity is
 full, and appearing publicly, to the everlasting confusion of all 
 impenitent sinners and the everlasting comfort of all his faithful 
 servants, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:9-17">ver. 9-17</A>.

 III. Of the provision God has made for the refreshment of his people, 
 for their safety and purity, when their enemies shall be made desolate, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:18-21">ver. 18-21</A>.

 These promises were not of private interpretation only, but were 
 written for our learning, "that we, through patience and comfort of 
 this scripture, might have hope."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall
 bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,
 &nbsp; 2 I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into
 the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my
 people and <I>for</I> my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered
 among the nations, and parted my land.
 &nbsp; 3 And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy
 for a harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink.
 &nbsp; 4 Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and
 all the coasts of Palestine? will ye render me a recompence? and
 if ye recompense me, swiftly <I>and</I> speedily will I return your
 recompence upon your own head;
 &nbsp; 5 Because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried
 into your temples my goodly pleasant things:
 &nbsp; 6 The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have
 ye sold unto the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from
 their border.
 &nbsp; 7 Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have
 sold them, and will return your recompence upon your own head:
 &nbsp; 8 And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of
 the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans,
 to a people far off: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath spoken <I>it.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have often heard of the <I>year of the redeemed,</I> and the <I>year 
 of recompences for the controversy of Zion;</I> now here we have a 
 description of the transactions of that year, and a prophecy of what 
 shall be done when it comes, whenever it comes, for it comes often, and 
 at the end of time it will come once for all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It shall be the <I>year of the redeemed,</I> for God will <I>bring 
 again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Though the bondage of God's people may be grievous and very long, yet 
 it shall not be everlasting. That in Egypt ended at length in their 
 deliverance into the glorious liberty of the children of God. <I>Let my 
 son go, the he may serve me.</I> That in Babylon shall likewise end 
 well. And the Lord Jesus will provide for the effectual redemption of 
 poor enslaved souls from under the dominion of sin and Satan, and will 
 proclaim that <I>acceptable year,</I> the year of jubilee, the release 
 of debts and servants, and the <I>opening of the prison to those that 
 were bound.</I> There is a day, there is a time, fixed for the 
 <I>bringing again of the captivity</I> of God's children, for the 
 redeeming of them <I>from the power of the grave;</I> and it shall be 
 the <I>last day</I> and the end of all time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It shall be the <I>year of recompences for the controversy of 
 Zion.</I> Though God may suffer the enemies of his people to prevail 
 against them very far and for a long time, yet he will call them to an 
 account for it, and will lead captivity captive 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:18">Ps. lxviii. 18</A>),

 will lead those captive that led his people captive,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:10">Rev. xiii. 10</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Who those are that shall be reckoned with--<I>all nations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 This intimates, 

 (1.) That all the nations had made themselves liable to the judgment of 
 God for wrong done to his people. Persecution is the reigning crying 
 sin of the world; that <I>lying in wickedness</I> itself is set against 
 godliness. The enmity that is in the old serpent, <I>the god of this 
 world,</I> against the seed of the woman, appears more or less in the 
 <I>children of this world. Marvel not if the world hate you.</I> 

 (2.) That, whatsoever nation injured God's nation, they should not go
 unpunished; for he that touches the Israel of God shall be made to know 
 that he touches the apple of his eye. Jerusalem will be a <I>burdensome 
 stone to all people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:3">Zech. xii. 3</A>.

 But the neighboring nations shall be particularly reckoned
 with--<I>Tyre, and Sidon, and all the coasts of Palestine,</I> or the 
 Philistines, who have been troublesome neighbours to the Israel of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 When the more remote and potent nations that laid Israel wastes are 
 reckoned with the impotent malice of those that lay near them, and 
 <I>helped forward the affliction,</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:15">Zech. i. 15</A>),

 and made a hand of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:2">Ezek. xxvi. 2</A>),

 shall not be passed by. Note, Little persecutors shall be called to an
 account as well as great ones; and, though they could not do much 
 mischief, shall be reckoned with according to the <I>wickedness of 
 their endeavors</I> and the mischief they would have done.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The sitting of this court for judgment. They shall all be 
 <I>gathered</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 that those who have combined together against God's people, <I>with one 
 consent</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:5">Ps. lxxxiii. 5</A>),

 may together receive their doom. They shall be <I>brought down into the 
 valley of Jehoshaphat,</I> which lay near Jerusalem, and there <I>God 
 will plead with them,</I> 

 (1.) Because it is fit that criminals should be tried in the same
 country where they did the fact.

 (2.) For their greater confusion, when they shall see that Jerusalem 
 which they have so long endeavored and hoped for the ruin of, in spite 
 of all their rage, made a <I>praise in the earth.</I>

 (3.) For the greater comfort and honor of God's Jerusalem, which shall
 see God pleading their cause.

 (4.) Then shall be re-acted what God did for Jehoshaphat when he gave
 him victory over those that invaded him, and furnished him and his 
 people with matter of joy and praise, in the <I>valley of Berachah.</I> 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+20:26">2 Chron. xx. 26</A>.

 (5.) It was in this valley of Jehoshaphat (as Dr. Lightfoot suggests)
 that Sennacherib's army, or part of it, lay, when it was destroyed by 
 an angel. They came together to ruin Jerusalem, but God brought them 
 together for their own ruin, <I>as sheaves into the floor,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+4:12">Mic. iv. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The plaintiff called, on whose behalf this prosecution is set on 
 foot; it is for <I>my people,</I> and <I>for my heritage Israel.</I> It 
 is their cause that God will now plead with jealousy. Note, God's 
 people are <I>his heritage,</I> his <I>peculiar,</I> his 
 <I>portion,</I> his <I>treasure,</I> above all people, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:5,De+32:9">Exod. xix. 5; Deut. xxxii. 9</A>.

 They are his demesne, and therefore he has a good action against those
 that trespass upon them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The charge exhibited against them, which is very particular. Many 
 affronts they had put upon God by their idolatries, but that for which 
 God has a quarrel with them is the affront they have put upon his 
 people and upon the vessels of his sanctuary.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They had been very abusive to the people of Israel, had 
 <I>scattered them among the nations</I> and forced them to seek for 
 shelter where they could find a place, or carried them captive into 
 their respective countries and there industriously dispersed them, for 
 fear of their incorporating for their common safety. They <I>parted 
 their land,</I> and took every one his share of it as their own; nay, 
 they have <I>cast lots for my people,</I> and <I>sold them.</I> When 
 they had taken them prisoners, 

 [1.] They made a jest of them, made a scorn of them as of no value. 
 They would not release them and yet thought them not worth the keeping; 
 they made nothing of playing them away at dice. Or they made a dividend 
 of the prisoners <I>by lot,</I> as the soldiers did of Christ's 
 garments.

 [2.] They made a gain of them. When they had them they <I>sold</I> 
 them, yet with so much contempt that they did <I>not increase their 
 wealth by their price,</I> but sold them for their pleasure rather than 
 their profit; they <I>gave a boy</I> taken in war for the <I>hire of a 
 harlot,</I> and <I>a girl</I> for so many bottles of wine as would 
 serve them for one sitting, a <I>goodly price</I> at which they valued 
 them, and goodly preferment for a son and daughter of Israel to be a 
 slave and a drudge in a tavern or a brothel. Observe, here, how that 
 which is got by sin is commonly spent upon another. The spoil which 
 these enemies of the Jews gathered by injustice and violence they 
 scattered and threw away in drinking and whoring; such is frequently 
 the character, and such the conversation, of the enemies and 
 persecutors of the people of God. The Tyrians and Philistines, when 
 they seized any of the children of Judah and Jerusalem, either took 
 them prisoners in war or kidnapped them, they sold them to the Grecians 
 (with whom the men of Tyre traded in the <I>persons of men,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:13">Ezek. xxvii. 13</A>),

 that they <I>might remove them far from their</I> own <I>border,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 It was a great reproach to Israel, God's first-born, his free-born, to 
 be thus bought and sold among the heathen.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They had unjustly seized <I>God's silver and gold</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 by which some understand the wealth of Israel. The silver and gold 
 which God's people had he calls his, because they had received it from 
 him and devoted it to him; and whosoever robbed them God took it as if 
 they had robbed him and would make reprisals accordingly. Those who 
 take away the estates of good men for well-doing will be found guilty 
 of sacrilege; they take God's <I>silver and gold.</I> But it seems 
 rather to be meant of the <I>vessels</I> and <I>treasures of the 
 temple,</I> which God here calls his <I>goodly pleasant things,</I> 
 precious and desirable to him and all that are his. These they 
 <I>carried into their temples</I> as trophies of their victory over 
 God's Israel, thinking that therein they triumphed over Israel's God, 
 nay, and that their idols triumphed over him. Thus the ark was put in 
 Dagon's temple. Thus they did unjustly. "<I>What have you to do with 
 me</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 with my people; what wrong have they done you? What provocation have
 they given you? You had nothing to do with them, and yet you do all 
 this against them. Devices are devised against the <I>quiet in the 
 land,</I> and those offended and harmed that are harmless and 
 inoffensive: <I>Will you render me a recompence?</I>" Can they pretend 
 that either God or his people have done them any injury, for which they 
 may justify themselves by the law of retaliation in doing them these 
 mischiefs? No; they have no colour for it. Note, It is no new thing for 
 those who have been very civil and obliging to their neighbours to find 
 them very unkind and unneighbourly and for those who do no injuries to 
 suffer many.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The sentence passed upon them. In general 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 "If <I>you recompense me,</I> if you pretend a quarrel with me, if you 
 provoke me thus to jealousy, if you touch the apple of my eye, <I>I 
 will swiftly and speedily return your recompence upon your own 
 head.</I>" Those that contend with God will find themselves unable to 
 make their part good with him. He will recompense them <I>suddenly,</I> 
 when they little think of it, and have not time to prevent it; if he 
 take them to task, he will soon effect their ruin. Particularly, it is 
 threatened, 

 (1.) That they should not gain their end in the mischief they designed
 against God's people. They thought to <I>remove them so far from their 
 border</I> that they should never return to it again,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 But (says God) "<I>I will raise them out of the place whither you have 
 sold them,</I> and they shall not, as you intended, be buried alive 
 there." Men's selling the people of God will not deprive him of his 
 property in them. 

 (2.) That they shall be paid in their own coin, as Adonibezek was 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hands of the 
 children of Judah;</I> you shall lie as much at their mercy as they 
 have been at yours," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:14">Isa. lx. 14</A>.

 Thus the Jews <I>had rule over those that hated them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:1">Esther ix. 1</A>.

 And then they shall justly be <I>sold to the Sabeans,</I> to a
 <I>people far off.</I> This (some think) had its accomplishment in the 
 victories obtained by the Maccabees over the enemies of the Jews; 
 others think it looks as far forward as the last day, when the 
 <I>upright shall have dominion</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:14">Ps. xlix. 14</A>)

 and <I>the saints shall judge the world.</I> It is certain that none
 ever hardened his heart against God, or his church, and prospered long; 
 no, not Pharaoh himself, for <I>the Lord has spoken it,</I> for the 
 comfort of all his suffering servants, that <I>vengeance is his and he 
 will repay.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 What the psalmist had long before ordered to be <I>said among the 
 heathen</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+96:10">Ps. xcvi. 10</A>)

 the prophet here will have in like manner to be published to all
 nations, That <I>the Lord reigns,</I> and that <I>he comes, he comes to 
 judge the earth,</I> as he had long been judging in the earth. The 
 notice here given of God's judging the nations may have reference to 
 the destruction of Sennacherib, Nebuchadnezzar, Antiochus, and to the 
 Antichrist especially, and all the proud enemies of the Christian 
 church; but some of the best interpreters, ancient and modern 
 (particularly the learned Dr. Polock), think the scope of these verses 
 is to set forth the day of the last judgment under the similitude of 
 God's making war upon the enemies of his kingdom, and his gathering in 
 the harvest of the earth, both which similitudes we find used in the 
 Revelation,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:11,Re+14:18"><I>ch.</I> xix. 11; xiv. 18</A>.
 
 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A challenge given to all the enemies of God's kingdom to do their 
 worst. To signify to them that God is preparing war against them, they 
 are called upon to prepare war against him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:9-11"><I>v.</I> 9-11</A>.

 When the hour of God's judgment shall come effectual methods shall be 
 taken to gather all nations <I>to the battle of that great day of God 
 Almighty,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:14,20:8">Rev. xvi. 14; xx. 8</A>.

 It seems to be here spoken ironically: "<I>Proclaim you this among the 
 Gentiles;</I> let all the forces of the nations be summoned to join in 
 confederacy against God and his people." It is like that, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:9">Isa. vii. 9</A>,

 "<I>Associate yourselves, O you people!</I> and <I>gird yourselves,</I> 
 but you shall be <I>broken to pieces.</I> <I>Prepare war;</I> muster up 
 all your strength; <I>wake up the mighty men;</I> call them into your 
 service; excite them to vigilance and resolution; <I>let all the men of 
 war draw near. Let them come</I> and enter the lists with Omnipotence 
 if they dare; let them not complain for want of weapons, but let them 
 <I>beat their ploughshares into swords</I> and their <I>pruning-hooks 
 into spears.</I> Let them resolve, if they will, never to return to 
 their husbandry again, but either to conquer or die; let none plead 
 unfitness to bear arms, but <I>let the weak say, I am strong</I> and 
 will venture into the field of battle." Thus does a God of almighty 
 power bid defiance to all the opposition of the powers of darkness; let 
 the <I>heathen rage,</I> and the <I>kings of the earth take counsel 
 together, against the Lord and his Christ;</I> let them <I>assemble, 
 and come,</I> and <I>gather themselves together;</I> but he that sits 
 in heaven shall laugh at them, and, while he thus calls them, he has 
 them in derision, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1,4">Ps. ii. 1, 4</A>.

 The heathen must be wakened, must be raised from the dead, that they
 may <I>come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat,</I> to receive their doom

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 may come up out of their graves, come up <I>into the air,</I> to meet 
 the Lord there. Jehoshaphat signifies <I>the judgment of the Lord.</I>
 Let them come to the place of God's judgment, which perhaps is the 
 chief reason for the using of this name here, but it is put together as 
 a proper name for the sake of allusions to the place so called, which 
 we observed before; let them come thither where God will <I>sit to 
 judge the heathen,</I> to that <I>throne of glory</I> before which 
 shall be <I>gathered all nations</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:32">Matt. xxv. 32</A>),

 for before the judgment-seat of Christ <I>we must all appear.</I> The
 challenge

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)
 
 is turned into a summons, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 It is not only, <I>Come if you dare,</I> but <I>You shall come</I> 
 whether you will or no, for there is no escaping the judgments of 
 God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A charge given to the ministers of God's justice to appear and act 
 against these daring enemies of his kingdom among men: And therefore 
 <I>cause thy mighty ones to come down, O Lord!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 When they bring their forces into the field, let God bring his, let the 
 archangel's trumpet sound a charge, to call together his <I>mighty 
 ones,</I> that is, his angels. Perhaps it is with reference to this 
 that Christ's coming from heaven at the last day is said to be <I>with 
 his mighty angels,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+1:7">2 Thess. i. 7</A>.

 These are the <I>hosts of the Lord,</I> that shall fight his battles
 when he shall put down all opposing rule, principality, and power when 
 he shall <I>judge among the heathen,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:6">Ps. cx. 6</A>.
 
 Some think these words
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>),

 <I>Prepare war, wake up the mighty men,</I> are not a challenge to the 
 enemies' hosts, but a charge to God's hosts; let them <I>draw near, and 
 come up.</I> When God's cause is to be pleaded, either by the law or by 
 the sword, he has those ready that shall please it effectually, 
 witnesses ready to appear for him in the court of judgment, soldiers 
 ready to appear for him in the field of battle. They shall <I>beat 
 ploughshares into swords,</I> if need be. However, it is plain that to 
 them the charge in given 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 <I>Put you in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe;</I> that is, 
 <I>their wickedness is great,</I> the measure of it is full, and they 
 are ripe for ruin. Our Saviour has expounded this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:39">Matt. xiii. 39</A>.

 <I>The harvest is the end of the world, and the reapers are the
 angels.</I> And they are commanded to <I>thrust</I> in their <I>sickle. 
 their sharp sickle,</I> and gather in both the <I>harvest</I> and the 
 <I>vintage,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:15,18">Rev. xiv. 15, 18</A>.

 Note, The greatness of men's wickedness makes them ripe for God's 
 judgment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The vast appearance that shall be in that great and solemn day 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>Multitudes, multitudes, in the valley of decision,</I> the same 
 which before was called the <I>valley of Jehoshaphat,</I> or <I>of the 
 judgment of the Lord,</I> for the <I>day of the Lord is near</I> in 
 that valley. Note, 

 1. The judgment-day, that day of the Lord, has all along been looked
 upon, and spoken of, as <I>nigh at hand.</I> Enoch said, <I>Behold, the 
 Lord comes,</I> as if the Judge were then standing before the do or, 
 because it is certain that that day will come and will come according 
 to the appointment, and a <I>thousand years with God are but as one 
 day;</I> things are ripening apace for it; we ought always to be ready 
 for it, because our judgment is at hand.

 2. The day of judgment will be the <I>day of decision,</I> when every
 man's eternal state will be determined, and the controversy that has 
 been long depending between the kingdom of Christ and that of Satan 
 shall be finally decided, and an end put to the struggle. <I>The valley 
 of the distribution of judgment</I> (so the Chaldee), when <I>every man 
 shall receive according to the things done in the body. The valley of 
 threshing</I> (so the margin), carrying on the metaphor of the 
 <I>harvest,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 The proud enemies of God's people will then be crushed and broken to 
 pieces, and made as the <I>dust of the summer threshing-floors.</I> 

 3. Innumerable multitudes will be gathered together to receive their
 final doom in that day, as in the destruction of Gog we read of the 
 valley of <I>Hamon-Gog,</I> and the city of <I>Hamonah</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:15,16">Ezek. xxxix. 15, 16</A>),

 both signifying the <I>multitude</I> of the vanquished enemies; it is
 the word here used, <I>Hamonim, Hamonim,</I> expressed by the way of 
 admiration--O what vast multitudes of sinners will divine justice be 
 glorified in the ruin of at that day! <I>A multitude of living</I>
 (says one of the rabbin) <I>and a multitude of dead,</I> for Christ 
 shall come <I>to judge both the quick and the dead.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The amazing change that shall then be made in the kingdom of nature 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>The sun and moon shall be darkened,</I> as before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:31"><I>ch.</I> ii. 31</A>.

 Their glory and lustre shall be eclipsed by the far greater brightness
 of that glory in which the Judge shall then appear. Nay, they shall
 themselves be set aside in the dissolution of all things; for the 
 damned sinners in hell shall not be allowed their light, for God 
 himself will be <I>their everlasting light,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:19">Isa. lx. 19</A>.

 Those that fall under the wrath of God in that day of wrath shall be
 cut off from all comfort and joy, signified by the darkening not only 
 of sun and moon, but of the stars also.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The different impressions which that day will make upon the children 
 of this world and the children of God, according as it will be to them. 
 
 1. To the wicked it will be a terrible day. <I>The Lord</I> shall then
 speak <I>from Zion and Jerusalem,</I> from the throne of his glory, 
 from heaven, where he manifests himself in a peculiar manner, as 
 sometimes he has done in the <I>glorious high throne of his 
 sanctuary,</I> which yet was but a faint resemblance of the glory of 
 that day. He shall speak <I>from heaven,</I> from <I>the midst</I> of 
 his saints and angels (so some understand it), the holy society of 
 which may be called <I>Zion</I> and <I>Jerusalem;</I> for, when we come 
 to the <I>heavenly Jerusalem,</I> we come to the <I>innumerable company 
 of angels;</I> see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:22">Heb. xii. 22, 25</A>.

 Now is speaking in that day will be to the wicked as <I>roaring,</I>
 terrible as the roaring of a lion (for so the word signifies); he long 
 kept silence, but now <I>our God shall come, and shall not keep 
 silence,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:3,21">Ps. l. 3, 21</A>.

 Note, The judgment of the great day will make the ears of those to
 tingle that continue the implacable enemies of God's kingdom. God's 
 voice will then <I>shake terribly</I> both <I>heaven and earth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:21">Isa. ii. 21</A>),

 yet <I>once more,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:6,Heb+12:26">Hag. ii. 6; Heb. xii. 26</A>.

 This denotes that the voice of God will in the great day speak such
 terror to the wicked as were enough to put even heaven and earth into a 
 consternation. When God comes to pull down and destroy his enemies, and 
 make them all his footstool, though heaven and earth should stand up in 
 defence of them and undertake their protection, it shall be all in 
 vain. Even they shall shake before him and be an insufficient shelter 
 to those whom he comforts forth to contend with. Note, As blessings out 
 of Zion are the sweetest blessings, and enough to make heaven and earth 
 sing, so terrors out of Zion are the sorest terrors, and enough to make 
 heaven and earth shake.

 2. To the righteous it will be a joyful day. When the heaven and earth
 shall tremble, and be dissolved and burnt up, then will the Lord be the 
 <I>hope of his people</I> and the <I>strength of the children of 
 Israel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 and <I>then shall Jerusalem be holy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 The saints are the Israel of God; they are <I>his people;</I> the 
 church is his Jerusalem. They are in covenant and communion with him;
 now in the great day, 

 (1.) Their longings shall be satisfied: <I>The Lord will be the hope of
 his people.</I> As he always was the founder and foundation of their 
 hopes, so he then will be the crown of their hopes. He will be the 
 <I>harbour</I> of his people (so the word is), their receptacle, 
 refuge, and home. The saints in the great day shall arrive at the 
 desired haven, shall put to shore after a stormy voyage; they shall go 
 to be for ever at home with God, to their Father's house, the house 
 <I>not made with hands.</I>

 (2.) Their happiness shall be confirmed. God will be in that day the
 <I>strength of the children of Israel,</I> enabling them to bid that 
 day welcome and to bear up under the weight of its glories and joys. In 
 this world, when the judgments of God are abroad, and sinners are 
 falling under them, God is and will be the hope and strength of his 
 people, the strength of their heart, and their portion, when other 
 men's hearts fail them for fear.

 (3.) Their holiness shall be completed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>Then shall Jerusalem be holy,</I> the <I>holy city</I> indeed; such 
 shall the heavenly Jerusalem be, such the glorious church, <I>without 
 spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing. Jerusalem shall be holiness</I> 
 (so the word is); it shall be perfectly holy; there shall be no 
 remainder of sin in it. The gospel-church is a holy society, even in 
 its militant state, but will never be holiness itself till it comes to 
 be triumphant. Then <I>no stranger shall pass through her any more;</I> 
 there shall not enter into the New Jerusalem any thing that defiles or 
 works iniquity; none shall be there but those who have a right to be 
 there, none but its own citizens; for it shall be an unmixed society. 
 
 (4.) God shall in all this be manifested and magnified: <I>So shall you
 know that I am the Lord your God.</I> By the sanctifying and glorifying 
 of the church God will be known in his holiness and glory, as the God 
 that dwells in his holy mountain and makes it holy by dwelling in it; 
 and those that are sanctified and glorified are so <I>through the 
 knowledge of him</I> that called them. The knowledge which true 
 believers have of God is, 

 [1.] An appropriating knowledge. They know that he is <I>the Lord their 
 God,</I> yet not theirs only, but theirs in common with the whole 
 church, that he is their God, but <I>dwelling in Zion his holy 
 mountain;</I> for, though faith appropriates, it does not engross or 
 monopolize the privileges of the covenant.

 [2.] It is an experimental knowledge. They shall find him their <I>hope 
 and strength</I> in the worst of times, and so they shall <I>know that 
 he is the Lord their God.</I> Those know best the goodness of God who 
 have tasted and seen it, and have found him good to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>18 And it shall come to pass in that day, <I>that</I> the mountains
 shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and
 all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain
 shall come forth of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and shall water the
 valley of Shittim.
 &nbsp; 19 Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate
 wilderness, for the violence <I>against</I> the children of Judah,
 because they have shed innocent blood in their land.
 &nbsp; 20 But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from
 generation to generation.
 &nbsp; 21 For I will cleanse their blood <I>that</I> I have not cleansed:
 for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> dwelleth in Zion.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These promises with which this prophecy concludes have their
 accomplishments in part in the kingdom of grace, and the comforts and
 graces of all the faithful subjects of that kingdom, but will have
 their full accomplishment in the kingdom of glory; for, as to the
 Jewish church, we know not of any event concerning that which answers
 to the extent of these promises, and what instances of peace and
 prosperity they were blessed with, which they may be supposed to be a
 hyperbolical description of, they were but figures of <I>better
 things</I> reserved <I>for us, that they</I> in their best estate
 <I>without us might not be made perfect.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It is promised that the enemies of the church shall be vanquished 
 and brought down, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Egypt, that old enemy of Israel, and Edom, which had an inveterate 
 enmity to Israel, derived from Esau, these <I>shall be a 
 desolation,</I> a <I>desolate wilderness,</I> no more to be inhabited; 
 they have become the <I>people of God's curse;</I> so the Idumeans 
 were, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:5">Isa. xxxiv. 5</A>.

 No strength nor wealth of a nation is a defence against the judgment of
 God. But what is the quarrel God has with these potent kingdoms? It is 
 for their <I>violence against the children of Judah,</I> and the 
 injuries they had done them; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:3,8,12,15,26:2">Ezek. xxv. 3, 8, 12, 15; xxvi. 2</A>.

 They had <I>shed</I> the <I>innocent blood</I> of the Jews that fled to
 them for shelter or were making their escape through their country. 
 Note, The innocent blood of God's people is very precious to him, and 
 not a drop of it shall be shed but it shall be reckoned for. In the
 last day this earth, which has been filled with violence against the 
 people of God, shall be made a desolation, when it and all the works 
 that are therein shall be burnt up. And, sooner or later, the 
 oppressors and persecutors of God's Israel shall be brought down and 
 laid in the dust, nay, they will at length be brought down and laid in 
 the flames.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It is promised that the church shall be very happy; and truly happy 
 it is in spiritual privileges, even during its militant state, but much 
 more when it comes to be triumphant. Three things are here promised 
 it:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Purity. This is put last here, as a reason for the rest 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>);

 but we may consider it first, as the ground and foundation of the rest: 
 <I>I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed,</I> that is, 
 their bloody heinous sins, especially shedding innocent blood; that 
 filth and guilt they had contracted by sin, which rendered them unfit 
 for communion with God, and made them odious to his holiness and 
 obnoxious to his justice; this they shall be washed from in the 
 <I>fountain opened,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:1">Zech. xiii. 1</A>.

 That shall be cleansed by the blood of Christ which could not be
 cleansed by the sacrifices and purifications of the ceremonial law. Or, 
 if we apply it to the happiness of a future state, it intimates the 
 cleansing of the saints from all these corruptions from which they were 
 not cleansed either by ordinances or providences in the world; there 
 shall not be the least remains of sin in them there. Here, though they 
 are washing daily, there is still something that is not cleansed; but 
 in heaven, even that also shall be done away. And the reason is 
 because <I>the Lord dwells in Zion,</I> dwells with his church, and 
 much more gloriously with that in heaven, and <I>holiness becomes his 
 house for ever,</I> for which reason, where he dwells there must be, 
 there shall be, a perfection of holiness. Note, Though the refining and 
 reforming of the church is work that goes on slowly, and still there is 
 something we complain of that is <I>not cleansed,</I> yet there is a 
 day coming when every thing that is amiss shall be amended, and the 
 church shall be all fair, and no spot, no stain in her; and we must 
 wait for that day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Plenty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 This is put first, because it is the reverse of the judgment threatened 
 in the foregoing chapters. 

 (1.) The streams of this plenty overflow the land and enrich it: <I>The
 mountains shall drop new wine</I> and <I>the hills shall flow with 
 milk,</I> such great abundance shall they have of suitable provision, 
 both for <I>babes</I> and for <I>strong men.</I> It intimates the 
 abundance of vineyards, and all fruitful; and the abundance of cattle 
 in the pastures that fill them with milk. And, to make the corn-land
 fruitful, the <I>rivers of Judah shall flow with water,</I> so that the 
 country shall be like the garden of Eden, well-watered every where and 
 greatly enriched, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:9">Ps. lxv. 9</A>.

 But this seems to be meant spiritually; the graces and comforts of the
 new covenant are compared to <I>wine and milk</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:1">Isa. lv. 1</A>),

 and the Spirit to <I>rivers of living water,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:38">John vii. 38</A>.

 And these gifts abound much more under the New Testament than they did
 under the Old; when believers receive <I>grace for grace</I> from 
 Christ's fulness, when they are enriched with <I>everlasting 
 consolations,</I> and <I>filled with joy and peace in believing,</I> 
 then <I>the mountains drop new wine,</I> and <I>the hills flow with 
 milk. Drink you,</I> drink abundantly, <I>O beloved!</I> When there is 
 plentiful effusion of the Spirit of grace, then the <I>rivers of Judah 
 flow with water,</I> and make glad, not only <I>the city of our God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:4">Ps. xlvi. 4</A>),

 but the whole land.

 (2.) The fountain of this plenty is in the <I>house of God,</I> whence
 the streams take their rise, as those <I>waters of the sanctuary</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+47:1">Ezek. xlvii. 1</A>)

 from <I>under the threshold of the house,</I> and the river of life
 <I>out of the throne of God and the Lamb,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:1">Rev. xxii. 1</A>.

 The psalmist, speaking of Zion, says, <I>All my springs are in 
 thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+87:7">Ps. lxxxvii. 7</A>.

 Those that take temporal blessings to be meant in the former part of
 the verse, yet by this <I>fountain</I> out of <I>the house of the 
 Lord</I> understand the grace of God, which, if we abound in temporal 
 blessings, we have so much more need of, that we may not abuse them. 
 Christ himself is the fountain; his merit and grace cleanse us, refresh 
 us, and make us fruitful. This is said to water <I>the valley of 
 Shittim,</I> which lay a great way off from the temple at Jerusalem, on 
 the other side of Jordan, and was a dry and barren valley, which 
 intimates that gospel-grace, flowing from Christ, shall reach far, even 
 to the Gentile world, to the most remote regions of it, and shall make 
 those to abound in the fruits of righteousness who had long lain as the 
 barren wilderness. This grace is a fountain overflowing, ever-flowing, 
 from which we may be continually drawing, and yet need not fear its 
 being drawn dry. This fountain comes <I>out of the house of the 
 Lord</I> above, from his temple in heaven, flows all that good which 
 here we are daily tasting the streams of, but hope to be shortly, hope 
 to be eternally, drinking at the fountain-head of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Perpetuity. This crowns all the rest 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>Judah shall dwell for ever</I> (when Egypt and Edom are made <I>a 
 desolation</I>), and Jerusalem shall continue <I>from generation to 
 generation.</I> This is a promise, and a precious promise it is, 

 (1.) That the church of Christ shall continue in the world to the end
 of time. As one generation of professing Christians passes away, 
 another shall come, in whom the <I>throne</I> of Christ <I>shall endure 
 for ever,</I> and <I>the gates of hell shall not prevail</I> against 
 it.

 (2.) That all the living members of that church (Judah and Jerusalem
 are put for the <I>inhabitants</I> of that city and country, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:5">Matt. iii. 5</A>)
 
 shall be established in their happiness to the utmost ages of eternity.
 This new Jerusalem shall be <I>from generation to generation,</I> for 
 it is a city that has foundations, not made with hands, but eternal in
 the heavens.</P>
