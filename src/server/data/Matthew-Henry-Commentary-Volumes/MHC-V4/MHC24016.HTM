 In this chapter, 

 I. The greatness of the calamity that was coming upon the Jewish nation
 is illustrated by prohibitions given to the prophet neither to set up a 
 house of his own 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>)

 nor to go into the house of mourning 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:5-7">ver. 5-7</A>)

 nor into the house of feasting, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:8,9">ver. 8, 9</A>.

 II. God is justified in these severe proceedings against them by an
 account of their great wickedness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:10-13">ver. 10-13</A>.

 III. An intimation is given of mercy in reserve, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:14,15">ver. 14, 15</A>.

 IV. Some hopes are given that the punishment of the sin should prove
 the reformation of the sinners, and that they should return to God at
 length in a way of duty, and so be qualified for his returns to them in 
 a way of favour,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came also unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons
 or daughters in this place.
 &nbsp; 3  For thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> concerning the sons and concerning
 the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their
 mothers that bare them, and concerning their fathers that begat
 them in this land;
 &nbsp; 4  They shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be
 lamented; neither shall they be buried; <I>but</I> they shall be as
 dung upon the face of the earth: and they shall be consumed by
 the sword, and by famine; and their carcases shall be meat for
 the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.
 &nbsp; 5  For thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Enter not into the house of
 mourning, neither go to lament nor bemoan them: for I have taken
 away my peace from this people, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>even</I>
 lovingkindness and mercies.
 &nbsp; 6  Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they
 shall not be buried, neither shall <I>men</I> lament for them, nor cut
 themselves, nor make themselves bald for them:
 &nbsp; 7  Neither shall <I>men</I> tear <I>themselves</I> for them in mourning,
 to comfort them for the dead; neither shall <I>men</I> give them the
 cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.
 &nbsp; 8  Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting, to sit
 with them to eat and to drink.
 &nbsp; 9  For thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold,
 I will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in your
 days, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of
 the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet is here for a sign to the people. They would not regard 
 what he said; let it be tried whether they will regard what he 
 <I>does.</I> In general, he must conduct himself so, in every thing, as 
 became one that expected to see his country in ruins very shortly. This 
 he foretold, but few regarded the prediction; therefore he is to show 
 that he is himself fully satisfied in the truth of it. Others go on in 
 their usual course, but he, in the prospect of these sad times, is 
 forbidden and therefore forbears marriage, mourning for the dead, and 
 mirth. Note, Those that would convince others of and affect them with 
 the word of God must make it appear, even in the most self-denying 
 instances, that they do believe it themselves and are affected with it.
 If we would rouse others out of their security, and persuade them to 
 sit loose to the world, we must ourselves be mortified to present 
 things and show that we expect the dissolution of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Jeremiah must not marry, nor think of having a family and being a 
 housekeeper 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>Thou shalt not take thee a wife,</I> nor think of <I>having sons and 
 daughters in this place,</I> not in the land of Judah, not in 
 Jerusalem, not in Anathoth. The Jews, more than any people, valued
 themselves on their early marriages and their numerous offspring. But 
 Jeremiah must live a bachelor, not so much in honour of virginity as in 
 diminution of it. By this it appears that it was advisable and 
 seasonable only in calamitous times, and times of <I>present 
 distress,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:26">1 Cor. vii. 26</A>.

 That it is so is a part of the calamity. There may be a time when it
 will be said, <I>Blessed is the womb that bears not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:29">Luke xxiii. 29</A>.
 
 When we see such times at hand it is wisdom for all, especially for
 prophets, to keep themselves as much as may be from being <I>entangled 
 with the affairs of this life</I> and encumbered with that which, the 
 dearer it is to them, the more it will be the matter of their care, and 
 fear, and grief, at such a time. The reason here given is because the 
 <I>fathers</I> and <I>mothers, the sons and the daughters, shall die of 
 grievous deaths,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 As for those that have wives and children, 

 1. They will have such a clog upon them that they cannot flee from
 those deaths. A single man may make his escape and shift for his own 
 safety, when he that has a wife and children can neither find means to 
 convey with them nor find in his heart to go and leave them behind him. 

 2. They will be in continual terror for fear of those deaths; and the
 more they have to lose by them the greater will the terror and 
 consternation be when death appears every where in its triumphant pomp 
 and power. 

 3. The death of every child, and the aggravating circumstances of it,
 will be a new death to the parent. Better have no children than have 
 them brought forth and bred up <I>for the murderer</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:13,14">Hos. ix. 13, 14</A>),
 
 than see them live and die in misery. Death is grievous, but some
 deaths are more grievous than others, both to those that die and to 
 their relations that survive them; hence we read of <I>so great a 
 death,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:10">2 Cor. i. 10</A>.

 Two things are used a little to palliate and alleviate the terror of
 death as to this world, and to sugar the bitter pill--bewailing the 
 dead and burying them; but, to make those deaths grievous indeed, these 
 are denied: <I>They shall not be lamented,</I> but shall be carried 
 off, as if all the world were weary of them; nay, they <I>shall not be 
 buried,</I> but left exposed, as if they were designed to be monuments 
 of justice. <I>They shall be a dung upon the face of the earth,</I>
 not only despicable, but detestable, as if they were good for nothing 
 but to manure the ground; being <I>consumed,</I> some <I>by the 
 sword</I> and some <I>by famine, their carcases shall be meat for the 
 fowls of heaven and the beasts of the earth.</I> Will not any one say, 
 "Better be without children than live to see them come to this?" What 
 reason have we to say,<I>All is vanity and vexation of spirit,</I> when 
 those creatures that we expect to be our greatest comforts may prove 
 not only our heaviest cares, but our sorest crosses!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Jeremiah must not go to the house of mourning upon occasion of the 
 death of any of his neighbours or relations 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Enter thou not into the house of mourning.</I> It was usual to 
 condole with those whose relations were dead, to <I>bemoan them,</I> to 
 <I>cut themselves,</I> and <I>make themselves bald,</I> which, it 
 seems, was commonly practised as an expression of mourning, though 
 forbidden by the law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+14:1">Deut. xiv. 1</A>.

 Nay, sometimes, in a passion of grief, they did <I>tear themselves for
 them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>),

 partly in honour of the deceased, thus signifying that they thought 
 there was a great loss of them, and partly in compassion to the 
 surviving relations, to whom the burden will be made the lighter by 
 their having sharers with them in their grief. They used to mourn with 
 them, and so <I>to comfort them for the dead,</I> as Job's friends with 
 him and the Jews with Martha and Mary; and it was a friendly office to 
 <I>give them a cup of consolation to drink,</I> to provide cordials for 
 them and press them earnestly to drink of them for the support of their 
 spirits, give wine to those that are of heavy heart <I>for their father 
 or mother,</I> that it may be some comfort to them to find that, though 
 they have lost their parents, yet they have some friends left that have 
 a concern for them. Thus the usage stood, and it was a laudable usage. 
 It is a good work to others, as well as of good use to ourselves, to 
 <I>go to the house of mourning.</I> It seems, the prophet Jeremiah had 
 been wont to abound in good offices of this kind, and it well became 
 his character both as a pious man and as a prophet; and one would think 
 it should have made him better beloved among his people than it should 
 seem he was. But now God bids him not lament the death of his friends 
 as usual, for 

 1. His sorrow for the destruction of his country in general must
 swallow up his sorrow for particular deaths. His tears must now be 
 turned into another channel; and there is occasion enough for them all.

 2. He had little reason to lament those who died now just before the 
 judgments entered which he saw at the door, but rather to think those 
 happy who were seasonable <I>taken away from the evil to come.</I> 

 3. This was to be a type of what was coming, when there should be such
 universal confusion that all neighbourly friendly offices should be 
 neglected. Men shall be in deaths so often, and even dying daily, that 
 they shall have no time, no room, no heart, for the ceremonies that 
 used to attend death. The sorrows shall be so ponderous as not to admit 
 relief, and every one so full of grief for his own troubles that he 
 shall have no thought of his neighbours. All shall be mourners then, 
 and no comforters; every one will find it enough to bear his own 
 burden; for

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 "<I>I have taken away my peace from this people,</I> put a full period 
 to their prosperity, deprived them of health, wealth, and quiet, and 
 friends, and every thing wherewith they might comfort themselves and 
 one another." Whatever peace we enjoy, it is God's peace; it is his 
 gift, and, <I>if he give quietness, who then can make trouble?</I> But, 
 if we make not a good use of his peace, he can and will take it away; 
 and where are we then? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:29">Job xxxiv. 29</A>.

 "I will take away my peace, <I>even my loving-kindness and
 mercies;</I>" these shall be shut up and restrained, which are the 
 fresh springs from which all their fresh streams flow, and then 
 farewell all good. Note, Those have cut themselves off from all true 
 peace that have thrown themselves out of the favour of God. All is gone 
 when God takes away from us his lovingkindness and his mercies. Then it 
 follows

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 <I>Both the great and the small shall die,</I> even <I>in this 
 land,</I> the land of Canaan, that used to be called the <I>land of the 
 living.</I> God's favour is our life; take away that, and <I>we die, we 
 perish, we all perish.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Jeremiah must not go to the house of mirth, any more than to the 
 house of mourning, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 It had been his custom, and it was innocent enough, when any of his 
 friends made entertainments at their houses and invited him to them, to 
 <I>go and sit with them,</I> not merely to drink, but <I>to eat and to 
 drink,</I> soberly and cheerfully. But now he must not take that 
 liberty, 

 1. Because it was unseasonable, and inconsistent with the providences
 of God in reference to that land and nation. God called aloud to 
 <I>weeping, and mourning, and fasting;</I> he was coming forth against 
 them in his judgments; and it was time for them to <I>humble 
 themselves;</I> and it well became the prophet who gave them the 
 warning to give them an example of taking the warning, and complying 
 with it, and so to make it appear that he did himself believe it.
 Ministers ought to be examples of self-denial and mortification, and to 
 show themselves affected with those terrors of the Lord with which they 
 desire to affect others. And it becomes all the sons of Zion to
 sympathize with her in her afflictions, and not to be merry when she is 
 perplexed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:6">Amos vi. 6</A>.

 2. Because he must thus show the people what sad times were coming upon 
 them. His friends wondered that he would not meet them, as he used to 
 do, in the house of feasting. But he lets them know it was to intimate 
 to them that all their feasting would be at an end shortly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>I will cause to cease the voice of mirth.</I> You shall have 
 nothing to feast on, nothing to rejoice in, but be surrounded with 
 calamities that shall mar your mirth and cast a damp upon it." God can 
 find ways to tame the most jovial. "This shall be done <I>in this 
 place,</I> in Jerusalem, that used to be the <I>joyous city</I> and 
 thought her joys were all secure to her. It shall be done <I>in your 
 eyes,</I> in your sight, to be a vexation to you, who now look so 
 haughty and so merry. It shall be done <I>in your days;</I> you 
 yourselves shall live to see it." The voice of praise they had made to 
 cease by their iniquities and idolatries, and therefore justly God made 
 to cease among them <I>the voice of mirth and gladness.</I> The voice 
 of God's prophets was not heard, was not heeded, among them, and 
 therefore no longer shall <I>the voice of the bridegroom and of the 
 bride,</I> of the songs that used to grace the nuptials, be heard among 
 them. See

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew this people
 all these words, and they shall say unto thee, Wherefore hath the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> pronounced all this great evil against us? or what <I>is</I> our
 iniquity? or what <I>is</I> our sin that we have committed against the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God?
 &nbsp; 11  Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have
 forsaken me, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and have walked after other gods,
 and have served them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken
 me, and have not kept my law;
 &nbsp; 12  And ye have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye
 walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart, that they
 may not hearken unto me:
 &nbsp; 13  Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that
 ye know not, <I>neither</I> ye nor your fathers; and there shall ye
 serve other gods day and night; where I will not shew you favour.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. An enquiry made into the reasons why God would bring those judgments 
 upon them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>When thou shalt show this people all these words,</I> the words of 
 this curse, they will say unto thee, <I>Wherefore has the Lord 
 pronounced all this great evil against us?</I> One would hope that 
 there were some among them that asked this question with a humble 
 penitent heart, desiring to know what was the sin for which God 
 contended with them, that they might cast it away and prevent the 
 judgment: "Show us the Jonah that raises the storm and we will throw it 
 overboard." But it seems here to be the language of those who 
 quarrelled at the word of God, and challenged him to show what they had 
 done which might deserve so severe a punishment: "<I>What is our 
 iniquity? Or what is our sin?</I> What crime have we even been guilty 
 of, proportionable to such a sentence?" Instead of humbling and 
 condemning themselves, they stand upon their own justification and 
 insinuate that God did them wrong in pronouncing this evil against 
 them, that he <I>laid upon them more than was right,</I> and that they 
 had reason to <I>enter into judgment with God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:23">Job xxxiv. 23</A>.

 Note, It is amazing to see how hardly sinners are brought to justify
 God and judge themselves when they are in trouble, and to own the 
 iniquity and the sin that have procured them the trouble.

 2. A plain and full answer given to this enquiry. Do they ask the 
 prophet why, and for what reason, God is thus angry with them? He shall 
 not stop their mouths by telling them that they may be sure there is a 
 sufficient reason, the righteous God is never <I>angry without 
 cause,</I> without good cause; but he must tell them particularly what 
 is the cause, that they may be convinced and humbled, or at least that 
 God may be justified. Let them know then,

 (1.) That God visited upon them the iniquities of their fathers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>Your fathers have forsaken me, and have not kept my law.</I> They 
 shook off divine institutions and grew weary of them (they thought them 
 too plain, too mean), and then they <I>walked after other gods,</I> 
 whose worship was more gay and pompous; and, being fond of variety and 
 novelty, they <I>served them and worshipped them;</I> and this was the 
 sin which God had said, in the second commandment, he would <I>visit 
 upon their children,</I> who kept up these idolatrous usages, because 
 they received them <I>by tradition from their fathers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:18">1 Pet. i. 18</A>.
 
 (2.) That God reckoned with them for their own iniquities
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 "You have made your fathers' sin your own, and have become obnoxious to 
 the punishment which in their days was deferred, for <I>you have done 
 worse than your fathers.</I>" If they had made a good use of their 
 fathers' reprieve, and had been led by the patience of God to 
 repentance, they would have fared the better for it and the judgment 
 would have been prevented, the reprieve turned into a national pardon; 
 but, making an ill use of it, and being hardened by it in their sins, 
 they fared the worse for it, and, the reprieve having expired, an 
 addition was made to the sentence and it was executed with the more 
 severity. They were more impudent and obstinate in sin than their 
 fathers, <I>walked every one after the imagination of his own 
 heart,</I> made that their guide and rule and were resolved to follow 
 that, on purpose <I>that they might not hearken to God</I> and his 
 prophets. They designedly suffered their own lusts and passions to be 
 noisy, that they might drown the voice of their consciences. No wonder 
 then that God has taken up this resolution concerning them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):
 
 "<I>I will cast you out of this land,</I> this land of light, this 
 valley of vision. Since you will not hearken to me, you shall not hear 
 me; you shall be hurried away, not into a neighbouring country which 
 you have formerly had some acquaintance and correspondence with, but 
 into a far country, <I>a land that you know not, neither you nor your 
 fathers,</I> in which you have no interest, nor can expect to meet with 
 any comfortable society, to be an allay to your misery." Justly were 
 those banished into a strange land who doted upon strange gods, which 
 neither they nor their fathers knew, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:17">Deut. xxxii. 17</A>.

 Two things would make their case there very miserable, and both of them
 relate to the soul, the better part; the greatest calamities of their 
 captivity were those which affected that and debarred that from its 
 bliss.

 [1.] "It is the happiness of the soul to be employed in the service of 
 God; but <I>there shall you serve other gods day and night;</I> that 
 is, you shall be in continual temptation to serve them and perhaps 
 compelled to do it by your cruel task-masters; and, when you are forced 
 to worship idols, you will be as sick of such worship as ever you were 
 fond of it when it was forbidden you by your godly kings." See how God 
 often makes men's sin their punishment, and <I>fills the backslider in 
 heart with his own ways.</I> "You shall have no public worship at all 
 but the worship of idols, and then you will think with regret how you 
 slighted the worship of the true God." 

 [2.] "It is the happiness of the soul to have some tokens of the 
 lovingkindness of God, but you shall go to a strange land, <I>where I 
 will not show you favour.</I>" If they had had God's favour, that would 
 have made even the land of their captivity a pleasant land; but, if 
 they lie under his wrath, the yoke of their oppression will be 
 intolerable to them.</P>

 profit.
 &nbsp; 20  Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they <I>are</I> no gods?
 &nbsp; 21  Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I

 There is a mixture of mercy and judgment in these verses, and it is 
 hard to know to which to apply some of the passages here--they are so
 interwoven, and some seem to look as far forward as the times of the 
 gospel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God will certainly execute judgment upon them for their idolatries. 
 Let them expect it, for the decree has gone forth. 

 1. God sees all their sins, though they commit them ever so secretly
 and palliate them ever so artfully

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>My eyes are upon all their ways.</I> They have not their eye upon 
 God, have no regard to him, stand in no awe of him; but he has his eye 
 upon them; neither they nor their sins are <I>hidden from his face, 
 from his eyes.</I> Note, None of the sins of sinners either can be 
 concealed from God or shall be overlooked by him, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:21,Job+34:21,Ps+90:8">Prov. v. 21; Job xxxiv. 21; Ps. xc. 8</A>.

 2. God is highly displeased, particularly at their idolatries, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.
 
 As his omniscience convicts them, so his justice condemns them: <I>I 
 will recompense their iniquity and their sin double,</I> not double to 
 what it deserves, but double to what they expect and to what I have 
 done formerly. Or I will recompense it <I>abundantly;</I> they shall 
 now pay for their long reprieve and the divine patience they have 
 abused. The sin for which God has a controversy with them is their
 having <I>defiled God's land</I> with their idolatries, and not only 
 alienated that which he was entitled to as his inheritance, but 
 polluted that which he dwelt in with delight as his inheritance, and 
 made it offensive to him <I>with the carcases of their detestable 
 things,</I> the gods themselves which they worshipped, the images of 
 which, though they were of gold and silver, were as loathsome to God as 
 the putrid carcases of men or beasts are to us. Idols are <I>carcases
 of detestable things.</I> God hates them, and so should we. Or he might 
 refer to the sacrifices which they offered to these idols, with which 
 <I>the land was filled;</I> for they had high places in all the coasts 
 and corners of it. This was the sin which, above any other, incensed 
 God against them. 

 3. He will find out and raise up instruments of his wrath, that shall
 <I>cast them out of their land,</I> according to the sentence passed 
 upon them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>I will send for many fishers and many hunters</I>--the Chaldean 
 army, that shall have many ways of ensnaring and destroying them, by 
 fraud as fishers, by force as hunters. They shall find them out 
 wherever they are, and shall chase and closely pursue them, to their 
 ruin. They shall discover them wherever they are hid, in <I>hills</I> 
 or <I>mountains,</I> or <I>holes of the rocks,</I> and shall drive them 
 out. God has various ways of prosecuting a people with his judgments 
 that avoid the convictions of his word. He has men at command fit for 
 his purpose; he has them within call, and can send for them when he 
 pleases. 

 4. Their bondage in Babylon shall be sorer and much more grievous than 
 that in Egypt, their task-masters more cruel, and their lives made more 
 bitter. This is implied in the promise

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>),
 
 that their deliverance out of Babylon shall be more illustrious in 
 itself, and more welcome to them, than that out of Egypt. Their slavery 
 in Egypt came upon them gradually and almost insensibly; that in 
 Babylon came upon them at once and with all the aggravating 
 circumstances of terror. In Egypt they had a Goshen of their own, but 
 none such in Babylon. In Egypt they were used as servants that were 
 useful, in Babylon as captives that had been hateful. 

 5. They shall be warned, and God shall be glorified, by these judgments
 brought upon them. These judgments have a voice, and speak aloud,

 (1.) Instruction to them. When God chastens them he teaches them. By 
 this rod God expostulates with them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 "<I>Shall a man make gods to himself?</I> Will any man be so perfectly 
 void of all reason and consideration as to think that a god of his own 
 making can stand him in any stead? Will you ever again be such fools as 
 you have been, to make to yourselves gods which are no gods, when you 
 have a God whom you may call your own, who made you, and is himself the 
 true and living God?" 

 (2.) Honour to God; for he will be known by the judgments which he 
 executes. He will first recompense their iniquity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),
 
 and then he will <I>this once</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>)--

 this once for all, not by many interruptions of their peace, but this 
 one desolation and destruction of it. "For <I>this once,</I> and no 
 more, <I>I will cause them to know my hand,</I> the length and weight 
 of my punishing hand, how far it can reach and how deeply it can wound. 
 <I>And they shall know that my name is Jehovah,</I> a God with whom 
 there is no contending, who gives being to threatenings and puts life 
 into them as well as promises."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Yet he has mercy in store for them, intimations of which come in 
 here for the encouragement of the prophet himself and of those few 
 among them that tremble at God's word. It was said, with an air of 
 severity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 that God would banish them into a strange land; but, that thereby they 
 might not be driven to despair, there follow immediately words of 
 comfort.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>The days will come,</I> the joyful days, when the same hand that 
 dispersed them shall gather them again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 They are cast out, but they are not cast off, they are not cast away. 
 They shall be <I>brought up from the land of the north,</I> the land of 
 their captivity, where they are held with a strong hand, <I>and from 
 all the lands whither they are driven,</I> and where they seemed to be 
 lost and buried in the crowd; nay, <I>I will bring them again into 
 their own land,</I> and settle them there. As he foregoing threatenings 
 agreed with what was written in this law, so does this promise. <I>Yet 
 will I not cast them away,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:44">Lev. xxvi. 44</A>.

 <I>Thence will the Lord thy God gather thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:4">Deut. xxx. 4</A>.

 And the following words 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 may be understood as a promise; God will send for fishers and hunters, 
 the Medes and Persians, that shall find them out in the countries where 
 they are scattered, and send them back to their own land; or 
 Zerubbabel, and others of their own nation, who should fish them out 
 and hunt after them, to persuade them to return; or whatever 
 instruments the Spirit of God made use of to <I>stir up their spirits 
 to go up,</I> which at first they were backward to do. They began to
 nestle in Babylon; but, <I>as an eagle stirs up her nest and flutters 
 over her young,</I> so God did by them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:7">Zech. ii. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Their deliverance out of Babylon should, upon some accounts, be more 
 illustrious and memorable than their deliverance out of Egypt was. Both 
 were the Lord's doing and marvellous in their eyes; both were proofs 
 that the Lord liveth and were to be kept in everlasting remembrance, to 
 his honour, as the living God; but the fresh mercy shall be so 
 surprising, so welcome, that it shall even abolish the memory of the 
 former. Not but that new mercies should put us in mind of old ones, and 
 give us occasion to renew our thanksgivings for them; yet because we 
 are tempted to think that the former days were better than these, and 
 to ask, <I>Where are all the wonders that our fathers told us of?</I> 
 as if God's <I>arm</I> had <I>waxed short,</I> and to cry up the age of 
 miracles above the later ages, when mercies are wrought in a way of 
 common providence, therefore we are allowed here comparatively to 
 forget the bringing of Israel out of Egypt as a deliverance outdone by 
 that out of Babylon. That was done <I>by might and power,</I> this 
 <I>by the Spirit of the Lord of hosts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:6">Zech. iv. 6</A>.

 In this there was more of pardoning mercy (the most glorious branch of
 divine mercy) than in that; for their captivity in Babylon had more in 
 it of the punishment of sin than their bondage in Egypt; and therefore 
 that which comforts Zion in her deliverance out of Babylon is this, 
 that <I>her iniquity is pardoned,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:2">Isa. xl. 2</A>.

 Note, God glorifies himself, and we must glorify him, in those mercies
 that have no miracles in them, as well as in those that have. And, 
 though the favours of God to our fathers must not be forgotten, yet 
 those to ourselves in our own day we must especially give thanks 
 for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Their deliverance out of captivity shall be accompanied with a 
 blessed reformation, and they shall return effectually cured of their 
 inclination to idolatry, which will complete their deliverance and make 
 it a mercy indeed. They had defiled their own land with their 
 <I>detestable things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 But, when they have smarted for so doing, they shall come and humble 
 themselves before God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:19-21"><I>v.</I> 19-21</A>.

 (1.) They shall be brought to acknowledge that their God only is God 
 indeed, for he is a God in need--<I>"My strength</I> to support and 
 comfort me, <I>my fortress</I> to protect and shelter me, <I>and my 
 refuge</I> to whom I may flee <I>in the day of affliction.</I>" Note, 
 Need drives many to God who had set themselves at a distance from him. 
 Those that slighted him in the day of their prosperity will be glad to 
 flee to him in the day of their affliction. 

 (2.) They shall be quickened to return to him by the conversion of the 
 Gentiles: <I>The Gentiles shall come to thee from the ends of the 
 earth;</I> and therefore shall not we come? Or, "The Jews, who had by
 their idolatries made themselves as Gentiles (so I rather understand 
 it), <I>shall come to thee</I> by repentance and reformation, shall 
 return to their duty and allegiance, even <I>from the ends of the 
 earth,</I> from all the countries whither they were driven." The 
 prophet comforts himself with the hope of this, and in a transport of 
 joy returns to God the notice he had given him of it: "<I>O Lord! my 
 strength and my fortress,</I> I am now easy, since thou hast given me a 
 prospect of multitudes that shall <I>come to thee from the ends of the 
 earth,</I> both of Jewish converts and of Gentile proselytes." Note, 
 Those that are brought to God themselves cannot but rejoice greatly to 
 see others coming to him, coming back to him. 

 (3.) They shall acknowledge the folly of their ancestors, which it 
 becomes them to do, when they were smarting for the sins of their 
 ancestors: "<I>Surely our fathers have inherited,</I> not the 
 satisfaction they promised themselves and their children, but <I>lies, 
 vanity, and things wherein there is no profit.</I> We are now sensible 
 that our fathers were cheated in their idolatrous worship; it did not 
 prove what it promised, and therefore what have we to do any more with 
 it?" Note, It were well if the disappointment which some have met with 
 in the service of sin, and the pernicious consequences of it to them, 
 might prevail to deter others from treading in their steps. 

 (4.) They shall reason themselves out of their idolatry; and that 
 reformation is likely to be sincere and durable which results from a 
 rational conviction of the gross absurdity there is in sin. They shall 
 argue thus with themselves (and it is well argued), <I>Should a man</I> 
 be such a fool, so perfectly void of the reason of a man, as to <I>make 
 gods to himself,</I> the creatures of his own fancy, the work of his 
 own hands, when they are really <I>no gods?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Can a man be so besotted, so perfectly lost to human understanding, as 
 to expect any divine blessing or favour from that which pretends to no 
 divinity but what it first received from him? 

 (5.) They shall herein give honour to God, and make it to appear that 
 they know both his hand in his providence and his name in his word, and 
 that they are brought to know his name by what they are made to know of 
 his hand,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 
 <I>This once,</I> now at length, they shall be made to know that which 
 they would not be brought to know by all the pains the prophets took 
 with them. Note, So stupid are we that nothing less than the mighty 
 hand of divine grace, known experimentally, can make us know rightly 
 the name of God as it is revealed to us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Their deliverance out of captivity shall be a type and figure of 
 this great salvation to be wrought out by the Messiah, who shall 
 <I>gather together in one the children of God that were scattered 
 abroad.</I> And this is that which so far outshines the deliverance out
 of Egypt as even to eclipse the lustre of it, and make it even to be 
 forgotten. To this some apply that of the <I>many fishers</I> and 
 <I>hunters,</I> the preachers of the gospel, who were <I>fishers of 
 men,</I> to enclose souls with the gospel net, to find them out <I>in 
 every mountain</I> and <I>hill,</I> and secure them for Christ. Then 
 the Gentiles came to God, some <I>from the ends of the earth,</I> and 
 turned to the worship of him from the service of dumb idols.</P>
