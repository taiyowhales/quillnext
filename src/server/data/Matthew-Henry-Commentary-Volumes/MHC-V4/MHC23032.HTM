 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter seems to be such a prophecy of the reign of Hezekiah as 
 amounts to an abridgment of the history of it, and this with an eye to 
 the kingdom of the Messiah, whose government was typified by the 
 thrones of the house of David, for which reason he is so often called 
 "the Son of David." Here is, 

 I. A prophecy of that good work of reformation with which he should
 begin his reign, and the happy influence it should have upon the 
 people, who had been wretchedly corrupted and debauched in the reign of 
 his predecessor, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>.

 II. A prophecy of the great disturbance that would be given to the
 kingdom in the middle of his reign by the Assyrian invasion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:9-14">ver. 9-14</A>.

 III. A promise of better times afterwards, towards the latter end of
 his reign, in respect both of piety and peace 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:15-20">ver. 15-20</A>),

 which promise may be supposed to look as far forward as the days of the
 Messiah.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes
 shall rule in judgment.
 &nbsp; 2  And a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind, and a
 covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as
 the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.
 &nbsp; 3  And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears
 of them that hear shall hearken.
 &nbsp; 4  The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and
 the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.
 &nbsp; 5  The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the
 churl said <I>to be</I> bountiful.
 &nbsp; 6  For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will
 work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error against
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and he will cause
 the drink of the thirsty to fail.
 &nbsp; 7  The instruments also of the churl <I>are</I> evil: he deviseth
 wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when
 the needy speaketh right.
 &nbsp; 8  But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal
 things shall he stand.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the description of a flourishing kingdom. "<I>Blessed art
 thou, O land!</I> when it is thus with thee, when kings, princes, and
 people, are in their places such as they should be." It may be taken as
 a directory both to magistrates and subjects, what both ought to do, or
 as a panegyric to Hezekiah, who ruled well and saw something of the 
 happy effects of his good government, and it was designed to make the 
 people sensible how happy they were under his administration and how 
 careful they should be to improve the advantages of it, and withal to 
 direct them to look for the kingdom of Christ, and the times of 
 reformation which that kingdom should introduce. It is here promised 
 and prescribed, for the comfort of the church,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That magistrates should do their duty in their places, and the 
 powers answer the great ends for which they were ordained of God, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 1. There shall be a king and princes that shall reign and rule; for it
 cannot go well when there is no king in Israel. The princes must have a 
 king, a monarch over them as supreme, in whom they may unite; and the 
 king must have princes under him as officers, by whom he may act, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:13,14">1 Pet. ii. 13, 14</A>.

 They both shall know their place and fill it up. The king shall reign,
 and yet, without any diminution to his just prerogative, the princes 
 shall rule in a lower sphere, and all for the public good.

 2. They shall use their power according to law, and not against it.
 They shall reign in righteousness and in judgment, with wisdom and 
 equity, protecting the good and punishing the bad; and those kings and 
 princes Christ owns as reigning by him who decree justice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:15">Prov. viii. 15</A>.
 
 Such a King, such a Prince, Christ himself is; he reigns by rule, and
 <I>in righteousness will he judge the world,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:7,11:4"><I>ch.</I> ix. 7; xi. 4</A>.

 3. Thus they shall be great blessings to the people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>A man,</I> that man, that king that reigns in righteousness, 
 <I>shall be as a hiding-place.</I> When princes are as they should be 
 people are as they would be.

 (1.) They are sheltered and protected from many mischiefs. This good 
 magistrate is a covert to the subject from the tempest of injury and 
 violence; he <I>defends the poor and fatherless,</I> that they be not 
 made a prey of by the mighty. Whither should oppressed innocency flee,
 when blasted by reproach or borne down by violence, but to the 
 magistrate as its hiding-place? To him it appeals, and by him it is 
 righted. 

 (2.) They are refreshed and comforted with many blessings. This good
 magistrate gives such countenance to those that are poor and in 
 distress, and such encouragement to every thing that is praiseworthy, 
 that he is <I>as rivers of water in a dry place,</I> cooling and 
 cherishing the earth and making it fruitful, and <I>as the shadow of a 
 great rock,</I> under which a poor traveller may shelter himself from 
 the scorching heat of the sun <I>in a weary land.</I> It is a great 
 reviving to a good man, who makes conscience of doing his duty, in the 
 midst of contempt and contradiction, at length to be backed, and 
 favoured, and smiled upon in it by a good magistrate. All this, and 
 much more, the man Christ Jesus is to all the willing faithful subjects 
 of his kingdom. When the greatest evils befal us, not only the wind, 
 but the tempest, when storms of guilt and wrath beset us and beat upon 
 us, they drive us to Christ, and in him we are not only safe, but 
 satisfied that we are so; in him we find rivers of water for those that 
 hunger and thirst after righteousness, all the refreshment and comfort 
 that a needy soul can desire, and the shadow, not of a tree, which sun 
 or rain may beat through, but of a rock, of a great rock, which reaches 
 a great way for the shelter of the traveller. Some observe here that as 
 the covert, and the hiding-place, and the rock, do themselves receive 
 the battering of the wind and storm, to save those from it that take 
 shelter in them, so Christ bore the storm himself to keep it off from 
 us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That subjects should do their duty in their places.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They shall be willing to be taught, and to understand things aright. 
 They shall lay aside their prejudices against their rulers and 
 teachers, and submit to the light and power of truth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 When this blessed work of reformation is set on foot, and men do their 
 parts towards it, God will not be wanting to do his: Then <I>the eyes 
 of those that see,</I> of the prophets, the seers, <I>shall not be 
 dim;</I> but God will bless them with visions, to be by them 
 communicated to the people; and those that read the word written shall 
 no longer have a veil upon their hearts, but shall see things clearly.
 Then <I>the ears of those that hear</I> the word preached <I>shall 
 hearken</I> diligently and readily receive what they hear, and not be 
 so dull of hearing as they have been. This shall be done by the grace 
 of God, especially gospel-grace; for <I>the hearing ear, and the seeing 
 eyes, the Lord has made,</I> has new-made, even both of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. There shall be a wonderful change wrought in them by that which is 
 taught them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 (1.) They shall have a clear head, and be able to discern things that 
 differ, and distinguish concerning them. <I>The heart of those that 
 were</I> hasty and <I>rash,</I> and could not take time to digest and 
 consider things, shall now be cured of their precipitation, and 
 <I>shall understand knowledge;</I> for the Spirit of God will open 
 their understanding. This blessed work Christ wrought in his disciples 
 after his resurrection 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:45">Luke xxiv. 45</A>),

 as a specimen of what he would do for all his people, in giving them an
 understanding, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:20">1 John v. 20</A>.

 The pious designs of good princes are likely to take effect when their
 subjects allow themselves liberty to consider, and to think, so freely 
 as to take things right.

 (2.) They shall have a ready utterance: <I>The tongue of the 
 stammerers,</I> that used to blunder whenever they spoke of the things 
 of God, <I>shall</I> now <I>be ready to speak plainly,</I> as those 
 that understand what they speak of, that believe, and therefore speak. 
 There shall be a great increase of such clear, distinct, and methodical 
 knowledge in the things of God, that those from whom one would not have 
 expected it shall speak intelligently of these things, very much to the 
 honour of God and the edification of others. Their hearts being full of 
 this good matter, their tongues shall be <I>as the pen of a ready 
 writer,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:1">Ps. xlv. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The differences between good and evil, virtue and vice, shall be 
 kept up, and no more confounded by those who put darkness for light and 
 light for darkness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>The vile shall no more be called liberal.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Bad men shall no more be preferred by the prince. When a king 
 reigns in justice he will not put those in places of honour and power 
 that are ill-natured, and of base and sordid spirits, and care not what 
 injury or mischief they do so they may but compass their own ends. Such 
 as <I>vile</I> persons (as Antiochus is called, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:21">Dan. xi. 21</A>);

 when they are advanced they are called <I>liberal</I> and
 <I>bountiful;</I> they are called <I>benefactors</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:25">Luke xxii. 25</A>):

 but it shall not always be thus; when the world grows wiser men shall
 be preferred according to their merit, and honour (which was never 
 thought seemly for a fool,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+26:1">Prov. xxvi. 1</A>)
 
 shall no longer be thrown away upon such.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Bad men shall be no more had in reputation among the people, nor 
 vice disguised with the colours of virtue. It shall no more be said to 
 Nabal, <I>Thou art Nadib</I> (so the words are); such a covetous 
 muck-worm as Nabal was, a fool but for his money, shall not be 
 complimented with the title of a gentleman or a prince; nor shall they 
 call a <I>churl,</I> that minds none but himself, does no good with 
 what he has, but is an unprofitable burden of the earth, <I>My 
 lord;</I> or, rather, they shall not say of him, <I>He is rich;</I> for 
 so the word signifies. Those only are to be reckoned rich that are rich 
 in good works; not those that have abundance, but those that use it 
 well. In short, it is well with a people when men are generally valued 
 by their virtue, and usefulness, and beneficence to mankind, and not by 
 their wealth or titles of honour. Whether this was fulfilled in the 
 reign of Hezekiah, and how far it refers to the kingdom of Christ (in 
 which we are sure men are judged of by what they are, not by what they 
 have, nor is any man's character mistaken), we will not say; but it 
 prescribes an excellent rule both to prince and people, to respect men 
 according to their personal merit. To enforce this rule, here is a 
 description both of the vile person and of the liberal; and by it we 
 shall see such a vast difference between them that we must quite forget 
 ourselves if we pay that respect to the vile person and the churl which 
 is due only to the liberal.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] A vile person and a churl will do mischief, and the more if he be 
 preferred and have power in his hand; his honours will make him worse 
 and not better, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 See the character of these base ill-conditioned men. <I>First,</I> They 
 are always plotting some unjust thing or other, designing ill either to 
 particular persons or to the public, and contriving how to bring it 
 about; and so many silly piques they have to gratify, and mean 
 revenges, that there appears not in them the least spark of generosity. 
 Their hearts will be still working some iniquity or other. Observe, 
 There is the work of the heart, as well as the work of the hands. As 
 thoughts are words to God, so designs are works in his account. See 
 what pains sinners take in sin. They labour at it; their hearts are 
 intent upon it, and with a great deal of art and application they 
 <I>work iniquity.</I> They <I>devise wicked devices</I> with all the 
 subtlety of the old serpent and a great deal of deliberation, which 
 makes the sin exceedingly sinful; and the more there is of plot and 
 management in a sin the more there is of Satan in it. <I>Secondly,</I> 
 They carry on their plots by trick and dissimulation. When they are 
 meditating iniquity, they <I>practise hypocrisy,</I> feign themselves 
 just men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:20">Luke xx. 20</A>.

 The most abominable mischiefs shall be disguised with the most
 plausible pretences of devotion to God, regard to man, and concern for 
 some common good. Those are the vilest of men that intend the worst 
 mischiefs when they speak fair. <I>Thirdly,</I> They <I>speak
 villainy.</I> When they are in a passion you will see what they are by 
 the base ill language they give to those about them, which no way 
 becomes men of rank and honour; or, in giving verdict or judgment, they 
 villainously put false colours upon things, to pervert justice.
 <I>Fourthly,</I> They affront God, who is a righteous God and loves 
 righteousness: They <I>utter error against the Lord,</I> and therein 
 they practise profaneness; for so the word which we translate 
 <I>hypocrisy</I> signifies. They give an unjust sentence, and then 
 profanely make use of the name of God for the ratification of it; as 
 if, because the <I>judgment is God's</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+1:17">Deut. i. 17</A>),

 therefore their false and unjust judgment was his. This is <I>uttering
 error against the Lord,</I> under pretence of uttering truth and 
 justice for him; and nothing can be more impudently done against God 
 than to use his name to patronise wickedness. <I>Fifthly,</I> They 
 abuse mankind, those particularly whom they are bound to protect and 
 relieve.

 1. Instead of supplying the wants of the poor, they impoverish them,
 they <I>make empty the souls of the hungry;</I> either taking away the 
 food they have, or, which is almost equivalent, denying the supply 
 which they want and which they have to give. And they <I>cause the 
 drink of the thirsty to fail;</I> they cut off the relief they used to 
 have, though they need it as much as ever. Those are vile persons 
 indeed that rob the spital. 

 2. Instead of righting the poor, when they appeal to their judgment, 
 they contrive to destroy the poor, to ruin them in their courts of 
 judicature with lying words in favour of the rich, to whom they are 
 plainly partial; yea, though the needy speak right, though the evidence 
 be ever so full for them to make out the equity of their cause, it is 
 the bribe that governs them, not the right. <I>Sixthly,</I> These
 churls and vile persons have always had instruments about them, that 
 are ready to serve their villainous purposes: <I>All their servants are 
 wicked.</I> There is no design so palpably unjust but there may be 
 found those that would be employed as tools to put it in execution. 
 <I>The instruments of the churl are evil,</I> and one cannot expect 
 otherwise; but this is our comfort, that they can do no more mischief 
 than God permits them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] One that is truly liberal, and deserves the honour of being called 
 so, makes it his business to do good to every body according as his 
 sphere is, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Observe, <I>First,</I> The care he takes, and the contrivances he has, 
 to do good. He <I>devises liberal things.</I> As much as the churl or 
 niggard projects how to save and lay up what he has for himself only, 
 so much the good charitable man projects how to use and lay out what he 
 has in the best manner for the good of others. Charity must be
 directed by wisdom, and liberal things done prudently and with device, 
 that the good intention of them may be answered, that it may not be 
 charity misplaced. The liberal man, when he has done all the liberal 
 things that are in his own power, devises liberal things for others to 
 do according to their power, and puts them upon doing them. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> the comfort he takes, and the advantage he has, in 
 doing good: <I>By liberal things he shall stand,</I> or be established. 
 The providence of God will reward him for his liberality with a settled 
 prosperity and an established reputation. The grace of God will give 
 him abundance of satisfaction and confirmed peace in his own bosom. 
 What disquiets others shall not disturb him; his heart is fixed. This 
 is the recompence of charity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:5,6">Ps. cxii. 5, 6</A>.

 Some read it, <I>The prince, or honourable man, will take honourable
 courses; and by such honourable or ingenuous courses he shall stand or 
 be established.</I> It is well with a land when the honourable of it 
 are indeed men of honour and scorn to do a base thing, when its king is 
 thus the son of nobles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye
 careless daughters; give ear unto my speech.
 &nbsp; 10  Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women:
 for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come.
 &nbsp; 11  Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless
 ones: strip you, and make you bare, and gird <I>sackcloth</I> upon
 <I>your</I> loins.
 &nbsp; 12  They shall lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields,
 for the fruitful vine.
 &nbsp; 13  Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns <I>and</I>
 briers; yea, upon all the houses of joy <I>in</I> the joyous city:
 &nbsp; 14  Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the
 city shall be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens for
 ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;
 &nbsp; 15  Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the
 wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted
 for a forest.
 &nbsp; 16  Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and
 righteousness remain in the fruitful field.
 &nbsp; 17  And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect
 of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.
 &nbsp; 18  And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in
 sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places;
 &nbsp; 19  When it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the city
 shall be low in a low place.
 &nbsp; 20  Blessed <I>are</I> ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth
 <I>thither</I> the feet of the ox and the ass.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have God rising up to judgment against the vile 
 persons, to punish them for their villainy; but at length returning in 
 mercy to the liberal, to reward them for their liberality.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. When there was so great a corruption of manners, and so much 
 provocation given to the holy God, bad times might well be expected, 
 and here is a warning given of such times coming. The alarm is sounded 
 to the <I>women that were at ease</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 and the <I>careless daughters,</I> to feed whose pride, vanity, and 
 luxury, their husbands and fathers were tempted to starve the poor. Let 
 them hear what the prophet has to say to them in God's name: "<I>Rise 
 up, and hear</I> with reverence and attention."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Let them know that God was about to bring wasting desolating 
 judgments upon the land in which they <I>lived in pleasure and were 
 wanton.</I> This seems to refer primarily to the desolations made by 
 Sennacherib's army when he seized all the fenced cities of Judah: but 
 then those words, <I>many days and years,</I> must be rendered (as the 
 margin reads them) <I>days above a year,</I> that is, something above a 
 year shall this havock be in the making: so long it was from the first 
 entrance of that army into the land of Judah to the overthrow of it. 
 But it is applicable to the wretched disappointment which those will 
 certainly meet with, first or last, that set their hearts upon the 
 world and place their happiness in it: <I>You shall be troubled, you 
 careless women.</I> It will not secure us from trouble to cast away 
 care when we are at ease; nay, to those who affect to live carelessly 
 even little troubles will be great vexations and press hard upon them. 
 They were careless and at ease because they had money enough and mirth 
 enough; but the prophet here tells them, 

 (1.) That the country whence they had their tents and dainties should 
 shortly be laid waste: "<I>The vintage shall fail;</I> and then what 
 will you do for wine to make merry with? <I>The gathering</I> of fruit 
 <I>shall not come,</I> for there shall be none to be gathered, and you 
 will find the want of them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 You will want <I>the teats,</I> the good milk from the cows, <I>the 
 pleasant fields</I> and their productions:" the useful fields that are 
 serviceable to human life are the pleasant ones. "You will want the 
 fruitful vine, and the grapes it used to yield you." The abuse of 
 plenty is justly punished with scarcity; and those deserve to be 
 deprived of the supports of life who make them the food and fuel of 
 lust and prepare them for Baal. 

 (2.) That the cities too, the cities of Judah, where they lived at 
 ease, spent their rents, and made themselves merry with their dainties, 
 should be laid waste

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>):

 <I>Briers and thorns,</I> the fruits of sin and the curse, <I>shall 
 come up,</I> not only <I>upon the land of my people,</I> which shall 
 lie uncultivated, but upon <I>all the houses of joy</I>--the 
 play-houses, the gaming-houses, the taverns--<I>in the joyous 
 cities.</I> When a foreign army was ravaging the country the houses of 
 joy, no doubt, became houses of mourning; then the palaces, or 
 noblemen's houses, were forsaken by their owners, who perhaps fled to 
 Egypt for refuge; the multitude of the city were left by their leaders 
 to shift for themselves. Then the stately houses <I>shall be for dens 
 for ever,</I> which had been as forts and towers for strength and 
 magnificence. They shall be abandoned; the owners shall never return to 
 them; every body shall look upon them to be like Jericho, an anathema; 
 so that, even when peace returns, they shall not be rebuilt, but shall 
 be thrown to the waste: <I>A joy of wild asses and a pasture of 
 flocks.</I> Thus is many a house brought to ruin by sin. <I>Jam seges 
 est ubi Troja fuit--Corn grows on the site of Troy.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In the foresight of this let them <I>tremble</I> and <I>be troubled, 
 strip themselves, and gird sackcloth upon their loins,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 This intimates not only that when the calamity comes they shall thus be 
 made to tremble and be forced to strip themselves, that then God's 
 judgments would strip them and make them bare, but, 

 (1.) That the best prevention of the trouble would be to repent and 
 humble themselves for their sin, and lie in the dust before God in true 
 remorse and godly sorrow, which would be the lengthening out of their 
 tranquillity. This is meeting God in the way of his judgments, and 
 saving a correction by correcting our own mistakes. Those only shall 
 break that will not bend.

 (2.) That the best preparation for the trouble would be to deny 
 themselves and live a life of mortification, and to sit loose to all 
 the delights of sense. Those that have already by a holy contempt of
 this world stripped themselves can easily bear to be stripped when 
 trouble and death come.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. While there was still a remnant that kept their integrity they had 
 reason to hope for good times at length and such times the prophet here 
 gives them a pleasant prospect of. Such times they saw in the latter 
 end of the reign of Hezekiah; but the prophecy may well be supposed to 
 look further, to the days of the Messiah, who is <I>King of 
 righteousness</I> and <I>King of peace,</I> and to whom all the 
 prophets bear witness. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How those blessed times shall be introduced-by the <I>pouring out of 
 the Spirit from on high</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 which speaks not only of the good-will of God towards us, but the good 
 work of God in us; for then, and not till then, there will be good 
 times, when God by his grace gives men good hearts; and therefore God's 
 <I>giving his Holy Spirit to those that ask him</I> is in effect his 
 giving them all good things, as appears by comparing 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:13,Mt+7:11">Luke xi. 13 with Matt. vii. 11</A>.

 This is the great thing that God's people comfort themselves with the
 hopes of, that <I>the Spirit shall be poured out upon them,</I> that 
 there shall be a more plentiful effusion of the Spirit of grace than 
 formerly, according as the necessity of the church, in its desolate 
 estate, calls for. This comes from on high, and therefore they look up
 to their Father in heaven for it. When God designs favours for his 
 church he pours out his Spirit, both to prepare his people to receive 
 his favours and to qualify and give success to those whom he designs to 
 employ as instruments of his favour; for their endeavours to repair the 
 desolations of the church are all fruitless <I>until the Spirit be 
 poured out upon them</I> and then the work is done suddenly. The
 kingdom of the Messiah was brought in, and set up, by the pouring out 
 of the Spirit

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:1-13">Acts ii.</A>),

 and so it is still kept up, and will be to the end.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What a wonderfully happy change shall then be made. That which was 
 <I>a wilderness,</I> dry and barren, <I>shall become a fruitful 
 field,</I> and that which we now reckon <I>a fruitful field,</I> in 
 comparison with what it shall be then, <I>shall be counted for a 
 forest. Then shall the earth yield her increase.</I> It is promised 
 that in the days of the Messiah the <I>fruit of the earth shall shake 
 like Lebanon,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:16">Ps. lxxii. 16</A>.

 Some apply this to the admission of the Gentiles into the gospel church
 (which made the wilderness a fruitful field), and the rejection and 
 exclusion of the Jews, which made that a forest which had been a 
 fruitful field. On the Gentiles was poured out a spirit of life, but on 
 the Jews a spirit of slumber. See what is the evidence and effect of 
 the pouring out of the Spirit upon any soul; it is thereby made 
 fruitful, and has its fruit unto holiness. Three things go to make 
 these times happy:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Judgment and righteousness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 When the Spirit is poured out upon a land, <I>then judgment shall dwell 
 in the wilderness</I> and turn it into a fruitful field, and 
 <I>righteousness shall remain in the fruitful field</I> and make it yet 
 more fruitful. Ministers shall expound the law and magistrates execute 
 it, and both so judiciously and faithfully that by both the bad shall 
 be made good and the good made better. Among all sorts of people, the 
 poor and low and unlearned, that are neglected as the wilderness, and 
 the rich and great and learned, that are valued as the fruitful field, 
 there shall be right thoughts of things, good principles commanding, 
 and conscience made of good and evil, sin and duty. Or in all parts of 
 the land, both champaign and enclosed, country and city, the ruder 
 parts and those that are more cultivated and refined, justice shall be 
 duly administered. The law of Christ introduces a judgment or rule by 
 which we must be governed, and the gospel of Christ a righteousness by 
 which we must be saved; and, wherever the Spirit is poured out, both 
 these dwell and remain as an everlasting righteousness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Peace and quietness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.

 The peace here promised is of two kinds:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Inward peace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 This follows upon the indwelling of righteousness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Those in whom that work is wrought shall experience this blessed 
 product of it. It is itself peace, and the effect of it is <I>quietness 
 and assurance for ever,</I> that is, a holy serenity and security of 
 mind, by which the soul enjoys itself and enjoys its God, and it is not 
 in the power of this world to disturb it in those enjoyments. Note, 
 Peace, and quietness, and everlasting assurance may be expected, and 
 shall be found, in the way and work of righteousness. True satisfaction 
 is to be had only in true religion, and there it is to be had without 
 fail. Those are the quiet and peaceable lives that are spent <I>in all
 godliness and honesty,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:2">1 Tim. ii. 2</A>.

 <I>First,</I> Even <I>the work of righteousness shall be peace.</I> In
 the doing of our duty we shall find abundance of true pleasure, a 
 present great reward of obedience in obedience. Though the work of 
 righteousness may be toilsome and costly, and expose us to contempt, 
 yet it is peace, such peace as is sufficient to bear our charges. 
 <I>Secondly, The effect of righteousness shall be quietness and 
 assurance,</I> not only to the end of time, of our time, and in the 
 end, but to the endless ages of eternity. Real holiness is real 
 happiness now and shall be perfect happiness, that is, perfect 
 holiness, for ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Outward peace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 It is a great mercy when those who by the grace of God have quiet and 
 peaceable spirits are by the providence of God made to <I>dwell in 
 quiet and peaceable habitations,</I> not disturbed in their houses or 
 solemn assemblies. When the terror of Sennacherib's invasion was over,
 the people, no doubt, were more sensible than ever of the mercy of a 
 quiet habitation, not disturbed with the alarms of war. Let every 
 family study to keep itself quiet from strifes and jars within, not two 
 against three and three against two in the house, and then put itself 
 under God's protection to dwell safely, and to be <I>quiet from the 
 fear of evil</I> without. Jerusalem shall be a peaceable habitation; 
 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:20"><I>ch.</I> xxxiii. 20</A>.

 Even <I>when it shall hail,</I> and there shall be a violent battering
 storm <I>coming down on the forest</I> that lies bleak, then shall 
 Jerusalem be <I>a quiet resting-place, for the city shall be low in a 
 low place,</I> under the wind, not exposed (as those cities are that 
 stand high) to the fury of the storm, but sheltered by the <I>mountains 
 that are round about Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+125:2">Ps. cxxv. 2</A>.

 The <I>high forts and towers are brought down</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 but the city that lies low shall be a quiet resting-place. Those are 
 most safe, and may dwell most at ease, that are humble, and are willing 
 to dwell low, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Those that would dwell in a peaceable habitation must be willing to 
 dwell low, and in a low place. Some think here is an allusion to the 
 preservation of the land of Goshen from the plague of hail, which made 
 great destruction in the land of Egypt.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Plenty and abundance. There shall be such good crops gathered in 
 every where, and every year, that the husbandmen shall be commended, 
 and though happy, who <I>sow beside all water</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 who sow all the grounds that are fit for seedness, who <I>cast their 
 bread,</I> or bread-corn, <I>upon the water,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+11:1">Eccl. xi. 1</A>.

 God will give the increase, but then the husbandman must be
 industrious, and mind his business, and sow beside all waters; and, if 
 he do this, the corn shall come up so thick and rank that he shall turn 
 in his cattle, even the ox and the ass, to eat the tops of it and keep 
 it under. This is applicable,

 [1.] To the preaching of the word. Some think it points at the ministry
 of the apostles, who, as husbandmen, went forth to sow their seed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:3">Matt. xiii. 3</A>);

 they sowed beside all waters; they preached the gospel wherever they
 came. Waters signify people, and they preached to multitudes. Wherever 
 they found men's hearts softened, and moistened, and disposed to 
 receive the word, they cast in the good seed. And whereas, by the law 
 of Moses, the Jews were forbidden to <I>plough with an ox and an ass 
 together</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+22:10">Deut. xxii. 10</A>),

 which intimated that Jews and Gentiles should not intermix, now that
 distinction shall be taken away, and both the ox and the ass, both Jews 
 and Gentiles, shall be employed in, and enjoy the benefit of, the 
 gospel husbandry. 

 [2.] To works of charity. When God sends these happy times blessed are
 those that improve them in doing good with what they have, that sow 
 beside all waters, that embrace all opportunities of relieving the 
 necessitous; for in due season they shall reap.</P>
