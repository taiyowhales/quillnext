 Glorious things had been spoken in the previous chapters concerning the 
 deliverance of the Jews out of Babylon; but lest any should think, when 
 it was accomplished, that it looked much greater and brighter in the 
 prophecy than in the performance, and that the return of about 40,000 
 Jews in a poor condition out of Babylon to Jerusalem was not an event 
 sufficiently answering to the height and grandeur of the expressions 
 used in the prophecy, he here comes to show that the prophecy had a 
 further intention, and was to have its full accomplishment in a 
 redemption that should as far outdo these expressions as the other 
 seemed to come short of them, even the redemption of the world by Jesus 
 Christ, of whom not only Cyrus, who was God's servant in foretelling 
 it, was a type. In this chapter we have, 

 I. The designation of Christ, under the type of Isaiah, to his office
 as Mediator, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. The assurance given him of the success of his undertaking among the
 Gentiles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:4-8">ver. 4-8</A>.

 III. The redemption that should be wrought by him, and the progress of 
 that redemption, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:9-12">ver. 9-12</A>.

 IV. The encouragement given hence to the afflicted church, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:13-17">ver. 13-17</A>.
 
 V. The addition of many to it, and the setting up of a church among the 
 Gentiles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:18-23">ver. 18-23</A>.

 VI. A ratification of the prophecy of the Jews' release out of Babylon, 
 which was to be the figure and type of all these blessings,,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:24-26">
 ver. 24-26</A>.
 
 If this chapter be rightly understood, we shall see ourselves to be 
 more concerned in the prophecies relating to the Jews' deliverance out 
 of Babylon than we thought we were.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far;
 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my
 mother hath he made mention of my name.
 &nbsp; 2  And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow
 of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his
 quiver hath he hid me;
 &nbsp; 3  And said unto me, Thou <I>art</I> my servant, O Israel, in whom I
 will be glorified.
 &nbsp; 4  Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my
 strength for nought, and in vain: <I>yet</I> surely my judgment <I>is</I>
 with the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and my work with my God.
 &nbsp; 5  And now, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> that formed me from the womb <I>to be</I>
 his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not
 gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and my
 God shall be my strength.
 &nbsp; 6  And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my
 servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the
 preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the
 Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the
 earth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. An auditory is summoned together and attention demanded. The sermon 
 in the foregoing chapter was directed to the house of Jacob and the 
 people of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:1,12"><I>v.</I> 1, 12</A>.

 But this is directed to the isles (that is, the Gentiles, for they are
 called <I>the isles of the Gentiles,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:5">Gen. x. 5</A>)

 and to <I>the people from far,</I> that were <I>strangers to the
 commonwealth of Israel,</I> and afar off. Let these listen

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)
 
 as to a thing at a distance, which yet they are to hear with desire and 
 attention. Note, 

 1. The tidings of a Redeemer are sent to the Gentiles, and to those
 that lie most remote; and they are concerned to listen to them. 

 2. The Gentiles listened to the gospel when the Jews were deaf to 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The great author and publisher of the redemption produces his 
 authority from heaven for the work he had undertaken. 

 1. God had appointed him and set him apart for it: <I>The Lord has
 called me from the womb</I> to this office and <I>made mention of my 
 name,</I> nominated me to be the Saviour. By an angel he called him 
 <I>Jesus--a Saviour,</I> who <I>should save his people from their 
 sins,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:21">Matt. i. 21</A>.

 Nay, from the womb of the divine counsels, before all worlds, he was
 called to this service, and help was laid upon him; and he came at the 
 call, for he said, <I>Lo, I come,</I> with an eye to what was written 
 of him <I>in the volume of the book.</I> This was said of some of the 
 prophets, as types of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:5">Jer. i. 5</A>.

 Paul was separated to the apostleship from his mother's womb,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:15">Gal. i. 15</A>.

 2. God had fitted and qualified him for the service to which he 
 designed him. He <I>made his mouth like a sharp sword,</I> and <I>made 
 him</I> like <I>a polished shaft,</I> or a bright arrow, furnished him 
 with every thing necessary to fight God's battles against the powers of 
 darkness, to conquer Satan, and bring back God's revolted subjects to 
 their allegiance, by his word: that is the <I>two-edged sword</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:12">Heb. iv. 12</A>)
 
 which comes out of his mouth,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:15">Rev. xix. 15</A>.

 The convictions of the word are the arrows that shall be sharp in the
 hearts of sinners, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:5">Ps. xlv. 5</A>.

 3. God had preferred him to the service for which he had reserved him:
 <I>He has hidden me in the shadow of his hand</I> and in his quiver, 
 which denotes,

 (1.) Concealment. The gospel of Christ, and the calling in of the 
 Gentiles by it, were long hidden from ages and generations, hidden in 
 God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:5,Ro+16:25">Eph. iii. 5, Rom. xvi. 25</A>),

 hidden in the shadow of the ceremonial law and the Old-Testament types.

 (2.) Protection. The house of David was the particular care of the 
 divine Providence, because that blessing was in it. Christ in his 
 infancy was sheltered from the rage of Herod.

 4. God had owned him, had said unto him, "<I>Thou art my servant,</I>
 whom I have employed and will prosper; thou art Israel, in effect, 
 <I>the prince with God,</I> that hast wrestled and prevailed; and in 
 thee I will be glorified." The people of God are <I>Israel,</I> and 
 they are all gathered together, summed up, as it were, in Christ, the 
 great representative of all Israel, as the high priest who had the 
 names of all the tribes on his breastplate; and in him God is and will 
 be glorified; so he said by a voice from heaven, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:27,28">John xii. 27, 28</A>.

 Some read the words in two clauses: <I>Thou art my servant</I> (so
 Christ is,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:1"><I>ch.</I> xlii. 1</A>);

 <I>it is Israel in whom I will be glorified by thee;</I> it is the
 spiritual Israel, the elect, in the salvation of whom by Jesus Christ 
 God will be glorified, and his free grace for ever admired.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He is assured of the good success of his undertaking; for whom God 
 calls he will prosper. And as to this,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He objects the discouragement he had met with at his first setting 
 out 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "Then I said, with a sad heart, <I>I have laboured in vain;</I> those 
 that were ignorant, and careless, and strangers to God, are so still: 
 <I>I have called, and they have refused;</I> I have <I>stretched out my 
 hands to a gainsaying people.</I>" This was Isaiah's complaint, but it 
 was no more than he was told to expect,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:9"><I>ch.</I> vi. 9</A>.

 The same was a temptation to Jeremiah to resolve he would labour no
 more, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+20:9">Jer. xx. 9</A>.

 It is the complaint of many a faithful minister, that has not loitered,
 but laboured, not spared, but spent, his strength, and himself with it, 
 and yet, as to many, it is all in vain and for nought; they will not be 
 prevailed with to repent and believe. But here it seems to point at
 the obstinacy of the Jews, among whom Christ went in person preaching 
 the gospel of the kingdom, laboured and spent his strength, and yet the 
 rulers and the body of the nation rejected him and his doctrine; so 
 very few were brought in, when one would think none should have stood 
 out, that he might well say, "<I>I have laboured in vain,</I> preached 
 so many sermons, wrought so many miracles, in vain." Let not the 
 ministers think it strange that they are slighted when the Master 
 himself was.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He comforts himself under this discouragement with this 
 consideration, that it was the cause of God in which he was engaged and 
 the call of God that engaged him in it: <I>Yet surely my judgment is 
 with the Lord,</I> who is the Judge of all, <I>and my work with my 
 God,</I> whose servant I am. His comfort is, and it may be the comfort 
 of all faithful ministers, when they see little success of their 
 labours, 

 (1.) That, however it be, it is a righteous cause that they are 
 pleading. They are with God, and for God; they are on his side, and 
 workers together with him. They like not their judgment, the rule they 
 go by, nor their work, the business they are employed in, ever the 
 worse for this. The unbelief of men gives them no cause to suspect the 
 truth of their doctrine, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:3">Rom. iii. 3</A>.

 (2.) That their management of this cause, and their prosecution of this 
 work, were known to God, and they could appeal to him concerning their 
 sincerity, and that it was not through any neglect of theirs that they 
 laboured in vain. "<I>He knows the way that I take; my judgment is with 
 the Lord,</I> to determine whether I have not delivered my soul and 
 left the blood of those that perish on their own heads." 

 (3.) Though the labour be in vain as to those that are laboured with, 
 yet not as to the labourer himself, if he be faithful: his judgment is 
 with the Lord, who will justify him and bear him out, though men 
 condemn him and run him down; and his work (the reward of his work) is 
 with his God, who will take care he shall be no loser, no, not by his 
 lost labour. 

 (4.) Though the judgment be not yet brought forth unto victory, nor the 
 work to perfection, yet both are with the Lord, to carry them on and 
 give them success, according to his purpose, in his own way and 
 time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He receives from God a further answer to this objection, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 He knew very well that God had set him on work, had <I>formed him from
 the womb to be his servant,</I> had not only called him so early to it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 but begun so early to fit him for it and dispose him to it. Those whom
 God designs to employ as his servants he is fashioning and preparing to 
 be so long before, when perhaps neither themselves nor others are aware 
 of it. It is he that forms the spirit of man within him. Christ was to 
 be <I>his servant, to bring Jacob again to him,</I> that had 
 treacherously departed from him. The seed of Jacob therefore, according 
 to the flesh, must first be dealt with, and means used to bring them 
 back. Christ, and the word of salvation by him, are sent to them first; 
 nay, Christ comes in person to them only, <I>to the lost sheep of the 
 house of Israel.</I> But what if Jacob will not be brought back to God 
 and Israel will not be gathered? So it proved; but this is a 
 satisfaction in that case, 

 (1.) Christ will be glorious in the eyes of the Lord; and those are 
 truly glorious that are so in God's eyes. Though few of the Jewish
 nation were converted by Christ's preaching and miracles, and many of 
 them loaded him with ignominy and disgrace, yet God put honour upon 
 him, and made him glorious, at his baptism, and in his transfiguration, 
 spoke to him from heaven, sent angels to minister to him, made even his 
 shameful death glorious by the many prodigies that attended it, much 
 more his resurrection. In his sufferings God was his strength, so that 
 though he met with all the discouragement imaginable, by the contempts 
 of a people whom he had done so much to oblige, yet he <I>did not fail 
 nor was discouraged.</I> An angel was sent from heaven to 
 <I>strengthen</I> him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:43">Luke xxii. 43</A>.

 Faithful ministers, though they see not the fruit of their labours,
 shall yet be accepted of God, and in that they shall be truly glorious, 
 for his favour is our honour; and they shall be assisted to proceed and 
 persevere in their labours notwithstanding. This weakens their hands, 
 but their God will be their strength.

 (2.) The gospel shall be glorious in the eyes of the world; though it 
 be not so in the eyes of the Jews, yet it shall be entertained by the 
 nations,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 The Messiah seemed as if he had been primarily designed to <I>bring
 Jacob back,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 But he is here told that it is comparatively but a small matter; a
 higher orb of honour than that, and a larger sphere of usefulness, are 
 designed him: "<I>It is a light thing that thou shouldst be my servant, 
 to raise up the tribes of Jacob</I> to the dignity and dominion they 
 expect by the Messiah, and to <I>restore the preserved of Israel,</I> 
 and make them a flourishing church and state as formerly" (nay, 
 considering what a little handful of people they are, it would be but a 
 small matter, in comparison, for the Messiah to be the Saviour of them 
 only); "and therefore <I>I will give thee for a light to the 
 Gentiles</I> (many great and mighty nations by the gospel of Christ 
 shall be brought to the knowledge and worship of the true God), <I>that 
 thou mayest be my salvation,</I> the author of that salvation which I 
 have designed for lost man, and this <I>to the end of the earth,</I> to 
 nations at the greatest distance." Hence Simeon learned to call Christ 
 <I>a light to lighten the Gentiles</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:32">Luke ii. 32</A>),

 and St. Paul's exposition of this text is what we ought to abide by,
 and it serves for a key to the context, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:47">Acts xiii. 47</A>.

 <I>Therefore,</I> says he, we turn to the Gentiles, to preach the
 gospel to them, <I>because so has the Lord commanded us, saying, I have 
 set thee to be a light to the Gentiles.</I> In this the Redeemer was 
 truly glorious, though Israel was not gathered; the setting up of his 
 kingdom in the Gentile world was more his honour than if he had raised 
 up all the tribes of Jacob. This promise is in part fulfilled already,
 and will have a further accomplishment, if that time be yet to come 
 which the apostle speaks of, when the fulness of the Gentiles shall be 
 brought in. Observe, God calls it his salvation, which some think
 intimates how well pleased he was with it, how he gloried in it, and 
 (if I may so say) how much his heart was upon it. They further observe 
 that Christ is given for a light to all those to whom he is given for 
 salvation. It is in darkness that men perish. Christ enlightens men's 
 eyes, and so makes them holy and happy.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The humiliation and exaltation of the Messiah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>The Lord, the Redeemer of Israel, and Israel's Holy One,</I> who had 
 always taken care of the Jewish church and wrought out for them those 
 deliverances that were typical of the great salvation, speaks here to 
 him, who was the undertaker of that salvation. And, 

 1. He takes notice of his humiliation, the instances of which were
 uncommon, nay, unparalleled. He was one <I>whom man despised.</I> He
 is <I>despised and rejected of men,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:3"><I>ch.</I> liii. 3</A>.

 To be despised by so mean a creature (man, who is himself a worm)
 bespeaks the lowest and most contemptible condition imaginable. Man, 
 whom he came to save and to put honour upon, yet despised him and put 
 contempt upon him; so wretchedly ungrateful were his persecutors. The 
 ignominy he underwent was not the least of his sufferings. They not 
 only made him despicable, but odious. He was <I>one whom the nation 
 abhorred;</I> they treated him as the worst of men, and cried out, 
 <I>Crucify him, crucify him.</I> The nation did it, the Gentiles as 
 well as Jews, and the Jews herein worse than Gentiles; for his cross 
 was <I>to the one a stumbling-block</I> and <I>to the other 
 foolishness.</I> He was <I>a servant of rulers;</I> he was trampled 
 upon, abused, scourged, and crucified as a slave. Pilate boasted of his 
 power over him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:10">John xix. 10</A>.
 
 This he submitted to for our salvation.

 2. He promises him his exaltation. Honour was done him even in the
 depth of his humiliation. Herod the king stood in awe of him, saying, 
 <I>I it John the Baptist;</I> noblemen, rulers, centurions came and 
 kneeled to him. But this was more fully accomplished when kings 
 received his gospel, and submitted to his yoke, and joined in the 
 worship of him, and called themselves the vassals of Christ. Not that 
 Christ values the rich more than the poor (they stand upon a level with 
 him), but it is for the honour of his kingdom among men when the great 
 ones of the earth appear for him and do homage to him. This shall be 
 the accomplishment of God's promise, and he will give him the heathen 
 for his inheritance, and <I>therefore</I> it shall be done, <I>because 
 of the Lord who is faithful</I> and true to his promise; and this shall 
 be an evidence that Christ had a commission for what he did, and that 
 God had chosen him, and would own the choice he had made.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The blessings he has in store for all those to whom he is made 
 salvation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God will own and stand by him in his undertaking 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>In an acceptable time have I heard thee,</I> that is, I will hear 
 thee. Christ, <I>in the days of his flesh, offered up strong cries,
 and was heard,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:7">Heb. v. 7</A>.

 He knew that the <I>Father heard him always</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:42">John xi. 42</A>),

 heard him for himself (for, though the cup might not pass from him, yet
 he was enabled to drink it), heard him for all that are his, and 
 therefore he interceded for them as one having authority. <I>Father, I
 will,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:24">John xvii. 24</A>.

 All our happiness results from the Son's interest in the Father and the
 prevalency of his intercession, that he always heard him; and this 
 makes the gospel time an acceptable time, welcome to us, because we are 
 accepted of God, both reconciled and recommended to him, that God hears 
 the Redeemer for us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:25">Heb. vii. 25</A>.

 Nor will he hear him only, but help him to go through with his
 undertaking. The Father was always with him at his right hand, and did 
 not leave him when his disciples did. Violent attacks were made upon
 our Lord Jesus by the powers of darkness, when it was their hour, to 
 drive him off from his undertakings, but God promises to preserve him 
 and enable him to persevere in it; on that <I>one stone were seven 
 eyes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+3:9">Zech. iii. 9</A>.

 God would preserve him, would preserve his interest, his kingdom among
 men, though fought against on all sides. Christ is preserved while
 Christianity is.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. God will authorize him to apply to his church the benefits of the 
 redemption he is to work out. God's preserving and helping him was to 
 make the day of his gospel a day of salvation. And so the apostle 
 understands it: <I>Behold, now is the day of salvation,</I> now the 
 word of reconciliation by Christ is preached, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:2">2 Cor. vi. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He shall be guarantee of the treaty of peace between God and man: 
 I will <I>give thee for a covenant of the people.</I> This we had 
 before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:6"><I>ch.</I> xlii. 6</A>),

 and it is here repeated as faithful, and well worthy of all acceptation
 and observation. He is given for a covenant, that is, for a pledge of 
 all the blessings of the covenant. It was in him that God was 
 <I>reconciling the world to himself;</I> and he that <I>spared not his 
 own Son</I> will deny us nothing. He is given for a covenant, not only 
 as he is the Mediator of the covenant, the blessed <I>days-man who has 
 laid his hand upon us both,</I> but as he is all in all in the 
 covenant. All the duty of the covenant is summed up in our being his; 
 and all the privilege and happiness of the covenant are summed up in 
 his being ours.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He shall repair the decays of the church and build it upon a rock. 
 He shall <I>establish the earth,</I> or rather the <I>land,</I> the 
 land of Judea, a type of the church. He shall <I>cause the desolate 
 heritages to be inherited;</I> so the cities of Judah were after the 
 return out of captivity, and so the church, which in the last and 
 degenerate ages of the Jewish nation had been as a country laid waste, 
 but was again replenished by the fruits of the preaching of the 
 gospel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He shall free the souls of men from the bondage of guilt and 
 corruption and bring them into the glorious liberty of God's children. 
 He shall <I>say to the prisoners</I> that were bound over to the 
 justice of God, and bound under the power of Satan, <I>Go forth,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Pardoning mercy is a release from the curse of the law, and renewing
 grace is a release from the dominion of sin. Both are from Christ, and 
 are branches of the great salvation. It is he that says, <I>Go 
 forth;</I> it is the Son that makes us free, and then we are free 
 indeed. He saith <I>to those that are in darkness, Show yourselves;</I> 
 "not only <I>see,</I> but <I>be seen,</I> to the glory of God and your 
 own comfort." When he discharged the lepers from their confinement, he 
 said, <I>Go show yourselves to the priest.</I> When we see the light, 
 let our light shine.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) He shall provide for the comfortable passage of those whom he sets 
 at liberty to the place of their rest and happy settlement, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:9-11"><I>v.</I> 9-11</A>.
 
 These verses refer to the provision made for the Jews' return out of
 their captivity, who were taken under the particular care of the divine 
 Providence, as favourites of Heaven, and now so in a special manner; 
 but they are applicable to that guidance of divine grace which all 
 God's spiritual Israel are under, from their release out of bondage to 
 their settlement in the heavenly Canaan. 

 [1.] They shall have their charges borne and shall be fed at free cost 
 with food convenient: <I>They shall feed in the ways,</I> as sheep; for 
 now, as formerly, God <I>leads Joseph like a flock.</I> When God 
 pleases even highway ground shall be good ground for the sheep of his 
 pasture to feed in. Their pastures shall be not only in the valleys, 
 but <I>in all high places,</I> which are commonly dry and barren. 
 Wherever God brings his people he will take care they shall want 
 nothing that is good for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:10">Ps. xxxiv. 10</A>.

 And so well shall they be provided for that they shall not hunger nor
 thirst, for what they need they shall have seasonably, before their 
 need of it comes to an extremity.

 [2.] They shall be sheltered and protected from every thing that would 
 incommode them: <I>Neither shall the heat nor sun smite them,</I> or 
 God causes <I>his flock to rest at noon,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:7">Cant. i. 7</A>.

 No evil thing shall befal those that put themselves under a divine
 protection; they shall be enabled to <I>bear the burden and heat of the 
 day.</I>

 [3.] They shall be under God's gracious guidance: <I>He that has mercy 
 on them,</I> in bringing them out of their captivity, <I>shall lead 
 them,</I> as he did their fathers in the wilderness, by a pillar of 
 cloud and fire. <I>Even by springs of water,</I> which will be ready to 
 them in their march, <I>shall he guide them.</I> God will furnish them 
 with suitable and seasonable comforts, not like the pools of rainwater 
 in the valley of Baca, but like the water out of the rock which 
 followed Israel. Those who are under a divine guidance, and follow that 
 closely, while they do so, may, upon good grounds, hope for divine 
 comforts and cordials. The world leads its followers by broken 
 cisterns, or brooks that fail in summer; but God leads those that are 
 his by springs of water. And those whom God guides shall find a ready 
 road and all obstacles removed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>I will make all my mountains a way.</I> He that in times past made 
 the sea a way, now with as much ease will make the mountains a way, 
 though they seemed impassable. The highway, or causeway, shall be 
 raised, to make it both the plainer and the fairer. Note, The ways in 
 which God leads his people he himself will be the overseer of, and will 
 take care that they be well mended and kept in repair, as of old the 
 ways that led to the cities of refuge. The levelling of the roads from 
 Babylon, as it was foretold

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:2,3"><I>ch.</I> xl. 2, 3</A>),

 was applied to gospel work, and so may this be. Though there be
 difficulties in the way to heaven, which we cannot by our own strength 
 get over, yet the grace of God shall be sufficient to help us over them 
 and to make even the mountains a way,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:8"><I>ch.</I> xxxv. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) He shall bring them all together from all parts, that they may
 return in a body, that they may encourage one another and be the more 
 taken notice of. They were dispersed into several parts of the country 
 of Babylon, as their enemies pleased, to prevent any combination among 
 themselves. But, when God's time shall come to bring them home 
 together, one spirit shall animate them all, all that lie at the 
 greatest distance from each other, and those also that had taken 
 shelter in other countries shall meet them in the land of Judah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 
 Here shall a party <I>come from far,</I> some <I>from the north,</I>
 some <I>from the west,</I> some <I>from the land of Sinim,</I> which 
 probably is some province of Babylon not elsewhere named in scripture, 
 but some make it to be a country belonging to one of the chief cities 
 of Egypt, called <I>Sin,</I> of which we read, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:15,16">Ezek. xxx. 15, 16</A>.

 Now this promise was to have a further accomplishment in the great
 confluence of converts to the gospel church, and its full 
 accomplishment when God's chosen shall come from the east and from the 
 west to sit down with the patriarchs in the kingdom of God,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The scope of these verses is to show that the return of the people of 
 God out of their captivity, and the eternal redemption to be wrought 
 out by Christ (of which that was a type), would be great occasions of 
 joy to the church and great proofs of the tender care God has of the 
 church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Nothing can furnish us with better matter for songs of praise and 
 thanksgiving, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Let the whole creation join with us in songs of joy, for it shares with
 us in the benefits of the redemption, and all they can contribute to 
 this sacred melody is little enough in return for such inestimable 
 favours, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+96:11">Ps. xcvi. 11</A>.

 Let there be joy in heaven, and let the angels of God celebrate the
 praises of the great Redeemer; let the earth and the mountains, 
 particularly the great ones of the earth, <I>be joyful,</I> and 
 <I>break forth into singing, for the earnest expectation of the 
 creature</I> that <I>waits for the glorious liberty of the children of 
 God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:19,21">Rom. viii. 19, 21</A>)

 shall now be <I>abundantly answered.</I> God's people are the blessings
 and ornaments of the world, and therefore let there be universal joy, 
 for <I>God has comforted his people</I> that were in sorrow and <I>he 
 will have mercy upon the afflicted</I> because of his compassion, upon 
 <I>his</I> afflicted because of his covenant.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Nothing can furnish us with more convincing arguments to prove the 
 most tender and affectionate concern God has for his church, and her 
 interests and comforts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The troubles of the church have given some occasion to question 
 God's care and concern for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 <I>Zion,</I> in distress, <I>said, The Lord has forsaken me,</I> and
 looks after me no more; <I>my Lord has forgotten me,</I> and 
 <I>will</I> look after me no more. See how deplorable the case of
 God's people may be sometimes, such that they may seem to be forsaken 
 and forgotten of their God; and at such a time their temptations may be 
 alarmingly violent. Infidels, in their presumption, say <I>God has 
 forsaken the earth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:12">Ezek. viii. 12</A>),

 and has <I>forgotten their sins,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:11">Ps. x. 11</A>.

 Weak believers, in their despondency, are ready to say, "God has
 forsaken his church and forgotten the sorrows of his people." But we 
 have no more reason to question his promise and grace than we have to 
 question his providence and justice. He is as sure a rewarder as he is 
 a revenger. Away therefore with these distrusts and jealousies, which 
 are the bane of friendship.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The triumphs of the church, after her troubles, will in due time put 
 the matter out of question.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What God will do for Zion we are told, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 [1.] Her friends, who had deserted her, shall be gathered to her, and
 shall contribute their utmost to her assistance and comfort: <I>Thy 
 children shall make haste.</I> Converts to the faith of Christ are the 
 children of the church; they shall join themselves to her with great 
 readiness and cheerfulness, and flock into the communion of saints, as 
 doves to their windows. "<I>Thy builders shall make haste</I>" (so some 
 read it), "who shall build up thy houses, thy walls, especially thy 
 temple; they shall do it with expedition." Church work is usually slow 
 work; but, when God's time shall come, it shall be done suddenly. 

 [2.] Her enemies, who had threatened and assaulted her, shall be forced 
 to withdraw from her: <I>Thy destroyers, and those who made thee 
 waste,</I> who had made themselves masters of the country and ravaged 
 it, <I>shall go forth of thee.</I> By Christ the prince of this world, 
 the great destroyer, is cast out, is dispossessed, has his power broken 
 and his attempts quite baffled.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Now by this it will appear that Zion's suggestions were altogether 
 groundless, that God has not forsaken her, nor forgotten her, nor ever 
 will. Be assured, 

 [1.] That God has a tender affection for his church and people,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 In answer to Zion's fears, God speaks as one concerned for his own
 glory (he takes himself to be reflected upon if Zion say, <I>The Lord 
 has forsaken me,</I> and he will clear himself), as one concerned also 
 for his people's comfort; he would not have them droop, and be 
 discouraged, and give way to any uneasy thoughts. "You think that I 
 have forgotten you. <I>Can a woman forget her sucking child?" 
 First,</I> It is not likely that she should. A woman, whose honour it 
 is to be of the tender sex as well as the fair one, cannot but have 
 compassion for a child, which, being both harmless and helpless, is a 
 proper object of compassion. A mother, especially, cannot but be 
 concerned for her own child; for it is her own, a piece of herself, and 
 very lately one with her. A nursing mother, most of all, cannot but be 
 tender of her sucking child; her own breasts will soon put her in mind 
 of it if she should forget it. But, <I>Secondly,</I> It is possible 
 that she may forget. A woman may perhaps be so unhappy as not to be 
 able to remember her sucking child (she may be sick, and dying, and 
 going to the land of forgetfulness), or she may be so unnatural as not 
 to have <I>compassion on the son of her womb,</I> as those who, to 
 conceal their shame, are the death of their children as soon as they 
 are their life, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:10,De+28:57">Lam. iv. 10; Deut. xxviii. 57</A>.

 But, says God, <I>I will not forget thee.</I> Note, God's compassions
 to his people infinitely exceed those of the tenderest parents towards 
 their children. What are the affections of nature to those of the God 
 of nature!

 [2.] That he has a constant care of his church and people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>I have engraven thee upon the palms of my hands.</I> This does not 
 allude to the foolish art of palmistry, which imagines every man's fate 
 to be engraved in the palms of his hands and to be legible in the lines 
 there, but to the custom of those who tie a string upon their hands or 
 fingers to put them in mind of things which they are afraid they shall 
 forget, or to the wearing of signet or locket-rings in remembrance of 
 some dear friend. His setting them thus as a seal upon his arm denotes 
 his setting them as a seal upon his heart, and his being ever mindful 
 of them and their interests, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:6">Cant. viii. 6</A>.

 If we <I>bind God's law as a sign upon our hand</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:8,11,18">Deut. vi. 8, 11, 18</A>),

 he will engrave our interests as a sign on his hand, and will look upon
 that and remember the covenant. He adds, "<I>Thy walls shall be 
 continually before me;</I> thy ruined walls, though no pleasing 
 spectacle, shall be in my thoughts of compassion." Do Zions' friends 
 <I>favour her dust?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:14">Ps. cii. 14</A>.

 So does her God. Or, "The plan and model of thy walls, that are to be
 rebuilt, is before me, and they shall certainly be built according to 
 it." Or, "Thy walls (that is, thy safety) are my continual care; so are 
 the watchmen on thy walls." Some apply his engraving his church on the 
 palms of his hands to the wounds in Christ's hands when he was 
 crucified; he will look on the marks of them, and remember those for 
 whom he suffered and died.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two things are here promised, which were to be in part accomplished in 
 the reviving of the Jewish church after its return out of captivity, 
 but more fully in the planting of the Christian church by the preaching 
 of the gospel of Christ; and we may take the comfort of these 
 promises.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That the church shall be replenished with great numbers added to it. 
 It was promised 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>)

 that <I>her children should make haste;</I> that promise is here 
 enlarged upon, and is made very encouraging. It is promised,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That multitudes shall flock to the church from all parts. <I>Look 
 round, and see how they gather themselves to thee</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 by a local accession to the Jewish church. They come to Jerusalem from 
 all the adjacent countries, for that was then the centre of their 
 unity; but, under the gospel, it is by a spiritual accession to the 
 mystical body of Christ in faith and love. Those that <I>come to Jesus 
 as the Mediator of the new covenant</I> do thereby <I>come to the Mount 
 Zion,</I> the <I>church of the first-born,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:22,23">Heb. xii. 22, 23</A>.

 <I>Lift up thy eyes, and behold</I> how <I>the fields are white unto
 the harvest,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:35">John iv. 35</A>.

 Note, It is matter of joy to the church to see a multitude of converts
 to Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That such as are added to the church shall not be a burden and 
 blemish to her, but her strength and ornament. This part of the promise 
 is confirmed with an oath: <I>As I live, saith the Lord, thou shalt 
 surely clothe thyself with them all.</I> The addition of such numbers 
 to the church shall complete her clothing; and, when all that were 
 chosen are effectually called, then the bride, the Lamb's wife, shall 
 have made herself ready, shall be quite dressed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:7">Rev. xix. 7</A>.

 They shall make her to appear comely and considerable; and she shall
 therefore bind them on with as much care and complacency as a bride 
 does her ornaments. When those that are added to the church are 
 serious, and holy, and exemplary in their conversation, they are an 
 ornament to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That thus the country which was waste and desolate, and <I>without 
 inhabitant</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:9,6:11"><I>ch.</I> v. 9; vi. 11</A>),

 shall be again peopled, nay, it shall be over-peopled 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 "<I>Thy waste and thy desolate places,</I> that have long lain so, 
 <I>and the land of thy destruction,</I> that land of thine which was 
 destroyed with thee and which nobody cared for dwelling in, shall now 
 be so full of people that there shall be no room for the inhabitants." 
 Here is blessing poured out till there be not <I>room enough to receive 
 it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:10">Mal. iii. 10</A>.

 Not that they shall be crowded by their enemies, or straitened for
 room, as Abraham and Lot were, because of the Canaanite in the land. 
 "No, <I>those that swallow thee up,</I> and took possession of thy land 
 when thy possession of it was discontinued, <I>shall be far away.</I> 
 Thy people shall be numerous, and there shall be no stranger, no enemy, 
 among them." Thus the <I>kingdom of God among men,</I> which had been 
 impoverished and almost depopulated, partly by the corruptions of the 
 Jewish church and partly by the abominations of the Gentile world, was 
 again peopled and enriched by the setting up of the Christian church, 
 and by its graces and glories.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That the new converts shall strangely increase and multiply. 
 Jerusalem, after she has lost abundance of her children by the sword, 
 famine, and captivity, shall have a new family growing up instead of 
 them, children which she <I>shall have after she has lost the other</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 as Seth, who was <I>appointed another seed instead of Abel,</I> and 
 Job's children, which God blessed him with instead of those that were 
 killed in the ruins of the house. God will repair his church's losses 
 and secure to himself a seed to serve him in it. It is promised to the 
 Jews, after their return, that <I>Jerusalem shall be full of boys and 
 girls playing in the streets,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:5">Zech. viii. 5</A>.

 The church, after it has lost the Jews, who will be cut off by their
 own infidelity, shall have abundance of children still, more than she 
 had when the Jews belonged to her. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:27">Gal. iv. 27</A>.
 
 They shall be so numerous that,

 (1.) The Children shall complain for want of room; they shall say (and
 it is a good hearing), "Our numbers increase so fast that <I>the place 
 is too strait for us;</I>" as the sons of the prophets complained, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+6:1">2 Kings vi. 1</A>.

 But, strait as the place is, still more shall desire to be admitted,
 and the church shall gladly admit them, and the inconvenient straitness 
 of the place shall be no hindrance to either; for it will be found, 
 whatever we think, that even when the <I>poor and the maimed, the halt 
 and the blind,</I> are brought in, <I>yet still there is room,</I> room 
 enough for those that are in and room for more, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:21,22">Luke xiv. 21, 22</A>.

 (2.) The mother shall stand amazed at the increase of her family,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 She shall say, <I>Who has begotten me these?</I> and, <I>Who has
 brought up these?</I> They come to her with all the duty, affection, 
 and submission of children; and yet she never bore any pain for them, 
 nor took any pains with them, but has them ready reared to her hand. 
 This gives her a pleasing surprise, and she cannot but be astonished at 
 it, considering what her condition had been very lately and very long. 
 The Jewish nation had left her children; they were cut off. She had 
 been desolate, without ark, and altar, and temple-service, those tokens 
 of God's espousals to them; nay, she had been a captive, and 
 continually removing to and fro, in an unsettled condition, and not 
 likely to bring up children either for God or herself. She was left 
 alone in obscurity (<I>this is Zion whom no man seeks after</I>), left 
 in all the solitude and sorrow of a widowed state. How then came she to 
 be thus replenished? See here, 

 [1.] That the church is not perpetually visible, but there are times 
 when it is desolate, and left alone, and made few in number. 

 [2.] That yet on the other hand its desolations shall not be perpetual, 
 nor will it be found too hard for God to repair them, and out of stones 
 to raise up children unto Abraham. 

 [3.] That sometimes this is done in a very surprising way, as when a
 nation is born at once,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:8"><I>ch.</I> lxvi. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. That this shall be done with the help of the Gentiles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 The Jews were cast off, among whom it was expected that the church
 should be built up; but God will <I>sow it to himself in the earth,</I> 
 and will thence reap a plentiful crop, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:23">Hos. ii. 23</A>.
 
 Observe,

 (1.) How the Gentiles shall be called in. God will <I>lift up his hand
 to them,</I> to invite or beckon them, having all the day stretched it 
 out in vain to the Jews,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:2"><I>ch.</I> lxv. 2</A>.

 Or it denotes the exerting of an almighty power, that of his Spirit and
 grace, to compel them to come in, to make them willing. And he will 
 <I>set up his standard to them,</I> the preaching of the everlasting 
 gospel, to which they shall gather, and under which they shall enlist 
 themselves. 

 (2.) How they shall come: <I>They shall bring thy sons in their 
 arms.</I> They shall assist the sons of Zion, which are found among 
 them, in their return to their own country, and shall forward them with 
 as much tenderness as ever any parent carried a child that was weak and 
 helpless. God can raise up friends for returning Israelites even among
 Gentiles. <I>The earth helped the woman,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:16">Rev. xii. 16</A>.

 Or, "When they come themselves, they shall bring their children, and
 make them thy children;" compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:4"><I>ch.</I> lx. 4</A>.

 "Dost thou ask, <I>Who has begotten and brought up these?</I> Know that
 they were begotten and brought up among the Gentiles, but they are now 
 brought into thy family." Let all that are concerned about young 
 converts, and young beginners in religion, learn hence to deal very 
 tenderly and carefully with them, as Christ does with the lambs which 
 he <I>gathers with his arms and carries in his bosom.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That the church shall have a great and prevailing interest in the 
 nations, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>.

 1. Some of the princes of the nations shall become patrons and
 protectors to the church: <I>King shall be thy nursing fathers,</I> to 
 carry thy sons in their arms (as Moses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:12">Num. xi. 12</A>);

 and, because women are the most proper nurses, <I>their queens shall be
 thy nursing mothers.</I> This promise was in part fulfilled to the 
 Jews, after their return out of captivity. Several of the kings of 
 Persia were very tender of their interests, countenanced and encouraged 
 them, as Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes; Esther the queen was a nursing 
 mother to the Jews that remained in their captivity, putting her life 
 in her hand to snatch the child out of the flames. The Christian 
 church, after a long captivity, was happy in some such kings and queens 
 as Constantine and his mother Helena, and afterwards Theodosius, and 
 others, who nursed the church with all possible care and tenderness.
 Whenever the sceptre of government is put into the hands of religious 
 princes, then this promise is fulfilled. The church in this world is in 
 an infant state, and it is in the power of princes and magistrates to 
 do it a great deal of service; it is happy when they do so, when their 
 power is a praise to those that do well.

 2. Others of them, who stand it out against the church's interests, 
 will be forced to yield and to repent of their opposition: <I>They 
 shall bow down to thee and lick the dust.</I> The promise to the church 
 of Philadelphia seems to be borrowed from this 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:9">Rev. iii. 9</A>):

 <I>I will make those of the synagogue of Satan to come and worship
 before thy feet.</I> Or it may be meant of the willing subjection which 
 kings and kingdoms shall pay to Christ the church's King, as he 
 manifests himself in the church

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:11">Ps. lxxii. 11</A>):

 <I>All kings shall fall down before him.</I> And by all this it shall
 be made to appear,

 (1.) That God is the Lord, the sovereign Lord of all, against whom 
 there is no standing out nor rising up. 

 (2.) That those who wait for him, in a dependence upon his promise and 
 a resignation to his will, shall not be made ashamed of their hope; for 
 the vision of peace is for an appointed time, and at the end <I>it 
 shall speak and shall not lie.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. An objection started against the promise of the Jews' release out of 
 their captivity in Babylon, suggesting that it was a thing not to be 
 expected; for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>)

 they were a prey in the hand of the mighty, of such as were then the 
 greatest potentates on earth, and therefore it was not likely they 
 should be rescued by force. Yet that was not all: they were lawful 
 captives; by the law of God, having offended, they were justly 
 delivered into captivity; and by the law of nations, being taken in 
 war, they were justly detained in captivity till they should be 
 ransomed or exchanged. Now this is spoken either, 

 1. By the enemies, as justifying themselves in their refusal to let
 them go. They plead both might and right. Proud men think all their own 
 that they can lay their hands on and their title good if they have but 
 the longest sword. Or,

 2. By their friends, either in a way of distrust, despairing of the 
 deliverance ("for who is able to deal with those that detain us, either 
 by force of arms or a treaty of peace?"), or in a way of thankfulness, 
 admiring the deliverance. "Who would have thought that ever the prey 
 should be <I>taken from the mighty?</I> Yet it is done." This is 
 applicable to our redemption by Christ. As to Satan, we were a prey in 
 the hand of the mighty, and yet delivered even from him that had the 
 power of death, by him that had the power of life. As to the justice of 
 God, we were lawful captives, and yet delivered by a price of 
 inestimable value.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. This objection answered by an express promise, and a further 
 promise; for God's promises being all yea, and amen, they may well 
 serve to corroborate one another. 

 1. Here is an express promise with a
 <I>non-obstante--notwithstanding</I> to the strength of the enemy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 "<I>Even the captives of the mighty,</I> though they are mighty, shall 
 be taken away, and it is to no purpose for them to oppose it; <I>and 
 the prey of the terrible,</I> though they are terrible, shall be 
 delivered; and, as they cannot with all their strength outforce, so 
 they cannot with all their impudence outface, the deliverance, and the 
 counsels of God concerning it." <I>The Lord saith thus,</I> who, having 
 all power and all hearts in his hands is able to make his words good.

 2. Here is a further promise, showing how, and in what way, God will 
 bring about the deliverance. He will bring judgments upon the 
 oppressors, and so will work salvation for the oppressed: "<I>I will 
 contend with him that contends with thee,</I> will plead thy cause 
 against those that justify themselves in oppressing thee; whoever it 
 be, though but a single person, that contends with thee, he shall know 
 that it is at his peril, and thus <I>I will save thy children.</I>" The 
 captives shall be delivered by <I>leading captivity captive,</I> that 
 is, sending those into captivity that had held God's people captive, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:10">Rev. xiii. 10</A>.
 
 Nay, they shall have blood for blood
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 "<I>I will feed those that oppress thee with their own flesh,</I> and 
 <I>they shall be drunken with their own blood.</I> The proud 
 Babylonians shall become not only an easy, but an acceptable, prey to 
 one another. God will send a dividing spirit among them, and their 
 ruin, which was begun by a foreign invasion, shall be completed by 
 their intestine divisions. They shall <I>bite and devour one
 another,</I> till they are <I>consumed one of another.</I> They shall 
 greedily and with delight prey upon those that are their own flesh and 
 blood." God can make the oppressors of his church to be their own 
 tormentors and their own destroyers. The New-Testament Babylon, having 
 made herself drunk with the blood of the saints, shall have <I>blood 
 given her to drink, for she is worthy.</I> See how cruel men sometimes 
 are to themselves and to one another: indeed those who are so to others 
 are so to themselves, for God's justice and men's revenge will mete to 
 them what they have measured to others. They not only thirst after 
 blood, but drink it so greedily that they are drunken with it, and with 
 as much pleasure as if it were sweet wine. If God had not more mercy on 
 sinners than they would have one upon another were their passions let 
 loose, the world would be soon an <I>Aceldama,</I> nay, a 
 desolation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. See what will be the effect of Babylon's ruin: <I>All flesh shall 
 know that I the Lord am thy Saviour.</I> God will make it to appear, to 
 the conviction of all the world, that, though Israel seem lost and cast
 off, they have a Redeemer, and, though they are made a prey to the 
 mighty, Jacob has a mighty One, who is able to deal with all his 
 enemies. God intends, by the deliverances of his church, both to notify 
 and to magnify his own name.</P>
