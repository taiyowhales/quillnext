 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have an answer expected by the prophet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:1">ver. 1</A>),

 and returned by the Spirit of God, to the complaints which the prophet
 made of the violences and victories of the Chaldeans in the close of 
 the foregoing chapter. The answer is,

 I. That after God has served his own purposes by the prevailing power
 of the Chaldeans, has tried the faith and patience of his people, and 
 distinguished between the hypocrites and the sincere among them, he 
 will reckon with the Chaldeans, will humble and bring down, not only 
 that proud monarch Nebuchadnezzar, but that proud monarchy, for their 
 boundless and insatiable thirst after dominion and wealth, for which 
 they themselves should at length be made a prey, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:2-8">ver. 2-8</A>.

 II. That not they only, but all other sinners like them, should perish
 under a divine woe. 

 1. Those that are covetous, are greedy of wealth and honours, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:9,11">ver. 9, 11</A>.

 2. Those that are injurious and oppressive, and raise estates by wrong 
 and rapine, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:12-14">ver. 12-14</A>.

 3. Those that promote drunkenness that they may expose their
 neighbours to shame, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:15-17">ver. 15-17</A>.

 4. Those that worship idols,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and
 will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall
 answer when I am reproved.
 &nbsp; 2 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> answered me, and said, Write the vision, and
 make <I>it</I> plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.
 &nbsp; 3 For the vision <I>is</I> yet for an appointed time, but at the end
 it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it;
 because it will surely come, it will not tarry.

 but the just shall live by his faith.

 Here, 

 I. The prophet humbly gives his attendance upon God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 "<I>I will stand upon my watch,</I> as a sentinel on the walls of a 
 besieged city, or on the borders of an invaded country, that is very 
 solicitous to gain intelligence. I will look up, will look round, will 
 look within, <I>and watch to see what he will say unto me,</I> will 
 listen attentively to the words of his mouth and carefully observe the 
 steps of his providence, that I may not lose the least hint of 
 instruction or direction. <I>I will watch to see what he will say in 
 me</I>" (so it may be read), "what the Spirit of prophecy in me will 
 dictate to me, by way of answer to my complaints." Even in a ordinary 
 way, God not only speaks to us by his word, but speaks in us by our own 
 consciences, whispering to us, <I>This is the way, walk in it;</I> and 
 we must attend to the voice of God in both. The prophet's standing upon 
 his <I>tower,</I> or high place, intimates his prudence, in making use 
 of the helps and means he had within his reach to know the mind of God, 
 and to be instructed concerning it. Those that expect to hear from God 
 must withdraw from the world, and get above it, must raise their 
 attention, fix their thought, study the scriptures, consult experiences 
 and the experienced, continue instant in prayer, and thus set 
 themselves <I>upon the tower.</I> His standing upon his watch intimates 
 his patience, his constancy and resolution; he will wait the time, and 
 weather the point, as a watchman does, but he will have an answer; he 
 will know what God will <I>say to him,</I> not only for his own 
 satisfaction, but to enable him as a prophet to give satisfaction to 
 others, and answer their exceptions, when he is reproved or argued 
 with. Herein the prophet is an example to us. 

 1. When we are tossed and perplexed with doubts concerning the methods
 of Providence, are tempted to think that it is fate, or fortune, and 
 not a wise God, that governs the world, or that the church is 
 abandoned, and God's covenant with his people cancelled and laid aside, 
 then we must take pains to furnish ourselves with considerations proper 
 to clear this matter; we must stand upon our watch against the 
 temptation, that it may not get ground upon us, must set ourselves upon 
 the tower, to see if we can discover that which will silence the 
 temptation and solve the objected difficulties, must do as the 
 psalmist, <I>consider the days of old</I> and make <I>a diligent 
 search</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+77:6">Ps. lxxvii. 6</A>),

 must go into the sanctuary of God, and there labour to understand the
 end of these things

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:17">Ps. lxxiii. 17</A>);

 we must not give way to our doubts, but struggle to make the best of
 our way out of them.

 2. When we have been at prayer, pouring out our complaints and requests
 before God, we must carefully observe what answers God gives by his 
 word, his Spirit, and his providences, to our humble representations; 
 when David says, <I>I will direct my prayer unto thee,</I> as an arrow 
 to the mark, he adds, <I>I will look up,</I> will look after my prayer, 
 as a man does after the arrow he has shot,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+5:3">Ps. v. 3</A>.

 We must <I>hear what God the Lord will speak,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+85:8">Ps. lxxxv. 8</A>.

 3. When we go to read and hear the word of God, and so to consult the
 lively oracles, we must set ourselves to observe what God will thereby 
 <I>say unto us,</I> to suit our case, what word of conviction, caution, 
 counsel, and comfort, he will bring to our souls, that we may receive 
 it, and submit to the power of it, and may consider what we shall 
 answer, what returns we shall make to the word of God, when we are 
 reproved by it. 

 4. When we are attacked by such as quarrel with God and his providence
 as the prophet here seems to have been--beset, besieged, as in a tower, 
 by hosts of objectors--we should consider how to answer them, fetch our 
 instructions from God, hear what he says to us for our satisfaction, 
 and have that ready to say to others, <I>when we are reproved,</I> to 
 satisfy them, as a <I>reason of the hope that is in us</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:15">1 Pet. iii. 15</A>),

 and beg of God <I>a mouth and wisdom,</I> and that it may be <I>given
 us in that same hour what we shall speak.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God graciously gives him the meeting; for he will not disappoint 
 the believing expectations of his people that wait to hear what he will 
 say unto them, but will <I>speak peace,</I> will <I>answer them with 
 good words and comfortable words,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:13">Zech. i. 13</A>.

 The prophet had complained of the prevalence of the Chaldeans, which
 God had given him a prospect of; now, to pacify him concerning it, he 
 here gives him a further prospect of their fall and ruin, as Isaiah, 
 before this, when he had foretold the captivity in Babylon, foretold 
 also the destruction of Babylon. Now, this great and important event 
 being made known to him by a vision, care is taken to publish the 
 vision, and transmit it to the generations to come, who should see the 
 accomplishment of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The prophet must <I>write the vision,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Thus, when St. John had a vision of the New Jerusalem, he was ordered 
 to <I>write,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:5">Rev. xxi. 5</A>.

 He must write it, that he might imprint it on his own mind, and make it 
 more clear to himself, but especially that it might be notified to 
 those in distant places and transmitted to those in future ages. What
 is handed down by tradition is easily mistaken and liable to 
 corruption; but what is written is reduced to a certainty, and 
 preserved safe and pure. We have reason to bless God for written
 visions, that God has written to us the great things of his prophets as 
 well as of his law. He must <I>write the vision,</I> and <I>make it 
 plain upon tables,</I> must write it legibly, in large characters, so 
 that <I>he who runs may read it,</I> that those who will not allow 
 themselves leisure to read it deliberately may not avoid a 
 <I>cursory</I> view of it. Probably, the prophets were wont to write 
 some of the most remarkable of their predictions in tables, and to hang 
 them up in the temple, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:1">Isa. viii. 1</A>.

 Now the prophet is told to <I>write this</I> very <I>plain.</I> Note, 
 Those who are employed in preaching the word of God should study 
 plainness as much as may be, so as to make themselves intelligible to 
 the meanest capacities. The things of our everlasting peace, which God 
 has written to us, are made plain, <I>they are all plain to him that 
 understands</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:9">Prov. viii. 9</A>),

 and they are published with authority; God himself has prefixed his
 <I>imprimatur</I> to them; he has said, <I>Make them plain.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The people must wait for the accomplishment of the <I>vision</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>The vision is yet for an appointed time</I> to come. You shall now 
 be told of your deliverance by the breaking of the Chaldeans' power, 
 and that the time of it is fixed in the counsel and decree of God. 
 <I>There is an appointed time,</I> but it is not near; it is yet to be 
 deferred a great while;" and that comes in here as a reason why it must 
 be written, that it may be reviewed afterwards and the event compared 
 with it. Note, God has an appointed time for his appointed work, and
 will be sure to do the work when the time comes; it is not for us to 
 anticipate his appointments, but to wait his time. And it is a great 
 encouragement to wait with patience, that, though the promised favour 
 be deferred long, it will come at last, and be an abundant recompence 
 to us for our waiting: <I>At the end it shall speak and not lie.</I> We 
 shall not be disappointed of it, for it will come at the time 
 appointed; nor shall we be disappointed in it, for it will fully answer 
 our believing expectations. The promise may seem silent a great while, 
 but at the end it shall speak; and therefore, <I>though it tarry</I> 
 longer than we expected, yet we must continue <I>waiting for it,</I> 
 being assured it will come, and willing to tarry until it does come. 
 The day that God has set for the deliverance of his people, and the 
 destruction of his and their enemies, is a day, 

 (1.) That will surely come at last; it is never adjourned <I>sine 
 die--without fixing another day,</I> but it will without fail come at 
 the fixed time and the fittest time. 

 (2.) It <I>will not tarry,</I> for God <I>is not slack, as some count 
 slackness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:9">2 Pet. iii. 9</A>);

 <I>though it tarry</I> past our time, yet <I>it does not tarry</I> past 
 God's time, which is always the best time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. This vision, the accomplishment of which is so long waited for, will 
 be such an exercise of faith and patience as will try and discover men 
 what they are, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 (1.) There are some who will proudly disdain this vision, whose hearts 
 are so lifted up that they scorn to take notice of it; if God will work 
 for them immediately, they will thank him, but they will not give him 
 credit; their hearts are lifted up towards vanity, and, since God puts 
 them off, they will shift for themselves and not be beholden to him; 
 they think <I>their own hands sufficient for them,</I> and God's 
 promise is to them an insignificant thing. That man's soul that is thus 
 <I>lifted up is not upright in him;</I> it is not right with God, is 
 not as it should be. Those that either distrust or despise God's 
 all-sufficiency will not walk uprightly with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:1">Gen. xvii. 1</A>.
 
 But, 

 (2.) Those who are truly good, and whose hearts are upright with God, 
 will value the promise, and venture their all upon it; and, in 
 confidence of the truth of it, will keep close to God and duty in the 
 most difficult trying times, and will then live comfortably in 
 communion with God, dependence on him, and expectation of him. <I>The 
 just shall live by faith;</I> during the captivity good people shall 
 support themselves, and live comfortably, by faith in these precious 
 promises, while the performance of them is deferred. <I>The just shall 
 live by his faith,</I> by that faith which he acts upon the word of 
 God. This is quoted in the New Testament 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:17,Ga+3:11,Heb+10:38">Rom. i. 17; Gal. iii. 11; Heb. x. 38</A>),

 for the proof of the great doctrine of justification by faith only and
 of the influence which the grace of faith has upon the Christian life.
 Those that are made <I>just by faith shall live,</I> shall be happy 
 here and for ever; while they are here, they live by it; when they come 
 to heaven faith shall be swallowed up in vision.</P>

 man, neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell,
 and <I>is</I> as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto
 him all nations, and heapeth unto him all people:

 people, and hast sinned <I>against</I> thy soul.

 a city by iniquity!

 shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary
 themselves for very vanity?

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet having had orders to <I>write the vision,</I> and the 
 people to wait for the accomplishment of it, the vision itself follows; 
 and it is, as divers other prophecies we have met with, the burden of 
 Babylon and Babylon's king, the same that was said to <I>pass over</I> 
 and <I>offend,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:11"><I>ch.</I> i. 11</A>.

 It reads the doom, some think, of Nebuchadnezzar, who was principally
 active in the destruction of Jerusalem, or of that monarchy, or of the 
 whole kingdom of the Chaldeans, or of all such proud and oppressive 
 powers as bear hard upon any people, especially upon God's people.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The charge laid down against this enemy, upon which the sentence is 
 grounded, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The <I>lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eye,</I> and <I>the pride 
 of life,</I> are the entangling snares of men, and great men 
 especially; and we find him that led Israel captive himself led captive 
 by each of these. For, 

 1. He is sensual and voluptuous, and given to his pleasures: <I>He
 transgresses by wine.</I> Drunkenness is itself a transgression, and is 
 the cause of abundance of transgression. We read of those that <I>err
 through wine,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:7">Isa. xxviii. 7</A>.

 Belshazzar (in whom particularly this prophecy had its accomplishment)
 was in the height of his transgression by wine when the hand-writing 
 upon the wall signed the warrant for his immediate execution, pursuant 
 to this sentence,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:1">Dan. v. 1</A>.

 2. He is haughty and imperious: <I>He is a proud man,</I> and his pride
 is a certain presage of his fall coming on. If great men be proud men, 
 the great God will make them know he is above them. His transgressing 
 by wine is made the cause of his arrogance and insolence: therefore 
 <I>he is a proud man.</I> When a man is drunk, though he makes himself 
 as mean as a beast, yet he thinks himself as great as a king, and 
 prides himself in that by which he shames himself. We find <I>the
 crown of pride</I> upon the head of the <I>drunkards of Ephraim,</I> 
 and a <I>woe</I> to both, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:1">Isa. xxviii. 1</A>.

 3. He is covetous and greedy of wealth, and this is the effect of his
 pride; he thinks himself worthy to enjoy all, and therefore makes it 
 his business to engross all. The Chaldean monarchy aimed to be a 
 universal one. He <I>keeps not at home,</I> is not content with his 
 own, which he has an incontestable title to, but thinks it too little, 
 and so enjoys it not, nor takes the comfort he might in his own palace, 
 in his own dominion. His sin is his punishment, his ambition is his
 perpetual uneasiness. Though the home be a palace, yet to a
 discontented mind it is a prison. He <I>enlarges his desire as
 hell,</I> or <I>the grave,</I> which daily receives the body of the 
 dead, and yet still cries, <I>Give, give;</I> he is <I>as death,</I> 
 which continues to devour, and <I>cannot be satisfied.</I> Note, It is 
 the sin and folly of many who have a great deal of the wealth of this 
 world that they do not know when they have enough, but the more they 
 have the more they would have, and the more eager they are for it. And 
 it is just with God that the desires which are insatiable should still 
 be unsatisfied; it is the doom passed on those that <I>love silver</I> 
 that they shall never be <I>satisfied with it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:10">Eccl. v. 10</A>.

 Those that will not be content with their allotments shall not have the
 comfort of their achievements. This proud prince is still <I>gathering 
 to him all nations, and heaping to him all people,</I> invading their 
 rights, seizing their properties, and they must not be unless they will 
 be his, and under his command. One nation will not satisfy him unless 
 he has another, and then another, and all at last; as those in a lower 
 sphere, to gratify the same inordinate desire, lay <I>house to house, 
 and field to field, that they may be placed alone in the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:8">Isa. v. 8</A>.

 And it is hard to say which is more to be pitied, the folly of such
 ambitious princes as place their honour in enlarging their dominions, 
 and not in ruling them well, or the misery of those nations that are 
 harassed and pulled to pieces by them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The sentence passed upon him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Shall not all these take up a parable against him?</I> His doom 
 is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That, since pride has been his sin, disgrace and dishonour shall be 
 his punishment, and he shall be loaded with contempt, shall be laughed 
 at and despised by all about him, as those that look big, and aim high, 
 deserve to be, and commonly are, when they are brought down and 
 baffled.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That, since he has been abusive to his neighbours, those very 
 persons whom he has abused shall be the instruments of his disgrace: 
 <I>All those shall take up a taunting proverb against him.</I> They 
 shall have the pleasure of insulting over him and he the shame of being 
 trampled upon by them. Those that shall triumph in the fall of this 
 great tyrant are here furnished with a <I>parable,</I> and a 
 <I>taunting proverb,</I> to take up against him. <I>He shall say</I> 
 (he that draws up the insulting ditty shall say thus), <I>Ho, he that 
 increases that which is not his! Aha!</I> what has become of him now? 
 So it may be read in a taunting way. Or, <I>He shall say,</I> that is, 
 <I>the just,</I> who <I>lives by his faith,</I> he to whom the vision 
 is written and made plain, with the help of that shall say this, shall 
 foretel the enemy's fall, even when he sees him flourishing, and 
 <I>suddenly curse his habitation,</I> even when he is <I>taking 
 root,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:3">Job v. 3</A>.
 
 He shall indeed denounce woes against him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Here is a woe against him for increasing his own possessions by 
 invading his neighbour's rights, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:6-8"><I>v.</I> 6-8</A>.

 He <I>increases that which is not his,</I> but other people's. Note, No 
 more of what we have is to be reckoned ours than what we came honestly 
 by; nor will it long be ours, for <I>wealth gotten by vanity will be 
 diminished.</I> Let not those that thrive in the world be too forward 
 to bless themselves in it, for, if they do not thrive lawfully, they 
 are under a woe. See here, 

 [1.] What this prosperous prince is doing; he is <I>lading himself with
 thick clay.</I> Riches are but clay, thick clay; what are gold and 
 silver but white and yellow earth? Those that travel through thick clay 
 are both retarded and dirtied in their journey; so are those that go 
 through the world in the midst of an abundance of the wealth of it; 
 but, as if that were not enough, what fools are those that <I>load 
 themselves with it,</I> as if this trash would be their treasure! They 
 burden themselves with continual care about it, with a great deal of 
 guilt in getting, saving, and spending it, and with a heavy account 
 which they must give of it another day. They overload their ship with
 this thick clay, and so sink it and themselves <I>into destruction and 
 perdition.</I>

 [2.] See what people say of him, while he is thus increasing his 
 wealth; they cry, "<I>How long?</I> How long will it be ere he has 
 enough?" They cry to God, "How long wilt thou suffer this proud 
 oppressor to trouble the nations?" Or they say to one another, "See how 
 long it will last, how long he will be able to keep what he gets thus 
 dishonestly." They dare not speak out, but we know what they mean when 
 they say, <I>How long?</I>

 [3.] See what will be in the end hereof. What he has got by violence 
 from others, others shall take by violence from him. The Medes and 
 Persians shall make a prey of the Chaldeans, as they have done of other 
 nations,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 "There shall be those that will <I>bite thee</I> and <I>vex thee;</I> 
 those from whom thou didst not fear any danger, that seemed 
 <I>asleep,</I> shall <I>rise up</I> and <I>awake</I> to be a plague to 
 thee. They shall rise up <I>suddenly</I> when thou are most secure, and 
 least prepared to receive the shock and ward off the blow. <I>Shall 
 they not rise up suddenly?</I> No doubt they shall, and thou thyself 
 hast reason to expect it, to be dealt with as thou hast dealt with 
 others, that <I>thou shalt be for booties unto them,</I> as others have 
 been unto thee, that, according to the law of retaliation, as <I>thou 
 hast spoiled many nations</I> so thou shalt thyself be <I>spoiled</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 <I>all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee.</I>" The king of 
 Babylon thought he had brought all the nations round about him so low 
 that none of them would be able to make reprisals upon him; but though 
 they were but a remnant of people, a very few left, yet these shall be 
 sufficient to spoil him, when God has such a controversy with him, 
 <I>First,</I> For <I>men's blood,</I> and the thousands of lives that 
 have been sacrificed to his ambition and revenge, especially for the 
 blood of Israelites, which is in a special manner precious to God.
 <I>Secondly, For the violence of the land,</I> his laying waste so many 
 countries, and destroying the fruits of the earth, especially in the 
 land of Israel. <I>Thirdly,</I> For the violence <I>of the city,</I> 
 the many cities that he had turned into ruinous heaps, especially 
 Jerusalem the holy city, and of <I>all that dwelt therein,</I> who were 
 ruined by him. Note, The violence done by proud men to advance and 
 enrich themselves will be called over again (and must be accounted for) 
 another day, by him <I>to whom vengeance belongs.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Here is a woe against him for coveting still more, and aiming to 
 be still higher, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:9-11"><I>v.</I> 9-11</A>.

 The crime for which this woe is denounced is much the same with that in 
 the foregoing article--an insatiable desire of wealth and honour; it is 
 <I>coveting an evil covetousness to his house,</I> that is, grasping at 
 an abundance for his family. Note, Covetousness is a very evil thing in 
 a family; it brings disquiet and uneasiness into it (<I>he that is 
 greedy of gain troubles his own house</I>), and, which is worse, it 
 brings the curse of God upon it and upon all the affairs of it. <I>Woe 
 to him that gains an evil gain;</I> so the margin reads it. There is a 
 lawful gain, which by the blessing of God may be a comfort to a house 
 (<I>a good man leaves an inheritance to his children's children</I>), 
 but what is got by fraud and injustice is ill-got, and will be poor 
 gain, will not only do no good to a family, but will bring poverty and 
 ruin upon it. Now observe, 

 [1.] What this covetous wretch aims at; it is <I>to set his nest on 
 high,</I> to raise his family to some greater dignity than it had 
 before arrived at, or to set it, as he apprehends, out of the reach of 
 danger, that he may be <I>delivered from the power of evil,</I> that it 
 may not be in the power of the worst of his enemies to do him a 
 mischief nor so much as to disturb his repose. Note, It is common for
 men to pretend it as an excuse for their covetousness and ambition that 
 they only consult their own safety, and aim to secure themselves; and 
 yet they do but deceive themselves when they think <I>their wealth</I> 
 will be a <I>strong city</I> to them, <I>and a high wall,</I> for it is 
 so only <I>in their own conceit,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:11">Prov. xviii. 11</A>.

 [2.] What he will get by it: <I>Thou hast consulted,</I> not safety, 
 but <I>shame, to thy house, by cutting off many people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 Note, An estate raised by iniquity is a scandal to a family. Those
 that cut off, or undermine, others, to make room for themselves, that 
 impoverish others to enrich themselves, do but consult shame to their 
 houses, and fasten upon them a mark of infamy. Yet that is not the 
 worst of it: "<I>Thou hast sinned against thy own soul,</I> hast 
 brought that under guilt and wrath, and endangered that." Note, Those 
 that do wrong to their neighbour do a much greater wrong to their own 
 souls. But if the sinner pleads, Not guilty, and thinks he has managed 
 his frauds and violence with so much art and contrivance that they 
 cannot be proved upon him, let him know that if there be no other 
 witnesses against him <I>the stone shall cry out of the wall</I> 
 against him, and <I>the beam out of the timber</I> in the roof <I>shall 
 answer it,</I> shall second it, shall witness it, that the money and 
 materials wherewith he built the house were unjustly gotten, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 The stones and timber cry to heaven for vengeance, as <I>the whole 
 creation groans under</I> the sin of man and waits to be delivered from 
 that <I>bondage of corruption.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Here is a woe against him for building a town and a city by blood 
 and extortion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 He <I>builds a town,</I> and is him-self lord of it; he <I>establishes 
 a city,</I> and makes it his royal seat. So Nebuchadnezzar did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:30">Dan. iv. 30</A>):

 <I>Is not this great Babylon that I have built for the house of the 
 kingdom?</I> But it is built with the blood of his own subjects, whom 
 he has oppressed, and the blood of his neighbours, whom he has unjustly 
 invaded; it is <I>established by iniquity,</I> by the unrighteous laws 
 that are made for the security of it. <I>Woe</I> to him that does so; 
 for the towns and cities thus built can never be established; they will 
 fall, and their founders be buried in the ruins of them. Babylon, which 
 was built by blood and iniquity, did not continue long; its day soon 
 came to fall; and then this woe took effect, when that prophecy, which 
 is expressed as a history

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:9">Isa. xxi. 9</A>),

 proved a history indeed: <I>Babylon has fallen, has fallen!</I> And the
 destruction of that city was, 

 [1.] The shame of the Chaldeans, who had taken so much pains, and were 
 at such a vast expense, to fortify it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Is it not of the Lord of hosts that the people</I> who have laboured 
 so hard to defend that city shall <I>labour in the very fire,</I> shall 
 see the out-works which they confided in the strength of set on fire, 
 and shall labour in vain to save them? Or they, in their pursuits of 
 worldly wealth and honour, put themselves to great fatigue, and ran a 
 great hazard, as those that <I>labour in the fire</I> do. The worst 
 that can be said of the labourers in God's vineyards is that <I>they 
 have borne the burden and heat of the day</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:12">Matt. xx. 12</A>);

 but those that are eager in their worldly pursuits <I>labour in the
 very fire,</I> make themselves perfect slaves to their lusts. There is 
 not a greater drudge in the world than he that is under the power of 
 reigning covetousness. And what comes of it? Though they take a world 
 of pains they are but poorly paid for it; for, after all, <I>they weary 
 themselves for very vanity;</I> they were told it was vanity, and when 
 they find themselves disappointed of it, and disappointed in it, they 
 will own it is worse than vanity, it is <I>vexation of spirit.</I>

 [2.] It was the honour of God, as a God of impartial justice and 
 irresistible power; for by the ruin of the Chaldean monarchy (which all 
 the world could not but take notice of) <I>the earth was filled with 
 the knowledge of the glory of the Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 <I>The Lord is known by</I> these <I>judgments which he executes,</I> 
 especially when he is pleased to <I>look upon proud men and abase 
 them,</I> for he thereby proves himself to be <I>God alone,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:11,12">Job xl. 11, 12</A>.

 See what good God brings out of the staining and sinking of earthly
 glory; he thereby manifests and magnifies his own glory, and <I>fills 
 the earth</I> with the knowledge of it as plentifully as the <I>waters 
 cover the sea,</I> which lie deep, spread far, and shall not be dried 
 up until time shall be no more. Such is the <I>knowledge of the glory 
 of God in the face of Jesus Christ</I> given by the gospel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:6">2 Cor. iv. 6</A>),

 and such was the knowledge of his glory by the miraculous ruin of
 Babylon. Note, Such as will not be taught the knowledge of God's glory 
 by the judgments of his mouth shall be made to know and acknowledge it 
 by the judgments of his hand.</P>

 mayest look on their nakedness!

 for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell

 &nbsp; 18 What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath
 graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The three foregoing articles, upon which the woes here are grounded, 
 are very near akin to each other. The criminals charged by them are 
 oppressors and extortioners, that raise estates by rapine and 
 injustice; and it is mentioned here again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 the very same that was said 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>,

 for that is the crime upon which the greatest stress is laid; it is 
 <I>because of men's blood,</I> innocent blood, barbarously and unjustly 
 shed, which is a provoking crying thing; it is <I>for the violence of 
 the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein,</I> which God 
 will certainly reckon for, sooner or later, as the asserter of right 
 and the avenger of wrong.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But here are two articles more, of a different nature, which carry a 
 <I>woe</I> to all those in general to whom they belong, and 
 particularly to the Babylonian monarchs, by whom the people of God were 
 taken and held captives.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The promoters of drunkenness stand here impeached and condemned. 
 Belshazzar was one of those; he was so, remarkably that very night that 
 the prophecy of this chapter was fulfilled in the period of his life 
 and kingdom, when he <I>drank wine before a thousand</I> of his lords 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:1">Dan. v. 1</A>),

 began the healths, and forced them to pledge him. And perhaps it was
 one reason why the succeeding monarchs of Persia made it a law of their 
 kingdom that <I>in drinking none should compel,</I> but <I>they should 
 do according to every man's pleasure</I> (as we find,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:8">Esth. i. 8</A>),

 because they had seen in the kings of Babylon the mischievous
 consequences of forcing healths and making people drunk. But the woe
 here stands firm and very fearful against all those, whoever they are, 
 who are guilty of this sin at any time, and in any place, from the 
 stately palace (where that was) to the paltry ale-house. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Who the sinner is that is here articled against; it is he that 
 <I>makes his neighbour drunk,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 To give a neighbour drink who is in want, who is thirsty and poor, 
 though it be but a cup of cold water to a disciple, in the name of a 
 disciple, to give drink to weary traveller, nay, and to give strong 
 drink to him that is ready to perish, and wine to those that are heavy 
 of heart, is a piece of charity which is required of us, and shall be 
 recompensed to us. <I>I was thirsty, and you gave me drink.</I> But to 
 give a neighbour drink who has enough already, and more than enough, 
 with design to intoxicate him, that he may expose himself, may talk 
 foolishly, and make himself ridiculous, may disclose his own secret 
 concerns, or be drawn in to agree to a bad bargain for himself--this is 
 abominable wickedness; and those who are guilty of it, who make a 
 practice of it, and take a pride and pleasure in it, are rebels against 
 God in heaven, and his sacred laws, factors for the devil in hell, and 
 his cursed interests, and enemies to men on earth, and their honour and 
 welfare; they are like the son of Nebat, who <I>sinned and made Israel 
 to sin.</I> To entice others to drunkenness, to <I>put the bottle to 
 them,</I> that they may be allured to it by its charms, by <I>looking 
 on the wine when it is red and gives its colour in the cup,</I> or to 
 force them to it, obliging them by the rules of the club (and club-laws 
 indeed they are) to drink so many glasses, and so filled, is to do what 
 we can, and perhaps more than we know of, towards the murder both of 
 soul and body; and those that do so have a great deal to answer 
 for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What the sentence is that is here passed upon him. There is a woe to 
 him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),
 
 and a punishment 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)
 
 that shall answer to the sin.
 
 (1.) Does he put the cup of drunkenness into the hand of his neighbour? 
 The cup of fury, the cup of trembling, the <I>cup of the Lord's right 
 hand,</I> shall be <I>turned unto him;</I> the power of God shall be 
 armed against him. That cup which had gone round among the nations, to 
 make them <I>a desolation, an astonishment, and a hissing,</I> which 
 had made them stumble and <I>fall,</I> so that they could <I>rise no 
 more,</I> shall at length be put into the hand of the king of Babylon, 
 as was foretold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:15,16,18,26,27">Jer. xxv. 15, 16, 18, 26, 27</A>.

 Thus the New-Testament Babylon, which had made the nations drunk with 
 the cup of her fornications, shall <I>have blood given her to drink, 
 for she is worthy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:3,6">Rev. xviii. 3, 6</A>.

 (2.) Does he take a pleasure in putting his neighbour to shame? He 
 shall himself be loaded with contempt: "<I>Thou art filled with shame 
 for glory, with shame instead of glory,</I> or art filled now with 
 shame more than ever thou wast with glory; and the glory thou hast been 
 filled with shall but serve to make thy shame the more grievous to 
 thyself, and the more ignominious in the eyes of others. Thou <I>also 
 shalt drink</I> of the cup of trembling, and shalt expose thyself by 
 thy fear and cowardice, which shall be as the <I>uncovering of thy 
 nakedness,</I> to thy shame; and all about thee shall load thee with 
 disgrace, for <I>shameful spewing shall be on thy glory,</I> on that 
 which thou hast most prided thyself in, thy dignity, wealth, and 
 dominion; those whom thou hast made drunk shall themselves spew upon 
 it. For <I>the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of 
 beasts</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);

 thou shalt be hunted and run down with as much violence as ever any 
 wild beasts in Lebanon were, shall be spoiled as they are, and thy fall 
 made a sport of; for thou art as one of the beasts that made them 
 afraid, and therefore they triumph when they have got the mastery of 
 thee." Or, "It is because of the violence thou hast done to Lebanon, 
 that is, the land of Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+3:25">Deut. iii. 25</A>)
 
 and the temple
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:1">Zech. xi. 1</A>),

 that God now reckons with thee; that is the sin that now covers
 thee."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The promoters of idolatry stand here impeached and condemned; and 
 this also was a sin that Babylon was notoriously guilty of; it was the 
 <I>mother of harlots.</I> Belshazzar, in his revels, <I>praised his 
 idols.</I> And for this, here is a woe against them, and in them 
 against all others that do likewise, particularly the New-Testament 
 Babylon. Now see here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What they do to promote idolatry; they are <I>mad upon their 
 idols;</I> so the Chaldeans are said to be, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:38">Jer. l. 38</A>.
 
 For,

 (1.) They have a great variety of idols, their <I>graven images</I> and
 <I>molten images,</I> that people may take their choice, which they 
 like best.

 (2.) They are very nice and curious in the framing of them: The 
 <I>maker of the work</I> has performed his part admirably well, the 
 <I>fashioner of his fashion</I> (so it is in the margin), that 
 contrived the model in the most significant manner. 

 (3.) They are at great expense in beautifying and adorning them: 
 <I>They lay them over with gold and silver;</I> because these are 
 things people love and dote upon wherever they meet with them, they 
 dress up their idols in them, the more effectually to court the 
 adoration of the children of this world. 

 (4.) They have great expectations from them: <I>The maker of the work 
 trusts therein</I> as his god, puts a confidence in it, and gives 
 honour to it as his god. The worshippers of God give honour to him, by
 offering up their prayers to him, and waiting to receive instructions 
 and directions from him; and these honours they give to their idols.
 
 [1.] They pray to them: <I>They say to the wood, Awake</I> for our 
 relief, "awake to hear our prayers;" and to the dumb stone, 
 "<I>Arise,</I> and save us," as the church prays to her God, <I>Awake, 
 O Lord! arise,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:23">Ps. xliv. 23</A>.

 They own their image to be a god by praying to it. <I>Deliver me, for
 thou art my God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:17">Isa. xliv. 17</A>.

 <I>Deos qui rogat ille facit--That to which a man addresses petitions
 is to him a god.</I>

 [2.] They consult them as oracles, and expect to be directed and 
 dictated to by them: <I>They say to the dumb stone,</I> though it 
 cannot speak, <I>yet it shall teach.</I> What the wicked demon, or no 
 less wicked priest, speaks to them from the image, they receive with 
 the utmost veneration, as of divine authority, and are ready to be 
 governed by it. Thus is idolatry planted and propagated under the 
 specious show of religion and devotion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How the extreme folly of this is exposed. God, by Isaiah, when he 
 foretold the deliverance of his people out of Babylon, largely showed 
 the shameful stupidity and sottishness of idolaters, and so he does 
 here by the prophet, on the like occasion.

 (1.) Their images, when they have made them, are but mere matter, which 
 is the meanest lowest rank of being; and all the expense they are at 
 upon them cannot advance them one step above that. They are wholly void 
 both of sense and reason, lifeless and speechless (the idol is a 
 <I>dumb idol,</I> a <I>dumb stone,</I> and there is <I>no breath at all 
 in the midst of it</I>), so that the most minute animal, that has but 
 breath and motion, is more excellent then they. They have not so much 
 as the spirit of a beast.

 (2.) It is not in their power to do their worshippers any good
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):
 
 <I>What profits the graven image?</I> Though it be mere matter, if it 
 were cast into some other form it might be serviceable to some purpose 
 or other of human life; but, as it is made a god of, it is of no profit 
 at all, nor can do its worshippers the least kindness. Nay, 

 (3.) It is so far from profiting them that it puts a cheat upon them, 
 and keeps them under the power of a strong delusion; they say, <I>It 
 shall teach,</I> but it is a <I>teacher of lies;</I> for it represents 
 God as having a body, as being finite, visible, and dependent, whereas 
 he is a Spirit, infinite, invisible, and independent, and it confirms 
 those that become vain in their imaginations in the false notions they 
 have of God, and makes the idea of God to be a precarious thing, and 
 what every man pleases. If we may say to the <I>works of our hands, You 
 are our gods,</I> we may say so to any of the creatures of our own 
 fancy, though the chimera be ever so extravagant. An image is a 
 <I>doctrine of vanities;</I> it is <I>falsehood,</I> and a <I>work of 
 errors,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:8,14,15">Jer. x. 8, 14, 15</A>.

 It is therefore easy to see what the religion of those is, and what
 they aim at, who recommend those teachers of lies as laymen's books, 
 which they are to study and govern themselves by, when they have locked 
 up from them the book of the scriptures in an unknown tongue.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. How the people of God triumph in him, and therewith support 
 themselves, when the idolaters thus shame themselves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>But the Lord is in his holy temple.</I> 

 (1.) <I>Our rock is not as their rock,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:31">Deut. xxxii. 31</A>.

 Theirs are dumb idols; ours is Jehovah, a living God, who is what he 
 is, and not, as theirs, what men please to make him. He is in his holy 
 temple in heaven, the residence of his glory, where we have access to 
 him in the way, not which we have invented, but which he himself has 
 instituted. Compare
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:3">Ps. cxv. 3</A>,
 
 <I>But our God is in the heavens,</I> and 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+11:4">Ps. xi. 4</A>.

 (2.) The multitude of their gods which they set up, and take so much 
 pains to support, cannot thrust out our God; he is, and will be, in his 
 holy temple still, and glorious in holiness. They have laid waste his 
 temple at Jerusalem; but he has a temple above that is out of the reach 
 of their rage and malice, but within the reach of his people's faith 
 and prayers. 

 (3.) Our God will make all the world silent before him, will strike the 
 idolaters as dumb as their idols, convincing them of their folly, and 
 covering them with shame. He will silence the fury of the oppressors, 
 and check their rage against his people.
