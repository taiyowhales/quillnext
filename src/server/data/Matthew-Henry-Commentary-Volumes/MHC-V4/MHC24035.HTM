 A variety of methods is tried, and every stone turned, to awaken the 
 Jews to a sense of their sin and to bring them to repentance and 
 reformation. The scope and tendency of many of the prophet's sermons 
 was to frighten them out of their disobedience, by setting before them 
 what would be the end thereof if they persisted in it. The scope of 
 this sermon, in this chapter, is to shame them out of their 
 disobedience if they had any sense of honour left in them for a 
 discourse of this nature to fasten upon.

 I. He sets before them the obedience of the family of the Rechabites to
 the commands which were left them by Jonadab their ancestor, and how 
 they persevered in that obedience and would not be tempted from it, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+35:1-11">ver. 1-11</A>.

 II. With this he aggravates the disobedience of the Jews to God and
 their contempt of his precepts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+35:12-15">ver. 12-15</A>.

 III. He foretels the judgments of God upon the Jews for their impious
 disobedience to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+35:16,17">ver. 16, 17</A>.

 IV. He assures the Rechabites of the blessing of God upon them for 
 their pious obedience to their father,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The word which came unto Jeremiah from the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in the days
 of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and
 bring them into the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, into one of the chambers,
 and give them wine to drink.
 &nbsp; 3  Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of
 Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole
 house of the Rechabites;
 &nbsp; 4  And I brought them into the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, into the
 chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God,
 which <I>was</I> by the chamber of the princes, which <I>was</I> above the
 chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door:
 &nbsp; 5  And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots
 full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine.
 &nbsp; 6  But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of
 Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine,
 <I>neither ye,</I> nor your sons for ever:
 &nbsp; 7  Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant
 vineyard, nor have <I>any:</I> but all your days ye shall dwell in
 tents; that ye may live many days in the land where ye <I>be</I>
 strangers.
 &nbsp; 8  Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab
 our father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all
 our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;
 &nbsp; 9  Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we
 vineyard, nor field, nor seed:
 &nbsp; 10  But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done
 according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.
 &nbsp; 11  But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon
 came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to
 Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of
 the army of the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter is of an earlier date than many of those before; for what 
 is contained in it was said and done <I>in the days of Jehoiakim</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+35:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>);

 but then it must be in the latter part of his reign, for it was after 
 the king of Babylon with his army <I>came up into the land</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+35:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),
 
 which seems to refer to the invasion mentioned 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:2">2 Kings xxiv. 2</A>,

 which was upon occasion of Jehoiakim's rebelling against
 Nebuchadnezzar. After the judgments of God had broken in upon this 
 rebellious people he continued to deal with them by his prophets to 
 turn them from sin, that his wrath might turn away from the. For this 
 purpose Jeremiah sets before them the example of the Rechabites, a 
 family that kept distinct by themselves and were no more numbered with 
 the families of Israel than they with the nations. They were originally 
 Kenites, as appears 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:55">1 Chron. ii. 55</A>,

 <I>These are the Kenites that came out of Hemath, the father of the
 house of Rechab.</I> The Kenites, at least those of them that gained a 
 settlement in the land of Israel, were of the posterity of Hobab, 
 Moses's father-in-law,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:16">Judg. i. 16</A>.

 We find them separated from the Amalekites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:6">1 Sam. xv. 6</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:17">Judg. iv. 17</A>.
 
 One family of these Kenites had their denomination from Rechab. His 
 son, or a lineal descendant from him, was Jonadab, a man famous in his 
 time for wisdom and piety. He flourished in the days of Jehu, king of
 Israel, nearly 300 years before this; for there we find him courted by 
 that rising prince, when he affected to appear zealous for God 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:15,16">2 Kings x. 15, 16</A>),

 which he thought nothing more likely to confirm people in the opinion
 of than to have so good a man as Jonadab ride in the chariot with him.
 Now here we are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What the rules of living were which Jonadab, probably by his last 
 will and testament, in writing, and duly executed, charged his 
 children, and his posterity after him throughout all generations, 
 religiously to observe; and we have reason to think that they were such 
 as he himself had all his days observed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They were comprised in two remarkable precepts:--

 (1.) He forbade them to <I>drink wine,</I> according to the law of the 
 Nazarites. Wine is indeed given to <I>make glad the heart</I> of man 
 and we are allowed the sober and moderate use of it; but we are so apt 
 to abuse it and get hurt by it, and a good man, who has his heart made 
 continually glad with the <I>light of God's countenance,</I> has so 
 little need of it for that purpose 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:6,7">Ps. iv. 6, 7</A>),

 that it is a commendable piece of self-denial either not to use it at
 all or very sparingly and medicinally, as Timothy used it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:23">1 Tim. v. 23</A>.

 (2.) He appointed them to <I>dwell in tents,</I> and not to build 
 houses, nor purchase lands, nor rent or occupy either,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+35:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 This was an instance of strictness and mortification beyond what the 
 Nazarenes were obliged to. Tents were mean dwellings, so that this 
 would teach them to be humble; they were cold dwellings, so that this 
 would teach them to be hardy and not to indulge the body; they were 
 movable dwellings, so that this would teach them not to think of 
 settling or taking root any where in this world. They must dwell in
 tents <I>all their days.</I> They must from the beginning thus accustom 
 themselves to endure hardness, and then it would be no difficulty to 
 them, no, not under the decays of old age. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Why did Jonadab prescribe these rules of living to his posterity? It 
 was not merely to show his authority, and to exercise a dominion over 
 them, by imposing upon them what he thought fit; but it was to show his 
 wisdom, and the real concern he had for their welfare, by recommending 
 to them what he knew would be beneficial to them, yet not tying them by 
 any oath or vow, or under any penalty, to observe these rules, but only 
 advising them to conform to this discipline as far as they found it for 
 edification, yet to be dispensed with in any case of necessity, as 
 here, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+35:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 He prescribed these rules to them, 

 (1.) That they might preserve the ancient character of their family, 
 which, however looked upon by some with contempt, he thought its real 
 reputation. His ancestors had addicted themselves to a pastoral life 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:16">Exod. ii. 16</A>),

 and he would have his posterity keep to it, and not degenerate from it,
 as Israel had done, who originally were shepherds and dwelt in tents,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+46:34">Gen. xlvi. 34</A>.

 Note, We ought not to be ashamed of the honest employments of our 
 ancestors, though they were but mean.

 (2.) That they might comport with their lot and bring their mind to 
 their condition. Moses had put them in hopes that they should be 
 naturalized 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:32">Num. x. 32</A>);

 but, it seems they were not; they were still <I>strangers in the
 land</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+35:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),
 
 had no inheritance in it, and therefore must live by their employments, 
 which was a good reason why they should accustom themselves to hard 
 fare and hard lodging; for strangers, such as they were, must not 
 expect to live as the landed men, so plentifully and delicately. Note, 
 It is our wisdom and duty to accommodate ourselves to our place and 
 rank, and not aim to live above it. What has been the lot of our 
 fathers why may we not be content that it should be our lot, and live 
 according to it? <I>Mind not high things.</I> 

 (3.) That they might not be envied and disturbed by their neighbours 
 among whom they lived. If they that were strangers should live great,
 raise estates, and fare sumptuously, the natives would grudge them 
 their abundance, and have a jealous eye upon them, as the Philistines 
 had upon Isaac 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:14">Gen. xxvi. 14</A>),

 and would seek occasions to quarrel with them and do them a mischief;
 therefore he thought it would be their prudence to keep low, for that 
 would be the way to continue long-to live meanly, that they might 
 <I>live many days in the land where they were strangers.</I> Note, 
 Humility and contentment in obscurity are often the best policy and 
 men's surest protection.

 (4.) That they might be armed against temptations to luxury and 
 sensuality, the prevailing sin of the age and place they lived in. 
 Jonadab saw a general corruption of manners; the drunkards of Ephraim 
 abounded, and he was afraid lest his children should be debauched and 
 ruined by them; and therefore he obliged them to live by themselves, 
 retired in the country; and, that they might not run into any unlawful 
 pleasures, to deny themselves the use even of lawful delights. They 
 must be very sober, and temperate, and abstemious, which would 
 contribute to the health both of mind and body, and to their living 
 many days, and easy ones, and such as they might reflect upon with 
 comfort <I>in the land where they were strangers.</I> Note, The 
 consideration of this, that we are strangers and pilgrims, should 
 oblige us to abstain from all fleshly lusts, to live above the things 
 of sense, and look upon them with a generous and gracious contempt. 
 
 (5.) That they might be prepared for times of trouble and calamity.
 Jonadab might, without a spirit of prophecy, foresee the destruction of 
 a people so wretchedly degenerated, and he would have his family 
 provide, that, if they could not <I>in the peace thereof,</I> yet even 
 in the midst of the troubles thereof, <I>they might have peace.</I> Let 
 them therefore have little to lose, and then losing times would be the 
 less dreadful to them: let them sit loose to what they had, and then 
 they might with less pain be stripped of it. Note, Those are in the
 best frame to meet sufferings who are mortified to the world and life a 
 life of self-denial. 

 (6.) That in general they might learn to live by rule and under
 discipline. It is good for us all to do so, and to teach our children
 to do so. Those that have lived long, as Jonadab probably had done
 when he left this charge to his posterity, can speak by experience of 
 the vanity of the world and the dangerous snares that are in the 
 abundance of its wealth and pleasures, and therefore ought to be 
 regarded when they warn those that come after them to stand upon their 
 guard.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How strictly his posterity observed these rules, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+35:8-10"><I>v.</I> 8-10</A>.

 They had in their respective generations all of them <I>obeyed the 
 voice of Jonadab their father,</I> had <I>done according to all that he 
 commanded them.</I> They <I>drank no wine,</I> though they dwelt in a 
 country where was plenty of it; their wives and children drank no wine, 
 for those that are temperate themselves should take care that all under 
 their charge should be so too. They built no houses, tilled no ground, 
 but lived upon the products of their cattle. This they did partly in 
 obedience to their ancestor, and out of a veneration they had for his 
 name and authority, and partly from the experience they themselves had 
 of the benefit of living such a mortified life. See the force of 
 tradition, and the influence that antiquity, example, and great names, 
 have upon men, and how that which seems very difficult will by long 
 usage and custom become easy and in a manner natural. Now, 

 1. As to one of the particulars he had given them in charge, we are 
 here told how in a case of necessity they dispensed with the violation 
 of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+35:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):
 
 <I>When the king of Babylon came into the land</I> with his army, 
 though they had hitherto dwelt in tents, they now quitted their tents, 
 and came and dwelt in Jerusalem, and in such houses as they could 
 furnish themselves with there. Note, The rules of a strict discipline 
 must not be made too strict, but so as to admit of a dispensation when 
 the necessity of a case calls for it, which therefore, in making vows 
 of that nature, it is wisdom to provide expressly for, that the way may 
 be made the more clear, and we may not afterwards be forced to say, 
 <I>It was an error,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:6">Eccles. v. 6</A>.

 Commands of that nature are to be understood with such limitations. 
 These Rechabites would have tempted God, and not trusted him, if they 
 had not used proper means for their own safety in a time of common 
 calamity, notwithstanding the law and custom of their family.

 2. As to the other particular, we are here told how, notwithstanding 
 the greatest urgency, they religiously adhered to it. Jeremiah took 
 them into the temple

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+35:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 into a <I>prophet's chamber,</I> there, rather than into the <I>chamber 
 of the princes,</I> that joined to it, because he had a message from 
 God, which would look more like itself when it was delivered in the 
 <I>chambers of a man of God.</I> There he not only asked the Rechabites 
 whether they would drink any wine, but he set <I>pots full of wine 
 before them,</I> and cups to drink out of, made the temptation as 
 strong as possible, and said, "<I>Drink you wine,</I> you shall have it 
 on free cost. You have broken one of the rules of your order, in coming 
 to live at Jerusalem; why may you not break this too, and when you are 
 in the city do as they there do?" But they peremptorily refused. They 
 all agreed in the refusal. "No, <I>we will drink no wine;</I> for with 
 us it is against the law." The prophet knew very well they would deny 
 it, and, when they did, urged it no further, for he saw they were 
 stedfastly resolved. Note, Those temptations are of no force with men
 of confirmed sobriety which yet daily overcome such as, notwithstanding 
 their convictions, are of no resolution in the paths of virtue.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  Then came the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> unto Jeremiah, saying,
 &nbsp; 13  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell
 the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not
 receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 14  The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded
 his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they
 drink none, but obey their father's commandment: notwithstanding
 I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye
 hearkened not unto me.
 &nbsp; 15  I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets,
 rising up early and sending <I>them,</I> saying, Return ye now every
 man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after
 other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I
 have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined
 your ear, nor hearkened unto me.
 &nbsp; 16  Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed
 the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but
 this people hath not hearkened unto me:
 &nbsp; 17  Therefore thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of hosts, the God of
 Israel; Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the
 inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced
 against them: because I have spoken unto them, but they have not
 heard; and I have called unto them, but they have not answered.
 &nbsp; 18  And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus
 saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have
 obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his
 precepts, and done according unto all that he hath commanded you:
 &nbsp; 19  Therefore thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, the God of Israel;
 Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me
 for ever.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The trial of the Rechabites' constancy was intended but for a sign; now 
 here we have the application of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The Rechabites' observance of their father's charge to them is made 
 use of as an aggravation of the disobedience of the Jews to God. Let 
 them see it and be ashamed. The prophet asks them, in God's name, 
 "<I>Will you not</I> at length <I>receive instruction?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+35:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Will nothing affect you? Will nothing fasten upon you? Will nothing 
 prevail to discover sin and duty to you? You see how obedient the 
 Rechabites are to their father's commandment 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+35:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);

 but <I>you have not inclined your ear to me</I>" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+35:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 though one might much more reasonably expect that the people of God 
 should have obeyed him than that the sons of Jonadab should have obeyed 
 him; and the aggravation is very high, for, 

 1. The Rechabites were obedient to one who was but a man like 
 themselves, who had but the wisdom and power of a man, and was only the 
 father of their flesh; but the Jews were disobedient to an infinite and 
 eternal God, who had an absolute authority over them, as the Father of 
 their spirits. 

 2. Jonadab was long since dead, and was ignorant of them, and could
 neither take cognizance of their disobedience to his orders nor give 
 correction for it; but God lives for ever, to see how his laws are 
 observed, and is in a readiness to revenge all disobedience. 

 3. The Rechabites were never put in mind of their obligations to their 
 father; but God often sent his prophets to his people, to put them in 
 mind of their duty to him, and yet they would not do it. This is 
 insisted on here as a great aggravation of their disobedience: "<I>I 
 have</I> myself <I>spoken to you, rising early and speaking</I> by the 
 written word and the dictates and admonitions of conscience

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+35:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);

 nay, <I>I have sent unto you all my servants the prophets,</I> men like 
 yourselves, whose terrors shall not make you afraid, <I>rising up early 
 and sending them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+35:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 and yet all in vain." 

 4. Jonadab never did that for his seed which God had done for his 
 people. He left them a charge, but left them no estate to bear the 
 charge; but God had given his people a <I>good land,</I> and promised 
 them that, if they would be obedient, they should still dwell in it, so 
 that they were bound both in gratitude and interest to be obedient, and 
 yet they <I>would not hear,</I> they would not <I>hearken.</I> 

 5. God did not tie up his people to so much hardship, and to such 
 instances of mortification, as Jonadab obliged his seed to; and yet 
 Jonadab's orders were obeyed and God's were not.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Judgments are threatened, as often before, against Judah and 
 Jerusalem, for their disobedience thus aggravated. The Rechabites shall 
 rise up in judgment against them, and shall condemn them; for they very 
 punctually <I>performed the commandment of their father,</I> and 
 continued and persevered in their obedience to it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+35:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);

 but <I>this people,</I> this rebellious and gainsaying people, <I>have 
 not hearkened unto me;</I> and therefore 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+35:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 because they have not obeyed the precepts of the word, God will perform 
 the threatenings of it: "<I>I will bring upon them,</I> by the Chaldean 
 army, <I>all the evil pronounced against them</I> both in the law and 
 in the prophets, for <I>I have spoken to them, I have called to 
 them</I>--spoken in a still small voice to those that were near and 
 called aloud to those that were at a distance, tried all ways and means 
 to convince and reduce them--spoken by my word, called by my 
 providence, both to the same purport, and yet all to no purpose; they 
 have not <I>heard</I> nor <I>answered.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Mercy is here promised to the family of the Rechabites for their 
 steady and unanimous adherence to the laws of their house. Though it 
 was only for the shaming of Israel that their constancy was tried, yet, 
 being unshaken, it was <I>found unto praise, and honour, and glory;</I> 
 and God takes occasion from it to tell them that he had favours in 
 reserve for them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+35:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>)

 and that they should have the comfort of them. 

 1. That the family shall continue as long as any of the families of 
 Israel, among whom they were strangers and sojourners. it shall 
 <I>never want a man</I> to inherit what they had, though they had no 
 inheritance to leave. Note, Sometimes those that have the smallest 
 estates have the most numerous progeny; but he that sends mouths will 
 be sure to send meat. 

 2. That religion shall continue in the family: "<I>He shall not want a 
 man to stand before me,</I> to serve me." Though they are neither 
 priests nor levites, nor appear to have had any post in the temple 
 service, yet in a constant course of regular devotion, they stand 
 before God, to minister to him. Note,

 (1.) The greatest blessing that can be entailed upon a family is to 
 have the worship of God kept up in it from generation to generation. 
 
 (2.) Temperance, self-denial, and mortification to the world, do very 
 much befriend the exercises of piety, and help to transmit the 
 observance of them to posterity. The more dead we are to the delights 
 of sense the better we are disposed for the service of God; but nothing 
 is more fatal to the entail of religion in a family than pride and 
 luxury.</P>
