 Still the prophet is attempting to awaken this secure and stubborn 
 people to repentance, by the consideration of the judgments of God that 
 were coming upon them. He is to tell them, 

 I. By the sign of a girdle spoiled that their pride should be stained,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:1-11">ver. 1-11</A>.

 II. By the sign of bottles filled with wine that their counsels should
 be blasted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:12-14">ver. 12-14</A>.

 III. In consideration hereof he is to call them to repent and humble
 themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:15-21">ver. 15-21</A>.

 IV. He is to convince them that it is for their obstinacy and
 incorrigibleness that the judgments of God are so prolonged and brought 
 to extremity,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> unto me, Go and get thee a linen girdle,
 and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water.
 &nbsp; 2  So I got a girdle according to the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and put
 <I>it</I> on my loins.
 &nbsp; 3  And the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me the second time,
 saying,
 &nbsp; 4  Take the girdle that thou hast got, which <I>is</I> upon thy
 loins, and arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of
 the rock.
 &nbsp; 5  So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded me.
 &nbsp; 6  And it came to pass after many days, that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto
 me, Arise, go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence,
 which I commanded thee to hide there.
 &nbsp; 7  Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle
 from the place where I had hid it: and, behold, the girdle was
 marred, it was profitable for nothing.
 &nbsp; 8  Then the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 9  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, After this manner will I mar the pride
 of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 10  This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk
 in the imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to
 serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle,
 which is good for nothing.
 &nbsp; 11  For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I
 caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole
 house of Judah, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; that they might be unto me for a
 people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but
 they would not hear.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A sign, the marring of a girdle, which the prophet had worn for some 
 time, by hiding it in a hole of a rock near the river Euphrates. It was 
 usual with the prophets to teach by signs, that a stupid unthinking 
 people might be brought to consider, and believe, and be affected with 
 what was thus set before them.

 1. He was to wear a linen girdle for some time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 Some think he wore it under his clothes, because it was linen, and it 
 is said to <I>cleave to his loins,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 It should rather seem to be worn upon his clothes, for it was worn for 
 a name and a praise, and probably was a fine sash, such as officers 
 wear and such as are commonly worn at this day in the eastern nations. 
 He must <I>not put it in water,</I> but wear it as it was, that it 
 might be the stronger, and less likely to rot: linen wastes almost as 
 much with washing as with wearing. Being not wet, it was the more stiff 
 and less apt to bend, yet he must make a shift to wear it. Probably it 
 was very fine linen which will wear long without washing. The prophet, 
 like John Baptist, was none of those that wore soft clothing, and 
 therefore it would be the more strange to see him with a linen girdle 
 on, who probably used to wear a leathern one.

 2. After he had worn this linen girdle for some time, he must go, and
 <I>hide it in a hole of a rock</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)

 by the water's side, where, when the water was high, it would be wet, 
 and when it fell would grow dry again, and by that means would soon 
 rot, sooner than if it were always wet or always dry. 

 3. After many days, he must look for it, and he should find it quite
 spoiled, gone all to rags and good for nothing,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 It has been of old a question among interpreters whether this was 
 really done, so as to be seen and observed by the people, or only in a 
 dream or vision, so as to go no further than the prophet's own mind. It 
 seems hard to imagine that the prophet should be sent on two such long 
 journeys as to the river Euphrates, each of which would take him up 
 some week's time, when he could so ill be spared at home. For this 
 reason most incline to think the journey, at least, was only in vision, 
 like that of Ezekiel, from the captivity in Chaldea to Jerusalem 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:3">Ezek. viii. 3</A>)
 
 and thence back to Chaldea

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:24"><I>ch.</I> xi. 24</A>);

 and the explanation of this sign is given only to the prophet himself
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 not to the people, the sign not being public. But there being, it is 
 probable, at that time, great conveniences of travelling between 
 Jerusalem and Babylon, and some part of Euphrates being not so far off 
 but that it was made the utmost border of the land of promise 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:4">Josh. i. 4</A>),

 I see no inconvenience in supposing the prophet to have made two
 journeys thither; for it is expressly said, <I>He did as the Lord 
 commanded him;</I> and thus gave a signal proof of his obsequiousness 
 to his God, to shame the stubbornness of a disobedient people: the toil 
 of his journey would be very proper to signify both the pains they took 
 to corrupt themselves with their idolatries and the sad fatigue of 
 their captivity; and Euphrates being the river of Babylon, which was to 
 be the place of their bondage, was a material circumstance in this 
 sign.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The thing signified by this sign. The prophet was willing to be at 
 any cost and pains to affect this people with the word of the Lord. 
 Ministers must spend, and be spent, for the good of souls. We have the 
 explanation of this sign, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:9-11"><I>v.</I> 9-11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The people of Israel had been to God as this girdle in two
 respects:--

 (1.) He had taken them into covenant and communion with himself: <I>As 
 the girdle cleaves</I> very closely <I>to the loins of a man</I> and 
 surrounds him, <I>so have I caused to cleave to me the houses of Israel 
 and Judah.</I> They were a people near to God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+148:14">Ps. cxlviii. 14</A>);

 they were his own, a peculiar people to him, a kingdom of priests that
 had access to him above other nations. He <I>caused them to cleave</I> 
 to him by the law he gave them, the prophets he sent among them, and 
 the favours which in his providence he showed them. He required their 
 stated attendance in the courts of his house, and the frequent 
 ratification of their covenant with him by sacrifices. Thus they were 
 made so as to cleave to him that one would think they could never have 
 been parted.

 (2.) He had herein designed his own honour. When he took them to be
 <I>to him for a people,</I> it was that they might be to him <I>for a 
 name, and for a praise, and for a glory,</I> as a girdle is an ornament 
 to a man, and particularly the <I>curious girdle of the ephod</I> was 
 to the high-priest <I>for glory and for beauty.</I> Note, Those whom 
 God takes to be to him for a people he intends to be to him for a 
 praise. 

 [1.] It is their duty to honour him, by observing his institutions and
 aiming therein at his glory, and thus adorning their profession. 

 [2.] It is their happiness that he reckons himself honoured in them and 
 by them. He is pleased with them, and glories in his relation to them, 
 while they behave themselves as become his people. He was pleased to 
 take it among the titles of his honour to be <I>the God of Israel,</I> 
 even a <I>God to Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+17:24">1 Chron. xvii. 24</A>.

 In vain do we pretend to be to God for a people if we be not to him for
 a praise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They had by their idolatries and other iniquities loosed themselves 
 from him, thrown themselves at a distance, robbed him of the honour 
 they owed him, buried themselves in the earth, and foreign earth too, 
 mingled among the nations, and were so spoiled and corrupted that they 
 were <I>good for nothing:</I> they could no more be to God, as they 
 were designed, <I>for a name and a praise,</I> for they would not hear 
 either their duty to do it or their privilege to value it: <I>They 
 refused to hear the words of God,</I> by which they might have been 
 kept still cleaving closely to him. <I>They walked in the imagination 
 of their heart,</I> wherever their fancy led them; and denied 
 themselves no gratification they had a mind to, particularly in their 
 worship. They would not <I>cleave to God,</I> but <I>walked after other 
 gods, to serve them,</I> and <I>to worship them;</I> they doted upon 
 the gods of the heathen nations that lay towards Euphrates, so that 
 they were quite spoiled for the service of their own God, and were as 
 <I>this girdle,</I> this rotten girdle, a disgrace to their profession 
 and not an ornament. A thousand pities it was that such a girdle should 
 be so spoiled, that such a people should so wretchedly degenerate.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. God would by his judgments separate them from him, send them into 
 captivity, deface all their beauty and ruin their excellency, so that 
 they should be like a fine girdle gone to rags, a worthless, useless, 
 despicable people. God will after this manner <I>mar the pride of 
 Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.</I> He would strip them of all 
 that which was the matter of their pride, of which they boasted and in 
 which they trusted; it should not only be sullied and stained, but 
 quite destroyed, like this linen girdle. Observe, He speaks of <I>the 
 pride of Judah</I> (the country people were proud of their holy land, 
 their good land), but of <I>the great pride of Jerusalem;</I> there the 
 temple was, and the royal palace, and therefore those citizens were 
 more proud than the inhabitants of other cities. God takes notice of 
 the degrees of men's pride, the pride of some and the great pride of 
 others; and he will mar it, he will stain it. Pride will have a fall, 
 for God resists the proud. He will either mar the pride that is in us 
 (that is, mortify it by his grace, make us ashamed of it, and, like 
 Hezekiah, humble us for the pride of our hearts, the great pride, and 
 cure us of it, great as it is; and this marring of the pride will be 
 making of the soul; happy for us if the humbling providences our hearts 
 be humbled) or else he will mar the thing we are proud of. Parts, 
 gifts, learning, power, external privileges, if we are proud of these, 
 it is just with God to blast them; even the temple, when it became 
 Jerusalem's pride, was marred and laid in ashes. It is the honour of 
 God to <I>took upon every one that is proud and abase him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A judgment threatened against this people that would quite 
 intoxicate them. This doom is pronounced against them in a figure, to 
 make it the more taken notice of and the more affecting 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):
 
 <I>Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, every bottle shall be filled with 
 wine;</I> that is, those that by their sins have made themselves 
 <I>vessels of wrath fitted to destruction</I> shall be filled with the 
 wrath of God as a bottle is with wine; and, as every vessel of mercy 
 prepared for glory shall be filled with mercy and glory, so they shall 
 <I>be full of the fury of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:20">Isa. li. 20</A>);

 and they shall be brittle as bottles; and, like old bottles into which
 new wine is put, they shall burst and be broken to pieces, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:17">Matt. ix. 17</A>.
 
 Or, They shall have their heads as full of wine as bottle are; for so
 it is explained,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>,

 <I>They shall be filled with drunkenness;</I> compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:17">Isa. li. 17</A>.

 It is probable that this was a common proverb among them, applied in
 various ways; but they, not being aware of the prophet's meaning in it, 
 ridiculed him for it: "<I>Do we not certainly know</I> that <I>every 
 bottle shall be filled with wine?</I> What strange thing is there in 
 that? Tell us something that we did not know before." Perhaps they were 
 thus touchy with the prophet because they apprehended this to be a 
 reflection upon them for their drunkenness, and probably it was in part 
 so intended. They <I>loved flagons of wine,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+3:1">Hos. iii. 1</A>.

 Their watchmen were all <I>for wine,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:12">Isa. lvi. 12</A>.

 They loved their false prophets <I>that prophesied to them of wine</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+2:11">Mic. ii. 11</A>),

 that bade them be merry, for that they should never want their bottle
 to make them so. "Well," says the prophet, "you shall have your 
 <I>bottles full of wine,</I> but not such wine as you desire." They 
 suspected that he had some mystical meaning in it which prophesied no 
 good concerning them, but evil; and he owns that so he had. What he 
 meant was this,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That they should be a giddy as men in drink. A drunken man is fitly 
 compared to a bottle or cask full of wine; for, when the wine is in, 
 the wit, and wisdom, and virtue, and all that is good for any thing, 
 are out. Now God threatens 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)

 that shall they shall all be <I>filled with drunkenness;</I> they shall 
 be full of confusion in their counsels, shall falter in all their talk 
 and stagger in all their motions; they shall not know what they say or 
 do, much less what they should say or do. They shall be sick of all 
 their enjoyments and throw them up as drunken men do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:15">Job xx. 15</A>.

 They shall fall into a slumber, and be utterly unable to help
 themselves, and, like men that have drunk away their reason, shall lie 
 at the mercy and expose themselves to the contempt of all about them. 
 And this shall be the condition not of some among them (if any had been 
 sober, they might have helped the rest), but <I>even the kings that sit 
 upon the throne of David,</I> that should have been like their father 
 David, who was <I>wise as an angel of God,</I> shall be thus 
 intoxicated. Their priests and prophets too, their false prophets, that 
 pretended to guide them, were as indulgent of their lusts, and 
 therefore were justly as much deprived of their senses, as any other. 
 Nay, <I>all the inhabitants,</I> both <I>of the land</I> and <I>of 
 Jerusalem</I> were as far gone as they. Whom God will destroy he 
 infatuates.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That, being giddy, they should run upon one another. The cup of the 
 wine of the Lord's fury shall throw them not only into a lethargy, so 
 that they shall not be able to help themselves or one another, but into 
 a perfect frenzy, so that they shall do mischief to themselves and one 
 another 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>I will dash a man against his brother.</I> Not only their drunken 
 follies, but their drunken frays, shall help to ruin them. Drunken men 
 are often quarrelsome, and upon that account they have <I>woe and 
 sorrow</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:29,30">Prov. xxiii. 29, 30</A>);

 so their sin is their punishment; it was so here. God sent an evil 
 spirit into families and neighbourhoods (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:23">Judg. ix. 23</A>),

 which made them jealous of, and spiteful towards, one another; so that
 <I>the fathers and sons</I> went <I>together</I> by the ears, and were 
 ready to pull one another to pieces, which made them all an easy prey 
 to the common enemy. This decree against them having gone forth, God 
 says, <I>I will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy 
 them;</I> for they <I>will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy,</I> but 
 destroy one another; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:15,16">Hab. ii. 15, 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is good counsel given, which, if taken, would prevent this 
 desolation. It is, in short, to <I>humble themselves under the mighty 
 hand of God.</I> If they will <I>hearken and give ear,</I> this is that 
 which God has to say to them, <I>Be not proud,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 This was one of the sins for which God had a controversy with them 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 let them mortify and forsake this sin, and God will let fall his 
 controversy. "<I>Be not proud.;</I> when God speaks to you by his
 prophets do not think yourselves too good to be taught; be not 
 scornful, be not wilful, let not your hearts rise against the word, nor 
 slight the messengers that bring it to you. When God is coming forth 
 against you in his providence (and by them he speaks) be not secure 
 when he threatens, be not impatient when he strikes, for pride is at 
 the bottom of both." It is the great God that has spoken, whose 
 authority is incontestable, whose power is irresistible; therefore bow 
 to what he says, and <I>be not proud,</I> as you have been. They must 
 not be proud, for,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They must advance God, and study how to do him honour: "Give 
 <I>glory to the Lord your God,</I> and not to your idols, not to other 
 gods. Give him glory by confessing your sins, owning yourselves guilty 
 before him, and accepting the punishment of your iniquity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Give him glory by a sincere repentance and reformation." The and not
 till then, we begin to live as we should, and to some good purpose, 
 when we begin to <I>give glory to the Lord our God,</I> to make his 
 honour our chief end and to seek it accordingly. "Do this quickly, 
 while your space to repent is continued to you; <I>before he cause 
 darkness,</I> before you will see no way of escaping." Note, Darkness 
 will be the portion of those that will not repent to <I>give glory to 
 God.</I> When those that by the fourth vial were scorched with heat 
 <I>repented not, to give glory to God.</I> When those that by the 
 fourth vial were scorched with heat <I>repented not, to give glory to 
 God,</I> the next vial filled them with <I>darkness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:9,10">Rev. xvi. 9, 10</A>.
 
 The aggravation of the darkness here threatened is, 

 (1.) That their attempts to escape shall hasten their ruin: <I>Their 
 feet shall stumble</I> when they are making all the haste they can over 
 <I>the dark mountains,</I> and they shall fall, and be unable to get up 
 again. Note, Those that think to out-run the judgments of God will
 find their road impassable; let them make the best of their way, they 
 can make nothing of it, the judgments that pursue them will overtake 
 them; their way is dark and slippery, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:6">Ps. xxxv. 6</A>.

 And therefore, before it comes to that extremity, it is our wisdom to
 give glory to him, and so make our peace with him, to fly to his mercy, 
 and then there will be no occasion to fly from his justice.

 (2.) That their hopes of a better state of things will be disappointed: 
 <I>While you look for light,</I> for comfort and relief, he will 
 <I>turn it into the shadow of death,</I> which is very dismal and 
 terrible, and make it <I>gross darkness,</I> like that of Egypt, when 
 Pharaoh continued to harden his heart, which was darkness that might be 
 felt. The expectation of impenitent sinners perishes when they die and 
 think to have it satisfied.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They must abase themselves, and take shame to themselves; the 
 prerogative of the king and queen will not exempt them from this 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "<I>Say to the king and queen,</I> that, great as they are, they must 
 <I>humble themselves</I> by true repentance, and so give both glory to 
 God and a good example to their subjects." Note, Those that are exalted 
 above others in the world must humble themselves before God, who is 
 higher than the highest, and to whom kings and queens are accountable. 
 They must <I>humble themselves,</I> and <I>sit down</I>--sit down, and 
 consider what is coming--sit down in the dust, and lament themselves. 
 Let them humble themselves, for God will otherwise take an effectual 
 course to humble them: "<I>Your principalities shall come down,</I> the 
 honour and power on which you value yourselves and in which you 
 confide, <I>even the crown of your glory,</I> your <I>goodly or 
 glorious crown:</I> when you are led away captives, where will your 
 principality and all the badges of it be then?" Blessed be God there is 
 a crown of glory, which those shall inherit who do humble themselves, 
 that shall never <I>come down.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. This counsel is enforced by some arguments if they continue proud 
 and unhumbled.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It will be the prophet's unspeakable grief 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 "<I>If you will not hear it,</I> will not submit to the word, but 
 continue refractory, not only my eye, but <I>my soul shall weep in 
 secret places.</I>" Note, The obstinacy of people, in refusing to hear 
 the word of God, will be heart-breaking to the poor ministers, who know 
 something of the terrors of the Lord and the worth of souls, and are so 
 far from desiring that they tremble at the thoughts of the death of 
 sinners. His grief for it was undissembled (his <I>soul wept</I>) and 
 void of affectation, for he chose to weep <I>in secret places,</I> 
 where no eye saw him but his who is all eye. He would mingle his tears 
 not only with his public preaching, but with his private devotions. 
 Nay, thoughts of their case would make him melancholy, and he would 
 become a perfect recluse. It would grieve him, 

 (1.) To see their sins unrepented of: "<I>My soul shall weep for your 
 pride,</I> your haughtiness, and stubbornness, and vain confidence." 
 Note, The sins of others should be matter of sorrow to us. We must 
 mourn for that which we cannot mend, and mourn the more for it because 
 we cannot mend it.

 (2.) To see their calamity past redress and remedy: "<I>My eyes shall 
 weep sorely,</I> not so much because my relations, friends, and 
 neighbours are in distress, but <I>because the Lord's flock,</I> his 
 people and the sheep of his pasture, <I>are carried away captive.</I>" 
 That should always grieve us most by which God's honour suffers and the 
 interest of his kingdom is weakened.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It will be their own inevitable ruin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:19-21"><I>v.</I> 19-21</A>.

 (1.) The land shall be laid waste: <I>The cities of the south shall be 
 shut up.</I> The cities of Judah lay in the southern part of the land 
 of Canaan; these shall be straitly besieged by the enemy, so that there 
 shall be no going in or out, or they shall be deserted by the 
 inhabitants, that there shall be none to go in and out. Some understand 
 it of the cities of Egypt, which was south from Judah; the places there 
 whence they expected succours shall fail them, and they shall find no 
 access to them. 

 (2.) The inhabitants shall be hurried away into a foreign country, 
 there to live in slavery: <I>Judah shall be carried away captive.</I> 
 Some were already carried off, which they hoped might serve to answer 
 the prediction, and that the residue should still be left; but no: 
 <I>It shall be carried away all of it.</I> God will make a full end 
 with them: <I>It shall be wholly carried away.</I> So it was in the 
 last captivity under Zedekiah, because they repented not. 

 (3.) The enemy was now at hand that should do this

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 "<I>Lift up your eyes.</I> I see upon their march, and you may if you 
 will <I>behold, those that come from the north,</I> from the land of 
 the Chaldeans; see how fast they advance, how fierce they appear." Upon 
 this he addresses himself to the king, or rather (because the pronouns 
 are feminine) to the city or state. 

 [1.] "What will you do now with the people who are committed to your
 charge, and whom you ought to protect? <I>Where is the flock that was
 given thee, thy beautiful flock?</I> Whither canst thou take them now 
 for shelter? How can they escape these ravening wolves?" Magistrates 
 must look upon themselves as shepherds, and those that are under their 
 charge as their flock, which they are entrusted with the care of and 
 must give an account of; they must take delight in them as their 
 beautiful flock, and consider what to do for their safety in times of 
 public danger. Masters of families, who neglect their children and 
 suffer them to perish for want of a good education, and ministers who 
 neglect their people, should think they hear God putting this question 
 to them: <I>Where is the flock that was given thee</I> to feed, <I>that 
 beauteous flock?</I> It is starved; it is left exposed to the beasts of 
 prey. What account wilt thou give of them when the chief shepherd shall 
 appear? 

 [2.] "What have you to object against the equity of God's proceedings? 
 <I>What will thou say when he shall visit upon thee</I> the former 
 days?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Thou canst say nothing, but that <I>God is just in all that is brought 
 upon thee.</I>" Those that flatter themselves with hopes of impunity, 
 what will they say? What confusion will cover their faces when they 
 shall find themselves deceived and that God punishes them! 

 [3.] "What thoughts will you now have of your own folly, in giving the
 Chaldeans such power over you, by seeking to them for assistance, and 
 joining in league with them? Thus <I>thou hast taught them against 
 thyself to be captains</I> and to <I>become the head.</I>" Hezekiah 
 began when he showed his treasures to the ambassadors of the king of 
 Babylon, tempting him thereby to come and plunder him. Those who, 
 having a God to trust to, court foreign alliances and confide in them, 
 do but make rods for themselves and teach their neighbours how to 
 become their masters. 

 [4.] "How will you bear the trouble that is at the door? <I>Shall not
 sorrows take thee as a woman in travail?</I> Sorrows which thou canst 
 not escape nor put off, extremity of sorrows; and in these respects 
 more grievous than those of a woman in travail that they were not 
 expected before, and that there is no manchild to be born, the joy of 
 which shall make them afterwards to be forgotten."</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>22  And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore come these things
 upon me? For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts
 discovered, <I>and</I> thy heels made bare.
 &nbsp; 23  Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?
 <I>then</I> may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.
 &nbsp; 24  Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth
 away by the wind of the wilderness.
 &nbsp; 25  This <I>is</I> thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me,
 saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in
 falsehood.
 &nbsp; 26  Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy
 shame may appear.
 &nbsp; 27  I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the
 lewdness of thy whoredom, <I>and</I> thine abominations on the hills
 in the fields. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! wilt thou not be made
 clean? when <I>shall it</I> once <I>be?</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Ruin threatened as before, that the Jews shall go into captivity, 
 and fall under all the miseries of beggary and bondage, shall be 
 stripped of their clothes, <I>their skirts discovered</I> for want of 
 upper garments to cover them, and their <I>heels made bare</I> for want 
 of shoes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Thus they used to deal with prisoners taken in war, when they drove 
 them into captivity, <I>naked and barefoot,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+20:4">Isa. xx. 4</A>.

 Being thus carried off into a strange country, they shall be scattered
 there, <I>as the stubble that is blown away by the wind of the 
 wilderness,</I> and nobody is concerned to bring it together again,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 If the stubble escape the fire, it shall be carried away by the wind. 
 If one judgment do not do the work, another shall, with those that by 
 sin have made themselves as stubble. They shall be stripped of all 
 their ornaments and exposed to shame, as harlots that are carted, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 They made their pride appear, but God will <I>make their shame 
 appear;</I> so that those who have doted on them shall be ashamed of 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. An enquiry made by the people into the cause of this ruin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 Thou wilt <I>say in thy heart</I> (and God knows how to give a proper 
 answer to what men say in their hearts, though they do not speak it 
 out; <I>Jesus, knowing their thoughts,</I> replied to <I>them,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:4">Matt. ix. 4</A>),

 <I>Wherefore came these things upon me?</I> The question is supposed to
 come into the heart,

 1. Of a sinner quarrelling with God and refusing to receive correction.
 They could not see that they had done any thing which might justly 
 provoke God to be thus angry with them. They durst not speak it out; 
 but in their hearts they thus charged God with unrighteousness, if he 
 had <I>laid upon them more than was meet.</I> They seek for the cause 
 of their calamities, when, if they had not been willfully blind, they 
 might easily have seen it. Or, 

 2. Of a sinner returning to God. If there come but a penitent thought 
 into the heart at any time (saying, <I>What have I done?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:6"><I>ch.</I> viii. 6</A>,

 wherefore am I in affliction? why doth God contend with me?) God takes 
 notice of it, and is ready by his Spirit to impress the conviction, 
 that, sin being discovered, it may be repented of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. An answer to this enquiry. God will be justified when he speaks 
 and will oblige us to justify him, and therefore will set the sin of 
 sinners in order before them. Do they ask, <I>Wherefore come these 
 things upon us?</I> Let them know it is all owing to themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is for the greatness of their iniquities, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 God does not take advantage against them for small faults; no, the sins 
 for which he now punishes them are of the first rate, very heinous in 
 their own nature and highly aggravated--for <I>the multitude of thy 
 iniquity</I> (so it may be read), sins of every kind and often repeated 
 and relapsed into. Some think we are more in danger from the multitude 
 of our smaller sins than from the heinousness of our greater sins; of 
 both we may say, <I>Who can understand his errors?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It is for their obstinacy in sin, their being so long accustomed to 
 it that there was little hope left of their being reclaimed from it 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>Can the Ethiopian change his skin,</I> that is by nature black, or 
 the <I>leopard his spots,</I> that are even woven into the skin? Dirt
 contracted may be washed off, but we cannot alter the natural colour of 
 a hair 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:36">Matt. v. 36</A>),

 much less of the skin; and so impossible is it, morally impossible, to
 reclaim and reform these people.

 (1.) They had been long <I>accustomed to do evil.</I> They were taught 
 to do evil; they had been educated and brought up in sin; they had 
 served an apprenticeship to it, and had all their days made a trade of 
 it. It was so much their constant practice that it had become a second 
 nature to them. 

 (2.) Their prophets therefore despaired of ever bring them to do good. 
 This was what they aimed at; they persuaded them to cease to do evil 
 and learn to do well, but could not prevail. They had so long been used 
 to do evil that it was next to impossible for them to repent, and 
 amend, and begin to do good. Note, Custom in sin is a very great 
 hindrance to conversion from sin. The disease that is inveterate is 
 generally thought incurable. Those that have been long accustomed to 
 sin have shaken off the restraint of fear and shame; their consciences 
 are seared; the habits of sin are confirmed; it pleads prescription; 
 and it is just with God to give those up to their own hearts' lusts 
 that have long refused to give themselves up to his grace. Sin is the
 blackness of the soul, the deformity of it; it is its spot, the 
 discolouring of it; it is natural to us, we were shapen in it, so that 
 we cannot get clear of it by any power of our own. But there is an 
 almighty grace that is able to change the Ethiopian's skin, and that 
 grace shall not be wanting to those who in a sense of their need of it 
 seek it earnestly and improve it faithfully.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. It is for their treacherous departures from the God of truth and 
 dependence on lying vanities 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 "<I>This is thy lot,</I> to be scattered and driven away; this is 
 <I>the portion of thy measures from me,</I> the punishment assigned 
 thee as by line and measure; this shall be thy share of the miseries of 
 this world; expect it, and think not to escape it: it is <I>because 
 thou hast forgotten me,</I> the favours I have bestowed upon thee and 
 the obligations thou art under to me; thou hast no sense, no 
 remembrance, of these." Forgetfulness of God is at the bottom of all 
 sin, as the remembrance of our Creator betimes is the happy and hopeful 
 beginning of a holy life. "Having <I>forgotten me, thou hast trusted in 
 falsehood,</I> in idols, in an arm of flesh in Egypt and Assyria, in 
 the self-flatteries of a deceitful heart." Whatever those trust to that 
 forsake God, they will find it a <I>broken reed,</I> a <I>broken 
 cistern.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. It is for their idolatry, their spiritual whoredom, that sin which 
 is of all sins most provoking to the <I>jealous God.</I> They are 
 exposed to a shameful calamity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>)

 because they have been guilty of a shameful iniquity and yet are 
 shameless in it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 "<I>I have seen thy adulteries</I> (thy inordinate fancy for strange 
 gods, which thou hast been impatient for the gratification of, and hast 
 even <I>neighed</I> after it), even the <I>lewdness of thy 
 whoredoms,</I> thy impudence and insatiableness in them, thy eager 
 worshipping of idols <I>on the hills in the fields,</I> upon the high 
 places. This is that for which a <I>woe</I> is denounced against thee, 
 <I>O Jerusalem!</I> nay, and many woes."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Here is an affectionate expostulation with them, in the close, upon 
 the whole matter. Though it was adjudged next to impossible for them to 
 be brought to do good 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 yet while there is life there is hope, and therefore still he reasons 
 with them to bring them to repentance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 1. He reasons with them concerning the thing itself: <I>Wilt thou not 
 be made clean?</I> Note, It is the great concern of those who are 
 polluted by sin to be made clean by repentance, and faith, and a 
 universal reformation. The reason why sinners are not made clean is 
 because they will not be made clean; and herein they act most 
 unreasonably: "<I>Wilt thou not be made clean?</I> Surely thou will at 
 length be persuaded to <I>wash thee, and make thee clean,</I> and so be 
 wise for thyself." 

 2. Concerning the time of it: <I>When shall it once be?</I> Note, It is 
 an instance of the wonderful grace of God that he desires the 
 repentance and conversion of sinners, and thinks the time long till 
 they are brought to relent; but it is an instance of the wonderful 
 folly of sinners that they put that off from time to time which is of 
 such absolute necessity that, if it be not done some time, they are 
 certainly undone for ever. They do not say that they will never be
 cleansed, but not yet; they will defer it to a more convenient season, 
 but cannot tell us when it shall once be.</P>
