 In this chapter we have, 

 I. Jeremiah imprisoned for foretelling the destruction of Jerusalem and
 the captivity of king Zedekiah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. We have him buying land, by divine appointment, as an assurance
 that in due time a happy end should be put to the present troubles, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:6-15">ver. 6-15</A>.

 III. We have his prayer, which he offered up to God upon that occasion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:16-25">ver. 16-25</A>.

 IV. We have a message which God thereupon entrusted him to deliver to
 the people.

 1. He must foretel the utter destruction of Judah and Jerusalem for
 their sins, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:26-35">ver. 26-35</A>.
 
 But,

 2. At the same time he must assure them that, though the destruction
 was total, it should not be final, but that at length their posterity 
 should recover the peaceable possession of their own land, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:36-44">ver. 36-44</A>.
 
 The predictions of this chapter, both threatenings and promises, are
 much the same with what we have already met with again and again, but 
 here are some circumstances that are very particular and 
 remarkable.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The word that came to Jeremiah from the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in the tenth
 year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which <I>was</I> the eighteenth year
 of Nebuchadrezzar.
 &nbsp; 2  For then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem: and
 Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison,
 which <I>was</I> in the king of Judah's house.
 &nbsp; 3  For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore
 dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Behold, I will
 give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall
 take it;
 &nbsp; 4  And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand
 of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of
 the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and
 his eyes shall behold his eyes;
 &nbsp; 5  And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be
 until I visit him, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: though ye fight with the
 Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper.
 &nbsp; 6  And Jeremiah said, The word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 7  Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come
 unto thee, saying, Buy thee my field that <I>is</I> in Anathoth: for
 the right of redemption <I>is</I> thine to buy <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 8  So Hanameel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the
 prison according to the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and said unto me, Buy
 my field, I pray thee, that <I>is</I> in Anathoth, which <I>is</I> in the
 country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance <I>is</I> thine, and
 the redemption <I>is</I> thine; buy <I>it</I> for thyself. Then I knew that
 this <I>was</I> the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 9  And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that <I>was</I>
 in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, <I>even</I> seventeen shekels
 of silver.
 &nbsp; 10  And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed <I>it,</I> and took
 witnesses, and weighed <I>him</I> the money in the balances.
 &nbsp; 11  So I took the evidence of the purchase, <I>both</I> that which
 was sealed <I>according</I> to the law and custom, and that which was
 open:
 &nbsp; 12  And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son
 of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine
 uncle's <I>son,</I> and in the presence of the witnesses that
 subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat
 in the court of the prison.
 &nbsp; 13  And I charged Baruch before them, saying,
 &nbsp; 14  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these
 evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed,
 and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen
 vessel, that they may continue many days.
 &nbsp; 15  For thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses
 and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It appears by the date of this chapter that we are now coming very nigh 
 to that fatal year which completed the desolations of Judah and 
 Jerusalem by the Chaldeans. God's judgments came gradually upon them, 
 but, they not meeting him by repentance in the way of his judgments, he 
 proceeded in his controversy till all was laid waste, which was in the 
 eleventh year of Zedekiah; now what is here recorded happened in the 
 tenth. The king of Babylon's army had now invested Jerusalem and was 
 carrying on the siege with vigour, not doubting but in a little time to 
 make themselves masters of it, while the besieged had taken up a 
 desperate resolution not to surrender, but to hold out to the last 
 extremity. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Jeremiah prophesies that both the city and the court shall fall into 
 the hands of the king of Babylon. He tells them expressly that the 
 besiegers shall take the city as a prize, for God, whose city it was in 
 a peculiar manner, will give it into their hands and put it out of his 
 protection 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),--

 that, though Zedekiah attempt to make his escape, he shall be
 overtaken, and shall be delivered a prisoner into the hands of 
 Nebuchadnezzar, shall be brought into his presence, to his great 
 confusion and terror, he having made himself so obnoxious by breaking 
 his faith with him, he shall hear the king of Babylon pronounce his 
 doom, and see with what fury and indignation he will look upon him 
 (<I>His eyes shall behold his eyes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),--

 that Zedekiah shall be carried to Babylon, and continue a miserable 
 captive there, <I>until God visit him,</I> that is, till God put an end 
 to his life by a natural death, as Nebuchadnezzar had long before put 
 an end to his days by putting out his eyes. Note, Those that live in 
 misery may be truly said to be visited in mercy when God by death takes 
 them home to himself. And, <I>lastly,</I> he foretels that all their 
 attempts to force the besiegers from their trenches shall be 
 ineffectual: <I>Though you fight with the Chaldeans, you shall not 
 prosper;</I> how should they, when God did not fight for them?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:2,3"><I>ch.</I> xxxiv. 2, 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. For prophesying thus he is imprisoned, not in the common gaol, but 
 in the more creditable prison that was within the verge of the palace, 
 <I>in the king of Judah's house,</I> and there not closely confined, 
 but in <I>custodia libera--in the court of the prison,</I> where he
 might have good company, good air, and good intelligence brought him, 
 and would be sheltered from the abuses of the mob; but, however, it was 
 a prison, and Zedekiah shut him up in it for prophesying as he did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 So far was he from <I>humbling himself before Jeremiah,</I> as he ought
 to have done 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:12">2 Chron. xxxvi. 12</A>),

 that he <I>hardened himself</I> against him. Though he had formerly so
 far owned him to be a prophet as to desire him to <I>enquire of the 
 Lord for them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+21:2"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 2</A>),

 yet now he chides him for prophesying

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and shuts him up in prison, perhaps not with design to punish him any
 further, but only to restrain him from prophesying any further, which 
 was crime enough. Silencing God's prophets, though it is not so bad as 
 mocking and killing them, is yet a great affront to the God of heaven. 
 See how wretchedly the hearts of sinners are hardened by the 
 deceitfulness of sin. Persecution was one of the sins for which God was 
 now contending with them, and yet Zedekiah persists in it even now that 
 he was in the depth of distress. No providences, no afflictions, will
 of themselves part between men and their sins, unless the grace of God 
 work with them. Nay, some are made worse by those very judgments that 
 should make them better.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Being in prison, he purchases from a near relation of his a piece 
 of ground that lay in Anathoth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>,

 &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. One would not have expected, 

 (1.) That a prophet should concern himself so far in the business of 
 this world; but why not? Though ministers must not entangle themselves, 
 yet they may concern themselves in the affairs of this life. 

 (2.) That one who had neither wife nor children should buy land. We 
 find 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:2"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 2</A>)

 that he had no family of his own; yet he may purchase for his own use
 while he lives, and leave it to the children of his relations when he 
 dies.

 (3.) One would little have thought that a prisoner should be a 
 purchaser; how should he get money beforehand to buy land with? It is 
 probably that he lived frugally, and saved something out of what 
 belonged to him as a priest, which is no blemish at all to his 
 character; but we have no reason to think that the people were kind, or 
 that his being beforehand was owing to their generosity. Nay,

 (4.) It was most strange of all that he should buy a <I>piece of
 land</I> when he himself knew that the whole land was now to be laid 
 waste and fall into the hands of the Chaldeans, and then what good 
 would this do him? But it was the will of God that he should buy it,
 and he submitted, though the money seemed to be thrown away. His 
 kinsman came to offer it to him; it was not of his own seeking; he 
 coveted not to lay house to house and field to field, but Providence 
 brought it to him, and it was probably a good bargain; besides, the 
 <I>right of redemption</I> belonged to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and if he refused he would not do the kinsman's part. It is true he 
 might lawfully refuse, but, being a prophet, in a thing of this nature 
 he must do that which would be for the honour of his profession. <I>It 
 became him to fulfil all righteousness.</I> It was land that lay within 
 the suburbs of a priests' city, and, if he should refuse it, there was 
 danger lest, in these times of disorder, it might be sold to one of 
 another tribe, which was contrary to the law, to prevent which it was 
 convenient for him to buy it. It would likewise be a kindness to his 
 kinsman, who probably was at this time in great want of money. Jeremiah 
 had but a little, but what he had he was willing to lay out in such a 
 manner as might tend most to the honour of God and the good of his 
 friends and country, which he preferred before his own private 
 interests.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Two things may be observed concerning this purchase:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How fairly the bargain was made. When Jeremiah knew by Hanameel's 
 coming to him, as God had foretold he would, that <I>it was the word of 
 the Lord,</I> that it was his mind that he should make this purchase, 
 he made no more difficulty of it, but <I>bought the field.</I> And, 

 [1.] He was very honest and exact in paying the money. He <I>weighted
 him the money,</I> did not press him to take it upon his report, though 
 he was his near kinsman, but weighed it to him, current money. It was 
 <I>seventeen shekels of silver,</I> amounting to about forty shillings 
 of our money. The land was probably but a little field and of small 
 yearly value, when the purchase was so low; besides, the <I>right of 
 inheritance</I> was in Jeremiah, so that he had only to buy out his 
 kinsman's life, the reversion being his already. Some think this was 
 only the earnest of a greater sum; but we shall not wonder at the 
 smallness of the price if we consider what scarcity there was of money 
 at this time and how little lands were counted upon. 

 [2.] He was very prudent and discreet in preserving the writings. They 
 were subscribed <I>before witnesses.</I> One copy was <I>sealed up,</I> 
 the other was <I>open.</I> One was the original, the other the 
 counterpart; or perhaps that which was <I>sealed up</I> was for his own 
 private use, the other that was <I>open</I> was to be laid up in the 
 public register of conveyances, for any person concerned to consult. 
 Due care and caution in things of this nature might prevent a great 
 deal of injustice and contention. The deeds of purchase were lodged in 
 the hands of Baruch, before witnesses, and he was ordered to lay them 
 up in an <I>earthen vessel</I> (an emblem of the nature of all the 
 securities this world can pretend to give us, brittle things and soon 
 broken), that they might <I>continue many days,</I> for the use of 
 Jeremiah's heirs, after the return out of captivity; for they might 
 then have the benefit of this purchase. Purchasing reversions may be a 
 kindness to those that come after us, and a good man thus <I>lays up an 
 inheritance for his children's children.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What was the design of having this bargain made. It was to signify 
 that though Jerusalem was now besieged, and the whole country was 
 likely to be laid waste, yet the time should come when <I>houses, and 
 fields, and vineyards should be again possessed in this land,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 As God appointed Jeremiah to confirm his predictions of the approaching 
 destruction of Jerusalem by his own practice in living unmarried, so he 
 now appointed him to confirm his predictions of the future restoration 
 of Jerusalem by his own practice in purchasing this field. Note, It 
 concerns ministers to make it to appear in their whole conversation 
 that they do themselves believe that which they preach to others; and 
 that they may do so, and impress it the more deeply upon their hearers, 
 they must many a time deny themselves, as Jeremiah did in both these 
 instances. God having promised that this land should again come into 
 the possession of his people, Jeremiah will, on behalf of his heirs, 
 put in for a share. Note, It is good to manage even our worldly affairs 
 in faith, and to do common business with an eye to the providence and 
 promise of God. Lucius Florus relates it as a great instance of the 
 bravery of the Roman citizens that in the time of the second Punic war, 
 when Hannibal besieged Rome and was very near making himself master of 
 it, a field on which part of his army lay, being offered to sale at 
 that time, was immediately purchased, in a firm belief that the Roman 
 valour would raise the siege, <I>lib. ii. cap.</I>

 6. And have not we much more reason to venture our all upon the word
 of God, and to embark in Zion's interests, which will undoubtedly be 
 the prevailing interests at last? <I>Non si male nunc et olim sic 
 erit--Though now we suffer, we shall not suffer always.</I></P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto
 Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, saying,
 &nbsp; 17  Ah Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth
 by thy great power and stretched out arm, <I>and</I> there is nothing
 too hard for thee:
 &nbsp; 18  Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest
 the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children
 after them: the Great, the Mighty God, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, <I>is</I>
 his name,
 &nbsp; 19  Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes <I>are</I>
 open upon all the ways of the sons of men: to give every one
 according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:
 &nbsp; 20  Which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt,
 <I>even</I> unto this day, and in Israel, and among <I>other</I> men; and
 hast made thee a name, as at this day;
 &nbsp; 21  And hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of
 Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and
 with a stretched out arm, and with great terror;
 &nbsp; 22  And hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to
 their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;
 &nbsp; 23  And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy
 voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all
 that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all
 this evil to come upon them:
 &nbsp; 24  Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it;
 and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight
 against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the
 pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and,
 behold, thou seest <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 25  And thou hast said unto me, O Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, Buy thee the field
 for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the
 hand of the Chaldeans.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Jeremiah's prayer to God upon occasion of the discoveries 
 God had made to him of his purposes concerning this nation, to pull it 
 down, and in process of time to build it up again, which puzzled the 
 prophet himself, who, though he delivered his messages faithfully, yet, 
 in reflecting upon them, was greatly at a loss within himself how to 
 reconcile them; in that perplexity he poured out his soul before God in 
 prayer, and so gave himself ease. That which disturbed him was not the 
 bad bargain he seemed to have made for himself in purchasing a field 
 that he was likely to have no good of, but the case of his people, for 
 whom he was still a kind and faithful intercessor, and he was willing 
 to hope that, if God had so much mercy in store for them hereafter as 
 he had promised, he would not proceed with so much severity against 
 them now as he had threatened. Before Jeremiah went to prayer he 
 delivered the deeds that concerned his new purchase to Baruch, which 
 may intimate to us that when we are going to worship God we should get 
 our minds as clear as may be from the cares and incumbrances of this 
 world. Jeremiah was in prison, in distress, in the dark about the 
 meaning of God's providences, and then he prays. Note, Prayer is a 
 salve for every sore. Whatever is a burden to us, we may by prayer
 cast it upon the Lord and then be easy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this prayer, or meditation,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Jeremiah adores God and his infinite perfections, and gives him the 
 glory due to his name as the Creator, upholder, and benefactor, of the 
 whole creation, thereby owning his irresistible power, that he can do 
 what he will, and his incontestable sovereignty, that he may do what he 
 will, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:17-19"><I>v.</I> 17-19</A>.

 Note, When at any time we are perplexed about the particular methods 
 and dispensations of Providence it is good for us to have recourse to 
 our first principles, and to satisfy ourselves with the general 
 doctrines of God's wisdom, power, and goodness. Let us consider, as 
 Jeremiah does here,

 1. That God is the fountain of all being, power, life, motion, and
 perfection: He <I>made the heaven and the earth with his outstretched 
 arm;</I> and therefore who can control him? Who dares contend with him? 

 2. That with him nothing is impossible, no difficulty insuperable: 
 <I>Nothing is too hard for thee.</I> When human skill and power are 
 quite nonplussed, <I>with God are strength and wisdom</I> sufficient to 
 master all the opposition. 

 3. That he is a God of boundless bottomless mercy; mercy is his
 darling attribute; it is his goodness that is his glory: "Thou not only 
 art kind, but thou <I>showest lovingkindness,</I> not to a few, to here 
 and there one, but <I>to thousands,</I> thousands of persons, thousands 
 of generations." 

 4. That he is a God of impartial and inflexible justice. His reprieves
 are not pardons, but if in mercy he spares the parents, that they may 
 be led to repentance, yet such a hatred has he to sin, and such a 
 displeasure against sinners, that he <I>recompenses their iniquity into 
 the bosom of their children,</I> and yet does them no wrong; so hateful 
 is the unrighteousness of man, and so jealous of its own honour is the 
 righteousness of God.

 5. That he is a God of universal dominion and command: He is <I>the
 great</I> God, for he is <I>the mighty God,</I> and might among men 
 makes them great. He is <I>the Lord of hosts,</I> of all hosts, that
 <I>is his name,</I> and he answers to his name, for all the hosts of 
 heaven and earth, of men and angels, are at his beck.

 6. That he contrives every thing for the best, and effects every thing 
 as he contrived it: He is <I>great in counsel,</I> so vast are the 
 reaches and so deep are the designs of his wisdom; and he is <I>mighty 
 in doing,</I> according to the counsel of his will. Now such a God as 
 this is not to be quarrelled with. His service is to be constantly 
 adhered to and all his disposals cheerfully acquiesced in.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He acknowledges the universal cognizance God takes of all the 
 actions of the children of men and the unerring judgment he passes upon 
 them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>Thy eyes are open upon all the sons of men,</I> wherever they are, 
 beholding the evil and the good, and upon all <I>their ways,</I> both 
 the course they take and every step they take, not as an unconcerned 
 spectator, but as an observing judge, <I>to give every one according to 
 his ways and according</I> to his deserts, which are <I>the fruit of 
 his doings;</I> for men shall find God as they are found of him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He recounts the great things God had done for his people Israel 
 formerly. 

 1. He brought them out of Egypt, that house of bondage, with <I>signs
 and wonders,</I> which remain, if not in the marks of them, yet in the 
 memorials of them, <I>even unto this day;</I> for it would never be 
 forgotten, not only <I>in Israel,</I> who were reminded of it every 
 year by the ordinance of the passover, but <I>among other men:</I> all 
 the neighbouring nations spoke of it, as that which redounded 
 exceedingly to the glory of the God of Israel, and made him <I>a name 
 as at this day.</I> This is repeated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 that God <I>brought them forth,</I> not only with comforts and joys to 
 them, but with glory to himself, <I>with signs and wonders</I> (witness 
 the ten plagues), <I>with a strong hand,</I> too strong for the 
 Egyptians themselves, <I>and with a stretched-out arm,</I> that reached 
 Pharaoh, proud as he was, <I>and with great terror</I> to them and all 
 about them. This seems to refer to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:34">Deut. iv. 34</A>.

 2. He brought them into Canaan, that good land, that <I>land flowing 
 with milk and honey.</I> He <I>swore to their fathers to give it 
 them,</I> and, because he would perform his oath, he did give it to the 
 children 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>)

 <I>and they came in and possessed it.</I> Jeremiah mentions this both 
 as an aggravation of their sin and disobedience and also as a plea with 
 God to work deliverance for them. Note, It is good for us often to 
 reflect upon the great things that God did for his church formerly, 
 especially in the first erecting of it, that work of wonder.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He bewails the rebellions they had been guilty of against God, and
 the judgments God had brought upon them for these rebellions. It is a 
 sad account he here gives of the ungrateful conduct of that people 
 towards God. He had done every thing that he had promised to do (they 
 had acknowledged it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:56">1 Kings viii. 56</A>),

 but they had <I>done nothing of all that he commanded them to do</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>);

 they made no conscience of any of <I>his laws;</I> they <I>walked 
 not</I> in them, paid no respect to any of his calls by his prophets, 
 for they <I>obeyed not his voice.</I> And therefore he owns that God 
 was righteous in <I>causing all this evil to come upon them.</I> The 
 city is besieged, is attacked <I>by the sword</I> without, is weakened 
 and wasted by the <I>famine</I> and <I>pestilence</I> within, so that 
 it is ready to fall <I>into the hands of the Chaldeans that fight 
 against it</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>);

 it is <I>given into their hands,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 
 Now,

 1. He compares the present state of Jerusalem with the divine
 predictions, and finds that what God <I>has spoken</I> has <I>come to 
 pass.</I> God had given them fair warning of it before; and, if they 
 had regarded this, the ruin would have been prevented; but, if they 
 will not do what God has commanded, they can expect no other than that 
 he should do what he had threatened. 

 2. He commits the present state of Jerusalem to the divine 
 consideration and compassion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>Behold the mounts,</I> or <I>ramparts,</I> or the <I>engines</I> 
 which they make use of to batter the city and beat down the wall of it. 
 And again, "<I>Behold thou seest it,</I> and takest cognizance of it. 
 Is this the city that thou has chosen to put thy name there? And shall 
 it be thus abandoned?" He neither complains of God for what he had done 
 nor prescribes to God what he should do, but desires he would behold 
 their case, and is pleased to think that he does behold it. Whatever 
 trouble we are in, upon a personal or public account, we may comfort 
 ourselves with this, that God sees it and sees how to remedy it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He seems desirous to be let further into the meaning of the order
 God had now given him to purchase his kinsman's field 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 "<I>Though the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans,</I> and no 
 man is likely to enjoy what he has, yet <I>thou hast said unto me, Buy 
 thou the field.</I>" As soon as he understood that it was the mind of 
 God he did it, and made no objections, was not disobedient to the 
 heavenly vision; but, when he had done it, he desired better to 
 understand why God had ordered him to do it, because the thing looked 
 strange and unaccountable. Note, Though we are bound to follow God with 
 an implicit obedience, yet we should endeavour that it may be more and 
 more an intelligent obedience. We must never dispute God's statutes and 
 judgments, but we may and must enquire, <I>What mean these statutes and 
 judgments?</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>26  Then came the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> unto Jeremiah, saying,
 &nbsp; 27  Behold, I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the God of all flesh: is there any
 thing too hard for me?
 &nbsp; 28  Therefore thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Behold, I will give this city
 into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of
 Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it:
 &nbsp; 29  And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come
 and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon
 whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out
 drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger.
 &nbsp; 30  For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have
 only done evil before me from their youth: for the children of
 Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their
 hands, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 31  For this city hath been to me <I>as</I> a provocation of mine
 anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto
 this day; that I should remove it from before my face,
 &nbsp; 32  Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the
 children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger,
 they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their
 prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 33  And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face:
 though I taught them, rising up early and teaching <I>them,</I> yet
 they have not hearkened to receive instruction.
 &nbsp; 34  But they set their abominations in the house, which is
 called by my name, to defile it.
 &nbsp; 35  And they built the high places of Baal, which <I>are</I> in the
 valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their
 daughters to pass through <I>the fire</I> unto Molech; which I
 commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they
 should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.
 &nbsp; 36  And now therefore thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the God of Israel,
 concerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into
 the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine,
 and by the pestilence;
 &nbsp; 37  Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I
 have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great
 wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will
 cause them to dwell safely:
 &nbsp; 38  And they shall be my people, and I will be their God:
 &nbsp; 39  And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may
 fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children
 after them:
 &nbsp; 40  And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I
 will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my
 fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.
 &nbsp; 41  Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will
 plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my
 whole soul.
 &nbsp; 42  For thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Like as I have brought all this
 great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the
 good that I have promised them.
 &nbsp; 43  And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, <I>It
 is</I> desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of
 the Chaldeans.
 &nbsp; 44  Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and
 seal <I>them,</I> and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in
 the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in
 the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and
 in the cities of the south: for I will cause their captivity to
 return, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here God's answer to Jeremiah's prayer, designed to quiet his 
 mind and make him easy; and it is a full discovery of the purposes of 
 God's wrath against the present generation and the purposes of his 
 grace concerning the future generations. Jeremiah knew not how to
 <I>sing both of mercy and judgment,</I> but God here teaches to sing 
 unto him of both. When we know not how to reconcile one word of God 
 with another we may yet be sure that both are true, both are pure, both 
 shall be made good, and not one iota or tittle of either shall fall to 
 the ground. When Jeremiah was ordered to buy the field in Anathoth he 
 was willing to hope that God was about to revoke the sentence of his 
 wrath and to order the Chaldeans to raise the siege. "No," says God, 
 "the execution of the sentence shall go on; Jerusalem shall be laid in 
 ruins." Note, Assurances of future mercy must not be interpreted as 
 securities from present troubles. But, lest Jeremiah should think that 
 his being ordered to buy this field intimated that all the mercy God 
 had in store for his people, after their return, was only that they 
 should have the possession of their own land again, he further informs 
 him that that was but a type and figure of those spiritual blessings 
 which should then be abundantly bestowed upon them, unspeakably more 
 valuable than fields and vineyards; so that in this <I>word of the 
 Lord,</I> which came to Jeremiah, we have first as dreadful 
 threatenings and then as precious promises as perhaps any we have in 
 the Old Testament; life and death, good and evil, are here set before 
 us; let us consider and choose wisely.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The ruin of Judah and Jerusalem is here pronounced. The decree has 
 gone forth, and shall not be recalled. 

 1. God here asserts his own sovereignty and power 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>Behold, I am Jehovah,</I> a self-existent self-sufficient being; 
 <I>I am that I am; I am the God of all flesh,</I> that is, of all 
 mankind, here called <I>flesh</I> because weak and unable to contend 
 with God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:4">Ps. lvi. 4</A>),

 and because wicked and corrupt and unapt to comply with God. God is the
 Creator of all, and makes what use he pleases of all. He that is the 
 God of Israel is the <I>God of all flesh</I> and of <I>the spirits of 
 all flesh,</I> and, if Israel were cast off, could raise up a people to 
 his name out of some other nation. If he be the <I>God of all 
 flesh,</I> he may well ask, <I>Is any thing too hard for me?</I> What 
 cannot he do from whom all the powers of men are derived, on whom they 
 depend, and by whom all their actions are directed and governed?
 Whatever he designs to do, whether in wrath or in mercy, nothing can 
 hinder him nor defeat his designs.

 2. He abides by that he had often said of the destruction of Jerusalem 
 by the king of Babylon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 <I>I will give this city into his hand,</I> now that he is grasping at 
 it, <I>and he shall take it</I> and make a prey of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 <I>The Chaldeans shall come and set fire to it,</I> shall burn it and 
 all the <I>houses in it,</I> God's house not excepted, nor the king's 
 neither.

 3. He assigns the reason for these severe proceedings against the city
 that had been so much in his favour. It is sin, it is that and nothing 
 else, that ruins it.

 (1.) They were impudent and daring in sin. They <I>offered incense to 
 Baal,</I> not in corners, as men ashamed or afraid of being discovered, 
 but upon the <I>tops of their houses</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 in defiance of God's justice.

 (2.) They designed an affront to God herein. They did it <I>to provoke
 me to anger,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 <I>They have only provoked me to anger with the works of their 
 hands,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 They could not promise themselves any pleasure, profit, or honour out 
 of it, but did it on purpose to offend God. And again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),

 <I>All the evil which they have done was to provoke me to anger.</I> 
 They knew he was a jealous God in the matters of his worship, and there 
 they resolved to try his jealousy and dare him to his face. "Jerusalem 
 has been <I>to me a provocation of my anger and fury,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 Their conduct in every thing was provoking.

 (3.) They began betimes, and had continued all along provoking to God: 
 "They have <I>done evil before me from their youth,</I> ever since they 
 were first formed into a people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 witness their murmurings and rebellions in the wilderness." And as for 
 Jerusalem, though it was the <I>holy city,</I> it has been <I>a 
 provocation</I> to the holy God <I>from the day that they built it, 
 even to this day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 O what reason have we to lament the little honour God has from this 
 world, and the great dishonour that is done him, when even in Judah, 
 where <I>he is known</I> and <I>his name is great,</I> and in Salem 
 where his <I>tabernacle is,</I> there was always that found that was a 
 provocation to him!

 (4.) All orders and degrees of men contributed to the common guilt, and 
 therefore were justly involved in the common ruin. Not only the 
 <I>children of Israel,</I> that had revolted from the temple, but the 
 <I>children of Judah</I> too, that still adhered to it--not only the 
 common people, the <I>men of Judah</I> and <I>inhabitants of 
 Jerusalem,</I> but those that should have reproved and restrained sin 
 in others were themselves ringleaders in it, their <I>kings</I> and 
 <I>princes,</I> their <I>priests</I> and <I>prophets.</I> 

 (5.) God had again and again called them to repentance, but they turned 
 a deaf ear to his calls, and rudely turned their back on him that 
 called them, though he was their master, to whom they were bound in 
 duty, and their benefactor, to whom they were bound in gratitude and 
 interest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 "<I>I taught them</I> better manners, with as much care as ever any 
 tender parent taught a child, <I>rising up early, in teaching them,</I> 
 studying to adapt the teaching to their capacities, taking them 
 betimes, when they might have been most pliable, but all in vain; they 
 <I>turned not the face to me,</I> would not so much as look upon me, 
 nay, they <I>turned the back upon me,</I>" an expression of the highest 
 contempt. <I>As he called them,</I> like froward children, <I>so they 
 went from him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:2">Hos. xi. 2</A>.

 <I>They have not hearkened to receive instruction;</I> they regarded
 not a word that was said to them, though it was designed for their own 
 good.

 (6.) There was in their idolatries an impious contempt of God; for 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>)

 <I>they set their abominations</I> (their idols, which they knew to be 
 in the highest degree abominable to God) <I>in the house which is 
 called by my name, to defile it.</I> They had their idols not only in 
 their high places and groves, but even in God's temple.

 (7.) They were guilty of the most unnatural cruelty to their own 
 children; for they <I>sacrificed them to Moloch,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 Thus because they <I>liked not to retain God in their knowledge,</I> 
 but <I>changed his glory</I> into shame, they were justly given up to 
 vile affections and stripped of natural ones, and their glory was 
 turned into shame. And,

 (8.) What was the consequence of all this?

 [1.] They <I>caused Judah to sin,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 The whole country was infected with the contagious idolatries and 
 iniquities of Jerusalem.

 [2.] They brought ruin upon themselves. It was as if they had done it 
 on purpose that God <I>should remove them from before his face</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>);
 
 they would throw themselves out of his favour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The restoration of Judah and Jerusalem is here promised, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>,

 &c. God will in judgment remember mercy, and there will a time come, a
 set time, to favour Zion. Observe, 

 1. The despair to which this people were now at length brought. When
 the judgment was threatened at a distance they had no fear; when it 
 attacked them they had no hope. They said concerning the city 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>),
 
 <I>It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon,</I> not 
 by any cowardice or ill conduct of ours, but by <I>the sword, famine, 
 and pestilence.</I> Concerning the country they said, with vexation 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>),

 <I>It is desolate, without man or beast;</I> there is no relief, there 
 is no remedy. <I>It is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</I> Note, 
 Deep security commonly ends in deep despair; whereas those that keep up 
 a holy fear at all times have a good hope to support them in the worst 
 of times.

 2. The hope that God gives them of mercy which he had in store for them 
 hereafter. Though their carcases must fall in captivity, yet their 
 children after them shall again see this good land and the goodness of 
 God in it.

 (1.) They shall be brought up from their captivity and shall come and 
 settle again in this land, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 They had been under God's <I>anger and fury, and great wrath;</I> but 
 now they shall partake of his grace, and love, and great favour. He had 
 dispersed them, and <I>driven them into all countries.</I> Those that 
 fled dispersed themselves; those that fell into the enemies; hands were 
 dispersed by them, in policy, to prevent combinations among them. God's 
 hand was in both. But now God will find them out, and <I>gather them 
 out of all the countries whither they were driven,</I> as he promised 
 in the law 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:3,4">Deut. xxx. 3, 4</A>)
 
 and the saints had prayed,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:47,Ne+1:9">Ps. cvi. 47; Neh. i. 9</A>.
 
 He had banished them, but he will <I>bring them again to this
 place,</I> which they could not but have an affection for. For many 
 years past, while they were in their own land, they were continually 
 exposed, and terrified with the alarms of war; but now <I>I will cause 
 them to dwell safely.</I> Being reformed, and having returned to God, 
 neither their own consciences within nor their enemies without shall be 
 a terror to them. He promises

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>):

 <I>I will plant them in this land assuredly;</I> not only I will 
 certainly do it, but they shall here enjoy a holy a security and 
 repose, and they shall take root here, shall be <I>planted in 
 stability,</I> and not again be unfixed and shaken.

 (2.) God will renew his covenant with them, a covenant of grace, the 
 blessings of which are spiritual, and such as will work good things in 
 them, to qualify them for the great things God intended to do for them. 
 It is called an <I>everlasting covenant</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>),

 not only because God will be for ever faithful to it, but because the 
 consequences of it will be everlasting. For, doubtless, here the 
 promises look further than to Israel according to the flesh, and are 
 sure to all believers, to every Israelite indeed. Good Christians may
 apply them to themselves and plead them with God, may claim the benefit 
 of them and take the comfort of them.

 [1.] God will own them for his, and make over himself to them to be 
 theirs 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>):

 <I>They shall be my people.</I> He will make them his by working in 
 them all the characters and dispositions of his people, and then he 
 will protect, and guide, and govern them as his people. "And, to make
 them truly, completely, and eternally happy, <I>I will be their 
 God.</I>" They shall serve and worship God as theirs and cleave to him 
 only, and he will approve himself theirs. All he is, all he has, shall 
 be engaged and employed for their good.

 [2.] God will give them a heart to fear him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 That which he requires of those whom he takes into covenant with him as 
 his people is that they fear him, that they reverence his majesty, 
 dread his wrath, stand in awe of his authority, pay homage to him, and 
 give him the glory due unto his name. Now what God requires of them he 
 here promises to work in them, pursuant to his choice of them as his 
 people. Note, As it is God's prerogative to fashion men's hearts, so it 
 is his promise to his people to fashion theirs aright; and a heart to 
 fear God is indeed a good heart, and well fashioned. It is repeated 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>):

 <I>I will put my fear in their hearts,</I> that is, work in them 
 gracious principles and dispositions, that shall influence and govern 
 their whole conversation. Teachers may put good things into our heads, 
 but it is God only that can put them into our hearts, that can work in 
 us <I>both to will and to do.</I>

 [3.] He will <I>give them one heart and one way.</I> In order to their 
 walking in one way, he will give them one heart: as the heart is, so 
 will the way be, and both shall be one; that is <I>First,</I> They 
 shall be each of them one with themselves. <I>One heart</I> is the same 
 with a <I>new heart,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:19">Ezek. xi. 19</A>.

 The heart is <I>then</I> one when it is fully determined for God and
 entirely devoted to God. When the eye is single and God's glory alone 
 aimed at, when our hearts are fixed, trusting in God, and we are 
 uniform and universal in our obedience to him, then the heart is one 
 and way one; and, unless the heart be thus steady, the goings will not 
 be stedfast. From this promise we may take direction and encouragement 
 to pray, with David

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:11">Ps. lxxxvi. 11</A>),

 <I>Unite my heart to fear thy name;</I> for God says, <I>I will give
 them one heart, that they may fear me. Secondly,</I> They shall be all 
 of them one with each other. All good Christians shall be incorporated 
 into one body; Jews and Gentiles shall become <I>one sheep-fold;</I> 
 and they shall all, as far as they are sanctified, have a disposition 
 to love one another, the gospel they profess having in it the strongest 
 inducements to mutual love, and the Spirit that dwells in them being 
 the Spirit of love. Though they may have different apprehensions about
 minor things, they shall be all one in the great things of God, being 
 renewed after the same image. Though they may have many paths, they 
 have but <I>one way,</I> that of serious godliness.

 [4.] He will effectually provide for their perseverance in grace and 
 the perpetuating of the covenant between himself and them. They would 
 have been happy when there were first planted in Canaan, like Adam in 
 paradise, if they had not departed from God. And therefore, now that 
 they are restored to their happiness, they shall be confirmed in it by 
 the preventing of their departures from God, and this will complete 
 their bliss. <I>First,</I> God will never leave nor forsake them: <I>I 
 will not turn away from them to do them good.</I> Earthly princes are 
 fickle, and their greatest favourites have fallen under their frowns; 
 but God's <I>mercy endures for ever. Whom he loves he loves to the 
 end.</I> God may seem to turn from this people
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:8">Isa. liv. 8</A>),

 but even then he does not turn from doing and designing them good.
 <I>Secondly,</I> They shall never leave nor forsake him; that is the 
 thing we are in danger of. We have no reason to distrust God's fidelity 
 and constancy, but our own; and therefore it is here promised that God 
 will <I>give them a heart to fear him for ever,</I> all days, to be in 
 his fear every day and all the day long

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:17">Prov. xxiii. 17</A>),

 and to continue so to the end of their days. He will put such a 
 principle into their hearts that they <I>shall not depart from him.</I> 
 Even those who have given up their names to God, if they be left to 
 themselves, will depart from him; but the fear of God ruling in the 
 heart, will prevent their departure. That, and nothing else, will do 
 it. If we continue close and faithful to God, it is owing purely to his 
 almighty grace and not to any strength or resolution of our own.

 [5.] He will entail a blessing upon their seed, will give them grace to 
 fear him, <I>for the good of them and of their children after them.</I> 
 As their departures from God had been to the prejudice of their 
 children, so their adherence to God should be to the advantage of their 
 children. We cannot better consult the good of posterity than by 
 setting up, and keeping up, the fear and worship of God in our 
 families.

 [6.] He will take a pleasure in their prosperity and will do every 
 thing to advance it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>):

 <I>I will rejoice over them to do them good.</I> God will certainly do 
 them good because he rejoices over them. They are dear to him; he makes 
 his boast of them, and therefore will not only do them good, but will 
 delight in doing them good. When he punishes them it is with 
 reluctance. <I>How shall I give thee up, Ephraim?</I> But, when he 
 restores them, it is with satisfaction; he rejoices in doing them good. 
 We ought therefore to serve him with pleasure and to rejoice in all 
 opportunities of serving him. He is himself a cheerful giver, and 
 therefore loves a cheerful servant. <I>I will plant them</I> (says God) 
 <I>with my whole heart and with my whole soul.</I> He will be intent 
 upon it, and take delight in it; he will make it the business of his 
 providence to settle them again in Canaan, and the various 
 dispensations of providence shall concur to it. All things shall appear 
 at last so to have been working for the good of the church that it will 
 be said, The governor of the world is entirely taken up with the care 
 of his church.

 [7.] These promises shall as surely be performed as the foregoing 
 threatenings were; and the accomplishment of those, notwithstanding the 
 security of the people, might confirm their expectation of the 
 performance of these, notwithstanding their present despair 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>):
 
 <I>As I have brought all this great evil upon them,</I> pursuant to the 
 threatenings, and for the glory of divine justice, <I>so I will bring 
 upon them all this good,</I> pursuant to the promise, and for the glory 
 of divine mercy. He that is faithful to his threatenings will much
 more be so to his promises; and he will comfort his people <I>according 
 to the time that he has afflicted them.</I> The churches shall have 
 rest after the days of adversity.

 [8.] As an earnest of all this, houses and lands shall again fetch a 
 good price in Judah and Jerusalem, and, though now they are a drug, 
 there shall again be a sufficient number of purchasers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:43,44"><I>v.</I> 43, 44</A>):
 
 <I>Fields shall be bought in this land,</I> and people will covet to 
 have lands here rather than any where else. Lands, wherever they lie, 
 will go off, not only in <I>the places about Jerusalem,</I> but <I>in 
 the cities of Judah</I> and of Israel, too, whether they lie <I>on 
 mountains,</I> or in valleys, or <I>in the south,</I> in all parts of 
 the country, <I>men shall buy fields, and subscribe evidences.</I> 
 Trade shall revive, for they shall have money enough to buy land with. 
 Husbandry shall revive, for those that have money shall covet to lay it 
 out upon lands. Laws shall again have their due course, for they shall 
 <I>subscribe evidences and seal them.</I> This is mentioned to 
 reconcile Jeremiah to his new purchase. Though he had bought a piece of 
 ground and could not go to see it, yet he must believe that this was 
 the pledge of many a purchase, and those but faint resemblances of the 
 purchased possessions in the heavenly Canaan, reserved for all those 
 who have God's fear in their hearts and do not depart from him.</P>
