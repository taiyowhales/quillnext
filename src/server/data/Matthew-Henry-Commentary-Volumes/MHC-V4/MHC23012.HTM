 The salvation promised in the foregoing chapter was compared to that of 
 Israel "in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt;" so that 
 chapter ends. Now as Moses and the children of Israel then sang a song 
 of praise to the glory of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:1">Exod. xv. 1</A>)

 so shall the people of God do in that day when the root of Jesse shall
 stand for an ensign of the people and shall be the desire and joy of 
 all nations. In that day,

 I. Every particular believer shall sing a song of praise for his own
 interest in that salvation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+12:1,2">ver. 1, 3</A>).

 "Thou shalt say, Lord, I will praise thee." Thanksgiving-work shall be
 closet-work. 

 II. Many in concert shall join in praising God for the common benefit
 arising from this salvation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+12:4-6">ver. 4-6</A>):

 "You shall say, Praise you the Lord." Thanksgiving-work shall be
 congregation-work; and the praises of God shall be publicly sung in the 
 congregations of the upright.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And in that day thou shalt say, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, I will praise thee:
 though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and
 thou comfortedst me.
 &nbsp; 2  Behold, God <I>is</I> my salvation; I will trust, and not be

 also is become my salvation.

 salvation.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is the former part of the hymn of praise which is prepared for the 
 use of the church, of the Jewish church when God would work great 
 deliverances for them, and of the Christian church when the kingdom of 
 the Messiah should be set up in the world in despite of the opposition 
 of the powers of darkness: <I>In that day thou shalt say, O Lord! I 
 will praise thee.</I> The scattered church, being united into one body, 
 shall, as one man, with one mind and one mouth, thus praise God, who is 
 one and his name one. <I>In that day,</I> when the Lord shall do these 
 great things for thee, <I>thou shalt say, O Lord! I will praise 
 thee.</I> That is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. "Thou shalt have cause to say so." The promise is sure, and the 
 blessings contained in it are very rich, and, when they are bestowed, 
 will furnish the church with abundant matter for rejoicing and 
 therefore with abundant matter for thanksgiving. The Old-Testament
 prophecies of gospel times are often expressed by the joy and praise 
 that shall then be excited; for the inestimable benefits we enjoy by 
 Jesus Christ require the most elevated and enlarged thanksgivings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. "Thou shalt have a heart to say so." All God's other gifts to his 
 people shall be crowned with this. He will give them grace to ascribe 
 all the glory of them to him, and to speak of them upon all occasions 
 with thankfulness to his praise. <I>Thou shalt say,</I> that is, thou 
 oughtest to say so. <I>In that day,</I> when many are brought home to 
 Jesus Christ and flock to him as doves to their windows, instead of 
 envying the kind reception they find with Christ, as the Jews grudged 
 the favour shown to the Gentiles, <I>thou shalt say, O Lord! I will 
 praise thee.</I> Note, we ought to rejoice in, and give thanks for, the 
 grace of God to others as well as to ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Believers are here taught to give thanks to God for the turning away 
 of his displeasure from them and the return of his favour to them 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+12:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>O Lord! I will praise thee, though thou wast angry with me.</I>
 Note, Even God's frowns must not put us out of tune for praising him; 
 though he be angry with us, though he slay us, yet we must put our 
 trust in him and give him thanks. God has often just cause to be angry 
 with us, but we have never any reason to be angry with him, nor to 
 speak otherwise than well of him; even when he blames us we must praise 
 him. <I>Thou was angry with us,</I> but <I>thy anger is turned 
 away.</I> Note,

 (1.) God is sometimes angry with his own people and the fruits of his
 anger do appear, and they ought to take notice of this, that they may 
 humble themselves under his mighty hand.

 (2.) Though God may for a time be angry with his people, yet his anger
 shall at length be turned away; it endures but for a moment, nor will 
 he contend for ever. By Jesus Christ, the root of Jesse, God's anger 
 against mankind was turned away; for <I>he is our peace.</I>

 (3.) Those whom God is reconciled to he comforts; even the turning away
 of his anger is a comfort to them; yet that is not all: those that are
 <I>at peace with God</I> may <I>rejoice in hope of the glory of
 God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:1,2">Rom. v. 1, 2</A>.

 Nay, God sometimes brings his people into a wilderness that there he
 may <I>speak comfortably to them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:14">Hosea ii. 14</A>.

 (4.) The turning away of God's anger, and the return of his comforts to
 us, ought to be the matter of our joyful thankful praises.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They are taught to triumph in God and their interest in him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+12:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):
 
 "<I>Behold,</I> and wonder; <I>God is my salvation;</I> not only my
 Saviour, by whom I am saved, but my salvation, in whom I am safe. I 
 depend upon him as my salvation, for I have found him to be so. He 
 shall have the glory of all the salvations that have been wrought for 
 me, and from him only will I expect the salvations I further need, and 
 not from hills and mountains: and if God be my salvation, if he 
 undertake my eternal salvation, <I>I will trust</I> in him to prepare 
 me for it and preserve me to it. I will trust him with all my temporal 
 concerns, not doubting but he will make all to work for my good. I will 
 be confident, that is, I will be always easy in my own mind." Note, 
 Those that have God for their salvation may enjoy themselves with a 
 holy security and serenity of mind. Let faith in God as our salvation 
 be effectual, 

 (1.) To silence our fears. We must <I>trust, and not be afraid,</I> not
 be afraid that the God we trust in will fail us; no, there is no danger 
 of that; not be afraid of any creature, though ever so formidable and 
 threatening. Note, Faith in God is a sovereign remedy against 
 disquieting tormenting fears.

 (2.) To support our hopes. Is the Lord Jehovah our salvation? Then he
 will be our <I>strength and song.</I> We have work to do and 
 temptations to resist, and we may depend upon him to enable us for 
 both, to <I>strengthen us with all might by his Spirit in the inner 
 man,</I> for he is our strength; his grace is so, and that grace shall 
 be sufficient for us. We have many troubles to undergo, and must expect 
 griefs in a vale of tears; and we may depend upon him to comfort us in 
 all our tribulations, for he is our song; he <I>giveth songs in the 
 night.</I> If we make God our strength, and put our confidence in him, 
 he will be our strength; if we make him our song, and place our comfort 
 in him, he will be our song. Many good Christians have God for their
 strength who have him not for their song; they walk in darkness: but 
 light is sown for them. And those that have God for their strength 
 ought to make him their song, that is, to give him the glory of it (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:35">Ps. lxviii. 35</A>)

 and to take to themselves the comfort of it, for he will become their
 salvation. Observe the title here given to God: <I>Jah, Jehovah.</I>
 Jah is the contraction of Jehovah, and both signify his eternity and 
 unchangeableness, which are a great comfort to those that depend upon 
 him as their strength and their song. Some make Jah to signify the Son 
 of God made man; he is Jehovah, and in him we may glory as our 
 strength, and song, and salvation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They are aught to derive comfort to themselves from the love of God 
 and all the tokens of that love 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+12:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>Therefore,</I> because the Lord Jehovah is your strength and song
 and will be your salvation, <I>you shall draw water with joy.</I>" 
 Note, The assurances God has given us of his love, and the experiences 
 we have had of the benefit and comfort of his grace, should greatly 
 encourage our faith in him and our expectations from him: "<I>Out of 
 the wells of salvation</I> in God, who is the fountain of all good to 
 his people, <I>you shall draw water with joy.</I> God's favour shall 
 flow forth to you, and you shall have the comfort of it and make use of 
 the blessed fruits of it." Note,

 (1.) God's promises revealed, ratified, and given out to us, in his
 ordinances, are wells of salvation; wells of <I>the Saviour</I> (so 
 some read it), for in them the Saviour and salvation are made known to 
 us and made over to us. 

 (2.) It is our duty by faith to draw water out of these wells, to take
 to ourselves the benefit and comfort that are treasured up for us in 
 them, as those that acknowledge all our fresh springs to be there and 
 all our fresh streams to be thence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+87:7">Ps. lxxxvii. 7</A>.

 (3.) Water is to be drawn out of the wells of salvation with a great
 deal of pleasure and satisfaction. It is the will of God that we should 
 rejoice before him and rejoice in him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+26:11">Deut. xxvi. 11</A>),

 be joyful in his house of prayer

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:7">Isa. lvi. 7</A>),

 and keep his feasts with gladness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:46">Acts ii. 46</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  And in that day shall ye say, Praise the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, call upon his
 name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his
 name is exalted.
 &nbsp; 5  Sing unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; for he hath done excellent things: this
 <I>is</I> known in all the earth.
 &nbsp; 6  Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great <I>is</I>
 the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is the second part of this evangelical song, and to the same 
 purport with the former; there believers stir up themselves to praise 
 God, here they invite and encourage one another to do it, and are 
 contriving to spread his praise and draw in others to join with them in 
 it. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Who are here called upon to praise God--<I>the inhabitants of
 Zion</I> and Jerusalem, whom God had in a particular manner protected 
 from Sennacherib's violence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+12:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Those that have received distinguishing favours from God ought to be
 most forward and zealous in praising him. The gospel church is Zion. 
 Christ is Zion's King. Those that have a place and a name in the church 
 should lay out themselves to diffuse the knowledge of Christ and to 
 bring many to him. <I>Thou inhabitress of Zion;</I> the word is 
 feminine. Let the weaker sex be strong in the Lord, and out of their 
 mouth praise shall be perfected.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How they must praise the Lord. 

 1. By prayer: <I>Call upon his name.</I> As giving thanks for former
 mercy is a decent way of begging further mercy, so begging further 
 mercy is graciously accepted as a thankful acknowledgment of the 
 mercies we have received. In calling upon God's name we give unto him 
 some of the glory that is due to his name as our powerful and bountiful 
 benefactor. 

 2. By preaching and writing. We must not only speak to God, but speak
 to others concerning him, not only call upon his name, but (as the 
 margin reads it) <I>proclaim his name;</I> let others know something 
 more from us than they did before concerning God, and those things 
 whereby he has made himself known. <I>Declare his doings,</I> his 
 <I>counsels</I> (so some read it); the work of redemption is according 
 to the counsel of his will, and in that and other wonderful works that 
 he has done we must take notice of his <I>thoughts which are to 
 us-ward,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:5">Ps. xl. 5</A>.

 Declare these <I>among the people,</I> among the heathen, that they may
 be brought into communion with Israel and the God of Israel. When the 
 apostles preached the gospel to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem, 
 then this scripture was fulfilled, that his doings should be declared 
 among the people and that what he has done should be known in all the 
 earth.

 3. By a holy exultation and transport of joy: "<I>Cry out and
 shout;</I> welcome the gospel to yourselves and publish it to others 
 with huzzas and loud acclamations, as those that <I>shout for 
 victory</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:18">Exod. xxxii. 18</A>)

 or for the coronation of a king," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:21">Num. xxiii. 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. For what they must praise the Lord. 

 1. Because he has glorified himself. Remember it yourselves, and
 <I>make mention</I> of it to others, <I>that his name is exalted,</I> 
 has become more illustrious and more conspicuous; in this every good 
 man rejoices. 

 2. Because he has magnified his people: <I>He has done excellent
 things</I> for them, which make them look great and considerable. 

 3. Because he is, and will be, great among them: <I>Great is the Holy
 One,</I> for he is glorious in holiness; <I>therefore</I> great, 
 because holy. True goodness is true greatness. He is great as <I>the 
 Holy One of Israel,</I> and <I>in the midst of them,</I> praised by 
 them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:1">Ps. lxxvi. 1</A>),

 manifesting himself among them, and appearing gloriously in their
 behalf. It is the honour and happiness of Israel that the God who is in 
 covenant with them, and in the midst of them, is infinitely great.</P>
