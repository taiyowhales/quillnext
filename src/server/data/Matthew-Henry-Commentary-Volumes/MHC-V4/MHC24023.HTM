 In this chapter the prophet, in God's name, is dealing his reproofs and 
 threatenings, 
 
 I. Among the careless princes, or pastors of the people
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>),

 yet promising to take care of the flock, which they had been wanting in
 their duty to, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:3-8">ver. 3-8</A>.

 II. Among the wicked prophets and priests, whose bad character is here
 given at large in divers instances, especially their imposing upon the 
 people with their pretended inspirations, at which the prophet is 
 astonished, and for which they must expect to be punished, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:9-32">ver. 9-32</A>.

 III. Among the profane people, who ridiculed God's prophets and
 bantered them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:33-40">ver. 33-40</A>.

 When all have thus corrupted their way they must all expect to be told
 faithfully of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of
 my pasture! saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 2  Therefore thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel against the
 pastors that feed my people; Ye have scattered my flock, and
 driven them away, and have not visited them: behold, I will visit
 upon you the evil of your doings, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 3  And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all
 countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again
 to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase.
 &nbsp; 4  And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them:
 and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they
 be lacking, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 5  Behold, the days come, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that I will raise unto
 David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and
 shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.
 &nbsp; 6  In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell
 safely: and this <I>is</I> his name whereby he shall be called, THE
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.
 &nbsp; 7  Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that they
 shall no more say, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> liveth, which brought up the children
 of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
 &nbsp; 8  But, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> liveth, which brought up and which led the seed
 of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all
 countries whither I had driven them; and they shall dwell in
 their own land.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is a word of terror to the negligent shepherds. The day is at 
 hand when God will reckon with them concerning the trust and charge 
 committed to them: <I>Woe be to the pastors</I> (to the <I>rulers,</I> 
 both in church and state) who should be to those they are set over as 
 pastors to lead them, feed them, protect them, and take care of them. 
 They are not owners of the sheep. God here calls them <I>the sheep of 
 my pasture,</I> whom I am interested in, and have provided good pasture 
 for. Woe be to those therefore who are commanded to feed God's people, 
 and pretend to do it, but who, instead of that, <I>scatter the 
 flock,</I> and <I>drive them away</I> by their violence and oppression, 
 and <I>have not visited them,</I> nor taken any care for their welfare, 
 nor concerned themselves at all to do them good. In not visiting them, 
 and doing their duty to them, they did in effect scatter them and drive 
 them away. The beasts of prey scattered them, and the shepherds are in 
 the fault, who should have kept them together. <I>Woe be to them</I> 
 when God will visit upon them the evil of their doings and deal with 
 them as they deserve. They would not visit the flock in a way of duty, 
 and therefore God will visit them in a way of vengeance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is a word of comfort to the neglected sheep. Though the 
 under-shepherds take no care of them, no pains with them, but betray 
 them, the chief Shepherd will look after them. <I>When my father and my 
 mother forsake me, then the Lord taketh me up.</I> Though the interests 
 of God's church in the world are neglected by those who should take 
 care of them, and postponed to their own private secular interests, yet 
 they shall not therefore sink. God will perform his promise, though 
 those he employs do not perform their duty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The dispersed Jews shall at length return to their own land, and be 
 happily settled there under a good government, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 Though there be but a remnant of God's flock left, a little remnant, 
 that has narrowly escaped destruction, he will gather that remnant, 
 will find them out wherever they are and find out ways and means to 
 bring them back out of all countries <I>whither he had driven them.</I> 
 It was the justice of God, for the sin of their shepherds, that 
 dispersed them; but the mercy of God shall gather in the sheep, when 
 the shepherds that betrayed them are cut off. <I>They shall be 
 brought</I> to their former habitations, as sheep to their folds, and 
 there <I>they shall be fruitful, and increase</I> in numbers. And, 
 though their former shepherds took no care of them, it does not 
 therefore follow that they shall have no more. If some have abused a 
 sacred office, that is no good reason why it should be abolished. "They 
 destroyed the sheep, but I will set shepherds over them who shall make 
 it their business to feed them." Formerly they were continually exposed 
 and disturbed with some alarm or other; but now <I>they shall fear no 
 more, nor be dismayed;</I> they shall be in no danger from without, in 
 no fright from within. Formerly some or other of them were ever and 
 anon picked up by the beasts of prey; but now <I>none of them shall be 
 lacking,</I> none of them missing. Though the times may have been long 
 bad with the church, it does not follow that they will be ever so. Such 
 pastors as Zerubbabel and Nehemiah, though they lived not in the pomp 
 that Jehoiakim and Jeconiah did, nor made such a figure, were as great 
 blessings to the people as the others were plagues to them. The 
 church's peace is not bound up in the pomp of her rulers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Messiah the Prince, that great and good Shepherd of the sheep, shall 
 in the latter days be raised up to bless his church, and to be <I>the 
 glory of his people Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 The house of David seemed to be quite sunk and ruined by that 
 threatening against Jeconiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:30"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 30</A>),

 that none of his seed should ever <I>sit upon the throne of David.</I>
 But here is a promise which effectually secures the honour of the 
 covenant made with David notwithstanding; for by it the house will be 
 raised out of its ruins to a greater lustre than ever, and shine 
 brighter far than it did in Solomon himself. We have not so many 
 prophecies of Christ in this book as we had in that of the prophet 
 Isaiah; but here we have one, and a very illustrious one; of him 
 doubtless the prophet here speaks, of him, and of no other man. The 
 first words intimate that it would be long ere this promise should have 
 its accomplishment: <I>The days come,</I> but they are not yet. <I>I 
 shall see him, but not now.</I> But all the rest intimate that the 
 accomplishment of it will be glorious. 

 (1.) Christ is here spoken of as a <I>branch from David,</I> the <I>man 
 the branch</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+3:8">Zech. iii. 8</A>),

 his appearance mean, his beginnings small, like those of a bud or
 sprout, and his rise seemingly out of the earth, but growing to be 
 green, to be great, to be loaded with fruits. A branch from David's 
 family, when it seemed to be a <I>root in a dry ground,</I> buried, and 
 not likely to revive. Christ is the <I>root and offspring of David,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:16">Rev. xxii. 16</A>.
 
 In him doth the <I>horn of David bud,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:17,18">Ps. cxxxii. 17, 18</A>.

 He is a branch of God's raising up; he sanctified him, and sent him
 into the world, gave him his commission and qualifications. He is <I>a 
 righteous branch,</I> for he is righteous himself, and through him 
 many, even all that are his, are made righteous. As an advocate, he is 
 <I>Jesus Christ the righteous.</I>

 (2.) He is here spoken of as his church's King. This branch shall be 
 raised as high as the throne of his father David, and there <I>he shall 
 reign and prosper,</I> not as the kings that now were of the house of 
 David, who went backward in all their affairs. No; he shall set up a 
 kingdom in the world that shall be victorious over all opposition. In 
 the chariot of the everlasting gospel he shall go forth, he shall go on 
 <I>conquering and to conquer.</I> If God raise him up, he will prosper 
 him, for he will own the work of his own hands; what is <I>the good 
 pleasure of the Lord</I> shall <I>prosper in the hands</I> of those to 
 whom it is committed. He shall prosper; for <I>he shall execute 
 judgment and justice in the earth,</I> all the world over, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+96:13">Ps. xcvi. 13</A>.
 
 The present kings of the house of David were unjust and oppressive, and
 therefore it is no wonder that they did not prosper. But Christ shall,
 by his gospel, break the usurped power of Satan, institute a perfect 
 rule of holy living, and, as far as it prevails, make all the world 
 righteous. The effect of this shall be a holy security and serenity of 
 mind in all his faithful loyal subjects. <I>In his days,</I> under his
 dominion, <I>Judah shall be saved and Israel shall dwell safely;</I> 
 that is, all the spiritual seed of believing Abraham and praying Jacob 
 shall be protected from the curse of heaven and the malice of hell, 
 shall be privileged from the arrests of God's law and delivered from 
 the attempts of Satan's power, shall be saved from sin, the guilt and 
 dominion of it, and then shall <I>dwell safely,</I> and be quiet from 
 the fear of all evil. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:74,75">Luke i. 74, 75</A>.

 Those that shall be saved hereafter from the wrath to come may dwell
 safely now; for, <I>if God be for us, who can be against us?</I> In the 
 days of Christ's government in the soul, when he is uppermost there, 
 the soul <I>dwells at ease.</I>

 (3.) He is here spoken of as <I>The Lord our righteousness.</I> 
 Observe,

 [1.] Who and what he is. As God, he is <I>Jehovah,</I> the 
 incommunicable name of God, denoting his eternity and self-existence. 
 As Mediator, he is <I>our righteousness.</I> By making satisfaction to 
 the justice of God for the sin of man, he has brought in an everlasting 
 righteousness, and so made it over to us in the covenant of grace that, 
 upon our believing consent to that covenant, it becomes ours. His being 
 <I>Jehovah our righteousness</I> implies that he is so our 
 righteousness as no creature could be. He is a sovereign, 
 all-sufficient, eternal righteousness. All our righteousness has its 
 being from him, and by him it subsists, and we are made <I>the 
 righteousness of God in him.</I>

 [2.] The profession and declaration of this: <I>This is the name 
 whereby he shall be called,</I> not only he shall be so, but he shall 
 be known to be so. God shall call him by this name, for he shall 
 appoint him to be <I>our righteousness.</I> By this name Israel shall 
 call him, every true believer shall call him, and call upon him. That 
 is our righteousness by which, as an allowed plea, we are justified 
 before God, acquitted from guilt, and accepted into favour; and nothing 
 else have we to plead but this, "Christ has died, yea, rather has risen 
 again;" and we have taken him for our Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. This great salvation, which will come to the Jews in the latter days 
 of their state, after their return out of Babylon, shall be so 
 illustrious as far to outshine the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>):

 <I>They shall no more say, The Lord liveth that brought up Israel out 
 of Egypt; but, The Lord liveth that brought them up out of the 
 north.</I> This we had before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:14,15"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 14, 15</A>.

 But here it seems to point more plainly than it did there to the days
 of the Messiah, and to compare not so much the two deliverances 
 themselves (giving the preference to the latter) as the two states to 
 which the church by degrees grew after those deliverances. Observe the 
 proportion: Just 480 years after they had come out of Egypt Solomon's 
 temple was built 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:1">1 Kings vi. 1</A>);

 and at that time that nation, which was so wonderfully brought up out
 of Egypt, had gradually arrived to its height, to its zenith. Just 490 
 years (70 weeks) after they came out of Babylon Messiah the Prince set 
 up the gospel temple, which was the greatest glory of that nation that 
 was so wonderfully brought out of Babylon; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:24,25">Dan. ix. 24, 25</A>.

 Now the spiritual glory of the second part of that nation, especially
 as transferred to the gospel church, is much more admirable and 
 illustrious than all the temporal glory of the first part of it in the 
 days of Solomon; for that was no glory compared with the glory which 
 excelleth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all
 my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine
 hath overcome, because of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and because of the words of
 his holiness.
 &nbsp; 10  For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing
 the land mourneth; the pleasant places of the wilderness are
 dried up, and their course is evil, and their force <I>is</I> not
 right.
 &nbsp; 11  For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house
 have I found their wickedness, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 12  Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery <I>ways</I> in
 the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I
 will bring evil upon them, <I>even</I> the year of their visitation,
 saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 13  And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they
 prophesied in Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.
 &nbsp; 14  I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem a horrible
 thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen
 also the hands of evildoers, that none doth return from his
 wickedness: they are all of them unto me as Sodom, and the
 inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.
 &nbsp; 15  Therefore thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts concerning the
 prophets; Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them
 drink the water of gall: for from the prophets of Jerusalem is
 profaneness gone forth into all the land.
 &nbsp; 16  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of
 the prophets that prophesy unto you: they make you vain: they
 speak a vision of their own heart, <I>and</I> not out of the mouth of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 17  They say still unto them that despise me, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath
 said, Ye shall have peace; and they say unto every one that
 walketh after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall
 come upon you.
 &nbsp; 18  For who hath stood in the counsel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and hath
 perceived and heard his word? who hath marked his word, and heard
 <I>it?</I>
 &nbsp; 19  Behold, a whirlwind of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> is gone forth in fury, even
 a grievous whirlwind: it shall fall grievously upon the head of
 the wicked.
 &nbsp; 20  The anger of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall not return, until he have
 executed, and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart:
 in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly.
 &nbsp; 21  I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not
 spoken to them, yet they prophesied.
 &nbsp; 22  But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my
 people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from
 their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.
 &nbsp; 23  <I>Am</I> I a God at hand, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and not a God afar
 off?
 &nbsp; 24  Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see
 him? saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 25  I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in
 my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.
 &nbsp; 26  How long shall <I>this</I> be in the heart of the prophets that
 prophesy lies? yea, <I>they are</I> prophets of the deceit of their
 own heart;
 &nbsp; 27  Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their
 dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their
 fathers have forgotten my name for Baal.
 &nbsp; 28  The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he
 that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What <I>is</I>
 the chaff to the wheat? saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 29  <I>Is</I> not my word like as a fire? saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and like a
 hammer <I>that</I> breaketh the rock in pieces?
 &nbsp; 30  Therefore, behold, I <I>am</I> against the prophets, saith the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that steal my words every one from his neighbour.
 &nbsp; 31  Behold, I <I>am</I> against the prophets, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that
 use their tongues, and say, He saith.
 &nbsp; 32  Behold, I <I>am</I> against them that prophesy false dreams,
 saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by
 their lies, and by their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor
 commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this people at
 all, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is a long lesson for the false prophets. As none were more bitter 
 and spiteful against God's true prophets than they, so there were none 
 on whom the true prophets were more severe, and justly. The prophet had 
 complained to God of those false prophets 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:13"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 13</A>),

 and had often foretold that they should be involved in the common ruin;
 but here they have woes of their own.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He expresses the deep concern that he was under upon this account, 
 and what a trouble it was to him to see men who pretended to a divine 
 commission and inspiration ruining themselves, and the people among 
 whom they dwelt, by their falsehood and treachery 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>My heart within me is broken; I am like a drunken man.</I> His head 
 was in confusion with wonder and astonishment; his heart was under 
 oppression with grief and vexation. Jeremiah was a man that laid things 
 much to heart, and what was any way threatening to his country made a 
 deep impression upon his spirits. He is here in trouble, 

 1. <I>Because of the prophets</I> and their sin, the false doctrine
 they preached, the wicked lives they lived; especially it filled him 
 with horror to hear them making use of God's name and pretending to 
 have their instruction from him. Never was the Lord so abused, and 
 <I>the words of his holiness,</I> as by these men. Note, The dishonour 
 done to God's name, and the profanation of his holy word, are the 
 greatest grief imaginable to a gracious soul. 

 2. "<I>Because of the Lord,</I> and his judgments, which by this means 
 are brought in upon us like a deluge." He trembled to think of the ruin 
 and desolation which were coming <I>from the face of the Lord</I> (so 
 the word is) <I>and from the face of the word of his holiness,</I> 
 which will be inflicted by the power of God's wrath, according to the 
 threatenings of his word, confirmed by <I>his holiness.</I> Note, Even 
 those that have God for them cannot but tremble to think of the misery 
 of those that have God against them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He laments the abounding abominable wickedness of the land and the 
 present tokens of God's displeasure they were under for it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):
 
 <I>The land is full of adulterers;</I> it is full both of spiritual and 
 corporal whoredom. They go a whoring from God, and, having cast off the 
 fear of him, no marvel that they abandon themselves to all manner of 
 lewdness; and, having dishonoured themselves and their own bodies, they 
 dishonour God and his name by rash and false swearing, <I>because of 
 which the land mourns.</I> Both perjury and common swearing are sins 
 for which a land must mourn in true repentance or it will be made to 
 mourn under the judgments of God. Their land mourned now under the 
 judgment of famine; the <I>pleasant places,</I> or rather <I>the 
 pastures,</I> or (as some read it) <I>the habitations of the 
 wilderness,</I> are dried up for want of rain, and yet we see no signs 
 of repentance. They answer not the end of the correction. The tenour 
 and tendency of men's conversations are sinful, <I>their course 
 continues evil,</I> as bad as ever, and they will not be diverted from 
 it. They have a great deal of resolution, but it is turned the wrong 
 way; they are <I>zealously affected,</I> but not <I>in a good thing: 
 Their force is not right;</I> their <I>heart is fully set in them to do 
 evil,</I> and they are not valiant for the truth, have not courage 
 enough to break off their evil courses, though they see God thus 
 contending with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He charges it all upon the prophets and priests, especially the 
 prophets. They are <I>both profane</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);

 the priests profane the ordinances of God they pretend to administer; 
 the prophets profane the word of God they pretend to deliver; their 
 converse and all their conversation are profane, and then it is not 
 strange that the people are so debauched. They both <I>play the 
 hypocrite</I> (so some read it); under sacred pretensions they carry on 
 the vilest designs; yea, not only in their own houses, and the bad 
 houses they frequent, but <I>in my house have I found their 
 wickedness;</I> in the temple, where the priests ministered, where the 
 prophets prophesied, there were they guilty both of idolatry and 
 immorality. See a woeful instance in Hophni and Phinehas, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:22">1 Sam. ii. 22</A>.
 
 God searches his house, and what wickedness is there he will find it
 out; and the nearer it is to him the more offensive it is. Two things 
 are charged upon them:--

 1. That they taught people to sin by their examples. He compares them
 with the prophets of Samaria, the head city of the kingdom of the ten 
 tribes, which had been long since laid waste. It was the folly of the
 prophets of Samaria that <I>they prophesied in Baal,</I> in Baal's 
 name; so Ahab's prophets did, and so <I>they caused my people Israel to 
 err,</I> to forsake the service of the true God and to worship Baal,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Now the prophets of Jerusalem did not do so; they prophesied in the 
 name of the true God, and valued themselves upon that, that they were 
 not like the prophets of Samaria, who prophesied in Baal; but what the 
 better, when they debauched the nation as much by their immoralities as 
 the other had done by their idolatries? It is a horrible thing in the 
 prophets of Jerusalem that they make use of the name of the holy God, 
 and yet wallow in all manner of impurity; they make nothing of 
 committing adultery. They make use of the name of the God of truth, and 
 yet <I>walk in lies;</I> they not only prophesy lies, but in their 
 common conversation one cannot believe a word they say. It is all 
 either jest and banter or fraud and design. Thus they encourage sinners 
 to go on in their wicked ways; for every one will say, "Surely we may 
 do as the prophets do; who can expect that we should be better than our 
 teachers?" By this means it is that none returns from his wickedness; 
 but they all say that they shall have <I>peace,</I> though they go on, 
 for their prophets tell them so. By this means Judah and Jerusalem have 
 become <I>as Sodom and Gomorrah,</I> that were wicked, <I>and sinners 
 before the Lord exceedingly;</I> and God looked upon them accordingly 
 as fit for nothing but to be destroyed, as they were, with fire and 
 brimstone. 

 2. That they encouraged people in sin by their false prophecies. They 
 made themselves believe that there was no harm, no danger in sin, and 
 practiced accordingly; and then no marvel that they made others believe 
 so too

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>They speak a vision of their own heart;</I> it is the product of 
 their own invention, and agrees with their own inclination, but it is 
 <I>not out of the mouth of the Lord;</I> he never dictated it to them, 
 nor did it agree either with the law of Moses or with what God has 
 spoken by other prophets. They tell sinners that it shall be well with
 them though they persist in their sins, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 See here who those are that they encourage--those that <I>despise 
 God,</I> that slight his authority, and have low and mean thoughts of 
 his institutions, and those that <I>walk after the imagination of their 
 own heart,</I> that are worshippers of idols and slaves to their own 
 lusts; those that are devoted to their pleasures put contempt upon 
 their God. Yet see how these prophets caressed and flattered them: they 
 should have been still saying, There is no peace to those that go on in 
 their evil ways--<I>Those that despise God shall be lightly 
 esteemed</I>--Woe, and a thousand woes, to them; but they still said, 
 <I>You shall have peace; no evil shall come upon you.</I> And, which 
 was worst of all, they told them, <I>God has said so,</I> so making him 
 to patronize sin, and to contradict himself. Note, Those that are 
 resolved to go on in their evil ways will justly be given up to believe 
 the strong delusions of those who tell them that they shall have peace 
 though they go on.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. God disowns all that these false prophets said to sooth people up 
 in their sins 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>I have not sent these prophets;</I> they never had any mission from 
 God. They were not only not sent by him on this errand, but they were 
 never sent by him on any errand; he never had employed them in any 
 service or business for him; and, as to this matter, whereas they 
 pretended to have instructions from him to assure this people of peace, 
 he declares that he never gave them any such instructions. Yet they 
 were very forward--<I>they ran;</I> they were very bold--<I>they 
 prophesied</I> without any of that difficulty with which the true 
 prophets sometimes struggled. They said to sinners, <I>You shall have 
 peace.</I> But 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "<I>Who hath stood in the counsel of the Lord?</I> Who of you has, that 
 are so confident of this? You deliver this message with a great deal
 of assurance; but have you consulted God about it? No; you never 
 considered whether it be agreeable to the discoveries God has made of 
 himself, whether it will consist with the honour of his holiness and 
 justice, to let sinners go unpunished. You have not <I>perceived and 
 heard his word,</I> nor <I>marked</I> that; you have not compared this 
 with the scripture; if you had taken notice of that, and of the 
 constant tenour of it, you would never have delivered such a message." 
 The prophets themselves must try the spirits by the touchstone of the 
 law and of the testimony, as well as those to whom they prophesy; but 
 which of those did so that prophesied of peace? That they did not
 <I>stand in God's counsel</I> nor <I>hear his word</I> is proved 
 afterwards, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 <I>If they had stood in my counsel,</I> as they pretend, 

 1. They would have made the scriptures their standard: <I>They would 
 have caused my people to hear my words,</I> and would have 
 conscientiously kept closely to them. But, not speaking according to 
 that rule, it is a plain evidence that there is no light in them. 

 2. They would have made the conversion of souls their business, and
 would have aimed at that in all their preaching. They would have done
 all they could to <I>turn</I> people <I>from their evil way</I> in 
 general and from all the particular <I>evil of their doings.</I> They 
 would have encouraged and assisted the reformation of manners, would 
 have made this their scope in all their preaching, to part between men 
 and their sins; but it appeared that this was a thing they never aimed 
 at, but, on the contrary, to encourage sinners in their sins. 

 3. They would have had some seals of their ministry. This sense our
 translation gives it: <I>If they had stood in my counsel,</I> and the 
 words they had preached had been <I>my words,</I> then they should 
 <I>have turned them from their evil way;</I> a divine power should have 
 gone along with the word for the conviction of sinners. God will bless 
 his own institutions. Yet this is no certain rule; Jeremiah himself, 
 though God sent him, prevailed with but few to <I>turn from their evil 
 way.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. God threatens to punish these prophets for their wickedness. They 
 promised the people <I>peace;</I> and to show them the folly of that 
 God tells them that they should have no peace themselves. They were 
 very unfit to warrant the people, and pass their word to them that no 
 evil shall come upon them, when all evil is coming upon themselves and 
 they are not aware of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Because the prophets and priests are profane, <I>therefore their ways 
 shall be unto them as slippery ways in the darkness.</I> Those that 
 undertake to lead others, because they mislead them, and know they do 
 so, shall themselves have no comfort in their way. 

 1. They pretend to show others the way, but they shall themselves be in
 the dark, or in a mist; their light or sight shall fail, so that they 
 shall not be able to look before them, shall have no forecast for 
 themselves. 

 2. They pretend to give assurances to others, but they themselves shall 
 find no firm footing: <I>Their ways shall be to them as slippery 
 ways,</I> in which they shall not go with any steadiness, safety, or 
 satisfaction.

 3. They pretend to make the people easy with their flatteries, but they
 shall themselves be uneasy: <I>They shall be driven,</I> forced forward 
 as captives, or making their escape as those that are pursued, and 
 <I>they shall fall in the way</I> by which they hoped to escape, and so 
 fall into the enemies' hands. 

 4. They pretend to prevent the evil that threatens others, but God will 
 <I>bring evil upon them, even the year of their visitation,</I> the 
 time fixed for calling them to an account; such a time is fixed 
 concerning all that do not judge themselves, and it will be an evil 
 time. <I>The year of visitation</I> is the year of recompenses. It is 
 further threatened

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 <I>I will feed them with wormwood,</I> or poison, with that which is 
 not only nauseous, but noxious, and <I>make them drink waters of 
 gall,</I> or (as some read it) <I>juice of hemlock;</I> see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:15"><I>ch.</I> ix. 15</A>.

 Justly is the cup of trembling put into their hand first, for <I>from
 the prophets of Jerusalem,</I> who should have been patterns of piety 
 and every thing that is praiseworthy, even <I>from them has profaneness 
 gone forth into all the lands.</I> Nothing more effectually debauches a 
 nation than the debauchery of ministers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The people are here warned not to give any credit to these false 
 prophets; for, though they flattered them with hopes of impunity, the 
 judgments of God would certainly break out against them, unless they 
 repented 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 "Take notice of what God says, and <I>hearken not to the words of these 
 prophets;</I> for you will find, in the issue, that God's word shall 
 stand, and not theirs. God's word will make you serious, but <I>they 
 make you vain,</I> feed you with vain hopes, which will fail you at 
 last. They tell you, <I>No evil shall come upon you;</I> but hear what 
 God says 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 <I>Behold, a whirlwind of the Lord has gone forth in fury.</I> They 
 tell you, All shall be calm and serene; but God tells you, There is a 
 storm coming, a <I>whirlwind of the Lord,</I> of his sending, and 
 therefore there is no standing before it. It is a whirlwind raised by 
 divine wrath; it has <I>gone forth in fury,</I> a wind that is brought 
 forth out of the treasuries of divine vengeance; and therefore it is a 
 <I>grievous whirlwind,</I> and shall light heavily, with rain and hail, 
 <I>upon the head of the wicked,</I> which they cannot avoid nor find 
 any shelter from." It shall <I>fall upon the wicked</I> prophets 
 themselves who deceived the people, and the wicked people who suffered 
 themselves to be deceived. A <I>horrible tempest</I> shall be <I>the 
 portion of their cup,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+11:6">Ps. xi. 6</A>.

 This sentence is bound on as irreversible

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>The anger of the Lord shall not return,</I> for the decree has gone 
 forth. God will not alter his mind, nor suffer his anger to be turned 
 away, <I>till he have executed</I> the sentence and <I>performed the 
 thoughts of his heart.</I> God's whirlwind, when it comes <I>down from 
 heaven, returns not thither, but accomplishes that for which he sent 
 it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:11">Isa. lv. 11</A>.

 This they will not consider now; but <I>in the latter days you shall
 consider it perfectly,</I> consider it <I>with understanding</I> (so 
 the word is) or <I>with consideration.</I> Note, Those that will not 
 fear the threatenings shall feel the execution of them, and will then 
 perfectly understand what they will not now admit the evidence of, what 
 a <I>fearful thing it is to fall into the hands of</I> a just and 
 jealous God. Those that will not consider in time will be made to 
 consider when it is too late. <I>Son, remember.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. Several things are here offered to the consideration of these 
 false prophets for their conviction, that, if possible, they might be 
 brought to recant their error and acknowledge the cheat they had put 
 upon God's people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Let them consider that though they may impose upon men God is too 
 wise to be imposed upon. Men cannot see through their fallacies, but 
 God can and does. Here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) God asserts his own omnipresence and omniscience in general, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.

 When they told the people that no evil should befall them though they 
 went on in their evil ways they went upon atheistical principles, that 
 the Lord doth not see their sin, that he cannot judge through the dark 
 cloud, that he will not require it; and therefore they must be taught 
 the first principles of their religion, and confronted with the most 
 incontestable self-evident truths.

 [1.] That though God's throne is prepared in the heavens, and this 
 earth seems to be at a distance from him, yet he is a God here in this 
 lower world, which seems to be afar off, as well as in the upper world, 
 which seems to be at hand, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 The eye of God is the same on earth that it is in heaven. Here it 
 <I>runs to and fro</I> as well as there 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+16:9">2 Chron. xvi. 9</A>);

 and what is in the minds of men, whose spirits are veiled in flesh, is
 as clearly seen by him as what is in the mind of angels, those unveiled 
 spirits above that surround his throne. The power of God is the same on 
 earth among its inhabitants that it is in heaven among its armies. With 
 us nearness and distance make a great difference both in our 
 observations and in our operations, but it is not so with God; to him 
 darkness and light, at hand and afar off, are both alike.

 [2.] That, how ingenious and industrious soever men are to disguise 
 themselves and their own characters and counsels, they cannot possibly 
 be concealed from God's all-seeing eye 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 "<I>Can any hide himself in the secret places</I> of the earth, <I>that 
 I shall not see him?</I> Can any hide his projects and intentions in 
 the secret places of the heart, that I shall not see them?" No arts of 
 concealment can hide men from the eye of God, nor deceive his judgment 
 of them.

 [3.] That he is every where present; he does not only rule heaven and 
 earth, and uphold both by his universal providence, but he <I>fills 
 heaven and earth</I> by his essential presence,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:7,8">Ps. cxxxix. 7, 8</A>,

 &c. No place can either include him or exclude him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He applies this to these prophets, who had a notable art of 
 disguising themselves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>):

 <I>I have heard what the prophets said that prophesy lies in my 
 name.</I> They thought that he was so wholly taken up with the other 
 world that he had no leisure to take cognizance of what passed in this. 
 But God will make them know that he knows all their impostures, all the 
 shams they have put upon the world, under colour of divine revelation. 
 What they intended to humour the people with they pretended to have had 
 from God in a dream, when there was no such thing. This they could not 
 discover. If a man tell me that he dreamed so and so, I cannot 
 contradict him; he knows I cannot. But God discovered the fraud. 
 Perhaps the false prophets whispered what they had to say in the ears 
 of such as were their confidants, saying, So and so <I>I have 
 dreamed;</I> but God overheard them. The heart-searching eye of God 
 traced them in all the methods they took to deceive the people, and he 
 cries out, <I>How long?</I> Shall I always bear with them? <I>Is it in 
 the hearts of those prophets</I> (so some read it) <I>to be ever 
 prophesying lies and prophesying the deceits of their own hearts?</I> 
 Will they never see what an affront they put upon God, what an abuse 
 they put upon the people, and what judgments they are preparing for 
 themselves?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Let them consider that their palming upon people counterfeit 
 revelations, and fathering their own fancies upon divine inspiration, 
 was the ready way to bring all religion into contempt and make men turn 
 atheists and infidels; and this was the thing they really intended, 
 though they frequently made mention of the name of God, and prefaced 
 all they said with, <I>Thus saith the Lord.</I> Yet, says God, <I>They 
 think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams.</I> They 
 designed to draw people off from the worship of God, from all regard to 
 God's laws and ordinances and the true prophets, as their fathers 
 <I>forgot God's name for Baal.</I> Note, The great thing Satan aims at 
 is to make people forget God, and all that whereby he has made himself 
 known; and he has many subtle methods to bring them to this. Sometimes 
 he does it by setting up false gods (bring men in love with Baal, and 
 they soon forget the name of God), sometimes by misrepresenting the 
 true God, as if he were altogether such a one as ourselves. Pretenses 
 to new revelation may prove as dangerous to religion as the denying of 
 all revelation; and false prophets in God's name may perhaps do more 
 mischief to the power of godliness than false prophets in Baal's name, 
 as being less guarded against.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Let them consider what a vast difference there was between their 
 prophecies and those that were delivered by the true prophets of the 
 Lord 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 <I>The prophet that has a dream,</I> which was the way of inspiration 
 that the false prophets most pretended to, if he has a dream, <I>let 
 him tell it as a dream;</I> so Mr. Gataker reads it. "Let him lay no 
 more stress upon it than men do upon their dreams, nor expect any more 
 regard to be had to it. Let them not say that it is from God, nor call 
 their foolish dreams divine oracles. But let the true prophet, that 
 <I>has my word, speak my word faithfully,</I> speak it <I>as a 
 truth</I>" (so some read it): "let him keep closely to his 
 instructions, and you will soon perceive a vast difference between the 
 dreams that the false prophets tell and the divine dictates which the 
 true prophets deliver. He that pretends to have a message from God, 
 whether by dream or voice, let him declare it, and it will easily 
 appear which is of God and which is not. Those that have spiritual 
 senses exercised will be able to distinguish; for <I>what is the chaff 
 to the wheat?</I> The promises of peace which these prophets make to 
 you are no more to be compared to God's promises than chaff to wheat." 
 Men's fancies are light, and vain, and worthless, as the chaff <I>which 
 the wind drives away.</I> But the word of God has substance in it; it 
 is of value, is food for the soul, the bread of life. Wheat was the 
 staple commodity of Canaan, that valley of vision, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:8,Eze+27:17">Deut. viii. 8; Ezek. xxvii. 17</A>.

 There is as much difference between the vain fancies of men and the 
 pure word of God as between the chaff and the wheat. It follows

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 <I>Is not my word like a fire, saith the Lord?</I> Is their word so? 
 Has it the power and efficacy that the word of God has? No; nothing 
 like it; there is no more comparison than between painted fire and real 
 fire. Theirs is like an <I>ignis fatuus--a deceiving meteor,</I> 
 leading men into by-paths and dangerous precipices. Note, The word of 
 God is like fire. The law was a fiery law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:2">Deut. xxxiii. 2</A>),

 and of the gospel Christ says, <I>I have come to send fire on the
 earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:49">Luke xii. 49</A>.

 Fire has different effects, according as the matter is on which it
 works; it hardens clay, but softens wax; it consumes the dross, but 
 purifies the gold. So the word of God is to some <I>a savour of life 
 unto life, to others of death unto death.</I> God appeals here to the 
 consciences of those to whom the word was sent: "<I>Is not my word like 
 fire?</I> Has it not been so to you? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:6">Zech. i. 6</A>.

 Speak as you have found." It is compared likewise to a <I>hammer
 breaking the rock in pieces.</I> The unhumbled heart of man is like a 
 rock; if it will not be melted by the word of God as the fire, it will 
 be broken to pieces by it as the hammer. Whatever opposition is given
 to the word, it will be borne down and broken to pieces.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Let them consider that while they went on in this course God was 
 against them. Three times they are told this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:30,31,32"><I>v.</I> 30, 31, 32</A>.

 <I>Behold, I am against the prophets.</I> They pretended to be for God, 
 and made use of his name, but were really against him; he looks upon 
 them as they were really, and is against them. How can they be long 
 safe, or at all easy, that have a God of almighty power against them? 
 While these prophets were promising peace to the people God was 
 proclaiming war against them. They stand indicted here, 

 (1.) For robbery: <I>They steal my word every one from his 
 neighbour.</I> Some understand it of that word of God which the good 
 prophets preached; they stole their sermons, their expressions, and 
 mingled them with their own, as hucksters mingle bad wares with some 
 that are good, to make them vendible. Those that were strangers to the 
 spirit of the true prophets mimicked their language, picked up some 
 good sayings of theirs, and delivered them to the people as if they had 
 been their own, but with an ill grace; they were not of a piece with 
 the rest of their discourses. <I>The legs of the lame are not equal, so 
 is a parable in the mouth of fools,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+26:7">Prov. xxvi. 7</A>.

 Others understand it of the word of God as it was received and 
 entertained by some of the people; they stole it out of their hearts, 
 as the wicked one in the parable is said to steal the good seed of the 
 word, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:19">Matt. xiii. 19</A>.

 By their insinuations they diminished the authority, and so weakened
 the efficacy, of the word of God upon the minds of those that seemed to 
 be under convictions by it.

 (2.) They stand indicted for counterfeiting the broad seal.
 <I>Therefore</I> God is against them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),

 because they <I>use their tongues</I> at their pleasure in their 
 discourses to the people; they say what they themselves think fit, and 
 then father it upon God, pretend they had it from him, and say, He 
 saith it. Some read it, <I>They smooth their tongues;</I> they are very 
 complaisant to the people, and say nothing but what is pleasing and 
 plausible; they never reprove them nor threaten them, but <I>their 
 words are smoother than butter.</I> Thus they ingratiate themselves 
 with them, and get money by them; and they have the impudence and 
 impiety to make God the patron of their lies; they say, "He saith so." 
 What greater indignity can be done to the God of truth than to lay the 
 brats of the father of lies at his door? 

 (3.) They stand indicted as common cheats

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):

 <I>I am against them,</I> for they <I>prophesy false dreams,</I> 
 pretending that to be a divine inspiration which is but an invention of 
 their own. This is a horrid fraud; nor will it excuse them to say,
 <I>Caveat emptor--Let the buyer take care of himself,</I> and <I>Si 
 populus vult decipi, decipiatur--If people will be deceived, let 
 them.</I> No; it is the people's fault that they err, that they take 
 things upon trust, and do not try the spirits; but it is much more the 
 prophets' fault that they cause God's people <I>to err by their lies 
 and by their lightness,</I> by the flatteries of their preaching 
 soothing them up in their sins, and by the looseness and lewdness of 
 their conversation encouraging them to persist in them.

 [1.] God disowns their having any commission from him: <I>I sent them 
 not, nor commanded them;</I> they are not God's messengers, nor is what 
 they say his message.

 [2.] He therefore justly denies his blessing with them: <I>Therefore 
 they shall not profit this people at all.</I> All the profit they aim 
 at is to make them easy; but they shall not so much as do that, for 
 God's providences will at the same time be making them uneasy. They 
 <I>do not profit this people</I> (so some read it); and more is implied 
 than is expressed; they not only do them no good, but do them a great 
 deal of hurt. Note, Those that corrupt the word of God, while they 
 pretend to preach it, are so far from edifying the church that they do 
 it the greatest mischief imaginable.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>33  And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask
 thee, saying, What <I>is</I> the burden of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>? thou shalt then
 say unto them, What burden? I will even forsake you, saith the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 34  And <I>as for</I> the prophet, and the priest, and the people,
 that shall say, The burden of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, I will even punish that
 man and his house.
 &nbsp; 35  Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one
 to his brother, What hath the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> answered? and, What hath the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spoken?
 &nbsp; 36  And the burden of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall ye mention no more: for
 every man's word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the
 words of the living God, of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts our God.
 &nbsp; 37  Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 answered thee? and, What hath the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spoken?
 &nbsp; 38  But since ye say, The burden of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; therefore thus
 saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Because ye say this word, The burden of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>;
 &nbsp; 39  Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I
 will forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers,
 <I>and cast you</I> out of my presence:
 &nbsp; 40  And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a
 perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The profaneness of the people, with that of the priests and prophets, 
 is here reproved in a particular instance, which may seem of small 
 moment in comparison of their greater crimes; but profaneness in common 
 discourse, and the debauching of the language of a nation, being a 
 notorious evidence of the prevalency of wickedness in it, we are not to 
 think it strange that this matter was so largely and warmly insisted 
 upon here. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The sin here charged upon them is bantering God's prophets and 
 dialect they used, and jesting with sacred things. They asked, <I>What 
 is the burden of the Lord?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:33,34"><I>v.</I> 33 and <I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 They say, <I>The burden of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 This was the word that gave great offence to God, that, whenever they 
 spoke of <I>the word of the Lord,</I> they called it, in scorn and 
 derision, <I>the burden of the Lord.</I> Now, 

 1. This was a word that the prophets much used, and used it seriously,
 to show what a weight the word of God was upon their spirits, of what 
 importance it was, and how pressingly it should come upon those that 
 heard it. The words of the false prophets had nothing ponderous in 
 them, but God's words had; those were as chaff, these as wheat. Now the 
 profane scoffers took this word, and made a jest and a byword of it; 
 they made people merry with it, that so, when the prophets used it, 
 they might not make people serious with it. Note, It has been the 
 artifice of Satan, in all ages, to obstruct the efficacy of sacred 
 things by turning them into matter of sport and ridicule; the mocking 
 of God's messengers was the baffling of his messages. 

 2. Perhaps this word was caught at and reproached by the scoffers as
 an improper word, newly-coined by the prophets, and not used in that 
 sense by any classic author. It was only in this and the last age that 
 the <I>word of the Lord</I> was called the <I>burden of the Lord,</I> 
 and it could not be found in their lexicons to have that signification. 
 But if men take a liberty, as we see they do, to form new phrases which 
 they think more expressive and significant in other parts of learning, 
 why not in divinity? But especially we must observe it as a rule that 
 the Spirit of God is not tied to our rules of speaking. 

 3. Some think that because when the <I>word of the Lord</I> is called
 a <I>burden</I> it signifies some word of reproof and threatening, 
 which would lay a load upon the hearers (yet I know not whether that 
 observation will always hold), therefore in using this word <I>the 
 burden of the Lord</I> in a canting way they reflected upon God as 
 always bearing hard upon them, always teasing them, always frightening 
 them, and so making the word of God a perpetual uneasiness to them. 
 They make the word of God a burden to themselves, and then quarrel with 
 the ministers for making it a burden to them. Thus the scoffers of the 
 latter days, while they slight heaven and salvation, reproach faithful 
 ministers for preaching hell and damnation. Upon the whole we may 
 observe that, how light soever men may make of it, the great God takes 
 notice of, and is much displeased with, those who burlesque sacred 
 things, and who, that they may make a jest of scripture truths and 
 laws, put jests upon scripture language. In such wit as this I am sure
 there is no wisdom, and so it will appear at last. <I>Be you not 
 mockers, lest your bands be made strong.</I> Those that were here 
 guilty of this sin were some of the false prophets, who perhaps came to 
 steal the word of God from the true prophets, some of the priests, who 
 perhaps came to seek occasions against them on which to ground an 
 information, and some of the people, who had learned of the profane 
 priests and prophets to play with the things of God. The people would 
 not have affronted the prophet and his God thus if the priests and the 
 prophets, those ringleaders of mischief, had not shown them the 
 way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. When they are reproved for this profane way of speaking they are 
 directed how to express themselves more decently. We do not find that 
 the prophets are directed to make no more use of this word; we find it 
 used long after this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:1,Mal+1:1,Na+1:1,Hab+1:1">Zech. ix. 1; 
 Mal. i. 1; Nah. i. 1; Hab. i. 1</A>);

 and we do not find it once used in this sense by Jeremiah either before
 or after. It is true indeed that in many cases it is advisable to make 
 no use of such words and things as some have made a bad use of, and it 
 may be prudent to avoid such phrases as, though innocent enough, are in 
 danger of being perverted and made stumbling-blocks. But here God will 
 have the prophet keep to his rule

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:19"><I>ch.</I> xv. 19</A>),

 <I>Let them return unto thee, but return not thou unto them.</I> Do not
 thou leave off using this word, but let them leave off abusing it. You 
 <I>shall not mention the burden of the Lord any more</I> in this 
 profane careless manner 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>),

 for it is <I>perverting the words of the living God</I> and making a 
 bad use of them, which is an impious dangerous thing; for, consider, he 
 is <I>the Lord of hosts our God.</I> Note, If we will but look upon God 
 as we ought to do in his greatness and goodness, and be but duly 
 sensible of our relation and obligation to him, it may be hoped that we 
 shall not dare to affront him by making a jest of his words. It is an 
 impudent thing to abuse him that is the <I>living God,</I> the <I>Lord 
 of hosts,</I> and <I>our God.</I> How then must they express 
 themselves? He tells them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>):

 <I>Thus shalt thou say to the prophet,</I> when thou art enquiring of 
 him, <I>What hath the Lord answered thee? And what hath the Lord 
 spoken?</I> And they must say thus when they enquire of <I>their 
 neighbours,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 Note, We must always speak of the things of God reverently and 
 seriously, and as becomes the oracles of God. It is a commendable 
 practice to enquire after the mind of God, to enquire of our brethren 
 what they have heard, to enquire of our prophets what they have to say 
 from God; but then, to show that we enquire for a right end, we must do 
 it after a right manner. Ministers may learn here, when they reprove 
 people for what they say and do amiss, to teach them how to say and do 
 better.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Because they would not leave off this bad way of speaking, though 
 they were admonished of it, God threatens them here with utter ruin. 
 They would still say, <I>The burden of the Lord,</I> though God had 
 sent to them to forbid them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 What little regard have those to the divine authority that will not be 
 persuaded by it to leave an idle word! But see what will come of it. 

 1. Those shall be severely reckoned with that thus <I>pervert the
 words of God,</I> that put a wrong construction on them and make a bad 
 use of them; and it shall be made to appear that it is a great 
 provocation to God to mock his messengers: <I>I will even punish that 
 man and his house;</I> whether he be prophet or priest, or one of the 
 common people, it shall be visited upon him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 Perverting God's word, and ridiculing the preachers of it, are sins 
 that bring ruining judgments upon families and entail a curse upon a 
 house. Another threatening we have 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 <I>Every man's word shall be his own burden;</I> that is, the guilt of 
 this sin shall be so heavy upon him as to sink him into the pit of 
 destruction. God <I>shall make their own tongue to fall upon them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+64:8">Ps. lxiv. 8</A>.

 God will give them enough of their jest, so that <I>the burden of the
 Lord</I> they shall have no heart to mention any more; it will be too 
 heavy to make a jest of. They are as <I>the madman that casts 
 firebrands, arrows, and death,</I> while they pretend to be <I>in 
 sport.</I>

 2. The words of God, though thus perverted, shall be accomplished. Do 
 they ask, <I>What is the burden of the Lord?</I> Let the prophet ask 
 them, <I>What burden</I> do you mean? Is it this: <I>I will even 
 forsake you?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 This is the burden that shall be laid and bound upon them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:39,40"><I>v.</I> 39, 40</A>):
 
 "<I>Behold I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake 
 you.</I> I will leave you, and have no thoughts of returning to you." 
 Those are miserable indeed that are forsaken and forgotten of God; and 
 men's bantering God's judgments will not baffle them. Jerusalem was the 
 city God had taken to himself as a holy city, and then <I>given to them 
 and their fathers;</I> but that shall now be forsaken and forgotten.
 God had taken them to be a people near to him; but they shall now be 
 <I>cast out of his presence.</I> They had been great and honourable 
 among the nations; but now God will bring upon them an <I>everlasting 
 reproach</I> and a <I>perpetual shame.</I> Both their sin and their 
 punishment shall be their lasting disgrace. It is here upon record, to 
 their infamy, and will remain so to the world's end. Note, God's word 
 will be magnified and made honourable when those that mock at it shall 
 be vilified and made contemptible. <I>Those that despise me shall be 
 lightly esteemed.</I></P>
