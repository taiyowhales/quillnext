 Though the vision of God's glory had gone up from the prophet, yet his 
 word comes to him still, and is by him sent to the people, and to the 
 same purport with that which was discovered to him in the vision, 
 namely, to set forth the terrible judgments that were coming upon 
 Jerusalem, by which the city and temple should be entirely laid waste. 
 In this chapter, 

 I. The prophet, by removing his stuff, and quitting his lodgings, must
 be a sign to set forth Zedekiah's flight out of Jerusalem in the utmost 
 confusion when the Chaldeans took the city, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:1-16">ver. 1-16</A>.

 II. The prophet, by eating his meat with trembling, must be a sign to
 set forth the famine in the city during the siege, and the 
 consternation that the inhabitants should be in, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:17-20">ver. 17-20</A>.

 III. A message is sent from God to the people, to assure them that all
 these predictions should have their accomplishment very shortly, and 
 not be deferred, as they flattered themselves they would be,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> also came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house,
 which have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and
 hear not: for they <I>are</I> a rebellious house.
 &nbsp; 3  Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing,
 and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy
 place to another place in their sight: it may be they will
 consider, though they <I>be</I> a rebellious house.
 &nbsp; 4  Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight,
 as stuff for removing: and thou shalt go forth at even in their
 sight, as they that go forth into captivity.
 &nbsp; 5  Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out
 thereby.
 &nbsp; 6  In their sight shalt thou bear <I>it</I> upon <I>thy</I> shoulders,
 <I>and</I> carry <I>it</I> forth in the twilight: thou shalt cover thy
 face, that thou see not the ground: for I have set thee <I>for</I> a
 sign unto the house of Israel.
 &nbsp; 7  And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by
 day, as stuff for captivity, and in the even I digged through the
 wall with mine hand; I brought <I>it</I> forth in the twilight, <I>and</I>
 I bare <I>it</I> upon <I>my</I> shoulder in their sight.
 &nbsp; 8  And in the morning came the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 9  Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious
 house, said unto thee, What doest thou?
 &nbsp; 10  Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; This burden
 <I>concerneth</I> the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel
 that <I>are</I> among them.
 &nbsp; 11  Say, I <I>am</I> your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be
 done unto them: they shall remove <I>and</I> go into captivity.
 &nbsp; 12  And the prince that <I>is</I> among them shall bear upon <I>his</I>
 shoulder in the twilight, and shall go forth: they shall dig
 through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face,
 that he see not the ground with <I>his</I> eyes.
 &nbsp; 13  My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in
 my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon <I>to</I> the land of the
 Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.
 &nbsp; 14  And I will scatter toward every wind all that <I>are</I> about
 him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword
 after them.
 &nbsp; 15  And they shall know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, when I shall
 scatter them among the nations, and disperse them in the
 countries.
 &nbsp; 16  But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the
 famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their
 abominations among the heathen whither they come; and they shall
 know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.

 Perhaps Ezekiel reflected with so much pleasure upon the vision he had 
 had of the glory of God that often, since it went up from him, he was 
 wishing it might come down to him again, and, having seen it once and a 
 second time, he was willing to hope he might be a third time so 
 favoured; but we do not find that he ever saw it any more, and yet 
 <I>the word of the Lord comes to</I> him; for God did <I>in divers 
 manners speak to the fathers</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:1">Heb. i. 1</A>)

 and they often <I>heard the words of God</I> when they did not <I>see
 the visions of the Almighty.</I> Faith comes by hearing that word of 
 prophecy which is more sure than vision. We may keep up our communion 
 with God without raptures and ecstasies. In these verses the prophet is 
 directed,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. By what signs and actions to express the approaching captivity of 
 Zedekiah king of Judah; that was the thing to be foretold, and it is 
 foretold to those that are already in captivity, because as long as 
 Zedekiah was upon the throne they flattered themselves with hopes that 
 he would make his part good with the king of Babylon, whose yoke he was 
 now projecting to shake off, from which, it is probable, these poor 
 captives promised themselves great things; and it may be, when he was 
 forming that design, he privately sent encouragement to them to hope 
 that he would rescue them shortly, or procure their liberty by exchange 
 of prisoners. While they were fed with these vain hopes they could not 
 set themselves either to submit to their affliction or to get good by 
 their affliction. It was therefore necessary, but very difficult, to 
 convince them that Zedekiah, instead of being their deliverer, should 
 very shortly be their fellow-suffered. Now, one would think it might 
 have been sufficient if the prophet had only told them this in God's 
 name, as he does afterwards 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);

 but, to prepare them for the prophecy of it, he must first give them a 
 sign of it, must speak it to their eyes first and then to their ears: 
 and here we have, 
 
 1. The reason why he must take this method
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 It is because they are a stupid, dull, unthinking people, that will not 
 heed or will soon forget what they only hear of, or at least will not 
 be at all affected with it; it will make no impression at all upon 
 them: <I>Thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house,</I> whom it 
 is next to impossible to work any good upon. <I>They have eyes and 
 ears,</I> they have intellectual powers and faculties, but they <I>see 
 not,</I> they <I>hear not.</I> They were idolaters, whose character it 
 was that they were like the idols they worshipped, which <I>have eyes 
 and see not, ears and hear not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:5,6,8">Ps. cxv. 5, 6, 8</A>.

 Note, Those are to be reckoned rebellious that shut their eyes against
 the divine light and stop their ears to the divine law. The ignorance 
 of those that are wilfully ignorant, that have faculties and means and 
 will not use them, is so far from being their excuse that it adds 
 rebellion to their sin. None so blind, so deaf, as those that will not
 see, that will not hear. They <I>see not,</I> they <I>hear not; for
 they are a rebellious house.</I> The cause is all from themselves: the 
 darkness of the understanding is owing to the stubbornness of the will. 
 Now this is the reason why he must speak to them by signs, as deaf 
 people are taught, that they might be either instructed or ashamed. 
 Note, Ministers must accommodate themselves not only to the weakness, 
 but to the wilfulness of those they deal with, and deal with them 
 accordingly: if they dwell among those that are rebellious they must 
 speak to them the more plainly and pressingly, and take that course 
 that is most likely to work upon them, that they may be left 
 inexcusable.

 2. The method he just take to awaken and affect them; he must furnish 
 himself with all necessaries <I>for removing</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 provide for a journey clothes and money; he must <I>remove from one 
 place to another,</I> as one unsettled and forced to shift; this he 
 must do <I>by day, in the sight</I> of the people; he must bring out 
 all his household goods, to be packed up and sent away 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 and, because all the doors and gates were either locked up that they 
 could not pass through them or so guarded by the enemy that they durst 
 not, he must therefore <I>dig through the wall,</I> and convey his 
 goods away clandestinely through that breach in the wall, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 He must carry his goods away himself upon his own shoulders, for want 
 of a servant to attend him; he must do this <I>in the twilight,</I> 
 that he might not be discovered; and, when he has made what shift he 
 can to secure some of the best of his effects, he must himself steal 
 away <I>at evening in their sight,</I> with fear and trembling, and 
 must go <I>as those that go forth into captivity</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 that is, he must <I>cover</I> his <I>face</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 as being ashamed to be seen and afraid to be known, or in token of very 
 great sorrow and concern; he must go away as a poor broken tradesman, 
 who, when he is forced to shut up shop, hides his head, or quits his 
 country. Thus Ezekiel must be himself a sign to them; and when perhaps 
 he seemed somewhat backward to put himself to all this trouble, and to 
 expose himself to be bantered and ridiculed for it, to reconcile him to 
 it God says 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 "<I>It may be they will consider,</I> and will by it be taken off from 
 their vain confidence, <I>though they be a rebellious house.</I>" Note, 
 We must not despair even of the worst, but that yet they may be brought 
 to bethink themselves and repent; and therefore we must continue the 
 use of proper means for their conviction and conversion, because, while 
 there is life, there is hope. And ministers must be willing to go 
 through the most difficult and inconvenient offices (for such was this 
 of Ezekiel's removing), though there be but the <I>it may be</I> of 
 success. If but one soul be awakened to consider, our care and pains 
 will be well bestowed. 

 3. Ezekiel's ready and punctual obedience to the orders God gave him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>I did so as I was commanded.</I> Hereby he teaches us all, and 
 ministers especially, 

 (1.) To obey with cheerfulness every command of God, even the most 
 difficult. Christ himself <I>learned obedience,</I> and so we must all. 
 
 (2.) To do all we can for the good of the souls of others, to put
 ourselves to any trouble or pains for the conviction of those that are 
 unconvinced. <I>We do all things</I> (that is, we are willing to do
 any thing), <I>dearly beloved, for your edifying.</I> 

 (3.) To be ourselves affected with those things wherewith we desire to 
 affect others. When Ezekiel would give his hearers a melancholy 
 prospect he does himself put on a melancholy aspect. 

 (4.) To sit loose to this world, and prepare to leave it, to carry out 
 our <I>stuff for removing,</I> because <I>we have here no continuing 
 city. Arise, depart, this it not your rest, for it is polluted.</I>
 Thou dwellest <I>in a rebellious house,</I> therefore prepare for 
 removing; for who would not be willing to leave such a house, such a 
 wicked world as this is?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He is directed by what words to explain those signs and actions, as 
 Agabus, when he bound his own hands and feet, told whose binding was 
 thereby signified. But observe, It was not till morning that God gave 
 him an exposition of the sign, till the next morning, to keep up in him 
 a continual dependence upon God for instruction. As what God does, so 
 what he directs us to do, perhaps we know not now, but shall know 
 hereafter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It was supposed that the people would ask the meaning of this sing, 
 or at least they should 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>Hath not the house of Israel said unto thee, What doest thou?</I> 
 Yes, I know they have. <I>Though they</I> are <I>a rebellious 
 house,</I> yet they are inquisitive concerning the mind of God," as 
 those 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:2">Isa. lviii. 2</A>)

 who <I>sought God daily. Therefore</I> the prophet must do such a
 strange uncouth thing, that they might enquire what it meant; and then, 
 it may be hoped, people will take notice of what is told them, and 
 profit by it, when it comes to them in answer to their enquiries. But 
 some understand it as an intimation that they had not made any such 
 enquiries: "<I>Hath not this rebellious house</I> so much as asked 
 thee, <I>What doest thou?</I> No; they take no notice of it; but tell 
 them the meaning of it, though they do not ask." Note, When God sends 
 to us by his ministers he observes what entertainment we give to the 
 messages he sends us; he hearkens and hears what we say to them, and 
 what enquiries we make upon them, and is much displeased if we pass 
 them by without taking any notice of them. When we have heard the word 
 we should apply to our ministers for further instruction; and then we 
 shall know if we thus follow on to know.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The prophet is to tell them the meaning of it. In general 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),
 
 <I>This burden concerns the prince in Jerusalem;</I> they knew who that 
 was, and gloried in it now that they were in captivity that they had a 
 prince of their own in Jerusalem, and that <I>the house of Israel</I> 
 was yet entire there, and therefore doubted not but in time to do well 
 enough. "But tell them," says God, "that in what thou hast done they 
 may read the doom of their friends at Jerusalem. <I>Say, I am your 
 sign,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 As the conversation of ministers should teach the people what they 
 should do, so the providences of God concerning them are sometimes 
 intended to tell them what they must expect. The unsettled state and 
 removals of ministers give warning to people what they must expect in 
 this world, no continuance, but constant changes. When times of
 trouble are coming on Christ tells his disciples, <I>They shall first 
 lay their hands on you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:12">Luke xxi. 12</A>.

 (1.) The people shall be led away into captivity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>As I have done, so shall it be done unto them;</I> they shall be 
 forced away from their own houses, no more to return to them, neither 
 shall <I>their place know them any more.</I> We cannot say concerning 
 our dwelling-place that it is our resting-place; for how far we may be 
 tossed from it before we die we cannot foresee. 

 (2.) The prince shall in vain attempt to make his escape; for he also 
 shall go into captivity. Jeremiah had told Zedekiah the same to his 
 face 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:3">Jer. xxxiv. 3</A>):

 <I>Thou shalt not escape, but shalt surely be taken.</I> Ezekiel here
 foretels it to those who made him their confidence and promised 
 themselves relief from him. 

 [1.] That he shall himself carry away his own goods: <I>He shall bear
 upon his shoulder</I> some of his most valuable effects. Note, The 
 judgments of God can turn a prince into a porter. He that was wont to 
 have the regalia carried before him, and to march through the city at 
 noon-day, shall now himself carry his goods on his back and steal away 
 out of the city in the twilight. See what a change sin makes with men! 
 All the avenues to the palace being carefully watched by the enemy, 
 <I>they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby.</I> Men shall 
 be their own house-breakers, and steal away their own goods; so it is 
 when the sword of war has cancelled all right and property. 

 [2.] That he shall attempt to escape in a disguise, with a mask or a
 visor on, which <I>shall cover his face,</I> so that he shall be able 
 only to look before him, and shall <I>not see the ground with his 
 eyes.</I> He who, when he was in pomp, affected to be seen, now that he 
 is in his flight is afraid to be seen; let none therefore either be 
 proud of being looked at or over-much pleased with looking about them, 
 when they see a king with <I>his face covered, that he cannot see the 
 ground.</I> 

 [3.] That he shall be made a prisoner and carried captive into Babylon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>My net will I spread upon him and he shall be taken in my snare.</I> 
 It seemed to be the Chaldeans' net and their snare, but God owns them 
 for his. Those that think to escape the sword of the Lord will find 
 themselves taken in his net. Jeremiah had said that king Zedekiah
 should <I>see the king of Babylon</I> and that he should <I>go to 
 Babylon;</I> Ezekiel says, He shall be <I>brought to Babylon,</I> yet 
 he <I>shall not see it,</I> though <I>he shall die there.</I> Those 
 that were disposed to cavil would perhaps object that these two 
 prophets contradicted one another; for one said, He shall <I>see the 
 king of Babylon,</I> the other said, He shall <I>not see Babylon;</I> 
 and yet both proved true: he did <I>see the king of Babylon</I> at 
 Riblah, where he passed sentence upon him for his rebellion, but there 
 he had his eyes put out, so that he did <I>not see Babylon</I> when he 
 was brought thither. These captives expected to see their prince come 
 to Babylon as a conqueror, to bring them out of their trouble; but he 
 shall come thither a prisoner, and his disgrace will be a great 
 addition to their troubles. Little joy could they have in seeing him 
 when he could not see them. 

 [4.] That all his guards should be dispersed and utterly disabled for
 doing him any service

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>I will scatter all that are about him to help him,</I> so that he 
 shall be left helpless; <I>I will scatter them among the nations and 
 disperse them in the countries</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 to be monuments of divine justice wherever they go. But are there not 
 hopes that they may rally again? (he that flies one time may fight
 another time); no: <I>I will draw out the sword after them,</I> which 
 shall cut them off wherever if finds them; for the sword that God draws 
 out will be sure to do the execution designed. Yet of Zedekiah's 
 scattered troops some shall escape 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>I will leave a few men of them.</I> Though they shall all be 
 scattered, yet they shall not all be cut off; some shall have their 
 <I>lives given them for a prey.</I> And the end for which they are thus 
 remarkably spared is very observable: <I>That they may declare all 
 their abominations among the heathen whither they come;</I> the 
 troubles they are brought into will bring them to themselves and to 
 their right mind, and then they will acknowledge the justice of God in 
 all that is brought upon them and will make an ingenuous confession of 
 their sins, which provoked God thus to contend with them; and, as by 
 this it shall appear that they were spared in mercy, so hereby they 
 will make a suitable grateful return to God for his favours to them in 
 sparing them. Note, When God has remarkably delivered us from the 
 deaths wherewith we were surrounded we must look upon it that for this 
 end, among others, we were spared, that we might glorify God and edify 
 others by making a penitent acknowledgment of our sins. Those that by 
 their afflictions are brought to this are then made to know <I>that God 
 is the Lord</I> and may help to bring others to the knowledge of him.
 See how God brings good out of evil. The dispersion of sinners, who had 
 done God much dishonour and disservice in their own country, proves the 
 dispersion of penitents, who shall do him much honour and service in 
 others countries. The Levites are by a curse <I>divided in Jacob</I> 
 and <I>scattered in Israel,</I> yet it is turned into a blessing, for 
 thereby they have the fairest opportunity to <I>teach Jacob God's 
 laws.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here again the prophet is made a sign to them of the desolations that 
 were coming on Judah and Jerusalem. 

 1. He must himself eat and drink in care and fear, especially when he
 was in company,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.

 Though he was under no apprehension of danger to himself, but lived in 
 safety and plenty, yet he must <I>eat his bread with quaking</I> (the 
 bread of sorrows, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+127:2">Ps. cxxvii. 2</A>)

 <I>and drink his water with trembling and with carefulness,</I> that he
 might express the calamitous condition of those that should be in 
 Jerusalem during the siege; not that he must dissemble and pretend to 
 be in fear and care when really he was not; but having to foretel this 
 judgment, to show that he firmly believed it himself, and yet was far 
 from desiring it, in the prospect of it he was himself affected with 
 grief and fear. Note, When ministers speak of the ruin coming upon 
 impenitent sinners they must endeavour to speak feelingly, as those 
 that <I>know the terrors of the Lord;</I> and they must be content to 
 endure hardness, so that they may but do good.

 2. He must tell them that <I>the inhabitants of Jerusalem</I> should in 
 like manner eat and drink with care and fear,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 Both those that have their home in Jerusalem and those <I>of the land 
 of Israel</I> that come to shelter themselves there, <I>shall eat their 
 bread with carefulness and drink their water with astonishment,</I> 
 either because they are afraid it will not hold out, but they shall 
 want shortly, or because they are continually expecting the alarms of 
 the enemy, <I>their life hanging in doubt before them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:66">Deut. xxiii. 66</A>),
 
 so that what they have they shall have no enjoyment of nor will it do
 them any good. Note, Care and fear, if they prevail, are enough to 
 embitter all our comforts and are themselves very sore judgments. They 
 shall be reduced to these straits that thus by degrees, and by the hand 
 of those that thus straiten them, both city and country may be laid in 
 ruins; for it is no less than an utter destruction of both that is 
 aimed at in these judgments--<I>that her land may be desolate from 
 all</I> the fulness thereof, may be stripped of all its ornaments and 
 robbed of all its fruits, and then of course <I>the cities that are 
 inhabited shall be laid waste,</I> for they are <I>served by the 
 field.</I> This universal desolation was coming upon them, and then no 
 wonder that they eat their bread with care and fear. Now we are here 
 told, 

 (1.) How bad the cause of this judgment was; it is <I>because of the 
 violence of all those that dwell therein,</I> their injustice and 
 oppression, and the mischief they did one another, for which God would 
 reckon with them, as well as for the affronts put upon him in his 
 worship. Note, The decay of virtue in a nation brings on a decay of 
 every thing else; and when neighbours devour one another it is just 
 with God to bring enemies upon them to devour them all. 

 (2.) How good the effect of this judgment should be: <I>You shall know 
 that I am the Lord;</I> and if, by these judgments, they learn to know 
 him aright, that will make up the loss of all they are deprived of by 
 these desolations. Those are happy afflictions, how grievous soever to 
 flesh and blood, that help to introduce us into and improve us in an 
 acquaintance with God.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  And the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 22  Son of man, what <I>is</I> that proverb <I>that</I> ye have in the

 faileth?
 &nbsp; 23  Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; I will make

 prophesieth of the times <I>that are</I> far off.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Various methods had been used to awaken this secure and careless people 
 to an expectation of the judgments coming, that they might be stirred 
 up, by repentance and reformation, to prevent them. The prophecies of 
 their ruin were confirmed by visions, and illustrated by signs, and all 
 with such evidence and power that one would think they must needs be 
 wrought upon; but here we are told how they evaded the conviction, and 
 guarded against it, namely, by telling themselves, and one another, 
 that though these judgments threatened should come at last yet they 
 would not come of a long time. This suggestion, with which they 
 bolstered themselves up in their security, is here answered, and shown 
 to be vain and groundless, in two separate messages which God sent to 
 them by the prophet at different times, both to the same purport; such 
 care, such pains, must the prophet take to undeceive them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:21,26"><I>v.</I> 21, 26</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How they flattered themselves with hopes that the judgments should 
 be delayed. One saying they had, which had become proverbial <I>in the 
 land of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 They said, "<I>The days are prolonged;</I> the judgments have not come 
 when they were expected to come, but seem to be still put off <I>de die 
 in diem--from day to day,</I> and therefore we may conclude that 
 <I>every vision fails,</I> because it should seem that some do, that 
 because the destruction has not come yet it will never come; we will 
 never trust a prophet again, for we have been more frightened than 
 hurt." And another saying they had which, if it would not conquer their 
 convictions, yet would cool their affections and abate their concern, 
 and that was, "<I>The vision</I> is <I>for</I> a great while <I>to 
 come;</I> it refers to events at a vast distance, <I>and he prophesies 
 of</I> things which, though they may be true, are yet very <I>far 
 off,</I> so that we need not trouble our heads about them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>);

 we may die in honour and peace before these troubles come." And, if 
 indeed the troubles had been thus adjourned, they might have made 
 themselves easy, as Hezekiah did. <I>Is it not well if peace and truth 
 shall be in my days?</I> But it was a great mistake, and they did but 
 deceive themselves into their own ruin; and God is here much displeased 
 at it; for, 

 1. It was a wretched abuse of the patience of God, who, because for a
 time he kept silence, was thought to be <I>altogether such a one as 
 themselves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:21">Ps. l. 21</A>.

 That forbearance of God which should have led them to repentance
 hardened them in sin. They were willing to think their works were not
 <I>evil because sentence against</I> them was <I>not executed 
 speedily;</I> and therefore concluded the <I>vision</I> itself 
 <I>failed,</I> because <I>the days were prolonged.</I>

 2. It received countenance form the false prophets that were among 
 them, as should seem from the notice God takes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>)
 
 of the <I>vain visions,</I> and <I>flattering divinations,</I> even 
 <I>within the house of Israel,</I> to whom <I>were committed the 
 oracles of God.</I> No marvel if those that deceived themselves by 
 worshipping pretended deities deceived themselves also by crediting 
 pretended prophecies, to which <I>strong delusions</I> God justly 
 <I>gave them up</I> for their idolatries. 

 3. These sayings had become proverbial; they were industriously spread
 among the people, so that they had got into very one's mouth, and not 
 only so, but were generally assented to, as proverbs usually are, not 
 only the proverbs of the ancients, but those of the moderns too. Note, 
 It is a token of universal degeneracy in a nation when corrupt and 
 wicked sayings have grown proverbial; and it is an artifice of Satan by 
 them to confirm men in their prejudices against the word and ways of 
 God, and a great offence to the God of heaven. It will not serve for an 
 excuse, in saying ill, to plead that it is a common saying.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How they are assured that they do but deceive themselves, for the 
 judgments shall be hastened, these profane proverbs shall be 
 confronted: <I>Tell them, therefore, The days are at hand</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),
 
 and again, <I>There shall none of my words be prolonged any more,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 Their putting the evil day far from them does but provoke God to bring 
 it the sooner upon them; and it will be so much the sorer, so much the 
 heavier, so much the more a surprise and terror to them when it does 
 come. He must tell them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That God will certainly silence the lying proverbs, and the lying 
 prophecies, with which they buoyed up their vain hopes, and will make 
 them ashamed of both: 

 (1.) <I>I will make this proverb to cease;</I> for when they find the 
 days of vengeance have come, and not one iota or tittle of the 
 prediction falls to the ground, they will be ashamed to <I>use it as a 
 proverb in Israel, The days are prolonged, and the vision fails.</I> 
 Note, Those that will not have their eyes opened and their mistakes 
 rectified, by the word of God, shall be undeceived by his judgments: 
 for <I>every mouth</I> that speaks perverse things <I>shall be 
 stopped.</I> 
 
 (2.) <I>There shall be no more any vain vision,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 The false prophets, who told the people they should have peace and 
 should soon see an end of their troubles, shall be disproved by the 
 event, and then shall be ashamed of their pretensions, and shall hide 
 their heads and impose silence upon themselves. Note, As truth was 
 older than error, so it will survive it; it got the start, and it will 
 get the race. The true prophets' visions and predictions stand, and are 
 in full force, power, and virtue; they give law, and receive credit, 
 when the <I>vain visions,</I> and the <I>flattering divinations,</I> 
 are lost and forgotten, and <I>shall be no more in the house of 
 Israel;</I> for <I>great is the truth, and will prevail.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That God will certainly, and very shortly, accomplish every word 
 that he has spoken. With what majesty does he say it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 I <I>am the</I> L<FONT SIZE=-1>ORD</FONT>! <I>I am Jehovah!</I>
 That glorious name of his speaks him a God giving being to his word by 
 the performance of it, and therefore to the patriarchs, who lived by 
 faith in a promise not yet performed, he was not known by his name 
 <I>Jehovah,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:3">Exod. vi. 3</A>.

 But, as he is Jehovah in making good his promise, so he is in making
 good his threatenings. Let them know then that God, <I>with whom they 
 have to do,</I> is the great Jehovah, and therefore,

 (1.) He will speak, <I>whether they will hear or whether they will 
 forbear: I am the Lord, I will speak.</I> God will have his saying, 
 whoever gainsays it. God's oracles are called <I>lively</I> ones, for 
 they still speak when the pagan oracles are long ago struck dumb. There 
 has been, and shall be, a succession of God's ministers to the end of 
 the world, by whom he will speak; and, though contempt may be put upon 
 them, that shall not put a period to their ministration: <I>In your
 days, O rebellious house! will I say the word.</I> Even in the worst 
 ages of the church God <I>left not himself without witness,</I> but 
 raised up men that spoke for him, that spoke from him. <I>I will say
 the word,</I> the word that shall stand. 

 (2.) The word that he speaks shall come to pass; it shall infallibly be 
 accomplished according to the true intent and meaning of it, and 
 according to the full extent and compass of it: <I>I will say the word
 and will perform it</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 for his mind is never changed, nor his arm shortened, nor is Infinite 
 Wisdom ever nonplussed. With men saying and doing are two things, but
 they are not so with God; with him it is <I>dictum, factum--said, and 
 done.</I> In the works of providence, as in those of creation, <I>he 
 speaks and it is done;</I> for he said, <I>Let there be light, and 
 there was light--Let there be a firmament, and there was a 
 firmament,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:19,1Sa+15:29">Num. xxiii. 19; 1 Sam. xv. 29</A>.

 Whereas they had said, <I>Every vision fails</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 God says, "No, there shall be <I>the effect of every vision</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>);

 it shall not return void, but every sign shall be answered by the thing 
 signified." Those that <I>see the visions of the Almighty</I> do not 
 see <I>vain visions;</I> God <I>confirms the word of his servants</I> 
 by performing it. 

 (3.) It shall be accomplished very shortly: "<I>The days are at 
 hand</I> when you shall see <I>the effect of every vision,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 It is said, it is sworn, that delay <I>shall be no longer</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+10:6">Rev. x. 6</A>);

 the year of God's patience has now just expired, and he will no longer 
 defer the execution of the sentence. <I>It shall be no more
 prolonged</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>);

 he has borne with you a great while, but he will not bear always.
 <I>In your days, O rebellious house!</I> shall the word that is said be 
 <I>performed,</I> and you shall see the threatened judgments and share 
 in them. <I>Behold, the Judge stands at the door.</I> The <I>righteous
 are taken away from the evil to come,</I> but this <I>rebellious 
 house</I> shall not be so quietly taken away; no, they shall live to be 
 hurried away, to <I>be chased out of the world.</I>" This is repeated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 "<I>There shall none of my words be prolonged any more,</I> but 
 judgment shall now hasten on apace; and the longer the bow has been in 
 the drawing the deeper shall the arrow pierce." When we tell sinners of 
 death and judgment, heaven and hell, and think by them to persuade them 
 to a holy life, though we do not find them downright infidels (they 
 will own that they do believe there is a state of rewards and 
 punishments in the other world), yet they put by the force of those 
 great truths, and void the impressions of them, by looking upon the 
 things of the other world as very remote; they tell us, "<I>The 
 vision</I> you <I>see is for many days to come, and</I> you <I>prophesy 
 of the times that are</I> very <I>far off;</I> it will be time enough 
 to think of them when they come nearer," whereas really there is but a 
 step between us and death, between us and an awful eternity; <I>yet a 
 little while and the vision shall speak and not lie,</I> and therefore 
 it concerns us to redeem time, and get ready with all speed for a 
 future state; for, though it is future, it is very near, and while 
 impenitent sinners slumber their <I>damnation slumbers not.</I></P>
