 In this chapter, 

 I. The Ephraimites are reproved and threatened for their pride and
 drunkenness, their security and sensuality, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>.

 But, in the midst of this, here is a gracious promise of God's favour
 to the remnant of his people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:5,6">ver. 5, 6</A>.

 II. They are likewise reproved and threatened for their dulness and
 stupidity, and unaptness to profit by the instructions which the 
 prophets gave them in God's name, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:9-13">ver. 9-13</A>.

 III. The rulers of Jerusalem are reproved and threatened for their
 insolent contempt of God's judgments, and setting them at defiance;
 and, after a gracious promise of Christ and his grace, they are made to
 know that the vain hopes of escaping the judgments of God with which
 they flattered themselves would certainly deceive them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:14-22">ver. 14-22</A>.

 IV. All this is confirmed by a comparison borrowed from the method
 which the husbandman takes with his ground and grain, according to
 which they must expect God would proceed with his people, whom he had
 lately called his threshing and the corn of his floor

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:10"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 10</A>)

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:23-29">ver. 23-29</A>.

 This is written for our admonition, and is profitable for reproof and
 warning to us.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose
 glorious beauty <I>is</I> a fading flower, which <I>are</I> on the head of
 the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine!
 &nbsp; 2  Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, <I>which</I> as a
 tempest of hail <I>and</I> a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty
 waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand.
 &nbsp; 3  The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be
 trodden under feet:
 &nbsp; 4  And the glorious beauty, which <I>is</I> on the head of the fat
 valley, shall be a fading flower, <I>and</I> as the hasty fruit before
 the summer; which <I>when</I> he that looketh upon it seeth, while it
 is yet in his hand he eateth it up.
 &nbsp; 5  In that day shall the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts be for a crown of glory,
 and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people,
 &nbsp; 6  And for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment,
 and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.
 &nbsp; 7  But they also have erred through wine, and through strong
 drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred
 through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out
 of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble
 <I>in</I> judgment.
 &nbsp; 8  For all tables are full of vomit <I>and</I> filthiness, <I>so that
 there is</I> no place <I>clean.</I>
 </FONT></P>
 
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. The prophet warns the kingdom of the ten tribes of the judgments 
 that were coming upon them for their sins, which were soon after 
 executed by the king of Assyria, who laid their country waste, and 
 carried the people into captivity. Ephraim had his name from 
 <I>fruitfulness,</I> their soil being very fertile and the products of 
 it abundant and the best of the kind; they had a great many <I>fat 
 valleys</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:1,4"><I>v.</I> 1, 4</A>),

 and Samaria, which was situated on a hill, was, as it were, <I>on the
 head of the fat valleys.</I> Their country was rich and pleasant, and 
 as the garden of the Lord: it was the glory of Canaan, as that was the 
 glory of all lands; their harvest and vintage were the <I>glorious 
 beauty</I> on the head of their valleys, which were covered over with 
 corn and vines. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What an ill use they made of their plenty. What God gave them to 
 serve him with they perverted, and abused, by making it the food and 
 fuel of their lusts. 

 (1.) They were puffed up with pride by it. The goodness with which God
 crowned their years, which should have been to him a crown of praise, 
 was to them a <I>crown of pride.</I> Those that are rich in the world 
 are apt to be high-minded, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:17">1 Tim. vi. 17</A>.

 Their king, who wore the crown, was proud that he ruled over so rich a
 country; Samaria, their royal city, was notorious for pride. Perhaps it 
 was usual at their festivals, or revels, to wear garlands made up of 
 flowers and ears of corn, which they wore in honour of their fruitful 
 country. Pride was a sin that generally prevailed among them, and 
 therefore the prophet, in his name who resists the proud, boldly 
 proclaims a <I>woe to the crown of pride.</I> If those who wear crowns 
 be proud of them, let them not think to escape this woe. What men are 
 proud of, be it ever so mean, is to them as a crown; he that is proud 
 thinks himself as great as a king. But woe to those who thus exalt
 themselves, for they shall be abased; their pride is the preface to 
 their destruction.

 (2.) They indulged themselves in sensuality. Ephraim was notorious for
 drunkenness, and excess of riot; Samaria, the head of the fat valleys, 
 was full of those that were <I>overcome with wine,</I> were <I>broken 
 with it,</I> so the margin. See how foolishly drunkards act, and no 
 marvel when, in the very commission of the sin, they make fools and 
 brutes of themselves; they yield, 

 [1.] To be conquered by the sin; it overcomes them, and <I>brings them
 into bondage</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:19">2 Pet. ii. 19</A>);

 they are led captive by it, and the captivity is the more shameful and
 inglorious because it is voluntary. Some of these wretched slaves have
 themselves owned that there is not a greater drudgery in the world than 
 hard drinking. They are overcome not with the wine, but with the love 
 of it. 

 [2.] To be ruined by it. They are broken by wine. Their constitution is
 broken by it, and their health ruined. They are broken in the callings 
 and estates, and their souls are in danger of being eternally undone, 
 and all this for the gratification of a base lust. Woe to these
 <I>drunkards of Ephraim!</I> Ministers must bring the general woes of 
 the word home to particular places and persons. We must say, <I>Woe to 
 this or that person,</I> if he be a drunkard. There is a particular woe 
 to the drunkards of Ephraim, for they are of God's professing people, 
 and it becomes them worse than any other; they know better, and 
 therefore should give a better example. Some make the <I>crown of 
 pride</I> to belong to the drunkards, and to mean the garlands with 
 which those were crowned that got the victory in their wicked drinking 
 matches and drank down the rest of the company. They were proud of 
 their being mighty to drink wine; but woe to those who thus glory in 
 their shame.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The justice of God in taking away their plenty from them, which they 
 thus abused. Their <I>glorious beauty,</I> the plenty they were proud 
 of, <I>is but a fading flower;</I> it is meat that perishes. The most 
 substantial fruits, if God blast them and blow upon them, are but 
 fading flowers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 God can easily <I>take away their corn in the season thereof</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:9">Hos. ii. 9</A>),

 and recover <I>locum vastatum--ground that has been alienated and has
 run to waste,</I> those goods of his which they prepared for Baal. God 
 has an officer ready to make a seizure for him, has one at his beck, 
 <I>a mighty and strong one,</I> who is able to do the business, even 
 the king of Assyria, who <I>shall cast down to the earth with the 
 hand,</I> shall easily and effectually, and with the turn of a hand, 
 destroy all that which they are proud of and pleased with, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 He shall throw it down to the ground, to be broken to pieces with a
 strong hand, with a hand that they cannot oppose. Then <I>the crown of 
 pride,</I> and <I>the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden under 
 foot</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 they shall lie exposed to contempt, and shall not be able to recover
 themselves. Drunkards, in their folly, are apt to talk proudly, and 
 vaunt themselves most when they most shame themselves; but they thereby 
 render themselves the more ridiculous. The beauty of their valleys, 
 which they gloried in, will be,

 (1.) Like <I>a fading flower</I> (as before,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>);

 it will wither of itself, and has in itself the principles of its own
 corruption; it will perish in time by its own moth and rust.

 (2.) Like <I>the hasty fruit,</I> which, as soon as it is discovered,
 is plucked and eaten up; so the wealth of this world, besides that it 
 is apt to decay of itself, is subject to be devoured by others as 
 greedily as the first-ripe fruit, which is earnestly desired, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:1">Mic. vii. 1</A>.
 
 <I>Thieves break through and steal.</I> The harvest which the worldling
 is proud of <I>the hungry eat up</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:5">Job v. 5</A>);

 no sooner do they see the prey but they catch at it, and swallow up all
 they can lay their hands on. It is likewise easily devoured, as that 
 fruit which, being ripe before it has grown, is very small, and is soon 
 eaten up; and there being little of it, and that of little worth, it is 
 not reserved, but used immediately.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He next turns to the kingdom of Judah, whom he calls the <I>residue 
 of his people</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 for they were but two tribes to the other ten.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He promises them God's favours, and that they shall be taken under 
 his guidance and protection when the beauty of Ephraim shall be left 
 exposed to be trodden down and eaten up, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 <I>In that day,</I> when the Assyrian army is laying Israel waste, and
 Judah might think that their neighbour's house being on fire their own 
 was in danger, in that day of treading down and perplexity, then God 
 will be to the residue of his people all they need and can desire; not 
 only to the kingdom of Judah, but to those of Israel who had kept their 
 integrity, and, as was probably the case with some, betook themselves 
 to the land of Judah, to be sheltered by good king Hezekiah. When the 
 Assyrian, that mighty one, was in Israel as <I>a tempest of hail,</I> 
 noisy and battering, as <I>a destroying storm</I> bearing down all 
 before it, especially at sea, and <I>as a flood of mighty waters 
 overflowing</I> the country

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 then <I>in that day will the Lord of hosts,</I> of all hosts,
 distinguish by peculiar favours his people who have distinguished 
 themselves by a steady and singular adherence to him, and that which 
 they most need he will himself be to them. This very much enhances the 
 worth of the promises that God, covenanting to be to his people a God 
 all-sufficient, undertakes to be himself all that to them which they 
 can desire.

 (1.) He will put all the credit and honour upon them which are
 requisite, not only to rescue them from contempt, but to gain them 
 esteem and reputation. He will be to them <I>for a crown of glory and 
 for a diadem of beauty.</I> Those that wore the crown of pride looked 
 upon God's people with disdain, and trampled upon them, for they were 
 the song of the drunkards of Ephraim; but God will so appear for them 
 by his providence as to make it evident that they have his favour 
 towards them, and that shall be to them a crown of glory; for what 
 greater glory can any people have than for God to acknowledge them as 
 his own? And he will so appear in them, by his grace, as to make it 
 evident that they have his image renewed on them, and that shall be to 
 them a diadem of beauty; for what greater beauty can any person have 
 than the beauty of holiness? Note, Those that have God for their God 
 have him for a crown of glory and a diadem of beauty; for they are made 
 to him kings and priests.

 (2.) He will give them all the wisdom and grace necessary to the due
 discharge of the duty of their place. He will himself be <I>a spirit of 
 judgment to those that sit in judgment;</I> the privy counsellors shall 
 be guided by wisdom and discretion and the judges shall govern by 
 justice and equity. It is a great mercy to any people when those that 
 are called to places of power and public trust are qualified for their 
 places, when those that sit in judgment have a spirit of judgment, a 
 spirit of government.

 (3.) He will give them all the courage and boldness requisite to carry
 them resolutely through the difficulties and oppositions they are 
 likely to meet with. He will be <I>for strength to those that turn the 
 battle to the gate,</I> to the gates of the enemy whose cities they 
 besiege, or to their own gates, when they sally out upon the enemies 
 that besiege them. The strength of the soldiery depends as much upon 
 God as the wisdom of the magistracy; and where God gives both these he 
 is to that people a crown of glory. This may well be supposed to refer 
 to Christ, and so the Chaldee paraphrast understands it: <I>In that day 
 shall the Messiah be a crown of glory.</I> Simeon calls him the 
 <I>glory of his people Israel;</I> and he is made of God to us wisdom, 
 righteousness, and strength.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He complains of the corruptions that were found among them, and the 
 many corrupt ones 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>But they also,</I> many of those of Judah, <I>have erred through
 wine.</I> There are drunkards of Jerusalem, as well as drunkards of 
 Ephraim; and therefore the mercy of God is to be so much the more 
 admired that he has not blasted the glory of Judah as he has done that 
 of Ephraim. Sparing mercy lays us under peculiar obligations when it is 
 thus distinguishing. Ephraim's sins are found in Judah, and yet not 
 Ephraim's ruins. <I>They have erred through wine.</I> Their drinking to 
 excess is itself a practical error; they think to raise their fancy by 
 it, but they ruin their judgment, and so put a cheat upon themselves; 
 they think to preserve their health by it and help digestion, but they 
 spoil their constitution and hasten diseases and deaths. It is also the 
 occasion of a great many errors in principle; their understanding is 
 clouded and their conscience debauched by it; and therefore, to support 
 themselves in it, they espouse corrupt notions, and form their minds in 
 favour of their lusts. Probably some were drawn in to worship idols by
 their love of the wine and strong drink which there was plenty of at 
 their idolatrous festivals; and so they erred through wine, as Israel, 
 for love of the daughters of Moab, joined themselves to Baal-peor. 
 Three things are here observed as aggravations of this sin:--

 (1.) That those were guilty of it whose business it was to warn others
 against it and to teach them better, and therefore who ought to have 
 set a better example: <I>The priest and the prophet are swallowed up of 
 wine;</I> their office is quite drowned and lost in it. The priests, as 
 sacrificers, were obliged by a particular law to be temperate

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+10:9">Lev. x. 9</A>),

 and, as rulers and magistrates, it was not for them to drink wine,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:4">Prov. xxxi. 4</A>.
 
 The prophets were a kind of Nazarites (as appears by

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:11">Amos ii. 11</A>),

 and, as reprovers by office, were concerned to keep at the utmost
 distance from the sins they reproved in others; yet there were many of 
 them ensnared in this sin. What! a priest, a prophet, a minister, and 
 yet drunk! <I>Tell it not in Gath.</I> Such a scandal are they to
 their coat.

 (2.) That the consequences of it were very pernicious, not only by the
 ill influence of their example, but the prophet, when he was drunk, 
 <I>erred in vision;</I> the false prophets plainly discovered 
 themselves to be so when they were in drink. The priest <I>stumbled in 
 judgment and forgot the law</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:5">Prov. xxxi. 5</A>);

 he reeled and staggered as much in the operations of his mind as in the
 motions of his body. What wisdom or justice can be expected from those
 that sacrifice reason, and virtue, and conscience, and all that is 
 valuable to such a base lust as the love of strong drink is? Happy art 
 thou, O land! when <I>thy princes eat</I> and drink <I>for strength, 
 and not for drunkenness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:17">Eccl. x. 17</A>.

 (3.) That the disease was epidemic, and the generality of those that
 kept any thing of a table were infected with it: <I>All tables are full 
 of vomit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 See what an odious thing the sin of drunkenness is, what an affront it
 is to human society; it is rude and ill-mannered enough to sicken the 
 beholders, for the tables where they eat their meat are filthily 
 stained with the marks of this sin, which the sinners declare as Sodom. 
 Their tables are full of vomit, so that the victor, instead of being 
 proud of his crown, ought rather to be ashamed of it. It bodes ill to
 any people when so sottish a sin as drunkenness has become 
 national.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to

 drawn from the breasts.
 &nbsp; 10  For precept <I>must be</I> upon precept, precept upon precept;
 line upon line, line upon line; here a little, <I>and</I> there a
 little:
 &nbsp; 11  For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to
 this people.
 &nbsp; 12  To whom he said, This <I>is</I> the rest <I>wherewith</I> ye may cause
 the weary to rest; and this <I>is</I> the refreshing: yet they would
 not hear.
 &nbsp; 13  But the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was unto them precept upon precept,
 precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a
 little, <I>and</I> there a little; that they might go, and fall
 backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet here complains of the wretched stupidity of this people, 
 that they were unteachable and made no improvement of the means of 
 grace which they possessed; they still continued as they were, their 
 mistakes not rectified, their hearts not renewed, nor their lives 
 reformed. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What it was that their prophets and ministers designed and aimed at. 
 It was to <I>teach</I> them <I>knowledge,</I> the knowledge of God and 
 his will, and to <I>make them understand doctrine,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 This is God's way of dealing with men, to enlighten men's minds first
 with the knowledge of his truth, and thus to gain their affections, and 
 bring their wills into a compliance with his laws; thus he enters in by 
 the door, whereas the thief and the robber climb up another way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What method they took, in pursuance of this design. They left no 
 means untried to do them good, but taught them as children are taught, 
 little children that are beginning to learn, that are taken from the 
 breast to the book 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 for among the Jews it was common for mothers to nurse their children
 till they were three years old, and almost ready to go to school. And 
 it is good to begin betimes with children, to teach them, as they are 
 capable, the good knowledge of the Lord, and to instruct them even when 
 they are but newly weaned from the milk. The prophets taught them as 
 children are taught; for, 

 1. They were constant and industrious in teaching them. They took great
 pains with them, and with great prudence, teaching them as they needed 
 it and were able to bear it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>Precept upon precept. It must be so,</I> or (as some read) <I>it has
 been so.</I> They have been taught, as children are taught to read, by 
 <I>precept upon precept,</I> and taught to write by <I>line upon line, 
 a little here</I> and <I>a little there,</I> a little of one thing and 
 a little of another, that the variety of instructions might be pleasing 
 and inviting,--a little at one time and a little at another, that they 
 might not have their memories overcharged,--a little from one prophet 
 and a little from another, that every one might be pleased with his 
 friend and him whom he admired. Note, For our instruction in the
 things of God it is requisite that we have precept upon precept and 
 line upon line, that one precept and line should be followed, and so 
 enforced by another; the precept of justice must be upon the precept of 
 piety, and the precept of charity upon that of justice. Nay, it is 
 necessary that the same precept and the same line should be often 
 repeated and inculcated upon us, that we may the better understand them 
 and the more easily recollect them when we have occasion for them. 
 Teachers should accommodate themselves to the capacity of the learners, 
 give them what they most need and can best bear, and a little at a 
 time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:6,7">Deut. vi. 6, 7</A>.

 2. They courted and persuaded them to learn, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 God, by his prophets, said to them, "<I>This</I> way that we are
 directing you to, and directing you in, <I>is the rest,</I> the only 
 rest, <I>wherewith you may cause the weary to rest; and this will be 
 the refreshing</I> of your own souls, and will bring rest to your 
 country from the wars and other calamities with which it has been long 
 harassed." Note, God by his word calls us to nothing but what is really 
 for our advantage; for the service of God is the only true rest for 
 those that are weary of the service of sin and there is no refreshing 
 but under the easy yoke of the Lord Jesus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What little effect all this had upon the people. They were as 
 unapt to learn as young children newly weaned from the milk, and it was 
 as impossible to fasten any thing upon them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 nay, one would choose rather to teach a child of two years old than
 undertake to teach them; for they have not only (like such a child) no 
 capacity to receive what is taught them, but they are prejudiced 
 against it. As children, they have <I>need of milk,</I> and <I>cannot 
 bear strong meat,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:12">Heb. v. 12</A>.
 
 1. They <I>would not hear</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 no, not that which would be rest and refreshing to them. They had no
 mind to hear it. The word of God commanded their serious attention, but 
 could not gain it; they were where it was preached, but they turned a 
 deaf ear to it, or as it came in at one ear it went out at the other. 
 
 2. They would not heed. It was unto them <I>precept upon precept, and
 line upon line</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);
 
 they went on in a road of external performances; they kept up the old
 custom of attending upon the prophet's preaching and it was continually 
 sounding in their ears, but that was all; it made no impression upon 
 them; they had the letter of the precept, but no experience of the 
 power and spirit of it; it was continually beating upon them, but it 
 beat nothing into them. Nay, 

 3. It should seem, they ridiculed the prophet's preaching, and bantered
 it. The word of the Lord was unto them <I>Tsau latsau, kau lakau;</I> 
 in the original it is in rhyme; they made a song of the prophet's 
 words, and sang it when they were merry over their wine. David was the 
 song of the drunkards. It is great impiety, and a high affront to God, 
 thus to make a jest of sacred things, to speak of that vainly which 
 should make us serious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. How severely God would reckon with them for this. 

 1. He would deprive them of the privilege of plain preaching, and speak
 to them <I>with stammering lips and another tongue,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Those that will not understand what is plain and level to their
 capacity, but despise it as mean and trifling, are justly amused with 
 that which is above them. Or God will send foreign armies among them, 
 whose language they understand not, to lay their country waste. Those 
 that will not hear the comfortable voice of God's word shall be made to 
 hear the dreadful voice of his rod. Or these words may be taken as 
 denoting God's gracious condescension to their capacity in his dealing 
 with them; he lisped to them in their own language, as nurses do to 
 their children, with stammering lips, to humor them; he changed his 
 voice, tried first one way and then another; the apostle quotes it as a 
 favour

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:21">1 Cor. xiv. 21</A>),

 applying it to the gift of tongues, and complaining that yet for all
 this they would not hear. 

 2. He would bring utter ruin upon them. By their profane contempt of
 God and his word they are but hastening on their own ruin, and ripening 
 themselves for it; it is <I>that they may go and fall backward,</I> may 
 grow worse and worse, may depart further and further from God, and 
 proceed from one sin to another, till they be quite <I>broken, and 
 snared, and taken,</I> and ruined, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 They have here a little and there a little of the word of God; they
 think it too much, and <I>say to the seers, See not;</I> but it proves 
 too little to convert them, and will prove enough to condemn them. If 
 it be not a <I>savour of life unto life,</I> it will be <I>a savour of 
 death unto death.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  Wherefore hear the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, ye scornful men, that
 rule this people which <I>is</I> in Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 15  Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death,
 and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge
 shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have made
 lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:
 &nbsp; 16  Therefore thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, Behold, I lay in Zion for
 a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner <I>stone,</I> a
 sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.
 &nbsp; 17  Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to
 the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies,
 and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.
 &nbsp; 18  And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your
 agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge
 shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.
 &nbsp; 19  From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for
 morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night: and
 it shall be a vexation only <I>to</I> understand the report.
 &nbsp; 20  For the bed is shorter than that <I>a man</I> can stretch himself
 <I>on it:</I> and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself
 <I>in it.</I>
 &nbsp; 21  For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall rise up as <I>in</I> mount Perazim, he shall
 be wroth as <I>in</I> the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work,
 his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.
 &nbsp; 22  Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made
 strong: for I have heard from the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> of hosts a
 consumption, even determined upon the whole earth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet, having reproved those that made a jest of the word of God, 
 here goes on to reprove those that made a jest of the judgments of God, 
 and set them at defiance; for he is a jealous God, and will not suffer 
 either his ordinances or his providences to be brought into contempt. 
 He addressed himself to <I>the scornful men who ruled in Jerusalem,</I> 
 who were the magistrates of the city, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 It is bad with a people when their thrones of judgment become the seats
 of the scornful, when rulers are scorners; but that the rulers of 
 Jerusalem should be men of such a character, that they should make 
 light of God's judgments and scorn to take notice of the tokens of his 
 displeasure, is very sad. Who will be mourners in Zion if they are 
 scorners? Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How these scornful men lulled themselves asleep in carnal security, 
 and even challenged God Almighty to do his worst 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 <I>You have said, We have made a covenant with death and the grave.</I>
 They thought themselves as sure of their lives, even when the most 
 destroying judgments were abroad, as if they had made a bargain with 
 death, upon a valuable consideration, not to come till they sent for 
 him or not to take them away by any violence, but by old age. If we be 
 at peace with God, and have made a covenant with him, we have in effect 
 made a covenant with death that it shall come in the fittest time, that 
 whenever it comes, it shall be no terror to us, nor do us any real 
 damage; death is ours if we be Christ's

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:22,23">1 Cor. iii. 22, 23</A>):

 but to think of making death our friend, or being in league with it,
 while by sin we are making God our enemy and are at war with him, is 
 the greatest absurdity that can be. It was fond conceit which these 
 scorners had, "<I>When the overflowing scourge shall pass through</I> 
 our country, and others shall fall under it, yet <I>it shall not come 
 to us,</I> not reach us, though it extend far, not bear us down, though 
 it is an overflowing scourge." It is the greatest folly imaginable for 
 impenitent sinners to think that either in this world or the other they 
 shall fare better than their neighbours. But what is the ground of 
 their confidence? Why, truly, <I>We have made lies our refuge.</I> 
 Either, 

 1. Those things which the prophets told them would be lies and
 falsehood to them and would deceive, but which they themselves looked 
 upon as substantial fences. The protection of their idols, the promises 
 with which their false prophets soothed them, their policy, their 
 wealth, their interest in the people; these they confided in, and not 
 in God; nay, these they confided in against God. Or, 

 2. Those things which should be lies and falsehood to the enemy, who
 was <I>flagellum Dei--the scourge of God,</I> the overflowing scourge; 
 they would secure themselves by imposing upon the enemy with their 
 stratagems of war, or their feigned submissions in treaties of peace. 
 The rest of the cities of Judah were taken because they made an 
 obstinate defence; but the rulers of Jerusalem hope to succeed better. 
 They think themselves greater politicians than those of the country 
 towns; they will compliment the king of Assyria with a promise to 
 surrender their city, or to become tributaries to him, with a purpose 
 at the same time to shake off his yoke as soon as the danger is over, 
 not caring though they be found liars to him, as the expression is, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:29">Deut. xxxiii. 29</A>.

 Note, Those put a cheat upon themselves that think to gain their point
 by putting cheats upon those they deal with. Those that pursue their 
 designs by trick and fraud, by mean and paltry shifts, may perhaps 
 compass them, but cannot expect comfort in them. Honesty is the best 
 policy. But such refuges as these are those driven to that depart from 
 God, and throw themselves out of his protection.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How God, by the prophet, awakens them out of this sleep, and shows 
 them the folly of their security.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He tells them upon what grounds they might be secure. He does not 
 disturb their false confidences, till he has first shown them a firm 
 bottom on which they may repose themselves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone.</I> This foundation
 is,

 (1.) The promises of God in general--his word, upon which he has caused
 his people to hope--his covenant with Abraham, that he would be a God 
 to him and his; this is a foundation, a foundation of stone, firm and 
 lasting, for faith to build upon; it is <I>a tried stone,</I> for all 
 the saints have stayed themselves upon it and it never failed them.

 (2.) The promise of Christ in particular; for to him this is expressly
 applied in the New Testament, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:6-8">1 Pet. ii. 6-8</A>.

 He is that stone which has become <I>the head of the corner.</I> The
 great promise of the Messiah and his kingdom, which was to begin at 
 Jerusalem, was sufficient to make God's people easy in the worst of 
 times; for they knew well that till he came <I>the sceptre should not 
 depart from Judah.</I> Zion shall continue while this foundation is yet 
 to be laid there. "<I>Thus saith the Lord Jehovah,</I> for the comfort 
 of those that dare not <I>make lies their refuge,</I> Behold, and look 
 upon me as one that has undertaken to <I>lay in Zion a Stone,</I>" 
 Jesus Christ is a foundation of God's laying. <I>This is the Lord's 
 doing.</I> He is laid in Zion, in the church, in the holy hill. He is a 
 tried stone, a trying stone (so some), a touch-stone, that shall 
 distinguish between true and counterfeit. He is a precious stone, for 
 such are the foundations of the New Jerusalem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:19">Rev. xxi. 19</A>),

 a corner-stone, in whom the sides of the building are united, the
 <I>head-stone of the corner.</I> And <I>he that believes</I> these 
 promises, and rests upon them, <I>shall not make haste,</I> shall not 
 run to and fro in a hurry, as men at their wits' end, shall not be 
 shifting hither and thither for his own safety, nor be driven to his 
 feet by any terrors, as the wicked man is said to be

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:11">Job xviii. 11</A>),

 but with a fixed heart shall quietly wait the event, saying, <I>Welcome
 the will of God.</I> He <I>shall not make haste</I> in his 
 expectations, so as to anticipate the time set in the divine counsels, 
 but, though it tarry, will wait the appointed hour, knowing that <I>he 
 that shall come will come, and will not tarry.</I> He that believes 
 will not make more haste than good speed, but be satisfied that God's 
 time is the best time, and wait with patience for it. The apostle from 
 the LXX. explains this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:6">1 Pet. ii. 6</A>.

 <I>He that believes on him shall not be confounded;</I> his
 expectations shall not be frustrated, but far out-done.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He tells them that upon the grounds which they now built on they 
 could not be safe, but their confidences would certainly fail them 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>Judgment will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the
 plummet.</I> This denotes,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The building up of his church; having laid the foundation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),
 
 he will raise the structure, as builders do, by line and plummet, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:10">Zech. iv. 10</A>.

 Righteousness shall be the line and judgment the plummet. The church,
 being grounded on Christ, shall be formed and reformed by the 
 scripture, the standing rule of judgment and righteousness. <I>Judgment 
 shall return unto righteousness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+94:15">Ps. xciv. 15</A>.
 
 Or,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The punishing of the church's enemies, against whom he will 
 proceed in strict justice, according to the threatenings of the law.
 He will give them their deserts, and bring upon them the judgments they 
 have challenged, but in wisdom too, and by an exact rule, that the 
 tares may not be plucked up with the wheat. And when God comes thus to 
 execute judgment,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] These scornful men will be made ashamed of the vain hopes with 
 which they had deluded themselves. <I>First,</I> They designed to make 
 lies their refuge; but it will indeed prove a refuge of lies, which 
 <I>the hail shall sweep away,</I> that tempest of hail spoken of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 Those that make lies their refuge build upon the sand, and the building
 will fall when the storm comes, and bury the builder in the ruins of 
 it. Those that make any thing their hiding place but Christ shall find 
 that the waters will overflow it, as every shelter but the ark was 
 over-topped and overthrown by the waters of the deluge. Such is the 
 hope of the hypocrite; this will come of all his confidences. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> They boasted of a covenant with death, and an 
 agreement with the grave; but it shall be <I>disannulled,</I> as made 
 without his consent who has the keys and sovereign command of hell and 
 death. Those do but delude themselves that think by any wiles to evade 
 the judgments of God. <I>Thirdly,</I> They fancied that when the 
 overflowing scourge should pass through the land it should not come 
 near them; but the prophet tells them that then, when others were 
 falling by the common calamity, they should not only share in it, but 
 should be trodden down by it: "You shall be to it for a treading down; 
 it shall triumph over you as much as over any other, and you shall 
 become its easy prey." They are further told 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 1. That it shall begin with them; they shall be so far from escaping it
 that they shall be the first that shall fall by it: "<I>From the time 
 it goes forth it shall take you,</I> as if it came on purpose to seize 
 you." 

 2. That it shall pursue them closely: "<I>Morning by morning shall it
 pass over;</I> as duly as the day returns you shall hear of some 
 desolation or other made by it; for divine justice will follow its 
 blow; you shall never be safe nor easy by day nor by night; there shall 
 be a pestilence walking in darkness and a destruction wasting at 
 noonday." 

 3. That there shall be no avoiding it: "The understanding of the report
 of its approach shall not give you any opportunity to make your escape, 
 for there shall be no way of escape open; but it shall be only a 
 vexation, you shall see it coming, and not see how to help yourselves." 
 Or, "The very report of it at a distance will be a terror to you; what 
 then will the thing itself be?" Evil tidings are a terror and vexation 
 to scorners, but he whose heart is fixed, <I>trusting in God, is not 
 afraid of them;</I> whereas, when the <I>overflowing scourge</I> comes, 
 then all the comforts and confidences of scorners fail them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 (1.) That in which they thought to repose themselves reaches not to the
 length of their expectations: <I>The bed is shorter than that a man can 
 stretch himself upon it,</I> so that he is forced to cramp and contract 
 himself. 

 (2.) That in which they thought to shelter themselves proves
 insufficient to answer the intention: <I>The covering is narrower than 
 that a man can wrap himself in it.</I> Those that do not build upon 
 Christ as their foundation, but rest in a righteousness of their own, 
 will prove in the end thus to have deceived themselves; they can never 
 be easy, safe, nor warm; the bed is too short, the covering is too 
 narrow; like our first parents' fig-leaves, the shame of their 
 nakedness will still appear.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] God will be glorified in the accomplishment of his counsels, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 When God comes to contend with these scorners, <I>First, He will do his
 work, and bring to pass his act,</I> he will work for his own honour 
 and glory, according to his own purpose; the work shall appear to all 
 that see it to be the work of God as the righteous Judge of the earth. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> He will do it now against his people, as formerly he 
 did it against their enemies, by which his justice will appear to be 
 impartial; he will now <I>rise up against Jerusalem as,</I> in David's 
 time, against the Philistines <I>in Mount Perazim</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:20">2 Sam. v. 20</A>),

 and as, in Joshua's time, against the Canaanites <I>in the valley of
 Gibeon.</I> If those that profess themselves members of God's church by 
 their pride and scornfulness make themselves like Philistines and 
 Canaanites, they must expect to be dealt with as such. <I>Thirdly,</I> 
 This will be <I>his strange work, his strange act,</I> his foreign 
 deed. It is work that he is backward to: he rather delights in showing 
 mercy, and <I>does not afflict willingly.</I> It is work that he is not 
 used to as to his own people; he protects and favours them. It is a 
 strange work indeed if he <I>turn to be their enemy and fight against 
 them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:10"><I>ch.</I> lxiii. 10</A>.

 It is a work that all the neighbours will stand amazed at 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:24">Deut. xxix. 24</A>),

 and therefore the ruins of Jerusalem are said to be <I>an
 astonishment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:18">Jer. xxv. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> We have the use and application of all this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):
 
 "<I>Therefore be you not mockers;</I> dare not to ridicule either the
 reproofs of God's word or the approaches of his judgments." <I>Mocking 
 the messengers of the Lord</I> was Jerusalem's measure-filling sin. The 
 consideration of the judgments of God that are coming upon hypocritical 
 professors should effectually silence mockers, and make them serious: 
 "<I>Be you not mockers, lest your bands be made strong,</I> both the 
 bands by which you are bound under the dominion of sin" (for there is 
 little hope of the conversion of mockers) "and the bands by which you 
 are bound over to the judgments of God." God has bands of justice 
 strong enough to hold those that break all the bonds of his law asunder 
 and cast away all his cord from them. Let not these mockers make light 
 of divine threatenings, for the prophet (who is one of those with whom 
 the secret of the Lord is) assures them that the Lord God of hosts has, 
 in his hearing, <I>determined a consumption upon the whole earth;</I> 
 and can they think to escape? or shall their unbelief invalidate the 
 threatening?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This parable, which (like many of our Saviour's parables) is borrowed 
 from the husbandman's calling, is ushered in with a solemn preface 
 demanding attention, <I>He that has ears to hear, let him hear,</I> 
 hear and understand, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The parable here is plain enough, that the husbandman applies 
 himself to the business of his calling with a great deal of pains and 
 prudence, <I>secundum artem--according to rule,</I> and, as his judgment
 directs him, observes a method and order in his work. 

 1. In his ploughing and sowing: <I>Does the ploughman plough all day to 
 sow?</I> Yes, he does, and he <I>ploughs in hope</I> and <I>sows in 
 hope,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:10">1 Cor. ix. 10</A>.

 <I>Does he open and break the clods?</I> Yes, he does, that the land
 may be fit to receive the seed. And <I>when he has thus made plain the 
 face thereof</I> does he not sow his seed, seed suitable to the soil? 
 For the husbandman knows what grain is fit for clayey ground and what 
 for sandy ground, and, accordingly, he sows each in its place--<I>wheat 
 in the principal place</I> (so the margin reads it), for it is the 
 principal grain, and was a staple commodity of Canaan

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:17">Ezek. xxvii. 17</A>),

 <I>and barley in the appointed place.</I> The wisdom and goodness of
 the God of nature are to be observed in this, that, to oblige his 
 creatures with a grateful variety of productions, he has suited to them 
 an agreeable variety of earths. 

 2. In his threshing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:27,28"><I>v.</I> 27, 28</A>.

 This also he proportions to the grain that is to be threshed out.
 <I>The fitches and the cummin,</I> being easily got out of their husk 
 or ear, are only threshed with <I>a staff and a rod;</I> but <I>the 
 bread-corn</I> requires more force, and therefore that must be bruised 
 with <I>a threshing instrument,</I> a sledge shod with iron, that was 
 drawn to and fro over it, to beat out the corn; and yet <I>he will not 
 be ever threshing it,</I> nor any longer than is necessary to loosen 
 the corn from the chaff; <I>he will not break it,</I> or crush it, into 
 the ground <I>with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it</I> to pieces 
 <I>with his horsemen;</I> the grinding of it is reserved for another 
 operation. Observe, by the way, what pains are to be taken, not only 
 for the earning, but for the preparing of our necessary food; and yet, 
 after all, it is <I>meat that perishes.</I> Shall we then grudge to 
 labour much more for the <I>meat which endures to everlasting life?
 Bread-corn is bruised.</I> Christ was so; <I>it pleased the Lord to 
 bruise him,</I> that he might be the bread of life to us.</P>

 II. The interpretation of the parable is not so plain. Most
 interpreters make it a further answer to those who set the judgments of 
 God at defiance: "Let them know that as the husbandman will not be 
 always ploughing, but will at length sow his seed, so God will not be 
 always threatening, but will at length execute his threatenings and 
 bring upon sinners the judgments they have deserved; but in wisdom, and 
 in proportion to their strength, not that they may be ruined, but that 
 they may be reformed and brought to repentance by them." But I think we 
 may give this parable a greater latitude in the exposition of it. 

 1. In general, that God who gives the husbandman this wisdom is,
 doubtless, himself infinitely wise. It is God that <I>instructs the 
 husbandman to discretion,</I> as <I>his God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Husbandmen have need of discretion wherewith to order their affairs,
 and ought not undertake that business unless they do in some measure 
 understand it; and they should by observation and experience endeavour 
 to improve themselves in the knowledge of it. Since <I>the king himself 
 is served of the field,</I> the advancing of the art of husbandry is a 
 common service to mankind more than the cultivating of most other arts. 
 The skill of the husbandman is from God, as every good and perfect gift 
 is. This takes off somewhat of the weight and terror of the sentence
 passed on man for sin, that when God, in execution of it, sent man to 
 till the ground, he taught him how to do it most to his advantage, 
 otherwise, in the greatness of his folly, he might have been for ever 
 <I>tilling the sand of the sea,</I> labouring to no purpose. It is he 
 that gives men capacity for this business, an inclination to it, and a 
 delight in it; and if some were not by Providence cut out for it, and 
 mad to rejoice (as Issachar, that tribe of husbandmen) in their tents, 
 notwithstanding the toil and fatigue of this business, we should soon 
 want the supports of life. If some are more discreet and judicious in 
 managing these or any other affairs than others are, God must be 
 acknowledged in it; and to him husbandmen must seek for direction in 
 their business, for they, above other men, have an immediate dependence 
 upon the divine Providence. As to the other instance of the 
 husbandman's conduct in threshing his corn, it is said, <I>This also 
 comes forth from the Lord of hosts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 Even the plainest dictate of sense and reason must be acknowledged to
 <I>come forth from the Lord of hosts.</I> And, if it is from him that 
 men do things wisely and discreetly, we must needs acknowledge him to 
 be <I>wise in counsel and excellent in working.</I> God's working is 
 according to his will; he never acts against his own mind, as men often 
 do, and there is a counsel in his whole will: he is <I>therefore</I> 
 excellent in working, because he is wonderful in counsel.

 2. God's church is his husbandry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:9">1 Cor. iii. 9</A>.

 If Christ is the true vine, his Father is the husbandman

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:1">John xv. 1</A>),

 and he is continually by his word and ordinances cultivating it.
 <I>Does the ploughman plough all day,</I> and <I>break the clods</I> of 
 his ground, that it may receive the seed, and does not God by his 
 ministers break up the fallow ground? Does not the ploughman, when the 
 ground is fitted for the seed, cast in the seed in its proper soil? He 
 does so, and so the great God sows his word by the hand of his 
 ministers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:19">Matt. xiii. 19</A>),
 
 who are to divide the word of truth and give every one his portion.
 Whatever the soil of the heart is, there is some seed or other in the 
 word proper for it. And, as the word of God, so the rod of God is thus
 wisely made use of. Afflictions are God's threshing-instruments, 
 designed to loosen us from the world, to separate between us and our 
 chaff, and to prepare us for use. And, as to these, God will make use 
 of them as there is occasion; but he will proportion them to our 
 strength; they shall be no heavier than there is need. If the rod and 
 the staff will answer the end, he will not make use of his cart-wheel 
 and his horsemen. And where these are necessary, as for the bruising of 
 the bread-corn (which will not otherwise be got clean from the straw), 
 yet he will not be ever threshing it, will not always chide, but his 
 anger shall endure but for a moment; nor will he <I>crush under his 
 feet the prisoners of the earth.</I> And herein we must acknowledge him 
 <I>wonderful in counsel and excellent in working.</I></P>
