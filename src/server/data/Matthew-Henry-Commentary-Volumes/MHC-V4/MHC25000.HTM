 S<FONT SIZE=-1>INCE</FONT> what Solomon says, though contrary to the 
 common opinion of the world, is certainly true, that <I>sorrow is 
 better than laughter,</I> and <I>it is better to go to the house of 
 mourning than to the house of feasting,</I> we should come to the 
 reading and consideration of the melancholy chapters of this book, not 
 only willingly, but with an expectation to edify ourselves by them; 
 and, that we may do this, we must compose ourselves to a holy sadness 
 and resolve to weep with the weeping prophet. Let us consider,

 I. The title of this book; in the Hebrew it has one, but is called (as
 the books of Moses are) from the first word <I>Ecah</I>--<I>How;</I> 
 but the Jewish commentators call it, as the Greeks do, and we from 
 them, <I>Kinoth</I>--<I>Lamentations.</I> As we have sacred odes or 
 songs of joy, so have we sacred elegies or songs of lamentation; such 
 variety of methods has Infinite Wisdom taken to work upon us and move 
 our affections, and so soften our hearts and make them susceptible of 
 the impressions of divine truths, as the wax of the seal. We have not 
 only <I>piped unto you,</I> but have <I>mourned</I> likewise, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:17">Matt. xi. 17</A>.

 II. The penman of this book; it was Jeremiah the prophet, who is here
 Jeremiah the poet, and <I>vates</I> signifies both; therefore this book 
 is fitly adjoined to the book of his prophecy, and is as an appendix to 
 it. We had there at large the predictions of the desolations of Judah 
 and Jerusalem, and then the history of them, to show how punctually the 
 predictions were accomplished, for the confirming of our faith: now 
 here we have the expressions of his sorrow upon occasion of them, to 
 show that he was very sincere in the protestations he had often made 
 that he did not desire the woeful day, but that, on the contrary, the 
 prospect of it filled him with bitterness. When he saw these calamities 
 at a distance, he wished that his <I>head were waters and his eyes 
 fountains of tears;</I> and, when they came, he made it to appear that 
 he did not dissemble in that wish, and that he was far from being 
 disaffected to his country, which was the crime his enemies charged him 
 with. Though his country had been very unkind to him, and though the 
 ruin of it was both a proof that he was a true prophet and a punishment 
 of them for prosecuting him as a false prophet, which might have 
 tempted him to rejoice in it, yet he sadly lamented it, and herein 
 showed a better temper than that which Jonah was of with respect to 
 Nineveh. 

 III. The occasion of these Lamentations was the destruction of Judah
 and Jerusalem by the Chaldean army and the dissolution of the Jewish 
 state both civil and ecclesiastical thereby. Some of the rabbies will 
 have these to be the Lamentations which Jeremiah penned upon occasion 
 of the death of Josiah, which are mentioned 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:25">2 Chron. xxxv. 25</A>.

 But, though it is true that that opened the door to all the following
 calamities, yet these Lamentations seem to be penned in the sight, not 
 in the foresight, of those calamities--when they had already come, not 
 when they were at a distance; and these is nothing of Josiah in them, 
 and his praise, as was no question, in the lamentations for him. No, it 
 is Jerusalem's funeral that this is an elegy upon. Others of them will 
 have these Lamentations to be contained in the roll which Baruch wrote 
 from Jeremiah's mouth, and which Jehoiakim burnt, and they suggest that 
 at first there were in it only the 1st, 2nd, and 4th chapters, but that 
 the 3rd and 5th were the <I>many like words</I> that were afterwards 
 added; but this is a groundless fancy; that roll is expressly said to 
 be a repetition and summary of the prophet's sermons,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:2">Jer. xxxvi. 2</A>.

 IV. The composition of it; it is not only poetical, but alphabetical,
 all except the 5th chapter, as some of David's psalms are; each verse
 begins with a several letter in the order of the Hebrew alphabet, the 
 first <I>aleph,</I> the second <I>beth,</I> &c., but the 3rd chapter is 
 a triple alphabet, the first three beginning with <I>aleph,</I> the 
 next three with <I>beth,</I> &c., which was a help to memory (it being 
 designed that these mournful ditties should be got by heart) and was an 
 elegance in writing then valued and therefore not now to be despised.
 They observe that in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th chapters, the letter 
 <I>pe</I> is put before <I>ain,</I> which in all the Hebrew alphabets 
 follows it, for a reason of which Dr. Lightfoot offers this conjecture, 
 That the letter <I>ajin,</I> which is the numeral letter for LXX., was 
 thus, by being displaced, made remarkable, to put them in mind of the 
 seventy years at the end of which God would turn again their captivity.
 
 V. The use of it: of great use, no doubt, it was to the pious Jews in
 their sufferings, furnishing them with spiritual language to express 
 their natural grief by, helping to preserve the lively remembrance of 
 Zion among them, and their children that never saw it, when they were 
 in Babylon, directing their tears into the right channel (for they are 
 here taught to mourn for sin and mourn to God), and withal encouraging 
 their hopes that God would yet return and have mercy upon them; and it 
 is of use to us, to affect us with godly sorrow for the calamities of 
 the church of God, as becomes those that are living members of it and 
 are resolved to take our lot with it.</P>
