 I. W<FONT SIZE=-1>E</FONT> have now before us the twelve minor 
 prophets, which some of the ancients, in reckoning up the books of the 
 Old Testament, put all together, and reckon but as <I>one book.</I> 
 They are called the minor prophets, not because their writings are of 
 any less authority or usefulness than those of the greater prophets, or 
 as if these prophets were less in God's account or might be so in ours 
 than the other, but only because they are shorter, and less in bulk, 
 than the other. We have reason to think that these prophets preached as 
 much as the others, but that they did not write so much, nor is so much 
 of their preaching kept upon record. Many excellent prophets wrote 
 nothing, and others but little, who yet were very useful in their day. 
 And so in the Christian church there have been many burning and shining 
 lights, who are not known to posterity by their writings, and yet were 
 no way inferior in gifts, and graces, and serviceableness to their own 
 generation, than those who are; and some who have left but little 
 behind them, and make no great figure among authors, were yet as 
 valuable men as the more voluminous writers. These twelve small 
 prophets, Josephus says, were put into one volume by the <I>men of the 
 great synagogue</I> in Ezra's time, of which learned and pious body of 
 men the last three of these twelve prophets are supposed to have been 
 themselves members. These are what remained of the scattered pieces of 
 inspired writing. Antiquaries value the <I>fragmenta veterum--the
 fragments of antiquity;</I> these are the fragments of prophecy, which 
 are carefully gathered up by the divine Providence and the care of the 
 church, that nothing might be lost, as St. Paul's short epistles after 
 his long ones. The son of Sirach speaks of these twelve prophets with 
 honour, as men that <I>strengthened Jacob,</I> 
 
 <U><I>Ecclus.</I> xlix. 10</U>.

 Nine of these prophets prophesied before the captivity, and the last
 three after the return of the Jews to their own land. Some difference 
 there is in the order of these books. We place them as the ancient 
 Hebrew did; and all agree to put Hosea first; but the ancient thing is 
 not material. And, if we covet to place them according to their 
 seniority, as to some of them we shall find no certainty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We have before us the prophecy of Hosea, who was the first of all 
 the writing prophets, being raised up somewhat before the time of 
 Isaiah. The ancients say, He was of Bethshemesh, and of the tribe of 
 Issachar. He continued very long a prophet; the Jews reckoned that he 
 prophesied nearly fourscore and ten years; so that, as Jerome observes, 
 he prophesied of the destruction of the kingdom of the ten tribes when 
 it was at a great distance, and lived himself to see and lament it, and 
 to improve it when it was over, for warning to its sister kingdom. The 
 scope of his prophecy is to discover sin, and to denounce the judgments 
 of God against a people that would not be reformed. The style is very 
 concise and sententious, above any of the prophets; and in some places 
 it seems to be like the book of Proverbs, without connexion, and rather 
 to be called Hosea's <I>sayings</I> than Hosea's <I>sermons.</I> And a 
 weighty adage may sometimes do more service than a laboured discourse. 
 Huetius observes that many passages in the prophecies of Jeremiah and 
 Ezekiel seem to refer to, and to be borrowed from, the prophet Hosea, 
 who wrote a good while before them. As 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:34,16:9.25:10,Eze+26:13">Jer. vii. 34; xvi. 9; xxv. 10;
 and Ezek. xxvi. 13</A>,
 
 speak the same with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:11">Hos. ii. 11</A>;

 so

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:16">Ezek. xvi. 16</A>,

 &c., is taken from
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:8">Hos. ii. 8</A>.

 And that promise of <I>serving the Lord their God,</I> and <I>David 
 their king,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:8,9">Jer. xxx. 8, 9</A>.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:23">Ezek. xxxiv. 23</A>,

 <I>Hosea</I> had before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+3:5"><I>ch.</I> iii. 5</A>.

 And

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+19:12">Ezek. xix. 12</A>

 is taken from
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+13:15">Hos. xiii. 15</A>.

 Thus one prophet confirms and corroborates another; and all these
 worketh that one and the self-same Spirit.</P>
