 Here are three separate messages which God entrusts the prophet to 
 deliver concerning Judah and Jerusalem, and all to the same purport, to 
 show them their sins and the judgments that were coming upon them for 
 those sins. 

 I. Here is a catalogue of their sins, by which they had exposed
 themselves to shame and for which God would bring them to ruin, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:1-16">ver. 1-16</A>.

 II. They are here compared to dross, and are condemned as dross to the
 fire, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:17-22">ver. 17-22</A>.

 III. All orders and degrees of men among them are here found guilty of
 the neglect of the duty of their place and of having contributed to the 
 national guilt, which therefore, since none appeared as intercessors, 
 they must all expect to share in the punishment of,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Moreover the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the
 bloody city? yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations.
 &nbsp; 3  Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, The city sheddeth
 blood in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh
 idols against herself to defile herself.
 &nbsp; 4  Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and
 hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and
 thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come <I>even</I> unto
 thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the
 heathen, and a mocking to all countries.
 &nbsp; 5  <I>Those that be</I> near, and <I>those that be</I> far from thee,
 shall mock thee, <I>which art</I> infamous <I>and</I> much vexed.
 &nbsp; 6  Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to
 their power to shed blood.
 &nbsp; 7  In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the
 midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in
 thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.
 &nbsp; 8  Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my
 sabbaths.
 &nbsp; 9  In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee
 they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit
 lewdness.
 &nbsp; 10  In thee have they discovered their fathers' nakedness: in
 thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.
 &nbsp; 11  And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour's
 wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and
 another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's daughter.
 &nbsp; 12  In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken
 usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy
 neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord
 G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 13  Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest
 gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in
 the midst of thee.
 &nbsp; 14  Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the
 days that I shall deal with thee? I the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> have spoken <I>it,</I>
 and will do <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 15  And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee
 in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.
 &nbsp; 16  And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the
 sight of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses the prophet by a commission from Heaven sits as a judge
 upon the bench, and Jerusalem is made to hold up her hand as a prisoner
 at the bar; and, if prophets were set over other nations, much more
 over God's nation,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:10">Jer. i. 10</A>.

 This prophet is authorized to <I>judge the bloody city,</I> the <I>city
 of bloods.</I> Jerusalem is so called, not only because she had been 
 guilty of the particular sin of blood-shed, but because her crimes in 
 general were bloody crimes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:23"><I>ch.</I> vii. 23</A>),

 such as polluted her in her blood, and for which she deserved to have
 blood given her to drink. Now the business of a judge with a malefactor 
 is to convict him of his crimes, and then to pass sentence upon him for 
 them. These two things Ezekiel is to do here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He is to find Jerusalem guilty of many heinous crimes here 
 enumerated in a long bill of indictment, and it is <I>billa vera--a true
 bill;</I> so he writes upon it whose judgment we are sure is according 
 to truth. He must <I>show her all her abominations</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 that God may be justified in all the desolations brought upon her. Let 
 us take a view of all the particular sins which Jerusalem here stands 
 charged with; and they are all exceedingly sinful.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Murder: <I>The city sheds blood,</I> not only in the suburbs, where 
 the strangers dwell, but <I>in the midst of it,</I> where, one would 
 think, the magistrates would, if any where, be vigilant. Even there 
 people were murdered either in duels or by secret assassinations and 
 poisonings, or in the courts of justice under colour of law, and there 
 was no care taken to discover and punish the murderers according to the 
 law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:6">Gen. ix. 6</A>),

 no, nor so much as the ceremony used to expiate an uncertain murder

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:1">Deut. xxi. 1</A>),

 and so the guilt and pollution remains upon the city. Thus <I>thou hast
 become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 This crime is insisted most upon, for it was Jerusalem's 
 measure-filling sin more than any; it is said to be that <I>which the 
 Lord would not pardon,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:4">2 Kings xxiv. 4</A>.

 (1.) The <I>princes of Israel,</I> who should have been the protectors
 of injured innocence, <I>every one were to their power to shed 
 blood,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 They thirsted for it, and delighted in it, and whoever came within 
 their power were sure to feel it; whoever lay at their mercy were sure 
 to find none. 

 (2.) There were those who <I>carried tales to shed blood,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 They told lies of men to the princes, to whom they knew it would be 
 pleasing, to incense them against them; or they betrayed what passed in 
 private conversation, to make mischief among neighbours, and set them 
 together by the ears, to bite, and devour, and worry one another, even 
 to death. Note, Those who, by giving invidious characters and telling 
 ill-natured stories of their neighbours, sow discord among brethren, 
 will be accountable for all the mischief that follows upon it; as he 
 that kindles a fire will be accountable for all the hurt it does. 

 (3.) There were those who <I>took gifts to shed blood</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 who would be hired with money to swear a man out of his life, or, if 
 they were upon a jury, would be bribed to find an innocent man guilty. 
 When so much barbarous bloody work of this kind was done in Jerusalem 
 we may well conclude, 

 [1.] That men's consciences had become wretchedly profligate and seared 
 and their hearts hardened; for those would stick at no wickedness who 
 would not stick at this.

 [2.] That abundance of quiet, harmless, good people were made away 
 with, whereby, as the guilt of the city was increased, so the number of 
 those that should have stood in the gap to turn away the wrath of God 
 was diminished.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Idolatry: <I>She makes idols against herself to destroy herself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 And again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 <I>Thou hast defiled thyself in thy idols which thou hast made.</I> 
 Note, Those who make idols for themselves will be found to have made 
 them against themselves, for idolaters put a cheat upon themselves and 
 prepare destruction for themselves; besides that thereby they pollute 
 themselves, they render themselves odious in the eyes of the just and 
 jealous God, and even <I>their mind and conscience are defiled,</I> so 
 that to them <I>nothing is pure.</I> Those who did not make idols 
 themselves were yet found guilty of <I>eating upon the mountains,</I> 
 or high places 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 in honour of the idols and in communion with idolaters.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Disobedience to parents 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>In thee have</I> the children <I>set light by their father and 
 mother,</I> mocked them, cursed them, and despised to obey them, which 
 was a sign of a more than ordinary corruption of nature as well as 
 manners, and a disposition to all manner of disorder, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:5">Isa. iii. 5</A>.

 Those that set light by their parents are in the highway to all
 wickedness. God had made many wholesome laws for the support of the
 paternal authority, but no care was taken to put them in execution; 
 nay, the Pharisees in their day taught children, under pretence of 
 respect to the Corban, to set light by their parents and refuse to 
 maintain them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:5">Matt. xv. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Oppression and extortion. To enrich themselves they wronged the poor 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>They dealt by oppression</I> and <I>deceit with the stranger,</I> 
 taking advantage of his necessities, and his ignorance of the laws and 
 customs of the country. In Jerusalem, that should have been a sanctuary 
 to the oppressed, <I>they vexed the fatherless and widows</I> by 
 unreasonable demands and inquisitions, or troublesome law-suits, in 
 which might prevails against right. "<I>Thou hast taken usury and 
 increase</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 not only there are those in thee that do it, but thou hast done it." It 
 was an act of the city or community; the public money, which should 
 have been employed in public charity, was put out to usury, with 
 extortion. <I>Thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours</I> by 
 <I>violence</I> and <I>wrong.</I> For neighbours to gain by one another 
 in a way of fair trading is well, but those who are <I>greedy of 
 gain</I> will not be held within the rules of equity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Profanation of the sabbath and other holy things. This commonly goes 
 along with the other sins for which they here stand indicted 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):
 
 <I>Thou hast despised my holy things,</I> holy oracles, holy 
 ordinances. The rites which God appointed were thought too plain, too 
 ordinary; they despised them, and therefore were fond of the customs of 
 the heathen. Note, Immorality and dishonesty are commonly attended with 
 a contempt of religion and the worship of God. <I>Thou hast profaned my 
 sabbaths.</I> There was not in Jerusalem that face of 
 sabbath-sanctification that one would have expected in the <I>holy 
 city.</I> Sabbath-breaking is an iniquity that is an inlet to all 
 iniquity. Many have owned it to contribute as much to their ruin as any 
 thing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. Uncleanness and all manner of seventh-commandment sins, fruits of 
 those vile affections to which God in a way of righteous judgment gives 
 men up, to punish them for their idolatry and profanation of holy 
 things. Jerusalem had been famous for its purity, but now <I>in the 
 midst of thee they commit lewdness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 lewdness goes bare-faced, though in the most scandalous instances, as 
 that of a man's having his father's wife, which is the <I>discovery of 
 the father's nakedness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>)

 and is a sin not <I>to be named among Christians</I> without the utmost 
 detestation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:1">1 Cor. v. 1</A>),

 and was made a capital crime by the law of Moses,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:11">Lev. xx. 11</A>.

 The time <I>to refrain from embracing</I> has not been observed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:6">Eccles. iii. 6</A>),

 for <I>they have humbled her that was set apart for her pollution.</I> 
 They made nothing of committing lewdness with a <I>neighbour's 
 wife,</I> with a <I>daughter-in-law,</I> or a sister, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 And <I>shall not God visit for these things?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. Unmindfulness of God was at the bottom of all this wickedness 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 "<I>Thou hast forgotten me,</I> else thou wouldst not have done thus." 
 Note, Sinners do that which provokes God because they forget him; they 
 forget their descent from him, dependence on him, and obligations to 
 him; they forget how valuable his favour is, which they make themselves 
 unfit for, and how formidable his wrath, which they make themselves 
 obnoxious to. Those that <I>pervert their ways forget the Lord their 
 God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:21">Jer. iii. 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He is to pass sentence upon Jerusalem for these crimes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Let her know that she has filled up the measure of her iniquity, and 
 that her sins are such as forbid delays and call for speedy vengeance. 
 She has made <I>her time to come</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 <I>her days to draw near;</I> and she <I>has come to her years</I> of 
 maturity for punishment 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 as an heir that has <I>come to age</I> and is ready for his 
 inheritance. God would have borne longer with them, but they had 
 arrived at such a pitch of impudence in sin that God could not in 
 honour give them a further day. Note, Abused patience will at last be 
 weary of forbearing. And, when sinners (as Solomon speaks) grow 
 <I>overmuch wicked,</I> they <I>die before their time</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:17">Eccl. vii. 17</A>)
 
 and shorten their reprieves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Let her know that she has exposed herself, and therefore God has 
 justly exposed her, to the contempt and scorn of all her neighbours 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>I have made thee a reproach to the heathen,</I> both <I>those who 
 are near,</I> who are eye-witnesses of Jerusalem's apostasy and 
 degeneracy, and <I>those afar off,</I> who, though at a distance, will 
 think it worth taking notice of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>);

 they shall all <I>mock thee.</I> While they were reproached by their 
 neighbours for their adherence to God it was their honour, and they 
 might be sure that God would roll away their reproach. But, now that 
 they are laughed at for their revolt from God, they must lie down in 
 their shame, and must say, <I>The Lord is righteous.</I> They make a 
 mock at Jerusalem, both because her sins had been very 
 <I>scandalous</I> (she is <I>infamous, polluted in name,</I> and has 
 quite lost her credit), and because her punishment is very 
 <I>grievous</I>--she is <I>much vexed</I> and frets without measure at 
 her troubles. Note, Those who fret most at their troubles have commonly 
 those about them who will be so much the more apt to make a jest of 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Let her know that God is displeased, highly displeased, at her 
 wickedness, and does and will witness against it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>I have smitten my hand at thy dishonest gain.</I> God, both by his 
 prophets and by his providence, revealed his wrath from heaven against 
 their <I>ungodliness</I> and <I>unrighteousness,</I> the oppressions 
 they were guilty of, though they got by them, and <I>their murders</I> 
 (the <I>blood which has been in the midst of thee</I>), and all their 
 other sins. Note, God has sufficiently discovered how angry he is at 
 the wicked courses of his people; and, that they may not say that they 
 have not had fair warning, he <I>smites his hand</I> against the sin 
 before he <I>lays his hand</I> upon the sinner. And this is a good 
 reason why we should despise dishonest gain, even the <I>gain of 
 oppressions,</I> and <I>shake our hands from holding bribes,</I> 
 because these are sins against which God <I>shakes his hands,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:15">Isa. xxxiii. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Let her know that, proud and secure as she is, she is no match for 
 God's judgments, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 (1.) She is assured that the destruction she has deserved will come: 
 <I>I the Lord have spoken it, and will do it.</I> He that is true to 
 his promises will be true to his threatenings too, for he is not a man 
 that he should repent. 

 (2.) It is supposed that she thinks herself able to contend with God, 
 and so stand a siege against his judgments. She bade defiance to the 
 day of the Lord, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:19">Isa. v. 19</A>.
 
 But,

 (3.) She is convinced of her utter inability to make her part good with
 him: "<I>Can thy heart endure, or can thy hand be strong, in the days 
 that I shall deal with thee?</I> Thou thinkest thou hast to do only 
 with men like thyself, but shalt be made to know that thou fallest into 
 the hands of a living God." Observe here,

 [1.] There is a day coming when God will <I>deal with sinners,</I> a 
 day of visitation. He deals with some to bring them to repentance, and 
 there is no resisting the force of convictions when he sets them on; he 
 deals with others to bring them to ruin. He deals with sinners in this 
 life, when he brings upon them his sore judgments; but the days of 
 eternity are especially the days in which God will deal with them, when 
 the full vials of God's wrath will be poured out without mixture.

 [2.] The wrath of God against sinners, when he comes to deal with them, 
 will be found both intolerable and irresistible. There is no heart 
 stout enough to endure it; it is none of the infirmities which <I>the 
 spirit of a man will sustain.</I> Damned sinners can neither forget nor 
 despise their torments, nor have they any thing wherewith to support 
 themselves under their torments. There are no hands strong enough
 either to ward off the strokes of God's wrath or to break the chains 
 with which sinners are bound over to the day of wrath. <I>Who knows the 
 power of God's anger?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Let her know that, since she has walked in the way of the heathen, 
 and learned their works, she shall have enough of them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 "<I>I will</I> not only send thee <I>among the heathen,</I> out of thy 
 own land, but <I>I will scatter thee</I> among them and <I>disperse 
 thee in the countries,</I> to be abused and insulted over by 
 strangers." And since her <I>filthiness</I> and <I>filthy ones</I> 
 continued in her, notwithstanding all the methods God had taken to 
 <I>refine</I> her (she <I>would not be made clean,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:27">Jer. xiii. 27</A>),

 he will be his judgments <I>consume her filthiness out of her;</I> he
 will destroy those that are incurably bad and reform those that are 
 inclined to be good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. Let her know that God has disowned her and cast her off. He had been 
 her heritage and portion; but now 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 "<I>Thou shalt take thy inheritance in thyself,</I> shift for thyself, 
 make the best hand thou canst for thyself, for God will no longer 
 undertake for thee." Note, Those that give up themselves to be ruled by 
 their lusts will justly be given up to be portioned by them. Those that 
 resolve to be their own masters, let them expect no other comfort and 
 happiness than what their own hands can furnish them with, and a 
 miserable portion it will prove. <I>Verily, I say unto you, They have
 their reward. Thou in thy life-time receivedst thy good things.</I> 
 These are the same with this, "<I>Thou shalt take thy inheritance in 
 thyself,</I> and then, when it is too late, shalt own <I>in the sight 
 of the heathen that I am the Lord,</I> who alone am a portion 
 sufficient for my people." Note, Those that have lost their interest in 
 God will know how to value it.</P>

 they <I>are</I> brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of
 the furnace; they are <I>even</I> the dross of silver.
 &nbsp; 19  Therefore thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Because ye are all become
 dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of
 Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 20  <I>As</I> they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and
 tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to
 melt <I>it;</I> so will I gather <I>you</I> in mine anger and in my fury,
 and I will leave <I>you there,</I> and melt you.
 &nbsp; 21  Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my
 wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.
 &nbsp; 22  As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye
 be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 have poured out my fury upon you.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The same melancholy string is still harped upon, and various turns are 
 given it, to make it affecting, that it may be influencing. The prophet 
 must here show, or at least it is here shown him, that the whole house 
 of Israel has become as dross and that as dross they shall be consumed. 
 What David has said concerning the wicked ones of the world is here 
 said concerning the wicked ones of the church, now that it is corrupt 
 and degenerate 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:119">Ps. cxix. 119</A>):

 <I>Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. See here how the wretched degeneracy of the house of Israel is 
 described. That state, in David's and Solomon's time, had been <I>a 
 head of gold;</I> when the kingdoms were divided it was as the <I>arms 
 of silver.</I> But now, 

 1. It has degenerated into baser metal, of no value in comparison with
 what it formerly was: <I>They are all brass, and tin, and iron, and 
 lead,</I> which some make to signify divers sorts of sinners among 
 them. Their being brass denotes the impudence of some in their 
 wickedness; they are <I>brazen-faced,</I> and cannot blush; their 
 <I>shoes</I> had been <I>iron and brass</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:25">Deut. xxxiii. 25</A>),

 but now their brow is so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:4">Isa. xlviii. 4</A>.

 Their being tin denotes the hypocritical profession of piety with which
 many of them cover their iniquity; they have a specious show, but no 
 intrinsic worth. Their being iron denotes the cruel disposition of 
 some, and their delight in war, according to the character of the 
 <I>iron age.</I> Their being lead denotes their dulness, sottishness, 
 and stupidity: though soft and pliable to evil, yet heavy and not 
 movable to good. <I>How has the gold become dross! How has the most
 fine gold changed!</I> So is Jerusalem's degeneracy bewailed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:1">Lam. iv. 1</A>.

 Yet this is not the worst; these metals, though of less value, are yet
 of good use. But,

 2. The <I>house of Israel has become dross to me.</I> So she is in 
 God's account, whatever she is in her own and her neighbours' account. 
 They were silver, but now they are <I>even the dross of silver;</I> the 
 word signifies all the dirt, and rubbish, and worthless stuff, that are 
 separated from the silver in the washing, melting, and refining of it. 
 Note, Sinners, and especially degenerate professors, are in God's 
 account as dross, vile, and contemptible, and of no account, as the 
 <I>evil figs</I> which <I>could not be eaten, they were so evil.</I> 
 They are useless and fit for nothing; of no consistency with themselves 
 and no service to man.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How the woeful destruction of this degenerate house of Israel is 
 foretold. They are all gathered together in Jerusalem; thither people 
 fled from all parts of the country as to a city of refuge, not only 
 because it was a strong city, but because it was the holy city. Now God 
 tells them that their flocking into Jerusalem, which they intended for 
 their security, should be as the gathering of various sorts of metal 
 into the furnace or crucible, to be melted down, and to have the dross 
 separated from them. They are <I>in the midst of Jerusalem,</I> 
 surrounded by the forces of the enemy; and, being thus enclosed, 

 1. The <I>fire of God's wrath</I> shall be kindled upon this furnace,
 and it shall be <I>blown,</I> to make it burn fiercely and strongly,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.

 God will <I>gather them in his anger and fury.</I> The blowing of the 
 fire makes a great noise, so will the judgments of God upon Jerusalem. 
 When God stirs up himself to execute judgments upon a provoking people, 
 from the consideration of his own glory and the necessity of making 
 some examples, then he may be said to <I>blow the fire of his wrath</I> 
 against sin and sinners, to <I>heat the furnace seven times hotter.</I> 

 2. The several sorts of metal gathered in it shall be melted; by a 
 complication of judgments, as by a raging fire, their constitution 
 shall be dissolved, they shall lose all their former shape and 
 strength, and shall be utterly unable to stand before the wrath of God. 
 The various sorts of sinners shall be melted down together, and united 
 in a common overthrow, as <I>brass</I> and <I>lead</I> in the same 
 furnace, as trees are <I>bound in bundles for the fire.</I> They came 
 together into Jerusalem as a place of defence, but God brought them 
 together there as unto a place of execution. 

 3. God will leave them in the furnace

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 I will <I>gather you into the furnace</I> and will <I>leave you 
 there.</I> When God brings his own people into the furnace he sits by 
 them, as the refiner by his gold, to see that they be not continued 
 there any longer than is fitting and needful; but he will bring these 
 people into the furnace, as men throw dross into it, which they design 
 shall be consumed, and therefore are in no care about it, but <I>leave 
 it there.</I> Compare with this 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:14">Hos. v. 14</A>,

 <I>I will tear and go away.</I>

 4. Hereby the dross shall be wholly separated and the good metal 
 purified, the impenitent shall be destroyed and the penitent reformed 
 and fitted for deliverance. <I>Take away the dross from the silver, and 
 there shall come forth a vessel for the finer,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:4">Prov. xxv. 4</A>.

 This judgment shall do that in the house of Israel for the doing of 
 which other methods had been tried in vain, and <I>reprobate silver 
 shall they no more be called,</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>23  And the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 24  Son of man, say unto her, Thou <I>art</I> the land that is not
 cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.
 &nbsp; 25  <I>There is</I> a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst
 thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have
 devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things;
 they have made her many widows in the midst thereof.
 &nbsp; 26  Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine
 holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and
 profane, neither have they shewed <I>difference</I> between the
 unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths,
 and I am profaned among them.
 &nbsp; 27  Her princes in the midst thereof <I>are</I> like wolves ravening
 the prey, to shed blood, <I>and</I> to destroy souls, to get dishonest
 gain.
 &nbsp; 28  And her prophets have daubed them with untempered <I>mortar,</I>
 seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith
 the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, when the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath not spoken.
 &nbsp; 29  The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised
 robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have
 oppressed the stranger wrongfully.
 &nbsp; 30  And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the
 hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should
 not destroy it: but I found none.
 &nbsp; 31  Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I
 have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have
 I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A general idea given of the land of Israel, how well it deserved the 
 judgments coming to destroy it and how much it needed these judgments 
 to refine it. Let the prophet tell her plainly, "<I>Thou art the land 
 that is not cleansed,</I> not refined as metal is, and therefore 
 needest to be again put into the furnace. Means and methods of 
 reformation have been ineffectual; thou art <I>not rained upon in the 
 day of indignation.</I>" This was one of the judgments which God 
 brought upon them in the day of his wrath, he <I>withheld the rain</I> 
 from them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:4">Jer. xiv. 4</A>.

 Or, "When thou art under the tokens of God's displeasure, even in the
 day of indignation thou art <I>not rained upon;</I> thou hast not 
 received instruction by the prophets, whose doctrine is said to 
 <I>descend as the rain.</I>" Or, "When thou art corrected thou art not 
 cleansed; thy filth is not carried away as that in the streets is by a 
 sweeping rain. Nay, though it be a <I>day of indignation</I> with thee, 
 yet thy filthiness, which should be done away, has become more 
 <I>offensive,</I> as that of a city is in dry weather, when it is not 
 rained upon." Or, "Thou hast nothing to refresh and comfort thyself 
 with <I>in the day of indignation;</I> thou art not rained upon by 
 divine consolations." So the rich man in torment had not a <I>drop of 
 water,</I> or rain, <I>to cool his tongue.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A particular charge drawn up against the several orders and degrees 
 of men among them, which shows that they had all helped to fill the 
 measure of the nation's guilt, but none had done any thing towards the 
 emptying of it; they are therefore all alike.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They have every one <I>corrupted his way,</I> and those who should 
 have been the brightest examples of virtue were ringleaders in iniquity 
 and patterns of vice.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The <I>prophets,</I> who pretended to make known the mind of God 
 to them, were not only <I>deceivers,</I> but <I>devourers</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),
 
 and hardened them in their wickedness both by their preaching, wherein 
 they promised them impunity and prosperity, and by their conversation, 
 in which they were as profligate as any. <I>There is a conspiracy of 
 her prophets</I> against God and religion, against the true prophets 
 and all good men; they conspired together to be all in one song, as 
 Ahab's prophets were, to assure them of peace in their sinful ways. 
 Note, The unity which is found among pretenders to infallibility, and 
 which they so much boast of, is only the result of a secret 
 <I>conspiracy</I> against the truth. Satan is not <I>divided against 
 himself.</I> The prophets are <I>in conspiracy</I> with the murderers 
 and oppressors, to patronise and protect them in their wickedness, and 
 justify what they did with their false prophecies, provided they may 
 come in sharers with them in the profits of it. They are like <I>a
 roaring lion ravening the prey;</I> they thunder out threats against 
 those whose ruin is aimed at, terrify them, or make them odious to the 
 people, and so make themselves masters, 

 [1.] Of their lives: They <I>have devoured souls,</I> have been 
 accessory to the shedding of the blood of many an innocent person, and 
 so have made many to become sorrowful widows who were comfortable 
 wives. They have persecuted those to death who witnessed against their 
 pretensions to prophecy and would not be imposed upon by their 
 counterfeit commission. Or, They devoured souls by flattering sinners 
 into a false peace and a vain hope, and seducing them into the paths of 
 sin, which would be their eternal ruin. Note, Those who draw men to
 wickedness, and encourage them in it, are the devourers and murderers 
 of their souls.

 [2.] Of their estates. When Naboth is slain they take possession of his 
 vineyard; <I>They have seized the treasure and precious things,</I> as 
 forfeited; some way or other they had of <I>devouring the widows' 
 houses,</I> as the Pharisees, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:14">Matt. xxiii. 14</A>.

 Or, They got this <I>treasure,</I> and all these <I>precious
 things,</I> as fees for false and flattering prophecies; for <I>he that 
 puts not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+3:5">Mic. iii. 5</A>.

 It was said with Jerusalem when such men as these passed for
 prophets.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The priests, who were teachers by office, and had the custody of 
 the sacred things, and should have called the false prophets to 
 account, were as bad as they, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 [1.] They violated the law of God, which they should have observed and 
 taught others to observe. They made no conscience of the law of the 
 priesthood, but openly broke it, and with contempt, as Hophni and 
 Phinehas. They did what they had a mind, with an express <I>non 
 obstante--notwithstanding</I> to the word of God. And how should those
 teach the people their duty who lived in contradiction to their own? 
 
 [2.] They <I>profaned God's holy things,</I> about which they were to 
 minister, and which they ought to have restrained others from the 
 profanation of. They suffered those to eat of the holy things who were 
 unqualified by the law. The table of the Lord was contemptible with 
 them. By dealing in holy things with such unhallowed hands they did 
 themselves profane them. 

 [3.] They did not themselves put a difference, nor did they show the 
 people how to <I>put a difference, between the holy and profane, the 
 clean and the unclean,</I> according to the directions and distinctions 
 of the law. They did not exclude those from God's courts who were
 excluded by the law, nor teach the people to observe the difference the 
 law had made between food clean and unclean, between times and places 
 holy and common; but they lived at large themselves and encouraged the 
 people to do so too.

 [4.] They <I>hid their eyes from God's sabbaths;</I> they took no care 
 about them; it was all one to them whether God's sabbaths were kept 
 holy or no; they neither gave countenance to those who observed them 
 nor check to those who profaned them, nor did they themselves show any 
 regard to them or veneration for them. They winked at those who did 
 servile works on that day, and looked another way when they should have 
 inspected the behaviour of the people on sabbath days. God's sabbaths
 have such a beauty and glory put upon them by the divine institution as 
 may command respect; but they <I>hid their eyes</I> from them and would 
 not see that excellency in them.

 [5.] By all this God himself was <I>profaned among them;</I> his 
 authority was slighted, his goodness made light of, and the highest 
 affront and contempt imaginable were put upon his holiness. Note, The 
 profanation of the honour of the scriptures, of sabbaths and sacred 
 things, is a profanation of the honour of God himself, who is 
 interested in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The princes, who should have interposed with their authority to 
 redress these grievances, were as daring transgressors of the law as 
 any 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>They are like wolves ravening the prey;</I> for such is power 
 without justice and goodness to direct it. All their business was to 
 gratify, 

 [1.] Their own pride and ambition, by making themselves arbitrary and 
 formidable.

 [2.] Their own malice and revenge, by <I>shedding blood</I> and 
 <I>destroying souls,</I> sacrificing to their cruelty all those that 
 stood in their way or had in any thing disobliged them.

 [3.] Their own avarice; all they aim at is to <I>get dishonest 
 gain,</I> by crushing and oppressing their subject. <I>Lucri bonus est 
 odor ex re qualibet. Rem, rem, quocunque modo rem--Sweet is the odour 
 of gain, from whatever substance it ascends. Money, money, by fairness 
 or by fraud, get money.</I> But, though they had power sufficient to 
 carry them on in their oppressive courses, yet how could they answer it 
 both to their credit and to their consciences? We are told how

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 The prophets <I>daubed them with untempered mortar,</I> told them in 
 God's name (horrid wickedness!) that there was no harm in what they 
 did, that they might dispose of the lives and estates of their subjects 
 as they pleased, and could do no wrong, nay, that in prosecuting such 
 and such whom they had marked out they did God service; and thus they 
 stopped the mouth of their consciences. They also justified what they 
 did, to the people, nay, and <I>magnified</I> it as if it were all for 
 the public good, and so saved their reputation, and kept their 
 oppressed subjects from murmuring. Note, Daubing prophets are the great 
 supporters of ravening princes, but will prove at last their great 
 deceivers, for they daub with untempered mortar which will not hold, 
 nor will the wall stand long that is built up with it. They pretend to 
 be seers, but they <I>see vanity;</I> they pretend to be diviners, but 
 they <I>divine lies;</I> they pretend a warrant from Heaven for what 
 they say, and that it is all as true as gospel; they say, <I>Thus saith 
 the Lord God,</I> but it is all a sham, for <I>the Lord has not spoken 
 any such thing.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The people that had any power in their hands learned of their
 princes to abuse it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 Those that should have complained of the oppression of the subject, and 
 have put in a <I>claim of rights</I> on behalf of the injured, that 
 should have stood up for liberty and property, were themselves invaders 
 of them: <I>The people of the land have used oppression and exercised 
 robbery.</I> The rich oppress the poor, masters their servants, 
 landlords their tenants, and even parents their own children; nay, the 
 buyers and sellers will find some way to oppress one another. This is 
 such a sin as, when it is national, is indeed a national judgment, and 
 is threatened as such.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:5">Isa. iii. 5</A>,

 <I>The people shall be oppressed every one by his neighbour.</I> It is
 an aggravation of the sin that they have <I>vexed the poor and 
 needy,</I> whom they should have relieved, and have <I>oppressed the 
 stranger</I> and deprived him of <I>his right,</I> to whom they ought 
 to have been not only just, but kind. Thus was the apostasy universal 
 and the disease epidemical.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. There is none that appears as an intercessor for them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 <I>I sought for a man among them that should stand in the gap, but I 
 found none.</I> Note, 

 (1.) Sin makes a gap in the hedge of protection that is about a people 
 at which good things run out from them and evil things pour in upon 
 them, a gap by which God enters to destroy them.

 (2.) There is a way of standing in the gap, and making up the breach 
 against the judgments of God, by repentance, and prayer, and 
 reformation. Moses stood in the gap when he made intercession for 
 Israel to <I>turn away the wrath of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:23">Ps. cvi. 23</A>.

 (3.) When God is coming forth against a sinful people to destroy them
 he expects some to intercede for them, and enquires if there be but one 
 that does; so much is it his desire and delight to show mercy. If there 
 be but a man that stands in the gap, as Abraham for Sodom, he will 
 discover him and be well pleased with him.

 (4.) It bodes ill to a people when judgments are breaking in upon them, 
 and the spirit of prayer is restrained, so that <I>not one is found</I> 
 that will either give them a good word or speak a good word for them.
 
 (5.) When it is so, what can be expected but utter ruin? <I>Therefore
 have I poured out my indignation upon them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),

 have given it full scope, that it may come upon them in a full stream; 
 yet, whatever God's wrath inflicts upon a people, it is <I>their own 
 way</I> that is therein <I>recompensed upon their heads,</I> and God 
 deals with them no worse, but even much better, than their iniquity 
 deserves.</P>
