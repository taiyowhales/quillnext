 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Perhaps, in reading some of the foregoing chapters, we may have been 
 tempted to think ourselves not much concerned in them (though they also 
 were written for our learning); but this chapter, at first view, 
 appears highly and nearly to concern us all, very highly, very nearly; 
 for, without particular reference to Judah and Jerusalem, it lays down 
 the rule of judgment according to which God will deal with the children 
 of men in determining them to their everlasting state, and it agrees 
 with that very ancient rule laid down, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:7">Gen. iv. 7</A>,

 "If though doest well, shalt thou not be accepted?" But, "if not, sin,"
 the punishment of sin,"lies at the door." Here is,

 I. The corrupt proverb used by the profane Jews, which gave occasion to
 the message here sent them, and made it necessary for the justifying of 
 God in his dealings with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. The reply given to this proverb, in which God asserts in general
 his own sovereignty and justice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:4">ver. 4</A>.

 Woe to the wicked; it shall be ill with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:4,20">ver. 4, 20</A>.

 But say to the righteous, It shall be ill with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:4,20">ver. 4, 20</A>.

 But say to the righteous, It shall be well with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:5-9">ver. 5-9</A>.

 In particular, as to the case complained of, he assures us, 

 1. That it shall be ill with a wicked man, though he had a good father, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:10-13">ver. 10-13</A>.

 2. That it shall be well with a good man, though he had a wicked father, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:14-18">ver. 14-18</A>.
 
 And therefore in this God is righteous, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:19,20">ver. 19, 20</A>.

 3. That it shall be well with penitents, though they began ever so ill, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:21-23,27,28">ver. 21-23 and 27, 28</A>.

 4. That it shall be ill with apostates, though they began ever so well,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:24,26">ver. 24, 26</A>.
 
 And the use of all this is, 

 (1.) To justify God and clear the equity of all his proceedings, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:25,29">ver. 25, 29</A>.

 (2.) To engage and encourage us to repent of our sins and turn to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:30-32">ver. 30-32</A>.

 And these are things which belong to our everlasting peace. O that we
 may understand and regard them before they be hidden from our eyes!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me again, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of
 Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the
 children's teeth are set on edge?
 &nbsp; 3  <I>As</I> I live, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, ye shall not have <I>occasion</I>
 any more to use this proverb in Israel.
 &nbsp; 4  Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so
 also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall
 die.
 &nbsp; 5  But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,
 &nbsp; 6  <I>And</I> hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted
 up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath
 defiled his neighbour's wife, neither hath come near to a
 menstruous woman,
 &nbsp; 7  And hath not oppressed any, <I>but</I> hath restored to the debtor
 his pledge, hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his bread
 to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment;
 &nbsp; 8  He <I>that</I> hath not given forth upon usury, neither hath taken
 any increase, <I>that</I> hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath
 executed true judgment between man and man,
 &nbsp; 9  Hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to
 deal truly; he <I>is</I> just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord
 G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Evil manners, we say, beget good laws; and in like manner sometimes 
 unjust reflections occasion just vindications; evil proverbs beget good 
 prophecies. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. An evil proverb commonly used by the Jews in their captivity. We had 
 one before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:22"><I>ch.</I> xii. 22</A>)

 and a reply to it; here we have another. <I>That</I> sets God's
 justice at defiance: "<I>The days are prolonged and every vision 
 fails;</I> the threatenings are a jest." <I>This</I> charges him with 
 injustice, as if the judgments executed were a wrong: "You use this 
 proverb <I>concerning the land of Israel,</I> now that it is laid waste 
 by the judgments of God, saying, <I>The fathers have eaten sour grapes 
 and the children's teeth are set on edge;</I> we are punished for the 
 sins of our ancestors, which is as great an absurdity in the divine 
 regimen as if the children should have their teeth set on edge, or 
 stupefied, by the fathers' eating sour grapes, whereas, in the order of 
 natural causes, if men eat or drink any thing amiss, they only 
 themselves shall suffer by it." Now, 

 1. It must be owned that there was some occasion given for this
 proverb. God had often said that he would <I>visit the iniquity of the 
 fathers upon the children,</I> especially the sin of idolatry, 
 intending thereby to express the evil of sin, of that sin, his 
 detestation of it, and just indignation against it, and the heavy 
 punishments he would bring upon idolaters, that parents might be 
 restrained from sin by their affection to their children and that 
 children might not be drawn to sin by their reverence for their 
 parents. He had likewise often declared by his prophets that in 
 bringing the present ruin upon Judah and Jerusalem he had an eye to the 
 sins of Manasseh and other preceding kings; for, looking upon the 
 nation as a body politic, and punishing them with national judgments 
 for national sins, and admitting the maxim in our law that <I>a 
 corporation never dies,</I> reckoning with them now for the iniquities 
 of former ages was but like making a man, <I>when he is old,</I> to 
 <I>possess the iniquities of his youth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:26">Job xiii. 26</A>.

 And there is no unrighteousness with God in doing so. But,

 2. They intended it as a reflection upon God, and an impeachment of his 
 equity in his proceedings against them. Thus far that is right which is 
 implied in this proverbial saying, That those who are guilty of wilful 
 sin <I>eat sour grapes;</I> they do that which they will feel from, 
 sooner or later. The grapes may look well enough in the temptation, but 
 they will be bitter as bitterness itself in the reflection. They will 
 set the sinner's teeth on edge. When conscience is awake, and sets the 
 sin in order before them, it will spoil the relish of their comforts as 
 when the teeth are set on edge. But they suggest it as unreasonable 
 that the children should smart for the fathers' folly and feel the pain 
 of that which they never tasted the pleasure of, and that God was 
 unrighteous in thus taking vengeance and could not justify it. See how 
 wicked the reflection is, how daring the impudence; yet see how witty 
 it is, and how sly the comparison. Many that are impious in their jeers 
 are ingenious in their jests; and thus the malice of hell against God 
 and religion is insinuated and propagated. It is here put into a 
 proverb, and that proverb used, commonly used; they had it up ever and 
 anon. And, though it had plainly a blasphemous meaning, yet they
 sheltered themselves under the similitude from the imputation of 
 downright blasphemy. Now by this it appears that they were unhumbled 
 under the rod, for, instead of condemning themselves and justifying 
 God, they condemned him and justified themselves; but <I>woe to him 
 that</I> thus <I>strives with his Maker.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A just reproof of, and reply to, this proverb: <I>What mean you</I> 
 by using it? That is the reproof. "Do you intend hereby to try it out 
 with God? Or can you think any other than that you will hereby provoke 
 him to be <I>angry with you will he has consumed you?</I> Is this the 
 way to reconcile yourselves to him and make your peace with him?" The 
 reply follows, in which God tells them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That the use of the proverb should be taken away. This is said, it 
 is sworn 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>You shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb;</I> or (as 
 it may be read), <I>You shall not have the use of this parable.</I> The 
 taking away of this parable is made the matter of a promise, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:29">Jer. xxxi. 29</A>.

 Here it is made the matter of a threatening. There it intimates that
 God will return to them in ways of mercy; here it intimates that God 
 would proceed against them in ways of judgment. He will so punish them
 for this impudent saying that they shall not dare to use it any more; 
 as in another case,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:34,36">Jer. xxiii. 34, 36</A>.

 God will find out effectual ways to silence those cavillers. Or God
 will so manifest both to themselves and others that they have 
 wickedness of their own enough to bring all these desolating judgments 
 upon them that they shall no longer for shame lay it upon the sins of 
 their fathers that they were thus dealt with: "Your own consciences 
 shall tell you, and all your neighbours shall confirm it, that you 
 yourselves have eaten the same sour grapes that your fathers ate before 
 you, or else your teeth would not have been set on edge."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That really the saying itself was unjust and a causeless reflection 
 upon God's government. For,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) God does not punish the children for the fathers' sins unless they 
 tread in their fathers' steps and <I>fill up the measure of their 
 iniquity</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:32">Matt. xxiii. 32</A>),

 and then they have no reason to complain, for, whatever they suffer, it
 is less than their own sin has deserved. And, when God speaks of
 <I>visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children,</I> that is
 so far from putting any hardship upon the children, to whom he only
 renders <I>according to their works,</I> that it accounts for God's
 patience with the parents, whom he therefore does not punish
 immediately, because he <I>lays up their iniquity for their
 children,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:19">Job xxi. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It is only in temporal calamities that children (and sometimes 
 innocent ones) fare the worse for their parents' wickedness, and God 
 can alter the property of those calamities, and make them work for good 
 to those that are visited with them; but as to spiritual and eternal 
 misery (and that is the death here spoken of) the children shall by no 
 means smart for the parents' sins. This is here shown at large; and it 
 is a wonderful piece of condescension that the great God is pleased to 
 reason the case with such wicked and unreasonable men, that he did not 
 immediately strike them dumb or dead, but vouchsafed to state the 
 matter before them, that he may be clear when he is judged. Now, in his 
 reply,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He asserts and maintains his own absolute and incontestable 
 sovereignty: <I>Behold, all souls are mine,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 God here claims a property in all the souls of the children of men, one 
 as well as another. <I>First,</I> Souls are his. He that is the Maker 
 of <I>all things</I> is in a particular manner the <I>Father of 
 spirits,</I> for his image is stamped on the souls of men; it was so in 
 their creation; it is so in their renovation. He <I>forms the spirit of 
 man within him,</I> and is therefore called <I>the God of the spirits 
 of all flesh,</I> of embodied spirits. <I>Secondly,</I> All souls are 
 his, all created by him and for him, and accountable to him. <I>As the 
 soul of the father, so the soul of the son, is mine.</I> Our earthly 
 parents are only the <I>fathers of our flesh;</I> our souls are not 
 theirs; God challenges them. Now hence it follows, for the clearing of 
 this matter, 

 1. That God may certainly do what he pleases both with fathers and
 children, and none may say unto him, <I>What doest thou?</I> He that 
 gave us our being does us no wrong if he takes it away again, much less 
 when he only takes away some of the supports and comforts of it; it is 
 as absurd to quarrel with him as for <I>the thing formed to say to him 
 that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?</I> 

 2. That God as certainly bears a good-will both to father and son, and
 will put no hardship upon either. We are sure that God hates nothing 
 that he has made, and therefore (speaking of the adult, who are capable 
 of acting for themselves) he has such a kindness for all souls that 
 none die but through their own default. <I>All souls are his,</I> and 
 therefore he is not partial in his judgment of them. Let us subscribe 
 to his interest in us and dominion over us. He says, <I>All souls are 
 mine;</I> let us answer, "Lord, my soul is thine; I devote it to thee 
 to be employed for thee and made happy in thee." It is with good reason 
 that God says, "<I>My son, give me thy heart,</I> for it is my own," to 
 which we must yield, "<I>Father, take my heart,</I> it is thy own."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Though God might justify himself by insisting upon his 
 sovereignty, yet he waives that, and lays down the equitable and 
 unexceptionable rule of judgment by which he will proceed as to 
 particular persons; and it is this:--<I>First,</I> The sinner that
 persists in sin shall certainly die, his iniquity shall be his ruin: 
 <I>The soul that sins shall die,</I> shall die as a soul can die, shall 
 be excluded from the favour of God, which is the life and bliss of the 
 soul, and shall lie for ever under his wrath, which is its death and 
 misery. Sin is the act of the <I>soul,</I> the body being only the 
 <I>instrument of unrighteousness;</I> it is called the <I>sin of the 
 soul,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:7">Mic. vi. 7</A>.

 And therefore the punishment of sin is the <I>tribulation and the
 anguish of the soul,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:9">Rom. ii. 9</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> The righteous man that perseveres in his righteousness
 shall certainly live. <I>If a man be just,</I> have a good principle, a 
 good spirit and disposition, and, as an evidence of that, <I>do 
 judgment and justice</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 <I>he shall surely live, saith the Lord God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 He that makes conscience of conforming in every thing to the will of 
 God, that makes it his business to serve God and his aim to glorify 
 God, shall without fail be happy here and for ever in the love and 
 favour of God; and, wherein he comes short of his duty, it shall be 
 forgiven him, through a Mediator. Now here is part of the character of 
 this just man. 

 1. He is careful to keep himself clean from the pollutions of sin, and
 at a distance from all the appearances of evil.

 (1.) From sins against the second commandment. In the matters of God's 
 worship he is jealous, for he knows God is so. He has not only not 
 sacrificed in the high places to the images there set up, but he has 
 not so much as <I>eaten upon the mountains,</I> that is, not had any 
 communion with idolaters by <I>eating things sacrificed to idols,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:20">1 Cor. x. 20</A>.

 He would not only not kneel with them at their altars, but not sit with
 them at their tables in their high places. He detests not only the 
 idols of the heathen but <I>the idols of the house of Israel,</I> which 
 were not only allowed of, but generally applauded and adored, by those 
 that were accounted the professing people of God. He has not only not
 worshipped those idols, but he has not so much as <I>lifted up his 
 eyes</I> to them; he has not given them a favourable look, has had no 
 regard at all to them, neither desired their favour nor dreaded their 
 frowns. He has observed so many bewitched by them that he has not dared 
 so much as to look at them, lest he should be taken in the snare. The 
 eyes of idolaters are said to <I>go a whoring,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+6:9">Ezek. vi. 9</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:19">Deut. iv. 19</A>.

 (2.) From sins against the seventh commandment. He is careful to
 possess his vessel in <I>sanctification and honour,</I> and not <I>in 
 the lusts of uncleanness;</I> and therefore he has not dared to 
 <I>defile his neighbour's wife,</I> nor said or done any thing which 
 had the least tendency to corrupt or debauch her, no, nor will he make 
 any undue approaches to his own wife when she is <I>put apart for her 
 uncleanness,</I> for it was forbidden by the law,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:19,20:18">Lev. xviii. 19; xx. 18</A>.
 
 Note, It is an essential branch of wisdom and justice to keep the 
 appetites of the body always in subjection to reason and virtue.

 (3.) From sins against the eighth commandment. He is a <I>just man,</I> 
 who has not, by fraud and under colour of law and right, <I>oppressed 
 any,</I> and who has not with force and arms <I>spoiled any by 
 violence,</I> not spoiled them of their goods or estates, much less of 
 their liberties and lives,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Oppression and violence were the sins of the old world, that brought 
 the deluge, and are sins of which still God is and will be the avenger. 
 Nay, he is one that has not lent his money <I>upon usury,</I> nor 
 <I>taken increase</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 though, being done by contract, it may seem free from injustice 
 (<I>Volenti non fit injuria--What is done to a person with his own 
 consent is no injury to him</I>), yet, as far as it is forbidden by the 
 law, he dares not do it. A moderate usury they were allowed to receive 
 from strangers, but not from their brethren. A just man will not take 
 advantage of his neighbour's necessity to make a prey of him, nor 
 indulge himself in ease and idleness to live upon the sweat and toil of 
 others, and therefore will not take increase from those who cannot make 
 increase of what he lends them, nor be rigorous in exacting what was 
 agreed for from those who by the act of God are disabled to pay it; but 
 he is willing to share in loss as well as profit. <I>Qui sentit 
 commodum, sentire debet et onus--He who enjoys the benefit should bear 
 the burden.</I> 

 2. He makes conscience of doing the duties of his place. He has 
 <I>restored the pledge</I> to the poor debtor, according to the law. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:26">Exod. xxii. 26</A>.

 "<I>If thou take thy neighbour's raiment</I> for a pledge, the raiment
 that is for necessary use, thou shalt <I>deliver it</I> to him again, 
 that he may sleep in his own bedclothes." Nay, he has not only restored 
 to the poor that which was their own, but has <I>given his bread to the 
 hungry.</I> Observe, It is called <I>his bread,</I> because it is 
 honestly come by; that which is given to some is not unjustly taken 
 from others; for God has said, <I>I hate robbery for 
 burnt-offerings.</I> Worldly men insist upon it that their bread is 
 <I>their own,</I> as Nabal, who therefore would not give of it to David

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:11">1 Sam. xxv. 11</A>);

 yet let them know that it is not so their own but that they are bound
 to do good to others with it. Clothes are necessary as well as food, 
 and therefore this just man is so charitable as <I>to cover the 
 naked</I> also <I>with a garment,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The coats which Dorcas had made for the poor were produced as witnesses 
 of her charity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:39">Acts ix. 39</A>.

 This just man has <I>withdrawn his hands from iniquity,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 If at any time he has been drawn in through inadvertency to that which 
 afterwards has appeared to him to be a wrong thing, he does not persist 
 in it because he has begun it, but <I>withdraws his hand</I> from that 
 which he now perceives to be <I>iniquity;</I> for he <I>executes true 
 judgment between man and man,</I> according as his opportunity is of 
 doing it (as a judge, as a witness, as a juryman, as a referee), and in 
 all commerce is concerned that justice be done, that no man be wronged, 
 that he who is wronged be righted, and that every man have his own, and 
 is ready to interpose himself, and do any good office, in order 
 hereunto. This is his character towards his neighbours; yet it will not 
 suffice that he be just and true to his brother, to complete his 
 character he must be so to his God likewise 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>He has walked in my statutes,</I> those which relate to the duties 
 of his immediate worship; <I>he has kept</I> those and all his other 
 <I>judgments,</I> has had respect to them all, has made it his constant 
 care and endeavour to conform and come up to them all, to deal truly, 
 that so he may approve himself faithful to his covenant with God, and, 
 having joined himself to God, he does not treacherously <I>depart from 
 him,</I> nor <I>dissemble with him.</I> This is a just man, and 
 <I>living he shall live;</I> he shall certainly live, shall have life 
 and shall have it more abundantly, shall live truly, live comfortably, 
 live eternally. <I>Keep the commandments,</I> and thou shalt <I>enter 
 into life,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  If he beget a son <I>that is</I> a robber, a shedder of blood,
 and <I>that</I> doeth the like to <I>any</I> one of these <I>things,</I>
 &nbsp; 11  And that doeth not any of those <I>duties,</I> but even hath
 eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour's wife,
 &nbsp; 12  Hath oppressed the poor and needy, hath spoiled by violence,
 hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the
 idols, hath committed abomination,
 &nbsp; 13  Hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall
 he then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these
 abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.
 &nbsp; 14  Now, lo, <I>if</I> he beget a son, that seeth all his father's
 sins which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such
 like,
 &nbsp; 15  <I>That</I> hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath
 lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not
 defiled his neighbour's wife,
 &nbsp; 16  Neither hath oppressed any, hath not withholden the pledge,
 neither hath spoiled by violence, <I>but</I> hath given his bread to
 the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment,
 &nbsp; 17  <I>That</I> hath taken off his hand from the poor, <I>that</I> hath
 not received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath
 walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his
 father, he shall surely live.
 &nbsp; 18  <I>As for</I> his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled
 his brother by violence, and did <I>that</I> which <I>is</I> not good among
 his people, lo, even he shall die in his iniquity.
 &nbsp; 19  Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the
 father? When the son hath done that which is lawful and right,
 <I>and</I> hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall
 surely live.
 &nbsp; 20  The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear
 the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the
 iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be
 upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God, by the prophet, having laid down the general rule of judgment, 
 that he will render eternal life to those that <I>patiently continue in 
 well-doing,</I> but indignation and wrath to those that do not <I>obey 
 the truth,</I> but <I>obey unrighteousness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:7,8">Rom. ii. 7, 8</A>),

 comes, in these verses, to show that men's parentage and relation shall
 not alter the case either one way or other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He applied it largely and particularly both ways. As it was in the 
 royal line of the kings of Judah, so it often happens in private 
 families, that godly parents have wicked children and wicked parents 
 have godly children. Now here he shows,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That a wicked man shall certainly perish in his iniquity, though he 
 be the son of a pious father. If that righteous man before described 
 <I>beget a son</I> whose character is the reverse of his father's, his 
 condition will certainly be so too. 

 (1.) It is supposed as no uncommon case, but a very melancholy one, 
 that the child of a very godly father, notwithstanding all the 
 instructions given him, the good education he has had and the needful 
 rebukes that have been given him, and the restraints he has been laid 
 under, after all the pains taken with him and prayers put up for him, 
 may yet prove notoriously wicked and vile, the grief of his father, the 
 shame of his family, and the curse and plague of his generation. He is 
 here supposed to allow himself in all those enormities which his good 
 father dreaded and carefully avoided, and to shake off all those good 
 duties which his father made conscience of and took satisfaction in; he 
 undoes all that his father did, and goes counter to his example in 
 every thing. He is here described to be a highwayman--<I>a robber and a 
 shedder of blood.</I> He is an idolater: <I>He has eaten upon the 
 mountains</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)

 and has <I>lifted up his eyes to the idols,</I> which his good father 
 never did, and has come at length not only to feast with the idolaters, 
 but to sacrifice with them, which is here called <I>committing 
 abomination,</I> for the way of sin is down-hill. He is an adulterer, 
 has <I>defiled his neighbour's wife.</I> He is an oppressor even of 
 <I>the poor and needy;</I> he robs the spital, and squeezes those who, 
 he knows, cannot defend themselves, and takes a pride and pleasure in 
 trampling upon the weak and impoverishing those that are poor already. 
 He <I>takes away</I> from those to whom he should <I>give.</I> He has 
 <I>spoiled by violence</I> and open force; he has <I>given forth upon 
 usury,</I> and so spoiled by contract; and he <I>has not restored the 
 pledge,</I> but unjustly detained it even when the debt was paid. Let 
 those good parents that have wicked children not look upon their case 
 as singular; it is a case put here; and by it we see that grace does 
 not run in the blood, nor always attend the means of grace. The race is 
 not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, for then the 
 children that are well taught would do well, but God will let us know 
 that his grace is his own and his Spirit a free-agent, and that though 
 we are tied to give our children a good education he is not tied to 
 bless it. In this, as much as any thing, appears the power of original 
 sin and the necessity of special grace. 

 (2.) We are here assured that this wicked man shall perish for ever in 
 his iniquity, notwithstanding his being the son of a good father. He 
 may perhaps prosper awhile in the world, for the sake of the piety of 
 his ancestors, but, having <I>committed all these abominations,</I> and 
 never repented of them, <I>he shall not live,</I> he shall not be happy 
 in the favour of God; though he may escape the sword of men, he shall 
 not escape the curse of God. <I>He shall surely die;</I> he shall be
 for ever miserable; <I>his blood shall be upon him.</I> He may thank 
 himself; he is his own destroyed. And his relation to a good father 
 will be so far from standing him in stead that it will aggravate his 
 sin and his condemnation. It made his sin the more heinous, nay, it 
 made him really the more vile and profligate, and, consequently, will 
 make his misery hereafter the more intolerable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That a righteous man shall be certainly happy, though he be the son 
 of a wicked father. Though the father did eat the sour grapes, if the 
 children do not meddle with them, they shall fare never the worse for 
 that. Here, 

 (1.) It is supposed (and, blessed be God, it is sometimes a case in 
 fact) that the son of an ungodly father may be godly, that, observing 
 how fatal his father's errors were, he may be so wise as to <I>take 
 warning,</I> and not tread in his father's tests,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 
 Ordinarily, children partake of the parents' temper and are drawn in to 
 imitate their example; but here the son, instead of <I>seeing his 
 father's sins,</I> and, as is usual, doing the like, sees them and 
 dreads doing the like. <I>Men</I> indeed do not <I>gather grapes of 
 thorns,</I> but God sometimes does, takes a branch from a wild olive 
 and grafts it into a good one. Wicked Ahaz begets a good Hezekiah, who 
 <I>sees all his father's sins which he has done,</I> and though he will 
 not, like Ham, proclaim his father's shame, or make the worst of it, 
 yet he loathes it, and blushes at it, and thinks the worse of sin 
 because it was the reproach and ruin of his own father. <I>He considers 
 and does not such like;</I> he considers how ill it became his father 
 to do such things, what an offence it was to God and all good men, what 
 a wound and dishonour he got by it, and what calamities he brought into 
 his family, and therefore he <I>does not such like.</I> Note, If we did 
 but duly <I>consider the ways</I> of wicked men, we should all dread 
 being associates with them and followers of them. The particulars are 
 here again enumerated almost in the same words with that character 
 given of the just man 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>,

 &c.), to show how good men <I>walk in the same spirit and in the same
 steps.</I> This just man here, when he took care to avoid his father's 
 sins, took care to imitate his grandfather's virtues; and, if we look 
 back, we shall find some examples for our imitation, as well as others 
 for our admonition. This just man can not only say, as the Pharisee, 
 <I>I am no adulterer, no extortioner,</I> no oppressor, no usurer, no 
 idolater; but he has <I>given his bread to the hungry</I> and 
 <I>covered the naked.</I> He has <I>taken off his hand from the 
 poor;</I> where he found his father had put hardships upon poor 
 servants, tenants, neighbours, he eased their burden. He did not say, 
 "What my father has done I will abide by, and if it was a fault it was 
 his and not mine;" as Rehoboam, who contemned the taxes his father had 
 imposed. No; he <I>takes his hand off from the poor,</I> and restores 
 them to their rights and liberties again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:15-17"><I>v.</I> 15-17</A>.

 Thus he has <I>executed God's judgments</I> and <I>walked in his 
 statutes,</I> not only done his duty for once, but one on in a course 
 and way of obedience.

 (2.) We are assured that the graceless father alone shall die in his 
 iniquity, but his gracious son shall fare never the worse for it. As 
 for his father

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 because he was a cruel oppressor, and <I>did hurt,</I> nay, because, 
 though he had wealth and power, he did not with them do good among his 
 people, lo, <I>even he,</I> great as he is, <I>shall die in his 
 iniquity,</I> and be undone for ever; but he that kept his integrity 
 <I>shall surely live,</I> shall be easy and happy, and he shall <I>not 
 die for the iniquity of his father.</I> Perhaps his father's wickedness 
 has lessened his estate and weakened his interest, but it shall be no 
 prejudice at all to his acceptance with God and his eternal 
 welfare.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He appeals to themselves then whether they did not wrong God with 
 their proverb. "Thus plain the case is, and <I>yet you say, Does not 
 the son bear the iniquity of the father?</I> No, he does not; he shall 
 not if he will himself <I>do that which is lawful and right,</I>" 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 But this people that bore the iniquity of their fathers had not done 
 that which is lawful and right, and therefore justly suffered for their 
 own sin and had no reason to complain of God's proceedings against them 
 as at all unjust, though they had reason to complain of the bad example 
 their fathers had left them as very unkind. <I>Our fathers have sinned 
 and are not, and we have borne their iniquity,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:7">Lam. v. 7</A>.

 It is true that there is a curse entailed upon wicked families, but it
 is as true that the entail may be cut off by repentance and 
 reformation; let the impenitent and unreformed therefore thank 
 themselves if they fall under it. The settled rule of judgment is 
 therefore repeated

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>The soul that sins shall die,</I> and not another for it. What 
 direction God has given to earthly judges 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:16">Deut. xxiv. 16</A>)

 he will himself pursue: <I>The son shall not die,</I> not die
 eternally, <I>for the iniquity of the father,</I> if he do not tread in 
 the steps of it, nor the father <I>for the iniquity of the son,</I> if 
 he endeavour to do his duty for the preventing of it. In <I>the day of 
 the revelation of the righteous judgment of God,</I> which is now 
 clouded and eclipsed, <I>the righteousness of the righteous shall</I> 
 appear before all the world to be <I>upon him,</I> to his everlasting 
 comfort and honour, upon him as a robe, upon his as a crown; and <I>the 
 wickedness of the wicked</I> shall be <I>upon him,</I> to his 
 everlasting confusion, upon him as a chain, upon him as a load, as a 
 mountain of lead to sink him to the bottomless pit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here another rule of judgment which God will go by in dealing 
 with us, by which is further demonstrated the equity of his government. 
 The former showed that God will reward or punish according to the 
 change made in the family or succession, for the better or for the 
 worse; here he shows that he will reward or punish according to the 
 change made in the person himself, whether for the better or the worse. 
 While we are in this world we are in a state of probation; the time of 
 trial lasts as long as the time of life, and according as we are found 
 at last it will be with us to eternity. Now see here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The case fairly stated, much as it had been before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:18"><I>ch.</I> iii. 18</A>,

 &c.), and here it is laid down once 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:21-24"><I>v.</I> 21-24</A>)
 
 and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:26-28"><I>v.</I> 26-28</A>),
 
 because it is a matter of vast importance, a matter of life and death, 
 of life and death eternal. Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A fair invitation given to wicked people, to turn from their 
 wickedness. Assurance is here given us that, <I>if the wicked will 
 turn,</I> he shall <I>surely live,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:21,27"><I>v.</I> 21, 27</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What is required to denominate a man a true convert, how he must 
 be qualified that he may be entitled to this act of indemnity. 

 [1.] The first step towards conversion is consideration

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 <I>Because he considers and turns.</I> The reason why sinners go on in 
 their evil ways is because they do not consider what will be <I>in the 
 end thereof;</I> but if the prodigal once <I>come to himself,</I> if he 
 sit down and consider a little how bad his state is and how easily it 
 may be bettered, he will soon <I>return to his father</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:17">Luke xv. 17</A>),
 
 and the adulteress <I>to her first husband</I> when she considers that
 <I>then it was better with her than now,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:7">Hos. ii. 7</A>.

 [2.] This consideration must produce an aversion to sin. When he
 considers he must turn <I>away from his wickedness,</I> which denotes a 
 change in the disposition of the heart; he must turn from <I>his sins 
 and his transgression,</I> which denotes a change in the life; he must 
 break off from all his evil courses, and, wherein he has done iniquity, 
 must resolve to do so no more, and this from a principle of hatred to 
 sin. <I>What have I to do any more with idols?</I>

 [3.] This aversion to sin must be universal; he must turn from 
 <I>all</I> his sins and <I>all</I> his transgressions, with out a 
 reserve for any Delilah, any house of Rimmon. We do not rightly turn 
 from sin unless we truly hate it, and we do not truly hate sin, as sin, 
 if we do not hate all sin.

 [4.] This must be accompanied with a conversion to God and duty; he 
 must <I>keep all God's statutes</I> (for the obedience, if it be 
 sincere, will be universal) and must <I>do that which is lawful and 
 right,</I> that which agrees with the word and will of God, which he 
 must take for his rule, and not the will of the flesh and the way of 
 the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What is promised to those that do thus turn from sin to God. 

 [1.] They shall <I>save their souls alive,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 They shall <I>surely live, they shall not die,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:21,28"><I>v.</I> 21 and again <I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 Whereas it was said, <I>The soul that sins it shall die,</I> yet let
 not those that have sinned despair but that the threatened death may be 
 prevented if they will but turn and repent in time. When David 
 penitently acknowledges, <I>I have sinned,</I> he is immediately 
 assured of his pardon: "<I>The Lord has taken away thy sin, thou shalt 
 not die</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:13">2 Sam. xii. 13</A>),

 thou shalt not die eternally." He shall <I>surely live;</I> he shall be
 restored to the favour of God, which is the life of the soul, and shall 
 not lie under <I>his wrath,</I> which is as <I>messengers of death</I> 
 to the soul.

 [2.] The sins they have repented of and forsaken shall not rise up in 
 judgment against them, nor shall they be so much as upbraided with 
 them: <I>All his transgressions that he has committed,</I> though 
 numerous, though heinous, though very provoking to God, and redounding 
 very much to his dishonour, yet <I>they shall not be mentioned unto 
 him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 not mentioned against them; not only they shall not be imputed to him 
 to ruin him, but in the great day they shall not be remembered against 
 him to grieve or shame him; they shall be covered, shall be sought for 
 and not found. This intimates the fulness of pardoning mercy; when sin 
 is forgiven it is <I>blotted out,</I> it is <I>remembered no more.</I> 
 
 [3.] In <I>their righteousness they shall live;</I> not for their 
 righteousness, as if that were the purchase of their pardon and bliss 
 and an atonement for their sins, but in their righteousness, which 
 qualifies them for all the blessings purchased by the Mediator, and is 
 itself one of those blessings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) What encouragement a repenting returning sinner has to hope for 
 pardon and life according to this promise. He is conscious to himself 
 that his obedience for the future can never be a valuable compensation 
 for his former disobedience; but he has this to support himself with, 
 that God's nature, property, and delight, is to have mercy and to 
 forgive, for he has said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 "<I>Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die?</I> No, by 
 no means; you never had any cause given you to think so." It is true 
 God has determined to punish sinners; his justice calls for their 
 punishment, and, pursuant to that, impenitent sinners will lie for ever 
 under his wrath and curse; that is the will of his decree, his 
 consequent will, but it is not his antecedent will, the will of his 
 delight. Though the righteousness of his government requires that 
 sinners die, yet the goodness of his nature objects against it. <I>How 
 shall I give thee up, Ephraim?</I> It is spoken here comparatively; he 
 has not pleasure in the ruin of sinners, for he would rather they 
 should <I>turn from their ways and live;</I> he is better pleased when 
 his mercy is glorified in their salvation than when his justice is 
 glorified in their damnation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. A fair warning given to righteous people not to turn from their 
 righteousness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:24-26"><I>v.</I> 24-26</A>.
 
 Here is, 

 (1.) The character of an apostate, that <I>turns away from his 
 righteousness.</I> He never was in sincerity a righteous man (as 
 appears by that of the apostle,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:19">1 John ii. 19</A>,

 <I>If they had been of us, they would, no doubt, have continued with
 us</I>), but he passed for a righteous man. He had the denomination and 
 all the external marks of a righteous man; he thought himself one, and 
 others thought him one. But he throws of his profession, leaves his 
 first love, disowns and forsakes the truth and ways of God, and so 
 <I>turns away from his righteousness</I> as one sick of it, and now 
 shows, what he always had, a secret aversion to it; and, having 
 <I>turned away from his righteousness,</I> he <I>commits iniquity,</I> 
 grows loose, and profane, and sensual, intemperate, unjust, and, in 
 short, <I>does according to all the abominations that the wicked man 
 does;</I> for, when the unclean spirit recovers his possession of the 
 heart, he <I>brings with him seven other spirits more wicked than 
 himself and they enter in and dwell there,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:26">Luke xi. 26</A>.

 (2.) The doom of an apostate: <I>Shall he live</I> because he was once
 a <I>righteous man?</I> No; <I>factum non dicitur quod non 
 perseverat--that which does not abide is not said to be done. In his 
 trespass</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>)

 and for his iniquity (that is the meritorious cause of his ruin), 
 <I>for the iniquity that he has done, he shall die,</I> shall die 
 eternally, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 <I>The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways.</I> But 
 will not his former professions and performances stand him in some 
 stead--will they not avail at least to mitigate his punishment? No: 
 <I>All his righteousness that he has done,</I> though ever so much 
 applauded by men, <I>shall not be mentioned</I> so as to be either a 
 credit or a comfort to him; the righteousness of an apostate is 
 forgotten, as the wickedness of a penitent is. Under the law, if a 
 Nazarite was polluted he lost all the foregoing days of his separation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+6:12">Num. vi. 12</A>),

 so those that have <I>begun in the spirit and end in the flesh</I> may
 reckon all their past services and sufferings <I>in vain</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:3,4">Gal. iii. 3, 4</A>);

 unless we persevere we <I>lose what we have gained,</I>

 II. An appeal to the consciences even of the house of Israel, though 
 very corrupt, concerning God's equity in all these proceedings; for he 
 will be justified, as well as sinners judged, out of their own mouths. 
 
 1. The charge they drew up against God is blasphemous,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:25,29"><I>v.</I> 25, 29</A>.

 The <I>house of Israel</I> has the impudence to say, <I>The way of the 
 Lord is not equal,</I> than which nothing could be more absurd as well 
 as impious. <I>He that formed the eye, shall he not see?</I> Can his 
 ways be unequal whose will is the eternal rule of good and evil, right 
 and wrong? <I>Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</I> No 
 doubt he shall; he cannot do otherwise. 

 2. God's reasonings with them are very gracious and condescending, for 
 even these blasphemers God would rather have convinced and saved than 
 condemned. One would have expected that God would immediately vindicate 
 the honour of his justice by making those that impeached it eternal 
 monuments of it. Must those be suffered to draw another breath that 
 have once breathed out such wickedness as this? Shall that tongue ever 
 speak again any where but in hell that has once said, <I>The ways of 
 the Lord are not equal?</I> Yes, because this is the day of God's 
 patience, he vouchsafes to argue with them; and he requires them to 
 own, for it is so plain that they cannot deny,

 (1.) The equity of his ways: <I>Are not my ways equal?</I> No doubt 
 they are. He never lays upon man more than is right. In the present 
 punishments of sinners and the afflictions of his own people, yea, and 
 in the eternal damnation of the impenitent, <I>the ways of the Lord are 
 equal.</I> 

 (2.) The iniquity of their ways: "<I>Are not your ways unequal?</I> It 
 is plain that they are, and the troubles you are in you have brought 
 upon your own heads. God does you no wrong, but you have wronged 
 yourselves." <I>The foolishness of man perverts his way,</I> makes that 
 unequal, and then <I>his heart frets against the Lord,</I> as if his 
 ways were unequal,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+19:3">Prov. xix. 3</A>.

 In all our disputes with God, and in all his controversies with us, it 
 will be found that his ways are equal, but ours are unequal, that he is 
 in the right and we are in the wrong.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>30  Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one
 according to his ways, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>. Repent, and turn
 <I>yourselves</I> from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not
 be your ruin.
 &nbsp; 31  Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have
 transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why
 will ye die, O house of Israel?
 &nbsp; 32  For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith
 the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>: wherefore turn <I>yourselves,</I> and live ye.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the conclusion and application of this whole matter. After 
 a fair trial at the bar of right reason the verdict is brought in on 
 God's side; it appears that <I>his ways are equal.</I> Judgment 
 therefore is next to be given; and one would think it should be a 
 judgment of condemnation, nothing short of <I>Go, you cursed, into 
 everlasting fire.</I> But, behold, a miracle of mercy; the day of grace 
 and divine patience is yet lengthened out; and therefore, though God 
 will at last judge <I>every one according to his ways,</I> yet he waits 
 to be gracious, and closes all with a call to repentance and a promise 
 of pardon upon repentance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here are four necessary duties that we are called to, all amounting 
 to the same:--

 1. We must repent; we must change our mind and change our ways; we must
 be sorry for what we have done amiss and ashamed of it, and go as far 
 as we can towards the undoing of it again.

 2. We must <I>turn ourselves from all our transgressions,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:30,32"><I>v.</I> 30 and again <I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 <I>Turn yourselves,</I> face about; turn from sin, nay, turn against it 
 as the enemy you loathe, turn to God as the friend you love.

 3. We must <I>cast away from us all our transgressions;</I> we must
 abandon and forsake them with a resolution never to return to them 
 again, give sin a bill of divorce, break all the leagues we have made 
 with it, throw it overboard, as the mariners did Jonah (for it has 
 raised the storm), cast it out of the soul, and crucify it as a 
 malefactor. 

 4. We must <I>make us a new heart and a new spirit.</I> This was the 
 matter of a promise,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:19"><I>ch.</I> xi. 19</A>.

 Here it is the matter of a precept. We must do our endeavour, and then
 God will not be wanting to us to give us his grace. St. Austin well 
 explains this precept. <I>Deus non jubet impossibilia, sed jubendo 
 monet et facere quod possis et petere quod non possis--God does not 
 enjoin impossibilities, but by his commands admonishes us to do what is 
 in our power and to pray for what is not.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here are four good arguments used to enforce these calls to 
 repentance:--

 1. It is the only way, and it is a sure way, to prevent the ruin which
 our sins have a direct tendency to: <I>So iniquity shall not be your 
 ruin,</I> which implies that, if we do not repent, iniquity will be our 
 ruin, here and for ever, but that, if we do, we are safe, we are 
 snatched as brands out of the burning.

 2. If we repent not, we certainly perish, and our blood will be upon 
 our own heads. <I>Why will you die, O house of Israel?</I> What an 
 absurd thing it is for you to choose death and damnation rather than 
 life and salvation. Note, The reason why sinners die is because they 
 <I>will die;</I> they will go down the way that leads to death, and not 
 come up to the terms on which life is offered. Herein sinners, 
 especially sinners of the house of Israel, are most unreasonable and 
 act most unaccountably.

 3. The God of heaven has no delight in our ruin, but desires our 
 welfare 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):

 <I>I have no pleasure in the death of him that dies,</I> which implies 
 that he has pleasure in the recovery of those that repent; and this is 
 both an engagement and an encouragement to us to repent. 

 4. We are made for ever if we repent: <I>Turn yourselves, and live.</I> 
 He that says to us, <I>Repent,</I> thereby says to us, <I>Live,</I> 
 yea, he says to us, <I>Live;</I> so that life and death are here set 
 before us.</P>
