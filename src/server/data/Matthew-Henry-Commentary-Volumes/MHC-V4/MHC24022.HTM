 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Upon occasion of the message sent in the foregoing chapter to the house 
 of the king, we have here recorded some sermons which Jeremiah preached 
 at court, in some preceding reigns, that it might appear they had had 
 fair warning long before that fatal sentence was pronounced upon them, 
 and were put in a way to prevent it. Here is, 

 I. A message sent to the royal family, as it should seem in the reign
 of Jehoiakim, relating partly to Jehoahaz, who was carried away captive 
 into Egypt, and partly to Jehoiakim, who succeeded him and was now upon 
 the throne. The king and princes are exhorted to execute judgment, and 
 are assured that, if they did so, the royal family should flourish, but 
 otherwise it should be ruined, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:1-9">ver. 1-9</A>.

 Jehoahaz, called here Shallum, is lamented, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:10-12">ver. 10-12</A>.

 Jehoiakim is reproved and threatened, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:13-19">ver. 13-19</A>.

 II. Another message sent them in the reign of Jehoiachin (alias,
 Jeconiah) the son of Jehoiakim. He is charged with an obstinate refusal 
 to hear, and is threatened with destruction, and it is foretold that in 
 him Solomon's house should fail,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Go down to the house of the king of
 Judah, and speak there this word,
 &nbsp; 2  And say, Hear the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, O king of Judah, that
 sittest upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy
 people that enter in by these gates:
 &nbsp; 3  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Execute ye judgment and righteousness,
 and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor: and do
 no wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the
 widow, neither shed innocent blood in this place.
 &nbsp; 4  For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by
 the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David,
 riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his
 people.
 &nbsp; 5  But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that this house shall become a desolation.
 &nbsp; 6  For thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> unto the king's house of Judah; Thou
 <I>art</I> Gilead unto me, <I>and</I> the head of Lebanon: <I>yet</I> surely I
 will make thee a wilderness, <I>and</I> cities <I>which</I> are not
 inhabited.
 &nbsp; 7  And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with
 his weapons: and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast
 <I>them</I> into the fire.
 &nbsp; 8  And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say
 every man to his neighbour, Wherefore hath the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> done thus
 unto this great city?
 &nbsp; 9  Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the
 covenant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> their God, and worshipped other gods, and
 served them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Orders given to Jeremiah to go and preach before the king. In the 
 foregoing chapter we are told that Zedekiah sent messengers to the 
 prophet, but here the prophet is bidden to go, in his own proper 
 person, <I>to the house of the king,</I> and demand his attention to 
 the word of the King of kings 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>Hear the word of the Lord, O king of Judah!</I> Subjects must own 
 that where the word of the king is there is power over them, but kings 
 must own that where the word of the Lord is there is power over them. 
 The <I>king of Judah</I> is here spoken to <I>as sitting upon the 
 throne of David,</I> who was a man after God's own heart, as holding 
 his dignity and power by the covenant made with David; let him 
 therefore conform to his example, that he may have the benefit of the 
 promises made to him. With the king his <I>servants</I> are spoken to, 
 because a good government depends upon a good ministry as well as a 
 good king.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Instructions given him what to preach.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He must tell them what was their duty, what was the good which the 
 Lord their God required of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 They must take care, 

 (1.) That they do all the good they can with the power they have. They 
 must do justice in defence of those that were injured, and must 
 <I>deliver the spoiled out of the hand of their oppressors.</I> This 
 was the duty of their place, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:3">Ps. lxxxii. 3</A>.

 Herein they must be ministers of God for good.

 (2.) That they do no hurt with it, <I>no wrong, no violence.</I> That 
 is the greatest wrong and violence which is done under colour of law 
 and justice, and by those whose business it is to punish and protect 
 from wrong and violence. They must <I>do no wrong to the stranger, 
 fatherless, and widow;</I> for these God does in a particular matter 
 patronise and take under his tuition, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:21,22">Exod. xxii. 21, 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He must assure them that the faithful discharge of their duty would 
 advance and secure their prosperity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 There shall then be a succession of kings, an uninterrupted succession, 
 <I>upon the throne of David</I> and of his line, these enjoying a 
 perfect tranquillity, and living in great state and dignity, <I>riding 
 in chariots and on horses,</I> as before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:25"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 25</A>.

 Note, the most effectual way to preserve the dignity of the government
 is to do the duty of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He must likewise assure them that the iniquity of their family, if 
 they persisted in it, would be the ruin of their family, though it was 
 a royal family 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>If you will not hear,</I> will not obey, <I>this house shall become 
 a desolation,</I> the palace of the kings of Judah shall fare no better 
 than other habitations in Jerusalem. Sin has often been the ruin of 
 royal palaces, though ever so stately, ever so strong. This sentence is 
 ratified by an oath: <I>I swear by myself</I> (and God can swear by no 
 greater, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:13">Heb. vi. 13</A>)

 that this house shall be laid in ruins. Note, Sin will be the ruin of
 the houses of princes as well as of mean men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He must show how fatal their wickedness would be to their kingdom as 
 well as to themselves, to Jerusalem especially, the royal city, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:6-9"><I>v.</I> 6-9</A>.
 
 (1.) It is confessed that Judah and Jerusalem had been valuable in 
 God's eyes and considerable in their own: <I>thou art Gilead unto me 
 and the head of Lebanon.</I> Their lot was cast in a place that was 
 rich and pleasant as Gilead; Zion was a stronghold, as stately as 
 Lebanon: this they trusted to as their security. But, 

 (2.) This shall not protect them; the country that is now fruitful as 
 Gilead shall be made <I>a wilderness.</I> The cities that are now 
 strong as Lebanon shall be cities <I>not inhabited;</I> and, when the 
 country is laid waste, the cities must be dispeopled. See how easily 
 God's judgments can ruin a nation, and how certainly sin will do it. 
 When this desolating work is to be done,

 [1.] There shall be those that shall do it effectually

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "<I>I will prepare destroyers against thee;</I> I will <I>sanctify</I> 
 them" (so the word is); "I will appoint them to this service and use 
 them in it." Note, When destruction is designed destroyers are 
 prepared, and perhaps are in the preparing, and things are working 
 towards the designed destruction, and are getting ready for it, long 
 before. And who can contend with destroyers of God's preparing? They 
 shall destroy cities as easily as men fell trees in a forest: <I>They 
 shall cut down thy choice cedars;</I> and yet, when they are down, 
 shall value them no more than thorns and briers; they shall <I>cast 
 them into the fire,</I> for their choicest cedars have become rotten 
 ones and good for nothing else. 

 [2.] There shall be those who shall be ready to justify God in the 
 doing of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>);

 persons of <I>many nations,</I> when they <I>pass by</I> the ruins of 
 <I>this city</I> in their travels, will ask, "<I>Wherefore hath the 
 Lord done thus unto this city?</I> How came so strong a city to be 
 overpowered? so rich a city to be impoverished? so populous a city to
 be depopulated? so holy a city to be profaned? and a city that had been 
 so dear to God to be abandoned by him?" The reason is so obvious that 
 it shall be ready in every man's mouth. Ask those <I>that go by the 
 way,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:29">Job xxi. 29</A>.

 Ask the next man you meet, and he will tell you it was because they
 changed their gods, which other nations never used to do. They forsook 
 <I>the covenant</I> of Jehovah their own God, revolted from their 
 allegiance to him and from the duty which their covenant with him bound 
 them to, and they <I>worshipped other gods and served them,</I> in 
 contempt of him; and therefore he gave them up to this destruction. 
 Note, God never casts any off until they first cast him off. "Go," says 
 God to the prophet, "and preach this to the royal family."</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: <I>but</I> weep
 sore for him that goeth away: for he shall return no more, nor
 see his native country.
 &nbsp; 11  For thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> touching Shallum the son of Josiah
 king of Judah, which reigned instead of Josiah his father, which
 went forth out of this place; He shall not return thither any
 more:
 &nbsp; 12  But he shall die in the place whither they have led him
 captive, and shall see this land no more.
 &nbsp; 13  Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and
 his chambers by wrong; <I>that</I> useth his neighbour's service
 without wages, and giveth him not for his work;
 &nbsp; 14  That saith, I will build me a wide house and large chambers,
 and cutteth him out windows; and <I>it is</I> cieled with cedar, and
 painted with vermilion.
 &nbsp; 15  Shalt thou reign, because thou closest <I>thyself</I> in cedar?
 did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice,
 <I>and</I> then <I>it was</I> well with him?
 &nbsp; 16  He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then <I>it was</I>
 well <I>with him: was</I> not this to know me? saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 17  But thine eyes and thine heart <I>are</I> not but for thy
 covetousness, and for to shed innocent blood, and for oppression,
 and for violence, to do <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 18  Therefore thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> concerning Jehoiakim the son
 of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, <I>saying,</I>
 Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him,
 <I>saying,</I> Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!
 &nbsp; 19  He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast
 forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Kings, though they are gods to us, are men to God, and shall <I>die 
 like men;</I> so it appears in these verses, where we have a sentence 
 of death passed upon two kings who reigned successively in Jerusalem, 
 two brothers, and both the ungracious sons of a very pious father.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is the doom of Shallum, who doubtless is the same with 
 Jehoahaz, for he is that son of Josiah king of Judah who reigned <I>in 
 the stead of Josiah his father</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 which Jehoahaz did by the act of the people, who made him king though 
 he was not the eldest son, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:30,2Ch+36:1">2 Kings xxiii. 30; 2 Chron. xxxvi. 1</A>.

 Among the sons of Josiah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+3:15">1 Chron. iii. 15</A>)

 there is one Shallum mentioned, and not Jehoahaz. Perhaps the people
 preferred him before his elder brother because they thought him a more
 active daring young man, and fitter to rule; but God soon showed them
 the folly of their injustice, and that it could not prosper, for within
 three months the king of Egypt came upon him, deposed him, and carried
 him away prisoner into Egypt, as God had threatened, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:68">Deut. xxviii. 68</A>.

 It does not appear that any of the people were taken into captivity
 with him. We have the story

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:34,2Ch+36:4">2 Kings xxiii. 34; 2 Chron. xxxvi. 4</A>.
 
 Now here,

 1. The people are directed to lament him rather than his father Josiah:
 "<I>Weep not for the dead,</I> weep not any more for Josiah." Jeremiah 
 had been himself a true mourner for him, and had stirred up the people 
 to mourn for him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:25">2 Chron. xxxv. 25</A>):

 yet now he will have them go out of mourning for him, though it was but
 three months after his death, and to turn their tears into another 
 channel. They must weep sorely for Jehoahaz, who had gone into Egypt; 
 not that there was any great loss of him to the public, as there was of 
 his father, but that his case was much more deplorable. Josiah went to 
 the grave in peace and honour, was prevented from seeing the evil to 
 come in this world and removed to see the good to come in the other 
 world; and therefore, <I>Weep not for him,</I> but for his unhappy son, 
 who is likely to live and die in disgrace and misery, a wretched 
 captive. Note, Dying saints may be justly envied, while living sinners
 are justly pitied. And so dismal perhaps the prospect of the times may 
 be that tears even for a Josiah, even for a Jesus, must be restrained, 
 that they may be reserved for <I>ourselves and for our children,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:28">Luke xxiii. 28</A>.

 2. The reason given is because he shall never return out of captivity,
 as he and his people expected, but shall die there. They were loth to 
 believe this, therefore it is repeated here again and again, He shall 
 <I>return no more,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 He shall never have the pleasure of seeing <I>his native country,</I> 
 but shall have the continual grief of hearing of the desolations of it. 
 He has gone <I>forth out of this place,</I> and shall <I>never 
 return,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 <I>He shall die in the place whither they have led him captive,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 This came of his forsaking the good example of his father, and usurping 
 the right of his elder brother. In Ezekiel's lamentation for the 
 princes of Israel this Jehoahaz is represented as a young lion, that 
 soon learned to <I>catch the prey,</I> but was taken, and brought in 
 chains to Egypt, and was long expected to return, but in vain. See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+19:3-5">Ezek. xix. 3-5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is the doom of Jehoiakim, who succeeded him. Whether he had 
 any better right to the crown than Shallum we know not; for, though he 
 was older than his predecessor, there seems to be another son of 
 Josiah, older than he, called <I>Johanan,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+3:15">1 Chron. iii. 15</A>.

 But this we know he ruled no better, and fared no better at last. Here
 we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His sins faithfully reproved. It is not fit for a private person to 
 say to a king, <I>Thou art wicked;</I> but a prophet, who has a message 
 from God, betrays his trust if he does not deliver it, be it ever so 
 unpleasing, even to kings themselves. Jehoiakim is not here charged
 with idolatry, and probably he had not yet put Urijah the prophet to 
 death (as we find afterwards he did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+26:22,23"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 22, 23</A>),

 for then he would have been told of it here; but the crimes for which
 he is here reproved are, 

 (1.) Pride and affection of pomp and splendour; as if all the business 
 of a king were to look great, and to do good were to be the least of 
 his care. He must build himself a stately palace, a <I>wide house,</I> 
 and <I>large chambers,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 
 He must have <I>windows cut out</I> after the newest fashion, perhaps 
 like sash-windows with us. The rooms must be <I>ceiled with cedar,</I> 
 the richest sort of wood. His house must be as well-roofed and 
 wainscoted as the temple itself, or else it will not please him, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:15,16">1 Kings vi. 15, 16</A>.

 Nay, it must exceed that, for it must be painted with <I>minium,</I> or
 <I>vermilion,</I> which dyes red, or, as some read it, with 
 <I>indigo,</I> which dyes blue. No doubt it is lawful for princes and 
 great men to build, and beautify, and furnish their houses so as is 
 agreeable to their dignity; but he that knows what is in man knew that 
 Jehoiakim did this in the pride of his heart, which makes that to be 
 sinful, exceedingly sinful, which is in itself lawful. Those therefore 
 that are enlarging their houses, and making them more sumptuous, have 
 need to look well to the frame of their own spirits in the doing of it, 
 and carefully to watch against all the workings of vain-glory. But that 
 which was particularly amiss in Jehoiakim's case was that he did this 
 when he could not but perceive, both by the word of God and by his 
 providence, that divine judgments were breaking in upon him. He reigned 
 his first three years by the permission and allowance of the king of 
 Egypt, and all the rest by the permission and allowance of the king of 
 Babylon; and yet he that was no better than a viceroy will covet to vie 
 with the greatest monarchs in building and furniture. Observe how 
 peremptory he is in this resolution: "<I>I will build myself a wide 
 house;</I> I am resolved <I>I will,</I> whoever advises me to the 
 contrary." Note, It is the common folly of those that are sinking in 
 their estates to covet to make a fair show. Many have unhumbled hearts 
 under humbling providences, and look most haughty when God is bringing 
 them down. This is striving with our Maker.

 (2.) Carnal security and confidence in his wealth, depending upon the 
 continuance of his prosperity, as if his mountain now stood so strong 
 that it could never be moved. He thought he must reign without any 
 disturbance or interruption because he had <I>enclosed himself in 
 cedar</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),
 
 as if that were too fine to be assaulted and too strong to be broken 
 through, and as if God himself could not, for pity, give up such a 
 stately house as that to be burned. Thus when Christ spoke of the 
 destruction of the temple his disciples came to him, to show him what a 
 magnificent structure it was, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:38,24:1">Matt. xxiii. 38; xxiv. 1</A>.

 Note, Those wretchedly deceive themselves who think their present
 prosperity is a lasting security, and dream of reigning because they 
 are <I>enclosed in cedar.</I> It is but in his own conceit that <I>the 
 rich man's wealth is his strong city.</I>

 (3.) Some think he is here charged with sacrilege, and robbing the 
 house of God to beautify and adorn his own house. He <I>cuts him 
 out</I> my <I>windows</I> (so it is in the margin), which some 
 understand as if he had taken windows out of the temple to put into his 
 own palace and then <I>painted them</I> (as it follows) <I>with 
 vermilion,</I> that it might not be discovered, but might look of a 
 piece with his own buildings. Note, Those cheat themselves, and ruin 
 themselves at last, who think to enrich themselves by robbing God and 
 his house; and, however they may disguise it, God discovers it. 

 (4.) He is here charged with extortion and oppression, violence and 
 injustice. He <I>built his house by unrighteousness,</I> with money
 unjustly got and materials which were not honestly come by, and perhaps 
 upon ground obtained as Ahab obtained Naboth's vineyard. And, because
 he went beyond what he could afford, he defrauded his workmen of their 
 wages, which is one of the sins that <I>cries in the ears of the Lord 
 of hosts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:4">Jam. v. 4</A>.

 God takes notice of the wrong done by the greatest of men to their poor
 servants and labourers, and will repay those, in justice, that will not 
 in justice pay those whom they employ, but <I>use their neighbour's 
 service without wages.</I> Observe, The greatest of men must look upon 
 the meanest as their neighbours, and be just to them accordingly, and 
 love them as themselves. Jehoiakim was oppressive, not only in his 
 buildings, but in the administration of his government. He did not do 
 justice, made no conscience of shedding innocent blood, when it was to 
 serve the purposes of his ambition, avarice, and revenge. He was all 
 for <I>oppression</I> and <I>violence,</I> not to threaten it only, but 
 to do it; and, when he was set upon any act of injustice, nothing 
 should stop him, but he would go through with it. And that which was at 
 the bottom of all was covetousness, that love of <I>money which is the 
 root of all evil. Thy eyes and thy heart are not but for 
 covetousness;</I> they were for that, and nothing else. Observe, In 
 covetousness the heart walks after the eyes: it is therefore called 
 <I>the lust of the eye,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:16,Job+31:7">1 John ii. 16; Job xxxi. 7</A>.

 It is <I>setting the eyes upon that which is not,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:5">Prov. xxiii. 5</A>.

 The eyes and the heart are then for covetousness when the aims and 
 affections are wholly set upon the wealth of this world; and, where 
 they are so, the temptation is strong to murder, oppression, and all 
 manner of violence and villany. 

 (5.) That which aggravated all his sins was that he was the son of a 
 good father, who had left him a good example, if he would but have 
 followed it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>):

 <I>Did not thy father eat and drink?</I> When Jehoiakim enlarged and 
 enlightened his house it is probable that he spoke scornfully of his 
 father for contenting himself with such a mean and inconvenient 
 dwelling, below the grandeur of a sovereign prince, and ridiculed him 
 as one that had a dull fancy, a low spirit, and could not find in his 
 heart to lay out his money, nor cared for what was fashionable; that 
 should not serve him which served his father: but God, by the prophet, 
 tells him that his father, though he had not the spirit of building, 
 was a man of an excellent spirit, a better man than he, and did better 
 for himself and his family. Those children that despise their parents' 
 old fashions commonly come short of their real excellences. Jeremiah
 tells him, 

 [1.] That he was directed to do his duty by his father's practice: He 
 <I>did judgment and justice;</I> he never did wrong to any of his 
 subjects, never oppressed them, nor put any hardship upon them, but was 
 careful to preserve all their just rights and properties. Nay, he not 
 only did not abuse his power for the support of wrong, but he used it 
 for the maintaining of right. He <I>judged the cause of the poor and 
 needy,</I> was ready to hear the cause of the meanest of his subjects 
 and do them justice. Note, The care of magistrates must be, not to 
 support their grandeur and take their ease, but to do good, not only 
 not to oppress the poor themselves, but to defend those that are 
 oppressed. 

 [2.] That he was encouraged to do his duty by his father's prosperity. 
 <I>First,</I> God accepted him: "<I>Was not this to know me, saith the 
 Lord?</I> Did he not hereby make it to appear that he rightly knew his 
 God, and worshipped him, and consequently was known and owned of him?" 
 Note, The right knowledge of God consists in doing our duty, 
 particularly that which is the duty of our place and station in the 
 world. <I>Secondly,</I> He himself had the comfort of it: <I>Did he
 not eat and drink</I> soberly and cheerfully, so as to fit himself for 
 his business, <I>for strength and not for drunkenness?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:17">Eccl. x. 17</A>.
 
 He did <I>eat, and drink, and do judgment;</I> he did not (as perhaps
 Jehoiakim and his princes did) <I>drink, and forget the law, and 
 pervert the judgment of the afflicted,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:5">Prov. xxxi. 5</A>.

 He did <I>eat and drink;</I> that is, God blessed him with great 
 plenty, and he had the comfortable enjoyment of it himself and gave 
 handsome entertainments to his friends, was very hospitable and very 
 charitable. It was Jehoiakim's pride that he had built a fine house,
 but Josiah's true praise that he kept a good house. Many times those 
 have least in them of true generosity that have the greatest affection 
 for pomp and grandeur; for, to support the extravagant expense of that, 
 hospitality, bounty to the poor, yea, and justice itself, will be 
 pinched. It is better to live with Josiah in an old-fashioned house, 
 and do good, than live with Jehoiakim in a stately house, and leave 
 debts unpaid. Josiah did <I>justice and judgment,</I> and then <I>it 
 was well with him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>,

 and it is repeated again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 He lived very comfortably; his own subjects, and all his neighbours, 
 respected him; and whatever he put his hand to prospered. Note, While 
 we do well we may expect it will be well with us. This Jehoiakim knew, 
 that his father found the way of duty to be the way of comfort, and yet 
 he would not tread in his steps. Note, It should engage us to keep up
 religion in our day that our godly parents kept it up in theirs and 
 recommended it to us from their own experience of the benefit of it. 
 They told us that they had found the promises which godliness has of 
 the <I>life that now</I> is made good to them, and that religion and 
 piety are friendly to outward prosperity. So that we are inexcusable if 
 we turn aside from that good way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here we have Jehoiakim's doom faithfully read, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 We may suppose that it was in the utmost peril of his own life that 
 Jeremiah here foretold the shameful death of Jehoiakim; but <I>thus 
 saith the Lord concerning</I> him, and therefore thus saith he. 

 (1.) He shall die unlamented; he shall make himself so odious by his 
 oppression and cruelty that all about him shall be glad to part with 
 him, and none shall do him the honour of dropping one tear for him, 
 whereas his father, who <I>did judgment and justice,</I> was 
 universally lamented; and it is promised to Zedekiah that he should be 
 lamented at his death, for he conducted himself better than Jehoiakim 
 had done,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:5"><I>ch.</I> xxxiv. 5</A>.

 His relations shall not <I>lament him,</I> no, not with the common
 expressions of grief used at the funeral of the meanest, where they
 cried, <I>Ah, my brother!</I> or, <I>Ah, sister!</I> His subjects shall
 not lament him, nor cry out, as they used to do at the graves of their
 princes, <I>Ah, lord!</I> or <I>Ah his glory!</I> It is sad for any to
 live so that, when they die, none will be sorry to part with them. Nay,
 
 (2.) He shall lie unburied. This is worse than the former. Even those
 that have no tears to grace the funerals of the dead with would 
 willingly have them buried out of their sight; but Jehoiakim shall be 
 <I>buried with the burial of an ass,</I> that is, he shall have no 
 burial at all, but his dead body shall be cast into a ditch or upon a 
 dunghill; it shall be <I>drawn,</I> or dragged, ignominiously, and 
 <I>cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.</I> It is said, in the 
 story of Jehoiakim 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:6">2 Chron. xxxvi. 6</A>),

 that Nebuchadnezzar <I>bound him in fetters, to carry him to
 Babylon,</I> and

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+19:9">Ezek. xix. 9</A>)

 that he was <I>brought in chains to the king of Babylon.</I> But it is
 probable that he died a prisoner, before he was carried away to Babylon 
 as was intended; perhaps he died for grief, or, in the pride of his 
 heart, hastened his own end, and, for that reason, was denied a decent 
 burial, as self-murderers usually are with us. Josephus says that 
 Nebuchadnezzar slew him at Jerusalem, and left his body thus exposed, 
 somewhere at a great distance from the <I>gates of Jerusalem.</I> And it 
 is said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:6">2 Kings xxiv. 6</A>)

 <I>he slept with his fathers.</I> When he built himself a stately
 house, no doubt he designed himself a stately sepulchre; but see how he 
 was disappointed. Note, Those that are lifted up with great pride are 
 commonly reserved for some great disgrace in life or death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This prophecy seems to have been calculated for the ungracious 
 inglorious reign of Jeconiah, or Jehoiachin, the son of Jehoiakim, who 
 succeeded him in the government, reigned but three months, and was then 
 carried captive to Babylon, where he lived many years, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:31"><I>ch.</I> lii. 31</A>.

 We have, in these verses, a prophecy,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Of the desolations of the kingdom, which were now hastening on 
 apace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:20-23"><I>v.</I> 20-23</A>.

 Jerusalem and Judah are here spoken to, or the Jewish state as a single 
 person, and we have it here under a threefold character:--

 1. Very haughty in a day of peace and safety

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 "<I>I spoke unto thee in thy prosperity,</I> spoke by my servants the 
 prophets, reproofs, admonitions, counsels, <I>but thou saidst, I will 
 not hear,</I> I will not heed, <I>thou obeyedst not my voice,</I> and 
 wast resolved that thou wouldst not, and hadst the front to tell me 
 so." It is common for those that live at ease to live in contempt of 
 the word of God. <I>Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked.</I> This is so
 much the worse that they had it by kind: <I>This has been thy manner 
 from thy youth.</I> They were called <I>transgressors from the 
 womb,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:8">Isa. xlviii. 8</A>.
 
 2. Very timorous upon the alarms of trouble

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 "When thou seest <I>all thy lovers destroyed,</I> when thou findest thy 
 idols unable to help thee and thy foreign alliances failing thee, thou 
 wilt then go up to Lebanon, and cry, as one undone and giving up all 
 for lost, cry with a bitter cry; thou wilt cry, <I>Help, help, or we 
 are lost;</I> thou wilt <I>lift up thy voice</I> in fearful shrieks 
 upon <I>Lebanon and Bashan,</I> two high hills, in hope to be heard 
 thence by the advantage of the rising ground. Thou wilt <I>cry from the 
 passages,</I> from the roads, where thou wilt ever and anon be in 
 distress." Thou wilt cry from <I>Abarim</I> (so some read it, as a 
 proper name), a famous mountain in the border of Moab. "Thou wilt cry, 
 as those that are in great consternation use to do, to all about thee; 
 but in vain, for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>)

 <I>the wind shall eat up all thy pastors,</I> or <I>rulers,</I> that 
 should protect and lead thee, and provide for thy safety; they shall be 
 blasted, and withered, and brought to nothing, as buds and blossoms are 
 by a bleak or freezing wind; they shall be devoured suddenly, 
 insensibly, and irresistibly, as fruits by the wind. <I>Thy lovers,</I> 
 that thou dependest upon and hast an affection for, shall <I>go into 
 captivity,</I> and shall be so far from saving thee that they shall not 
 be able to save themselves." 

 3. Very tame under the heavy and lasting pressures of trouble: "When
 there appears no relief from any of thy confederates, and thy own 
 priests are at a loss, <I>then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for 
 all thy wickedness,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Note, Many will never be ashamed of their sins till they are brought by 
 them to the last extremity; and it is well if we get this good by our 
 straits to be brought by them to confusion for our sins. The Jewish 
 state is here called <I>an inhabitant of Lebanon,</I> because that 
 famous forest was within their border 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 and all their country was wealthy, and well-guarded as with Lebanon's 
 natural fastnesses; but so proud and haughty were they that they are 
 said to <I>make their nest in the cedars,</I> where they thought 
 themselves out of the reach of all danger, and whence they looked with 
 contempt upon all about them. "But, <I>how gracious wilt thou be when
 pangs come upon thee!</I> Then thou wilt humble thyself before God and 
 promise amendment. When thou art overthrown in stony places thou wilt 
 be glad to <I>hear those words</I> which in thy prosperity <I>thou 
 wouldst not hear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:6">Ps. cxli. 6</A>.

 Then thou wilt endeavour to make thyself acceptable with that God whom,
 before, thou madest light of." Note, Many have their pangs of piety 
 who, when the pangs are over, show that they have no true piety. Some
 give another sense of it: "What will all thy pomp, and state, and 
 wealth avail thee? What will become of it all, or what comfort shalt
 thou have of it, when thou shalt be in these distresses? No more than 
 <I>a woman in travail,</I> full of pains and fears, can take comfort in 
 her ornaments while she is in that condition." So Mr. Gataker. Note, 
 Those that are proud of their worldly advantages would do well to 
 consider how they will look when pangs come upon them, and how they 
 will then have lost all their beauty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is a prophecy of the disgrace of the king; his name was 
 <I>Jeconiah,</I> but he is here once and again called <I>Coniah,</I> in 
 contempt. The prophet shortens or nicks his name, and gives him, as we 
 say, a nickname, perhaps to denote that he should be despoiled of his 
 dignity, that his reign should be shortened, and the number of his 
 months cut off in the midst. Two instances of dishonour are here put 
 upon him:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He shall be carried away <I>into captivity</I> and shall spend and 
 end his days in bondage. He was born to a crown, but it should quickly 
 fall from his head, and he should exchange it for fetters. Observe the 
 steps of this judgment. 
 
 (1.) God will abandon him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 The God of truth says it, and confirms it with an oath: "<I>Though he 
 were the signet upon my right hand</I> (his predecessors have been so, 
 and he might have been so if he had conducted himself well, but he 
 being degenerated) <I>I will pluck him thence.</I>" The godly kings of 
 Judah had been as signets on God's right hand, near and dear to him; he 
 had gloried in them, and made use of them as instruments of his 
 government, as the prince does of his signet-ring, or sign manual; but 
 Coniah has made himself utterly unworthy of the honour, and therefore 
 the privilege of his birth shall be no security to him; notwithstanding 
 that, he shall be thrown off. Answerable to this threatening against 
 Jeconiah is God's promise to Zerubbabel, when he made him his people's 
 guide in their return out of captivity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:23">Hag. ii. 23</A>):

 <I>I will take thee, O Zerubbabel! my servant, and make thee as a
 signet.</I> Those that think themselves as signets on God's right hand 
 must not be secure, but fear lest they be plucked thence.

 (2.) The king of Babylon shall seize him. <I>Those</I> know not what 
 enemies and mischiefs they lie exposed to who have thrown themselves 
 out of God's protection,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 The Chaldeans are here said to be such as had a spite to <I>Coniah;</I> 
 they <I>sought his life;</I> no less than that, they thought, would 
 satisfy their rage; they were such as he had a dread of (they are those 
 <I>whose face thou fearest</I>) which would make it the more terrible 
 to him to fall into their hands, especially when it was God himself 
 that gave <I>him into their hands.</I> And, if God deliver him to them, 
 who can deliver him from them? 

 (3.) He and his family shall be carried to Babylon, where they shall 
 wear out many tedious years of their lives in a miserable 
 captivity--<I>he and his mother</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 <I>he and his seed</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 that is, he and all the royal family (for he had no children of his own 
 when he went into captivity), or he and the children in his loins; they 
 shall all be cast out to another country, to a strange country, <I>a 
 country where they were not born,</I> nor such a country as that where 
 they were born, <I>a land which they know not,</I> in which they have 
 no acquaintance with whom to converse or from whom to expect any 
 kindness. Thither they shall be carried, from a land where they were
 entitled to dominion, into a land where they shall be compelled to 
 servitude. But have they no hopes of seeing their own country again? 
 No: <I>To the land whereunto they desire to return, thither shall they 
 not return,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 They conducted themselves ill in it when they were in it, and therefore 
 they shall never see it more. Jehoahaz was carried to Egypt, the land
 of the south, Jeconiah to Babylon, the land of the north, both far 
 remote, the quite contrary way, and must never expect to meet again, 
 nor either of them to breathe their native air again. Those that had 
 abused the dominion they had over others were justly brought thus under 
 the dominion of others. Those that had indulged and gratified their
 sinful desires, by their oppression, luxury, and cruelty, were justly 
 denied the gratification of their innocent desire to see their own 
 native country again. We may observe something very emphatic in that 
 part of this threatening 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 <I>In the country where you were not born, there shall you die.</I> As 
 there is a <I>time to be born</I> and a <I>time to die,</I> so there is 
 a place to be born in and a place to die in. We know where we were 
 born, but where we shall die we know not; it is enough that our God 
 knows. Let it be our care that we die in Christ, and then it will be 
 well with us, wherever we die, though it should be in a far country.
 
 (4.) This shall render him very mean and despicable in the eyes of all 
 his neighbours. They shall be ready to say 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 "<I>This is Coniah a despised broken idol?</I> Yes, certainly he is, 
 and much debased from what he was." 

 [1.] Time was when he was dignified, nay, when he was almost deified. 
 The people who had seen his father lately deposed were ready to adore 
 him when they saw him upon the throne, but now <I>he is a despised 
 broken idol,</I> which, when it was whole, was worshipped, but, when it 
 is rotten and broken, is thrown by and despised, and nobody regards it, 
 or remembers what it has been. Note, What is idolized will, first or
 last, be despised and broken; what is unjustly honoured will be justly 
 contemned, and rivals with God will be the scorn of man. Whatever we 
 idolize we shall be disappointed in and then shall despise. 

 [2.] Time was when he was delighted in; but now he is <I>a vessel in 
 which is not pleasure,</I> or to which there is no desire, either 
 because grown out of fashion or because cracked or dirtied, and so 
 rendered unserviceable. Those whom God has no pleasure in will, some 
 time or other, be so mortified that men will have no pleasure in 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He shall leave no posterity to inherit his honour. The prediction of 
 this is ushered in with a solemn preface 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 <I>O earth, earth, earth! hear the word of the Lord.</I> Let all the 
 inhabitants of the world take notice of these judgments of God upon a 
 nation and a family that had been near and dear to him, and thence 
 infer that God is impartial in the administration of justice. Or it is 
 an appeal to the earth itself on which we tread, since those that dwell 
 on earth are so deaf and careless, like that 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:2">Isa. i. 2</A>),

 <I>Hear, O heavens! and give ear, O earth!</I> God's word, however
 slighted, will be heard; the earth itself will be made to hear it, and 
 yield to it, when it, and all the works that are therein, shall be 
 burnt up. Or it is a call to men that <I>mind earthly things,</I> that 
 are swallowed up in those things and are inordinate in the pursuit of 
 them; such have need to be called upon again and again, and a third 
 time, to <I>hear the word of the Lord.</I> Or it is a call to men 
 considered as mortal, of the earth, and hastening to the earth again. 
 We all are so; earth we are, <I>dust we are,</I> and, in consideration 
 of that, are concerned to hear and regard <I>the word of the Lord,</I> 
 that, though we are earth, we may be found among those whose names are 
 written in heaven. Now that which is here to be taken notice of is
 that Jeconiah is <I>written childless</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 that is, as it follows, <I>No man of his seed shall prosper, sitting 
 upon the throne of David.</I> In him the line of David was extinct as a 
 royal line. Some think that he had children born in Babylon because 
 mention is made of his seed being cast out there 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>)

 and that they died before him. We read in the genealogy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+3:17">1 Chron. iii. 17</A>)
 
 of seven sons of Jeconiah Assir (that is, Jeconiah the captive) of whom 
 Salathiel is the first. Some think that they were only his adopted 
 sons, and that when it is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:12">Matt. i. 12</A>),

 <I>Jeconiah begat Salathiel,</I> no more is meant than that he
 bequeathed to him what claims and pretensions he had to the government, 
 the rather because Salathiel is called the <I>son of Neri</I> of <I>the 
 house of Nathan,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:27,31">Luke iii. 27, 31</A>.

 Whether he had children begotten, or only adopted, thus far he was
 childless that none of his seed ruled as kings in Judah. He was the

 do good in their days cannot expect to prosper in their days.</P>
