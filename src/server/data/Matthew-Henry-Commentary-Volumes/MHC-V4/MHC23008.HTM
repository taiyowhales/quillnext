 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter, and the four next that follow it (to chap. xiii.) are all
 one continued discourse or sermon, the scope of which is to show the 
 great destruction that should now shortly be brought upon the kingdom 
 of Israel, and the great disturbance that should be given to the 
 kingdom of Judah by the king of Assyria, and that both were for their 
 sins; but rich provision is made of comfort for those that feared God 
 in those dark times, referring especially to the days of the Messiah. 
 In this chapter we have, 

 I. A prophecy of the destruction of the confederate kingdoms of Syria
 and Israel by the king of Assyria, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. Of the desolations that should be made by that proud victorious
 prince in the land of Israel and Judah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:5-8">ver. 5-8</A>.

 III. Great encouragement given to the people of God in the midst of
 those distractions; they are assured, 

 1. That the enemies shall not gain their point against them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:9,10">ver. 9, 10</A>.

 2. That if they kept up the fear of God, and kept down the fear of
 man, they should find God their refuge 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:11-14">ver. 11-14</A>),

 and while others stumbled, and fell into despair, they should be
 enabled to wait on God, and should see themselves reserved for better
 times,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:15-18">ver. 15-18</A>.

 Lastly, He gives a necessary caution to all, at their peril, not to 
 consult with familiar spirits, for they would thereby throw themselves
 into despair, but to keep close to the word of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:19-22">ver. 19-22</A>.

 And these counsels and these comforts will still be of use to us in
 time of trouble.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Moreover the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto me, Take thee a great roll, and
 write in it with a man's pen concerning Maher-shalal-hash-baz.
 &nbsp; 2  And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the
 priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.
 &nbsp; 3  And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a
 son. Then said the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> to me, Call his name 
 Maher-shalal-hash-baz.
 &nbsp; 4  For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father,
 and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria
 shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.
 &nbsp; 5  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake also unto me again, saying,
 &nbsp; 6  Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that
 go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;
 &nbsp; 7  Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the
 waters of the river, strong and many, <I>even</I> the king of Assyria,
 and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels,
 and go over all his banks:
 &nbsp; 8  And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go
 over, he shall reach <I>even</I> to the neck; and the stretching out
 of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have a prophecy of the successes of the king of
 Assyria against Damascus, Samaria, and Judah, that the two former
 should be laid waste by him, and the last greatly frightened. Here we
 have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Orders given to the prophet to write this prophecy, and publish it
 to be seen and read of all men, and to leave it upon record, that when 
 the thing came to pass they might know that God had sent him; for that 
 was one end of prophecy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:29">John xiv. 29</A>.

 He must <I>take a great roll,</I> which would contain those five
 chapters fairly written in words at length; and he must write in it all 
 that he had foretold concerning the king of Assyria's invading the 
 country; he must <I>write it with a man's pen,</I> in the usual way and 
 style of writing, so as that it might be legible and intelligible by 
 all. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:2">Hab. ii. 2</A>,

 <I>Write the vision, and make it plain.</I> Those that speak and write 
 of the things of God should avoid obscurity, and study to speak and 
 write so as to be understood,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:19">1 Cor. xiv. 19</A>.

 Those that write for men should write with a man's pen, and not covet
 the pen or tongue of angels. And forasmuch as it is usual to put some 
 short, but significant comprehensive title before books that are 
 published, the prophet is directed to call his book 
 <I>Maher-shalal-hash-baz--Make speed to the spoil, hasten to the 
 prey,</I> intimating that the Assyrian army should come upon them with 
 great speed and make great spoil. By this title the substance and 
 meaning of the book would be enquired after by those that heard of it, 
 and remembered by those that had read it or heard it read. It is 
 sometimes a good help to memory to put much matter in few words, which 
 serve as handles by which we take hold of more.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The care of the prophet to get this record well attested 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):
 
 <I>I took unto me faithful witnesses to record;</I> he wrote the 
 prophecy in their sight and presence, and made them subscribe their 
 names to it, that they might be ready, if afterwards there should be 
 occasion, to make oath of it, that the prophet had so long before 
 foretold the descent which the Assyrians made upon that country. He 
 names his witnesses for the greater certainty, that they might be 
 appealed to by any. They were two in number (for <I>out of the mouth of 
 two witnesses shall every word be established</I>); one was Uriah the 
 priest; he is mentioned in the story of Ahaz, but for none of his good 
 deeds, for he humoured Ahaz with an idolatrous altar 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:10,11">2 Kings xvi. 10, 11</A>);
 
 however, at this time, no exception lay against him, being a faithful
 witness. See what full satisfaction the prophets took care to give to 
 all persons concerned of the sincerity of their intentions, that we 
 might know with a full assurance the <I>certainty of the things wherein 
 we have been instructed,</I> and that we have <I>not followed 
 cunningly-devised fables.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The making of the title of his book the name of his child, that it 
 might be the more taken notice of and the more effectually perpetuated, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 His wife (because the wife of a prophet) is called <I>the
 prophetess;</I> she <I>conceived and bore a son,</I> another son, who 
 must carry a sermon in his name, as the former had done

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:3"><I>ch.</I> vii. 3</A>),

 but with this difference, that spoke mercy, <I>Shear-jashub--The remnant
 shall return;</I> but, that being slighted, this speaks judgment, 
 <I>Maher-shalal-hash-baz--In making speed to the spoil he shall
 hasten,</I> or <I>he has hastened, to the prey.</I> The prophecy is 
 doubled, even in this one name, for the thing was certain. <I>I will 
 hasten my word,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:12">Jer. i. 12</A>.

 Every time the child was called by his name, or any part of it, it
 would serve as a memorandum of the judgments approaching. Note, It is 
 good for us often to put ourselves in mind of the changes and troubles 
 we are liable to in this world, and which perhaps are at the door. When 
 we look with pleasure on our children it should be with the allay of 
 this thought, We know not what they are yet reserved for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The prophecy itself, which explains this mystical name.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That Syria and Israel, who were now in confederacy against Judah, 
 should in a very little time become an easy prey to the king of Assyria 
 and his victorious army 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>Before the child,</I> now newly born and named, shall have 
 <I>knowledge to cry, My father, and My mother</I>" (which are usually 
 some of the first things that children know and some of the first words 
 that children speak), that is, "in about a year or two, <I>the riches 
 of Damascus, and the spoil of Samaria,</I> those cities that are now so 
 secure themselves and so formidable to their neighbours, <I>shall be 
 taken away before the king of Assyria,</I> who shall plunder both city 
 and country, and send the best effects of both into his own land, to 
 enrich that, and as trophies of his victory." Note, Those that spoil 
 others must expect to be themselves spoiled

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:1"><I>ch.</I> xxxiii. 1</A>);

 for the Lord is righteous, and those that are troublesome shall be
 troubled.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That forasmuch as there were many in Judah that were secretly in the 
 interests of Syria and Israel, and were disaffected to the house of 
 David, God would chastise them also by the king of Assyria, who should 
 create a great deal of vexation to Judah, as was foretold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:17"><I>ch.</I> vii. 17</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 (1.) What was the sin of the discontented party in Judah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>This people,</I> whom the prophet here speaks to, <I>refuse the
 waters of Shiloah that go softly,</I> despise their own country and the 
 government of it, and love to run it down, because it does not make so 
 great a figure, and so great a noise, in the world, as some other kings 
 and kingdoms do. They refuse the comforts which God's prophets offer 
 them from the word of God, speaking to them in a still small voice, and 
 make nothing of them; but <I>they rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's 
 son,</I> who were the enemies of their country, and were now actually 
 invading it; they cried them up as brave men, magnified their policies 
 and strength, applauded their conduct, were well pleased with their 
 successes, and were hearty well-wishers to their designs, and resolved 
 to desert and go over to them. Such vipers does many a state foster in 
 its bosom, that eat its bread, and yet adhere to its enemies, and are 
 ready to quit its interests if they but seem to totter. 

 (2.) The judgment which God would bring upon them for this sin. The 
 same king of Assyria that should lay Ephraim and Syria waste should be 
 a scourge and terror to those of their party in Judah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 Because they <I>refuse the waters of Shiloah,</I> and will not
 accommodate themselves to the government God has set over them, but are 
 uneasy under it, <I>therefore the Lord brings upon them the waters of 
 the river, strong and many,</I> the river Euphrates. They slighted the
 land of Judah, because it had no river to boast of comparable to that; 
 the river at Jerusalem was a very inconsiderable one. "Well," says God, 
 "if you be such admirers of Euphrates, you shall have enough of it; the 
 king of Assyria, whose country lies upon that river, shall come with 
 his glory, with his great army, which you cry up as his glory, 
 despising your own king because he cannot bring such an army as that 
 into the field; God shall bring that army upon you." If we value men, 
 if we over-value them, for their worldly wealth and power, it is just 
 with God to make them thereby a scourge to us. It is used as an 
 argument against magnifying rich men that <I>rich men oppress us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:3,5">Jam. ii. 3, 5</A>.

 Let us be best pleased with the waters of Shiloah, that go softly, for
 rapid streams are dangerous. It is threatened that the Assyrian army 
 should break in upon them like a deluge, or inundation of waters, 
 bearing down all before it, should come up over all his channels, and 
 overflow all his banks. It would be to no purpose to oppose or 
 withstand them. Sennacherib and his army should pass through Judah, and 
 meet with so little resistance that it should look more like a march 
 through the country than a descent upon it. <I>He shall reach even to 
 the neck,</I> that is, he shall advance so far as to lay siege to 
 Jerusalem, the head of the kingdom, and nothing but that shall be kept 
 out of his hands; for that was the holy city. Note, In the greatest 
 deluge of trouble God can and will keep the head of his people above 
 water, and so preserve their comforts and spiritual lives; the waters 
 that come into their souls may reach to the neck

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:1">Ps. lxix. 1</A>),

 but there shall their proud waves be stayed. And here is another
 comfortable intimation that though the stretching out of the wings of 
 the Assyrian, that bird of prey, though the right and left wing of his 
 army, should fill the breadth of the land of Judah, yet still it was 
 Immanuel's land. It is <I>thy land, O Immanuel!</I> It was to be 
 Christ's land; for there he was to be born, and live, and preach, and 
 work miracles. He was Zion's King, and therefore had a peculiar 
 interest in and concern for that land. Note, The lands that Immanuel 
 owns for his, as he does all those lands that own him, though they may 
 be deluged, shall not be destroyed; <I>for, when the enemy shall come 
 in like a flood,</I> Immanuel shall secure his own, and shall <I>lift 
 up a standard against him,</I>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet here returns to speak of the present distress that Ahaz and 
 his court and kingdom were in upon account of the threatening 
 confederacy of the ten tribes and the Syrians against them. And in 
 these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He triumphs over the invading enemies, and, in effect, sets them at 
 defiance, and bids them do their worst 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>):

 "<I>O you people, you of far countries,</I> give ear to what the 
 prophet says to you in God's name." 

 1. "We doubt not but you will now make your utmost efforts against
 Judah and Jerusalem. You <I>associate yourselves</I> in a strict 
 alliance. You <I>gird yourselves,</I> and again you <I>gird 
 yourselves;</I> you prepare for action; you address yourselves to it 
 with resolution; you gird on your swords; you gird up your loins. You 
 animate and encourage yourselves and one another with all the 
 considerations you can think of: you <I>take counsel together,</I> call 
 councils of war, and all heads are at work about the proper methods for 
 making yourselves masters of the land of Judah. <I>You speak the
 word;</I> you come to resolutions concerning it, and are not always 
 deliberating; you determine what to do, and are very confident of the 
 success of it, that the matter will be accomplished with a word's 
 speaking." Note, It is with a great deal of policy, resolution, and 
 assurance, that the church's enemies carry on their designs against it; 
 and abundance of pains they take to roll a stone that will certainly 
 return upon them. 

 2. "This is to let you know that all your efforts will be ineffectual. 
 You cannot, you shall not, gain your point, nor carry the day: <I>You 
 shall be broken in pieces.</I> Though you associate yourselves, though 
 you gird yourselves, though you proceed with all the policy and 
 precaution imaginable, yet, I tell you again and again, all your 
 projects shall be baffled, <I>you shall be broken in pieces.</I> Nay, 
 not only shall your attempts be ruined, but your attempts shall be your 
 ruin; you shall be broken by those designs you have formed against 
 Jerusalem: <I>Your counsels shall come to nought;</I> for there is no 
 wisdom nor counsel against the Lord. Your resolves will not be put in 
 execution; they shall not stand. You speak the word, but <I>who is he 
 that saith, and it cometh to pass, if the Lord commandeth it not?</I> 
 What sets up itself against God, and his cause and counsel, cannot 
 stand, but must inevitably fall. <I>For God is with us</I>" (this 
 refers to the name of <I>Immanuel--God with us</I>); "the Messiah is to 
 be born among us, and a people designed for such an honour cannot be 
 given up to utter ruin. We have now the special presence of God with us 
 in his temple, his oracles, his promises, and these are our defence. 
 God is with us; he is on our side, to take our part and fight for us; 
 and, <I>if God be for us, who can be against us?</I>" Thus does the 
 daughter of Zion despise them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He comforts and encourages the people of God with the same comforts 
 and encouragements which he himself had received. The attempt made upon 
 them was very formidable; the house of David, the court and royal 
 family, were at their wits' end 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:2"><I>ch.</I> vii. 2</A>),

 and then no marvel if the people were in a consternation. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The prophet tells us how he was himself taught of God not to give 
 way to such amazing fears as the people were disturbed with, nor to run 
 into the same measures with them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 "<I>The Lord spoke to me with a strong hand not to walk in the way of 
 this people,</I> not to say as they say nor do as they do, not to 
 entertain the same frightful apprehensions of things nor to approve of 
 their projects of making peace upon any terms, or calling in the help 
 of the Assyrians." God instructed the prophet not to go down the 
 stream. Note, 

 (1.) There is a proneness in the best of men to be frightened at 
 threatening clouds, especially when fears are epidemic. We are all too
 apt to walk in the way of the people we live among, though it be not a 
 good way. 

 (2.) Those whom God loves and owns he will instruct and enable to swim 
 against the stream of common corruptions, particularly of common fears.
 He will find ways to teach his own people not to walk in the way of 
 other people, but in a sober singularity. 

 (3.) Corruption is sometimes so active in the hearts even of good men 
 that they have need to be taught their duty with a strong hand, and it 
 is God's prerogative to teach so, for he only can give an understanding 
 and overpower the contradiction of unbelief and prejudice. He can teach 
 the heart; and herein none teaches like him.

 (4.) Those that are to teach others have need to be themselves well 
 instructed in their duty, and then they teach most powerfully when they 
 teach experimentally. The word that comes from the heart is most likely 
 to reach to the heart; and what we are ourselves by the grace of God 
 instructed in we should, as we are able, teach others also.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Now what is it that he says to God's people?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He cautions them against a sinful fear, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 It seems it was the way of this people at this time, and fear is
 catching. He whose heart fails him makes his brethren's heart to fail, 
 like his heart 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:8">Deut. xx. 8</A>);

 therefore <I>Say you not, A confederacy, to all those to whom this
 people shall say, A confederacy;</I> that is,

 [1.] "Be not associated with them in the confederacies they are 
 projecting and forecasting for. Do not join with those that, for the 
 securing of themselves, are for making a league with the Assyrians, 
 through unbelief, and distrust of God and their cause. Do not come into 
 any such confederacy." Note, It concerns us, in time of trouble, to 
 watch against all such fears as put us upon taking any indirect courses 
 for our own security. 

 [2.] "Be not afraid of the confederacies they frighten themselves and 
 one another with. Do not distress yourselves with the apprehension of a 
 confederacy upon every thing that stirs, nor, when any little thing is 
 amiss, cry out presently, There is a plot, a plot. When they talk what 
 dismal news there is, <I>Syria is joined with Ephraim,</I> what will 
 become of us? must we fight, or must we flee, or must we yield? do not 
 you fear their fear: <I>Be not afraid of the signs of heaven,</I> as 
 the heathen are, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:2">Jer. x. 2</A>.

 Be not afraid of evil tidings on earth, but let your hearts be fixed.
 Fear not that which they fear, nor be afraid as they are. Be not put 
 into such a fright as causes trembling and shaking;" so the word 
 signifies. Note, When the church's enemies have sinful confederacies on 
 foot the church's friends should watch against the sinful fears of 
 those confederacies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He advises them to a gracious religious fear: <I>But sanctify the
 Lord of hosts himself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Note, The believing fear of God is a special preservative against the
 disquieting fear of man; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:14,15">1 Pet. iii. 14, 15</A>,

 where this is quoted, and applied to suffering Christians.

 [1.] We must look upon God as the Lord of hosts, that has all power in 
 his hand and all creatures at his beck. 

 [2.] We must sanctify him accordingly, give him the glory due to that 
 name, and behave towards him as those that believe him to be a holy 
 God. 

 [3.] We must make him our fear, the object of our fear, and make him 
 our dread, keep up a reverence of his providence and stand in awe of 
 his sovereignty, be afraid of his displeasure and silently acquiesce in 
 all his disposals. Were we but duly affected with the greatness and
 glory of God, we should see the pomp of our enemies eclipsed and 
 clouded, and all their power restrained and under check; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+4:14">Neh. iv. 14</A>.

 (3.) He assures them of a holy security and serenity of mind in so 
 doing 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 "<I>He shall be for a sanctuary;</I> make him your fear, and you shall 
 find him your hope, your help, your defence, and your mighty deliverer. 
 He will sanctify and preserve you. He will be for a sanctuary,"

 [1.] "To make you holy. He will be your sanctification;" so some read 
 it. If we sanctify God by our praises, he will sanctify us by his 
 grace. 

 [2.] "To make you easy. He will be your sanctuary," to which you may 
 flee for safety, and where you are privileged form all the arrests of 
 fear; you shall find an inviolable refuge and security in him, and see 
 yourselves our of the reach of danger. Those that truly fear God shall 
 not need to fear any evil.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He threatens the ruin of the ungodly and unbelieving, both in 
 Judah and Israel. They have no part nor lot in the foregoing comforts; 
 that God who will be a sanctuary to those who trust in him will be a 
 stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, to those who <I>leave these 
 waters of Shiloah, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son,</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),
 
 who make the creature their fear and their hope, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 The prophet foresees that the greatest part of both the houses of
 Israel would not <I>sanctify the Lord of hosts,</I> and to them he 
 would be <I>for a gin and a snare;</I> he would be a terror to them, as 
 he would be a support and stay to those that trusted in him. Instead of 
 profiting by the word of God, they should be offended at it; and the 
 providences of God, instead of leading them to him, would drive them 
 from him. What was a savour of life unto life to others would be a 
 savour of death unto death to them. "So that <I>many among them shall 
 stumble and fall;</I> they shall fall both into sin and into ruin; they 
 shall fall by the sword, shall be taken prisoners, and go into 
 captivity." Note, If the things of God be an offence to us, they will 
 be an undoing to us. Some apply this to the unbelieving Jews, who 
 rejected Christ, and to whom he became a stone of stumbling; for the 
 apostle quotes this scripture with application to all those who 
 persisted in their unbelief of the gospel of Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:8">1 Pet. ii. 8</A>);

 to them he is a rock of offence, because, being disobedient to the
 word, they stumble at it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The unspeakable privilege which the people of God enjoy in having 
 the oracles of God consigned over to them, and being entrusted with the 
 sacred writings. That they may sanctify the Lord of hosts, may make him 
 their fear and find him their sanctuary, <I>bind up the testimony,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Note, It is a great instance of God's care of his church and love to it
 that he has lodged in it the invaluable treasure of divine revelation.
 
 1. It is a <I>testimony</I> and a <I>law;</I> not only this prophecy is
 so, which must therefore be preserved safely for the comfort of God's 
 people in the approaching times of trouble and distress, but the whole 
 word of God is so; God has attested it, and he has enjoined it. As a 
 testimony it directs our faith; as a law it directs our practice; and 
 we ought both to subscribe to the truths of it and to submit to the 
 precepts of it. 

 2. This testimony and this law are bound up and sealed, for we are not 
 to add to them nor diminish from them; they are a letter from God to 
 man, folded up and sealed, a proclamation under the broad seal. The 
 binding up and sealing of the Old Testament signified that the full 
 explication of many of the prophecies of it was reserved for the 
 New-Testament times. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+12:4">Dan. xii. 4</A>,

 <I>Seal the book till the time of the end;</I> but what was then bound 
 up and sealed is now open and unsealed, and <I>revealed unto babes,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:25">Matt. xi. 25</A>.

 Yet with reference to the other world, and the future state, still the
 testimony is bound up and sealed, for we know but in part, and prophesy 
 but in part.

 3. They are lodged as a sacred deposit in the hands of the disciples
 of <I>the children of the prophets and the covenant,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:25">Acts iii. 25</A>.
 
 This is the good thing which is committed to them, and which they are
 charged with the custody of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:13,14">2 Tim. i. 13, 14</A>.

 Those that had prophets for their tutors must still keep close to the
 written word.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The good use which we ought to make of this privilege. This we are 
 taught,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. By the prophet's own practice and resolutions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.

 He embraced the law ad the testimony, and he had the comfort of them,
 in the midst of the many discouragements he met with. Note, Those 
 ministers can best recommend the word of God to others that have 
 themselves found the satisfaction of relying upon it. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The discouragements which the prophet laboured under. He specifies 
 two:--

 [1.] The frowns of God, not so much upon himself, but upon his people, 
 whose interests lay very near his heart: "He <I>hides his face from the 
 house of Jacob,</I> and seems at present to neglect them, and lay them 
 under the tokens of his displeasure." The prophet was himself employed 
 in revealing God's wrath against them, and yet grieved thus for it, as 
 one that did not desire the woeful day. If the house of Jacob forsake 
 the God of Jacob, let it not be thought strange that he hides his face 
 from them. 

 [2.] The contempt and reproaches of men, not only upon himself, but 
 upon his disciples, among whom the law and the testimony were sealed: 
 <I>I and the children whom the Lord has given me are for signs and 
 wonders;</I> we are gazed at as monsters or outlandish people, pointed 
 at as we go along the streets. Probably the prophetical names that were 
 given to his children were ridiculed and bantered by the profane 
 scoffers of the town. <I>I am as a wonder unto many,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:7">Ps. lxxi. 7</A>.
 
 God's people are the world's wonder
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+3:8">Zech. iii. 8</A>)

 for their singularity, and because they run not with them to the same
 excess of riot, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:4">1 Pet. iv. 4</A>.

 The prophet was herein a type of Christ; for this is quoted

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:13">Heb. ii. 13</A>)

 to prove that believers are Christ's children: <I>Behold, I and the 
 children whom God has given me.</I> Parents must look upon their 
 children as God's gifts, his gracious gifts; Jacob did so,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+33:5">Gen. xxxiii. 5</A>.

 Ministers must look upon their converts as their children, and be
 tender of them accordingly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:7">1 Thess. ii. 7</A>),

 and as the children whom God has given them; for, whatever good we are
 instrumental of to others, it is owing to the grace of God. Christ 
 looks upon believers as his children, whom the Father gave him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:6">John xvii. 6</A>),

 and both he and they are for signs and wonders, spoken against

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:34">Luke ii. 34</A>),

 every where spoken against,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:22">Acts xxviii. 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The encouragement he took in reference to these discouragements. 
 
 [1.] He saw the hand of God in all that which was discouraging to him, 
 and kept his eye upon that. Whatever trouble the house of Jacob is in, 
 it comes from God's hiding his face; nay, whatever contempt was put 
 upon him or his friends, it is from the Lord of hosts; he has bidden 
 Shimei curse David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:13,30:11">Job xix. 13; xxx. 11</A>.

 [2.] He saw God dwelling in Mount Zion, manifesting himself to his 
 people, and ready to hear their prayers and receive their homage. 
 Though, for the present, he hide his face from the house of Jacob, yet 
 they know where to find him and recover the sight of him; he dwells in 
 Mount Zion. 

 [3.] He therefore resolved to wait upon the Lord and to look for him; 
 to attend his motions even while he hid his face, and to expect with a 
 humble assurance his returns in a way of mercy. Those that wait upon 
 God by faith and prayer may look for him with hope and joy. When we 
 have not sensible comforts we must still keep up our observance of God 
 and obedience to him, and then wait awhile; <I>at evening time it shall 
 be light.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. By the counsel and advice which he gives to his disciples, among 
 whom the law and the testimony were sealed, to whom were committed the 
 lively oracles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He supposes they would be tempted, in the day of their distress, 
 to consult <I>those that had familiar spirits,</I> that dealt with the 
 devil, asked his advice, and desired to be informed by him concerning 
 things to come, that they might take their measures accordingly. Thus 
 Saul, when he was in straits, made his application to the witch of 
 Endor 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:7,15">1 Sam. xxviii. 7, 15</A>),
 
 and Ahaziah to the god of Ekron, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+1:2">2 Kings i. 2</A>.
 
 These conjurors had strange fantastic gestures and tones: They
 <I>peeped and muttered;</I> they muffled their heads, that they could 
 neither see nor be seen plainly, but peeped and were peeped at. Or both 
 the words here used may refer to their voice and manner of speaking; 
 they delivered what they had to say with a low, hollow, broken sound, 
 scarcely articulate, and sometimes in a puling or mournful tone, like a 
 crane, or a swallow, or a dove, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+38:14"><I>ch.</I> xxxviii. 14</A>.

 They spoke not with that boldness and plainness which the prophets of
 the Lord spoke with, but as those who desire to amuse people rather 
 than to instruct them; yet there were those who were so wretchedly 
 sottish as to seek to them and to court others to do so, even the 
 prophet's hearers, who knew better things, whom therefore the prophet 
 warns not to say, <I>A confederacy</I> with such. There were express 
 laws against this wickedness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lev+19:31,20:27">Lev. xix. 31; xx. 27</A>),

 and yet it was found in Israel, is found even in Christian nations; but
 let all that have any sense of religion show it, by startling at the 
 thought of it. <I>Get thee behind me, Satan.</I> Dread the use of
 spells and charms, and consulting those that by hidden arts pretend to 
 tell fortunes, cure diseases, or discover things lost; for this is a 
 heinous crime, and, in effect, denies the God that is above.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He furnishes them with an answer to this temptation, puts words 
 into their mouths. "If any go about thus to ensnare you, give them this 
 reply: <I>Should not a people seek to their God?</I> What! <I>for the 
 living to the dead!</I>" 

 [1.] "Tell them it is a principle of religion that a people ought to 
 seek unto their God; now Jehovah is our God, and therefore to him we 
 ought to seek, and to consult with him, and not with those that have 
 familiar spirits. <I>All people will thus walk in the name of their 
 God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+4:5">Mic. iv. 5</A>.

 Those that made the hosts of heaven their gods <I>sought unto them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:2">Jer. viii. 2</A>.

 Should not a people under guilt, and in trouble, seek to their God for
 pardon and peace? Should not a people in doubt, in want, and in danger, 
 seek to their God for direction, supply, and protection? Since the Lord 
 is our God, and we are his people, it is certainly our duty to seek 
 him."

 [2.] "Tell them it is an instance of the greatest folly in the world to 
 seek for living men to dead idols." What can be more absurd than to 
 seek to lifeless images for life and living comforts, or to expect that 
 our friends that are dead should do that for us, when we deify them and 
 pray to them, which our living friends cannot do? The <I>dead know not 
 any thing,</I> nor is there with them <I>any device or working,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:5,10">Eccl. ix. 5, 10</A>.

 It is folly therefore for the living to make their court to them, with
 any expectation of relief from them. Necromancers consulted the dead, 
 as the witch of Endor, and so proclaimed their own folly. We must live 
 by the living, and not by the dead. What life or light can we look for 
 from those that have no light or life themselves?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He directs them to consult the oracles of God. If the prophets 
 that were among them did not speak directly to every case, yet they had 
 the written word, and to that they must have recourse. Note, Those will 
 never be drawn to consult wizards that know how to make a good use of 
 their Bibles. Would we know how we may seek to our God, and come to the 
 knowledge of his mind? <I>To the law and to the testimony.</I> There 
 you will see what is good, and what the Lord requires of you. Make 
 God's statutes your counsellors, and you will be counselled aright. 
 Observe, 

 [1.] What use we must make of the law and the testimony: we must 
 <I>speak according to that word,</I> that is, we must make this our 
 standard, conform to it, take advice from it, make our appeals to it, 
 and in every thing be overruled and determined by it, consent to those 
 wholesome healing words 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:3">1 Tim. vi. 3</A>),

 and speak of the things of God in the words which the Holy Ghost
 teaches. It is not enough to say nothing against it, but we must speak 
 according to it.

 [2.] Why we must make this use of the law and the testimony: because we 
 shall be convicted of the greatest folly imaginable if we do not. Those 
 that concur not with the word of God do thereby evince that <I>there is 
 no light,</I> no morning light (so the word is) <I>in them;</I> they 
 have no right sense of things; they do not understand themselves, nor 
 the difference between good and evil, truth and falsehood. Note, Those 
 that reject divine revelation have not so much as human understanding; 
 nor do those rightly admit the oracles of reason who will not admit the 
 oracles of God. Some read it as a threatening: "If they speak not 
 according to this word, there shall be no light to them, no good, no 
 comfort or relief; but they shall be driven to darkness and despair;" 
 as it follows here, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.

 What light had Saul when he consulted the witch? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:18,20">1 Sam. xxviii. 18, 20</A>.

 Or what light can those expect that turn away from the Father of
 lights?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) He reads the doom of those that seek to familiar spirits and 
 regard not God's law and testimony; there shall not only be no light to 
 them, no comfort or prosperity, but they may expect all horror and 
 misery, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.

 [1.] The trouble they feared shall come upon them: They shall <I>pass 
 through</I> the land, or pass to and fro in the land, unfixed, 
 unsettled, and driven from place to place by the threatening power of 
 an invading enemy; they shall be <I>hardly bestead</I> whither to go 
 for the necessary supports of life, either because the country would be 
 so impoverished that there would be nothing to be had, or at least 
 themselves and their friends so impoverished that there would be 
 nothing to be had for them; so that those who used to be fed to the 
 full shall be hungry. Note, Those that go away from God go out of the 
 way of all good. 

 [2.] They shall be very uneasy to themselves, by their discontent and 
 impatience under their trouble. A good man may be in want, but then he 
 quiets himself, and strives to make himself easy; but these people 
 <I>when they shall be hungry shall fret themselves,</I> and when they 
 have nothing to feed on their vexation shall prey upon their own 
 spirits; for fretfulness is a sin that is its own punishment.

 [3.] They shall be very provoking to all about them, nay, to all above 
 them; when they find all their measures broken, and themselves at their 
 wits' end, they will forget all the rules of duty and decency, and will 
 treasonably <I>curse their king</I> and blasphemously curse <I>their 
 God,</I> and this more than <I>in their thought and in their 
 bedchamber,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:20">Eccl. x. 20</A>.

 They begin with cursing their king for managing the public affairs no
 better, as if the fault were his, when the best and wisest kings cannot 
 secure success; but, when they have broken the bonds of their 
 allegiance, no marvel if those of their religion do not hold them long: 
 they next curse their God, curse him, and die; they quarrel with his 
 providence, and reproach that, as if he had done them wrong. <I>The 
 foolishness of man perverts his way,</I> and then <I>his heart frets 
 against the Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+19:3">Prov. xix. 3</A>.

 See what need we have to <I>keep our mouth as with a bridle</I> when
 our <I>heart is hot within us;</I> for the language of fretfulness is 
 commonly very offensive.

 [4.] They shall abandon themselves to despair, and, which way soever 
 they look, shall see no probability of relief. They shall look upward,
 but heaven shall frown upon them and look gloomy; and how can it be 
 otherwise when they curse their God? They shall look to the earth, but 
 what comfort can that yield to those with whom God is at war? There is 
 nothing there but trouble, and darkness, and dimness of anguish, every 
 thing threatening, and not one pleasant gleam, not one hopeful 
 prospect; but they shall be driven to darkness by the violence of their 
 own fears, which represent every thing about them black and frightful. 
 This explains what he had said 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>,

 that there shall be no light to them. Those that shut their eyes
 against the light of God's word will justly be abandoned to darkness, 
 and left to wander endlessly, and the sparks of their own kindling will 
 do them no kindness.</P>
