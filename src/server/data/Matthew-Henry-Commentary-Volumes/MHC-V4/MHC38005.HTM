 Hitherto we have seen visions of peace only, and all the words we have 
 heard have been good words and comfortable words. But the pillar of 
 cloud and fire has a black and dark side towards the Egyptians, as well 
 as a bright and pleasant side towards Israel; so have Zechariah's 
 visions; for God's prophets are not only his ambassadors, to treat of 
 peace with the sons of peace, but heralds, to proclaim war against 
 those that delight in war, and persist in their rebellion. In this 
 chapter we have two visions, by which "the wrath of God is revealed 
 from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men." God 
 will do great and kind things for his people, which the faithful sons 
 of Zion shall rejoice in; but "let the sinners in Zion be afraid;" for, 
 
 I. God will reckon severely with those particular persons among them
 that are wicked and profane, and that hated to be reformed in these 
 times of reformation; while God is showing kindness to the body of the 
 nation, and loading that with his blessings, they and their families 
 shall, notwithstanding that, lie under the curse, which the prophet 
 sees in a flying roll, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+5:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. If the body of the nation hereafter degenerate, and wickedness 
 prevail among them, it shall be carried off and hurried away with a 
 swift destruction, under the pressing weight of divine wrath, 
 represented by a talent of lead upon the mouth of an ephah, carried 
 upon the wing I know not where,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and
 behold a flying roll.
 &nbsp; 2 And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a
 flying roll; the length thereof <I>is</I> twenty cubits, and the
 breadth thereof ten cubits.
 &nbsp; 3 Then said he unto me, This <I>is</I> the curse that goeth forth
 over the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth
 shall be cut off <I>as</I> on this side according to it; and every one
 that sweareth shall be cut off <I>as</I> on that side according to it.
 &nbsp; 4 I will bring it forth, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, and it shall
 enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that
 sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of
 his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the
 stones thereof.

 We do not find that the prophet now needed to be awakened, as he did 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:1"><I>ch.</I> iv. 1</A>.

 Being awakened then, he kept wakeful after; nay, now he needs not be so 
 much as called to look about him, for of his own accord he <I>turns and 
 lifts up his eyes.</I> This good men sometimes get by their 
 infirmities, they make them the more careful and circumspect 
 afterwards. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What it was that the prophet saw; he looked up into the air, and 
 <I>behold a flying roll.</I> A vast large scroll of parchment which had 
 been rolled up, and is therefore called a <I>roll,</I> was now unrolled 
 and expanded; this roll was flying upon the wings of the wind, carried 
 swiftly through the air in open view, as an eagle that shoots down upon 
 her prey; it was a <I>roll,</I> like Ezekiel's that was <I>written
 within and without</I> with <I>lamentations, and mourning, and woe,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+2:9,10">Ezek. ii. 9, 10</A>.

 As the command of the law is in writing, for certainty and perpetuity, 
 so is the <I>curse of the law;</I> it <I>writes bitter things</I> 
 against the sinner. "What I have written I have written and what is 
 written remains." The angel, to engage the prophet's attention, and to 
 raise in him a desire to have it explained, asks him <I>what he 
 sees?</I> And he gives him this account of it: <I>I see a flying 
 roll,</I> and as near as he can guess by his eye it is <I>twenty cubits 
 long</I> (that is, ten yards) and <I>ten cubits broad,</I> that is, 
 five yards. The scriptures of the Old Testament and the New are 
 <I>rolls,</I> in which God has <I>written to us the great things of his 
 law</I> and gospel. Christ is the Master of the rolls. They are large 
 rolls, have much in them. They are <I>flying</I> rolls; the angel that 
 had <I>the everlasting gospel to preach flew in the midst of 
 heaven,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:6">Rev. xiv. 6</A>.

 God's word <I>runs very swiftly,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:15">Ps. cxlvii. 15</A>.

 Those that would be let into the meaning of these rolls must first tell
 what they see, must go as far as they can themselves. "<I>What is 
 written in the law? how readest thou?</I> Tell me that, and then thou 
 shalt be made to <I>understand what thou readest.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How it was expounded to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+5:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 This flying roll is a <I>curse;</I> it contains a declaration of the
 righteous wrath of God against those sinners especially who by swearing 
 affront God's majesty or by stealing invade their neighbour's property.
 Let every Israelite rejoice in the blessings of his country with 
 trembling; for if he swear, if he steal, if he live in any course of 
 sin, he shall see them with his eyes, but shall not have the comfort of 
 them, for against him the curse has gone forth. <I>If I be wicked, woe
 to me</I> for all this. Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The extent of this curse; the prophet sees it flying, but which way 
 does it steer its course? It <I>goes forth over the face of the whole 
 earth,</I> not only of the land of Israel, but the <I>whole world;</I> 
 for those that have sinned against the <I>law written in their 
 hearts</I> only shall by that law be judged, though they have not the 
 book of the law. Note, All mankind are liable to the judgment of God; 
 and, wherever sinners are, any where upon the face of the whole earth, 
 the curse of God can and will find them out and seize them. Oh that we 
 could with an eye of faith see the flying roll of God's curse hanging 
 over the guilty world as a thick cloud, not only keeping off the
 sun-beams of God's favour from them, but big with thunders, lightnings, 
 and storms, ready to destroy them! How welcome then would the tidings 
 of a Saviour be, who came to <I>redeem us from the curse of the law</I> 
 by being himself <I>made a curse for us,</I> and, like the prophet, 
 <I>eating this roll!</I> The vast length and breadth of this roll 
 intimate what a multitude of curses sinners lie exposed to. God will 
 make their plagues wonderful, if <I>they turn not.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The criminals against whom particularly this curse is levelled. The 
 world is full of sin in great variety: so was the Jewish church at this 
 time. But two sorts of sinners are here specified as the objects of 
 this curse:--

 (1.) Thieves; it is <I>for every one that steals,</I> that by fraud or
 force takes that which is not his own, especially that robs God and
 converts to his own use what was devoted to God and his honour, which
 was a sin much complained of among the Jews at this time,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:8,Ne+13:10">Mal. iii. 8; Neh. xiii. 10</A>.

 Sacrilege is, without doubt, the worst kind of thievery. He also that
 <I>robs his father or mother, and saith, It is no transgression</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:24">Prov. xxviii. 24</A>),

 let him know that against him this curse is directed, for it is against 
 <I>every one that steals.</I> The letter of the eighth commandment has 
 no penalty annexed to it; but the curse here is a sanction to that 
 command. 

 (2.) Swearers. Sinners of the former class offend against the second 
 table, these against the first; for the curse meets those that break 
 either table. He that swears rashly and profanely shall not be held 
 guiltless, much less he that swears falsely 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 he imprecates the curse upon himself by his perjury, and so shall his 
 doom be; God will say <I>Amen</I> to his imprecation, and turn it upon 
 his own head. He has appealed to God's judgment, which is always
 according to truth, for the confirming of a lie, and to that judgment 
 he shall go which he has so impiously affronted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The enforcing of this curse, and the equity of it: <I>I will bring 
 it forth, saith the Lord of hosts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 He that pronounces the sentence will take care to see it executed. His
 bringing it forth denotes,

 (1.) His giving it commission. It is a righteous curse, for he is a 
 righteous God that warrants it. 

 (2.) His giving it the setting on. He brings it forth with power, and
 orders what execution it shall do; and who can put by or resist the 
 curse which a God of almighty power brings forth?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The effect of this curse; it is very dreadful, 

 (1.) Upon the sinner himself: <I>Every one that steals shall be cut 
 off,</I> not corrected, but destroyed, cut off from the land of the 
 living. The curse of God is a cutting thing, a killing thing. He shall 
 be cut off <I>as on this side</I> (cut off from this place, that is, 
 from Jerusalem), and so he that swears from <I>this side</I> (it is the 
 same word), from this place. God will not spare the sinners he finds 
 among his own people, nor shall the holy city be a protection to the 
 unholy. Or they shall be cut off <I>from hence,</I> that is, from the 
 face of the whole earth, over which the curse flies. Or he that steals 
 shall be <I>cut off on this side,</I> and he that swears <I>on that 
 side;</I> they shall all be cut off, one as well as another, and both 
 according to the curse, for the judgments of God's hand are exactly 
 agreeable with the judgments of his mouth. 

 (2.) Upon his family: <I>It shall enter into the house of the thief and 
 of him that swears.</I> God's curse comes with a warrant to break open 
 doors, and cannot be kept out by bars or locks. There where the sinner 
 is most secure, and thinks himself out of danger,--there where he 
 promises himself refreshment by food and sleep,--there, in his own 
 house, shall the curse of God seize him; nay, it shall fall not upon 
 him only, but upon all about him for his sake. <I>Cursed shall be his
 basket and his store, and cursed the fruit of his body,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:17,18">Deut. xxviii. 17, 18</A>.

 The <I>curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:33">Prov. iii. 33</A>.

 It shall not only beset his house, or he at the door, but <I>it shall 
 remain in the midst of his house,</I> and diffuse its malignant 
 influences to all the parts of it. <I>It shall dwell in his tabernacle 
 because it is none of his,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:15">Job xviii. 15</A>.

 It shall dwell where he dwells, and be his constant companion at bed
 and board, to make both miserable to him. Having got possession, it 
 shall keep it, and, unless he repent and reform, there is no way to 
 throw it out or cut off the entail of it. Nay, it shall so remain in it 
 as to <I>consume it with the timber thereof, and the stones 
 thereof,</I> which, though ever so strong, though the timber be heart 
 of oak and the stones hewn out of the rocks of adamant, yet they shall 
 not be able to stand before the curse of God. We heard the stone and 
 the timber complaining of the owner's extortion and oppression, and 
 groaning under the burden of them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:11">Hab. ii. 11</A>.

 Now here we have them delivered <I>from that bondage of corruption.</I>
 While they were in their strength and beauty they supported, sorely 
 against their will, the sinner's pride and security; but, when they are 
 consumed, their ruins will, to their satisfaction, be standing 
 monuments of God's justice and lasting witnesses of the sinner's 
 injustice. Note, Sin is the ruin of houses and families, especially the 
 sins of injury and perjury. <I>Who knows the power of God's anger,</I> 
 and the operations of his curse? Even timber and stones have been 
 consumed by them; let us therefore stand in awe and not sin.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5 Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto
 me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what <I>is</I> this that goeth
 forth.
 &nbsp; 6 And I said, What <I>is</I> it? And he said, This <I>is</I> an ephah
 that goeth forth. He said moreover, This <I>is</I> their resemblance
 through all the earth.
 &nbsp; 7 And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this
 <I>is</I> a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah.
 &nbsp; 8 And he said, This <I>is</I> wickedness. And he cast it into the
 midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth
 thereof.
 &nbsp; 9 Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there
 came out two women, and the wind <I>was</I> in their wings; for they
 had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah
 between the earth and the heaven.
 &nbsp; 10 Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do
 these bear the ephah?
 &nbsp; 11 And he said unto me, To build it a house in the land of
 Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her own
 base.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The foregoing vision was very plain and easy, but in this are things 
 <I>dark and hard to be understood;</I> and some think that the scope of 
 it is to foretel the final destruction of the Jewish church and nation 
 and the dispersion of the Jews, when, by crucifying Christ and 
 persecuting his gospel, they should have filled up the measure of their 
 iniquities; therefore it is industriously set out in obscure figures 
 and expressions, "lest the plain denunciation of the second overthrow 
 of temple and state might discourage them too much from going forward 
 in the present restoration of both." So Mr. Pemble.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet was contemplating the power and terror of the curse which 
 consumes the houses of thieves and swearers, when he was told to turn 
 and he should see greater desolations than these made by the curse of 
 God for the sin of man: <I>Lift up thy eyes now,</I> and see what is 
 here, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 <I>What is this that goeth forth?</I> Whether over the face of the 
 whole earth, as the flying roll 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+5:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 or only over Jerusalem, is not certain. But, it seems, the prophet now, 
 through either the distance or the dimness of his sight, could not well 
 tell what it was, but asked, <I>What is it?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 And the angel tells him both what it is and what it means.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He sees an <I>ephah,</I> a measure wherewith they measured corn; it 
 contained <I>ten omers</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:36">Exod. xvi. 36</A>)

 and was the tenth part of a <I>homer</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:11">Ezek. xlv. 11</A>);
 
 it is put for any measure used in commerce,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+25:14">Deut. xxv. 14</A>.

 And <I>this is their resemblance,</I> the resemblance of the Jewish
 nation <I>over all the earth,</I> wherever they are now dispersed, or
 at least it will be so when their ruin draws near. They are filling up
 the measure of their iniquity, which God has set them; and when it is
 full, as the ephah of corn, they shall be delivered into the hands of
 those to whom God has sold them for their sins; they are <I>meted</I>
 to destruction, as an ephah of corn measured to the market or to the
 mill. And some think that the mentioning of an ephah, which is used in
 buying and selling, intimates that fraud, and deceit, and extortion in
 commerce, were sins abounding much among them, as that people are known
 to be notoriously guilty of them at this day. This is a proper
 representation of them <I>through all the earth.</I> There is a measure
 set them, and they are filling it up apace. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:32,1Th+2:16">Matt. xxiii. 32; 1 Thess. ii. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He sees a <I>woman sitting in the midst of the ephah,</I> 
 representing the sinful church and nation of the Jews in their latter 
 and degenerate age, when <I>the faithful city became a harlot.</I> He 
 that weighs the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance measures 
 nations and churches as in an ephah; so exact is he in his judicial 
 dealings with them. God's people are called <I>the corn of his 
 floor,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:10">Isa. xxi. 10</A>.

 And here he puts this corn into the bushel, in order to his parting
 with it. The angel says of the woman in the <I>ephah, This is
 wickedness;</I> it is a wicked nation, else God would not have rejected 
 it thus; it is as wicked as <I>wickedness</I> itself, it is abominably 
 wicked. <I>How has the gold become dim! Israel was holiness to the 
 Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:3">Jer. ii. 3</A>);

 but now <I>this is wickedness,</I> and wickedness is nowhere so
 scandalous, so odious, and, in many instances, so outrageous, as when 
 it is found among professors of religion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He sees the woman thrust down into the ephah, and a <I>talent,</I> 
 or large weight, <I>of lead,</I> cast upon the <I>mouth</I> of it, by 
 which she is secured, and made a close prisoner in the <I>ephah,</I> 
 and utterly disabled to get out of it. This is designed to show that
 the wrath of God against impenitent sinners is, 

 1. Unavoidable, and what they cannot escape; they are bound over to it,
 concluded under sin, and shut up under the curse, as this woman in the 
 ephah; <I>he would fain flee out of his hand</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+27:22">Job xxvii. 22</A>),
 
 but he cannot. 

 2. It is insupportable, and what they cannot bear up under. Guilt is
 upon the sinner as a talent of lead, to sink him to the lowest hell. 
 When Christ said of the things of Jerusalem's peace, <I>Now they are 
 hidden from thy eyes,</I> that threw a talent of lead upon them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He sees the ephah, with the woman thus pressed to death in it, 
 carried away into some far country. 

 1. The instruments employed to do it were <I>two women,</I> who had
 <I>wings like</I> those <I>of a stork,</I> large and strong, and, to 
 make them fly the more swiftly, they had the <I>wind in their 
 wings,</I> denoting the great violence and expedition with which the 
 Romans destroyed the Jewish nation. God has not only winged messengers 
 in heaven, but he can, when he pleases, give wings to those also whom 
 he employs in this lower world; and, when he does so, he forwards them 
 with the wind in their wings; his providence carries them on with a 
 favourable gale. 

 2. They bore it up in the air, denoting the terrors which pursued the
 wicked Jews, and their being a public example of God's vengeance to the 
 world. They <I>lifted it up between the earth and the heaven,</I> as 
 unworthy of either and abandoned by both; for the Jews, when this was 
 fulfilled, <I>pleased not God and</I> were <I>contrary to all men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:15">1 Thess. ii. 15</A>.

 <I>This is wickedness,</I> and this comes of it; heaven thrust out
 wicked angels, and earth spewed out wicked Canaanites.

 3. When the prophet enquired whither they carried their prisoner whom
 they had now in execution

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>)

 he was told that they designed <I>to build it a house in the land of 
 Shinar.</I> This intimates that the punishment of the Jews should be a 
 final dispersion; they should be hurried out of their own country, 
 <I>as the chaff which the wind drives away,</I> and should be forced to 
 dwell in far countries, particularly in the country of Babylon, whither 
 many of the scattered Jews went after the destruction of their country 
 by the Romans, as they did also to other countries, especially in the 
 Levant parts, not to sojourn, as in their former captivity, for seventy 
 years, but to be nailed down for perpetuity. There the <I>ephah</I> 
 shall <I>be established, and set upon her own base.</I> This intimates, 
 
 (1.) That their calamity shall continue from generation to generation,
 and that they shall be so dispersed that they shall never unite or 
 incorporate again; they shall settle in a perpetual unsettlement, and 
 Cain's doom shall be theirs, to dwell in the land of shaking. 

 (2.) That their iniquity shall continue too, and their hearts shall be
 hardened in it. <I>Blindness</I> has <I>happened</I> unto Israel, and 
 they are settled upon the lees of their own unbelief; their wickedness 
 is established upon its <I>own basis.</I> God has given them a 
 <I>spirit of slumber</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:8">Rom. xi. 8</A>),

 <I>lest at any time they should convert, and be healed.</I></P>
