 In this chapter we have, 

 I. A sinful people studying to put a slight upon God's threatenings and
 to make them appear trivial, confiding in their privileges and 
 pre-eminences above other nations 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:2,3">ver. 2, 3</A>),

 and their power

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:13">ver. 13</A>),

 and wholly addicted to their pleasures, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:4-6">ver. 4-6</A>.

 II. A serious prophet studying to put a weight upon God's threatenings
 and to make them appear terrible, by setting forth the severity of 
 those judgments that were coming upon these sensualists 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:7">ver. 7</A>),

 God's abhorring them, and abandoning them and theirs to death 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:8-11">ver. 8-11</A>),

 and bringing utter desolation upon them, since they would not be 
 wrought upon by the methods he had taken for their conviction,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Woe to them <I>that are</I> at ease in Zion, and trust in the
 mountain of Samaria, <I>which are</I> named chief of the nations, to
 whom the house of Israel came!
 &nbsp; 2 Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath
 the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: <I>be they</I>
 better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your
 border?
 &nbsp; 3 Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of
 violence to come near;
 &nbsp; 4 That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon
 their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves
 out of the midst of the stall;
 &nbsp; 5 That chant to the sound of the viol, <I>and</I> invent to
 themselves instruments of music, like David;
 &nbsp; 6 That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the
 chief ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of
 Joseph.
 &nbsp; 7 Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go
 captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall
 be removed.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The first words of the chapter are the contents of these verses; but 
 they sound very strangely, and contrary to the sentiments of a vain 
 world: <I>Woe to those that are at ease!</I> We are ready to say, 
 <I>Happy are those that are at ease,</I> that neither feel any trouble 
 nor fear any, that lie soft and warm, and lay nothing to heart; and 
 wise we think are those that do so, that bathe themselves in the 
 delights of sense and care not how the world goes. Those are looked 
 upon as doing well for themselves that do well for their bodies and 
 make much of them; but against them this woe is denounced, and we are 
 here told what their ease is, and what the woe is.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is a description of their pride, security, and sensuality, for 
 which God would reckon with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They were vainly conceited of their own dignities, and thought those 
 would secure them from the judgments threatened and be their defence 
 against the wrath both of God and man. 

 (1.) Those that dwelt in Zion thought that was honour and protection 
 enough for them, and they might there be quiet from all fear of evil, 
 because it was a strong city, well fortified both by nature and art (we 
 read of Zion's <I>strong-holds</I> and her <I>bulwarks</I>), and 
 because it was a royal city, where were set the thrones of the house of 
 David (it was the head-city of Judah, and therefore truly great), and 
 especially because it was the holy city, where the temple was, and the 
 testimony of Israel; those that dwelt there doubted not but that God's 
 sanctuary would be a sanctuary to them and would shelter them from his 
 judgments. The <I>temple of the Lord are these,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:4">Jer. vii. 4</A>.

 They are <I>haughty because of the holy mountain,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:11">Zeph. iii. 11</A>.

 Note, Many are puffed up with pride, and rocked asleep in carnal
 security, by their church-privileges, and the place they have in Zion.

 (2.) Those that dwelt <I>in the mountain of Samaria,</I> though it was 
 not a holy hill, like that of Zion, yet they trusted in it, because it 
 was the metropolis of a potent kingdom, and perhaps, in imitation of 
 Jerusalem, was the head-quarters of its religion; and by lapse of time 
 the hill of Shemer became with them in as good repute as the hill of 
 Zion ever was. They hoped for salvation from these hills and
 mountains. 

 (3.) Both these two kingdoms valued themselves upon their relation to 
 Israel, that prince with God, which they looked upon as masking them 
 the <I>chief of the nations,</I> more ancient and honourable than any 
 of them; the <I>first-fruits of the nations</I> (so the word is), 
 dedicated to God and sanctifying the whole harvest. The <I>house of 
 Israel</I> came to them, that is, was divided into those kingdoms, of 
 which Zion and Samaria were the mother cities. Those that were at ease 
 were the princes and rulers, the great men, that were <I>chief of the 
 nations,</I> chief of those two kingdoms, and to whom, having their 
 residence in Zion and Samaria, the whole house of Israel applied for 
 judgment. Note, It is hard to be great and not to be proud. Great
 nations and great men are apt to overvalue themselves, and to overlook 
 their neighbours, because they think they a little overtop them. But, 
 for a check to their pride and security, the prophet bids them take 
 notice of those cities that were within the compass of their knowledge, 
 that had been as illustrious in their time as ever Zion or Samaria was, 
 and yet were destroyed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 "Go <I>to Calneh</I> (which was an ancient city built by Nimrod, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:10">Gen. x. 10</A>),

 and see what has become of that, it is now in ruins; so is <I>Hamath
 the great,</I> one of the chief cities of Syria. Sennacherib boasts of 
 <I>destroying the gods of Hamath.</I> Gath was likewise made desolate 
 by Hazael, and not long ago, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+12:17">2 Kings xii. 17</A>.

 Now <I>were they better than these kingdoms</I> of Judah and Israel?
 Yes, they were, and <I>their border greater than your border,</I> so 
 that they had more reason than you to be confident of their own safety; 
 yet you see what has become of them, and dare you be secure? <I>Art 
 thou better than populous No?</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+3:8">Nah. iii. 8</A>.

 Note, The examples of others' ruin forbid us to be secure.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They persisted in their wicked courses upon a presumption that they 
 should never be called to an account for them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>You put far away the evil day,</I> the day of reckoning, as a thing 
 that shall never come, or you look upon it as at such a distance that 
 it makes no impression at all upon you; you <I>put it far away,</I> and 
 think you can still put it yet further, and adjourn it <I>de die in 
 diem--from day to day,</I> and therefore you <I>cause the seat of 
 violence to draw near;</I> you venture upon all acts of injustice and 
 oppression, and have <I>fellowship with the throne of iniquity, which 
 frames mischief by a law,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+94:20">Ps. xciv. 20</A>.

 You cause that to come near, as if that would be your protection from
 these judgments which really ripens you for them." Note, 
 <I>Therefore</I> men take sin to be near them, because they take 
 judgment to be far off from them; but those deceive themselves who thus 
 mock God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They indulged themselves in all manner of sensual pleasures and 
 delights, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:4-6"><I>v.</I> 4-6</A>.

 These Israelites were perfect epicures and slaves to their appetites. 
 Their dignities (in consideration of which they ought to have been 
 examples of self-denial and mortification), they thought, would justify 
 them in their sensuality; the gains of their oppression and violence, 
 they thought, would bear the charge of it; and they put the evil day at 
 a distance, that they might give them no disturbance in it. That which 
 they are here charged with is not in itself sinful (these things might 
 be soberly and moderately used), but they placed their happiness in the 
 gratification of their carnal appetites; and though they were men in 
 office, that had business to mind, they gave themselves up to their 
 pleasures, spent their time in them, and threw away their thoughts, and 
 cares, and estates upon them. They were in these enjoyments as in their 
 element. Their hearts were upon them; they exceeded all bounds in them, 
 and this at a time when God in his providence was calling them to 
 <I>weeping and mourning,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:12,13">Isa. xxii. 12, 13</A>.

 When they were under guilt and wrath, and the judgments of God were
 ready to break in upon them, they called for <I>wine and strong 
 drink,</I> presuming that <I>to-morrow shall be as this day, and much 
 more abundant</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:12">Isa. lvi. 12</A>),

 thus walking contrary to God and setting his justice at defiance.

 (1.) They were extravagant in their furniture. Nothing would serve them 
 but <I>beds of ivory</I> to sleep upon, or to sit on at their meat, 
 when sackcloth and ashes would have become them better.

 (2.) They were lazy, and humoured themselves in the love of ease. They
 did not only lie down, but <I>stretched themselves</I> upon their 
 couches, when they should have stirred up themselves to their business; 
 they were willingly slothful, and took a pride in doing nothing; they 
 <I>abound in superfluities</I> (so the margin reads it), when many of 
 their poor brethren wanted necessaries.

 (3.) They were nice and curious in their diet, must have every thing of 
 the best and abundance of it: They ate <I>the lambs out of the 
 flock</I> (lambs by wholesale) and the <I>calves out of the midst of 
 the stall,</I> the fattest they could lay their hand on; and these 
 perhaps not out of their own flock and their own stall, but taken by 
 oppression from the poor. 

 (4.) They were merry and jovial, and diverted themselves at their 
 feasts with music and singing: They <I>chant to the sound of the 
 viol,</I> sing and play in concert, and they invent new-fashioned 
 <I>instruments of music,</I> striving herein, more than in any thing 
 else, to excel their ancestors; they set their wits on work to contrive 
 how to please their fancy. Some men never show their ingenuity but in 
 their luxury; on that they bestow all their faculty of invention and 
 contrivance. They invent <I>instruments of music, like David,</I> 
 entertain themselves with that which formerly used to be the 
 entertainment of kings only. Or it intimates their profaneness in their 
 mirth; they mimicked the temple-music, and made a jest of that, 
 because, it may be, it was old-fashioned, and they took a pride in 
 bantering it as the Babylonians did when they urged the captives to 
 sing to them the <I>songs of Zion;</I> such was Belshazzar's 
 profaneness when he drank wine in temple-bowls, and such is theirs that 
 sing vain and loose songs in psalm-tunes, on purpose to ridicule a 
 divine institution. 

 (5.) They drank to excess, and never thought they could pour down 
 enough: They <I>drank wink in bowls,</I> not in glasses, or cups (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+35:5">Jer. xxxv. 5</A>);

 they hate to be stinted, and must have large draughts, and therefore
 make use of vessels that they can steal a draught out of.

 (6.) They affected the strongest perfumes: They <I>anoint themselves
 with the chief ointments,</I> to please the smell, and to make them 
 more in love with their own bodies, and to guard against those presages 
 of putrefaction which they carry about with them while they live. No 
 ordinary ointments would serve their turn; they must have the chief, 
 such as were far-fetched and dear-bought, when cheaper would have 
 served as well.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They had no concern at all for the interests of the church of God, 
 and of the nation, that were sinking and going to decay: <I>They are 
 not grieved for the affliction of Joseph;</I> the church of God, 
 including both the kingdoms of Judah and Israel (which are called 
 <I>Joseph,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:1">Ps. lxxx. 1</A>),

 was in distress, invaded, insulted, and broken in upon. As to their own
 kingdom which they were entrusted with the government of, the affairs 
 of which they were directors of, the peace of which they were the 
 conservators of, great breaches were made upon it, upon its peace and 
 welfare; and they were so besotted that they were not aware of them, so 
 indulgent of their pleasures that they never laid them to heart, and 
 had such an aversion to the thing called business that they were in no 
 care or concern to get them repaired. It is all one to them whether the 
 nation sink or swim, so that they can but lie at ease and live in 
 pleasure. Particular persons that belonged to Joseph were in 
 affliction, and they took no cognizance of their case of the wrongs and 
 hardships they sustained and the troubles they were in, nor took any 
 care to relieve them, and right them, contrary to the temper of holy 
 Job, who, when he was in prosperity, <I>wept with him</I> that <I>was 
 in misery</I> and his <I>soul was grieved for the poor,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:25">Job xxx. 25</A>.
 
 Some think that, in calling the afflicted church <I>Joseph,</I> there
 is an allusion to the story of Pharaoh's butler, who, when he preferred 
 to give the cup again into his master's hand, <I>remembered not Joseph, 
 but forgot him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+40:21,23">Gen. xl. 21, 23</A>.

 Thus they <I>drank wine in bowls,</I> but <I>were not grieved for the
 affliction of Joseph.</I> Note, Those are commonly careless of the 
 troubles of others who are set upon their own pleasures; and it is a 
 great offence to God when his church is in affliction and we are not 
 grieved for it, nor lay it to heart.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is the doom passed upon them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go 
 captive,</I> and shall fall into all the miseries that attend captives; 
 and the <I>banquet of those</I> that <I>stretched themselves</I> upon 
 their couches <I>shall be removed.</I> Their plenty shall be taken from 
 them, and they from it, because they made it the food and fuel of their 
 lusts. 

 1. Those who lived in luxury shall lose even their liberty; and by 
 being brought into servitude shall be justly punished for the abuse of 
 their dignity and dominion. 

 2. Those who trusted in the delights and pleasures of their own land
 shall be carried away into a strange land, and so made ashamed of their 
 pride and confidence; they shall <I>go captive.</I> 

 3. Those who placed their happiness in the pleasures of sense, and set
 their hearts upon them, shall be deprived of those pleasures; their 
 banquet shall be removed, and they shall know what it is to fare hard.
 
 4. Those who <I>stretched themselves</I> shall be made to contract
 themselves, and to come into a less compass. 

 5. Those who <I>put the evil day far from them</I> shall find it nearer
 to them than it is to others; <I>those shall go captive with the 
 first</I> who flattered themselves with hopes that if trouble did come 
 they should be the last who should be seized by it. Those are ripening 
 apace for trouble themselves who lay not to heart the trouble of others 
 and of the church of God. Those who give themselves to mirth, when God 
 calls them to mourning, will find it a sin that shall not go 
 unpunished,

 wilderness.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the former part of the chapter we had these secure Israelites 
 loading themselves with pleasures, as if they could never be made merry 
 enough; here we have God loading them with punishments, as if they 
 could never be made miserable enough. And observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How strongly this burden is bound on, not to be shaken off by their 
 presumption and security; for it is bound by <I>the Lord the God of 
 hosts,</I> by his mighty, his almighty, hand, which none can resist; it 
 is bound with an oath, which puts the sentence past revocation: <I>The 
 Lord God has sworn, and he will not repent,</I> and, since he could 
 swear by no greater, he has sworn by himself. How dreadful, how 
 miserable, is the case of those whose ruin, whose eternal ruin, God 
 himself has sworn, who can execute his purpose and cannot alter it!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How heavily this burden lies! Let us see the particulars. 

 1. God will abhor and abandon them, and that implies misery enough, all
 misery: <I>I abhor the excellency of Jacob,</I> all that which they are 
 proud of, and value themselves upon, and for which they call and count 
 themselves the <I>chief of nations.</I> Their visible 
 church-membership, and the privileges of that, their temple, altar, and 
 priesthood, these were, more than any thing, the excellencies of Jacob; 
 but, when these were profaned and polluted by sin, God abhorred them; 
 he hated and despised them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:21"><I>ch.</I> v. 21</A>.

 Note, God abhors that form of godliness which hypocrites keep up, while
 they abhor the power of it. And if he abhors their temple, for the
 iniquity of that, no marvel that he hates their palaces, for the 
 injustices and oppression he finds there. Note, that creature which we 
 take such a complacency and put such a confidence in as to make it a 
 rival with God is thereby made abominable to him. He <I>hates the 
 palaces</I> of sinners, for the sake of wickedness of those that dwell 
 therein. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:33">Prov. iii. 33</A>,

 <I>The curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked.</I> And, if God 
 abhor them, immediately it follows, He will <I>deliver up the city with 
 all that is therein,</I> deliver it up into the hands of the enemy, 
 that will lay it waste, and make a prey of all its wealth. Note, Those 
 that are abhorred and abandoned of God are undone to all intents and 
 purposes.
 
 2. There shall be a great and general mortality among them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>If there remain ten men in one house,</I> that have escaped the
 sword of the enemy, yet they shall be met with another way; <I>they 
 shall</I> all <I>die</I> by famine or pestilence. In the most sickly 
 times, if there be ten in a house, one may hope that at least the 
 one-half of them will escape, according to the proportion of two in a 
 bed, <I>one taken and the other left;</I> but here not one of ten shall 
 live to bury the rest. Another instance of the greatness of the 
 mortality is 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>)

 that the nearest relations of the dead shall be forced with their own 
 hands to wind up their bodies, and bury them, for want of other hands 
 to be employed in it; that is all that the <I>next of kin,</I> to whom 
 the right of redemption belongs, can do for them, and with great 
 reluctance will they do that. It intimates that the young people shall 
 be cut off soonest; for the uncle that survives is, ordinarily, the 
 senior relation. "When the uncle comes with the sexton (or <I>him that 
 burns</I>), <I>to bring out the bones out of the house,</I> he <I>shall 
 say</I> to him that he sees next about the house, '<I>Is there any yet 
 with thee?</I> Are there any left alive?' And he shall say, 'No, this 
 is the last; now the whole family is cut off by death, and neither root 
 nor branch remains.'" But that which makes the judgment the more 
 grievous is that their hearts seem to be hardened under it. "When he 
 that is found by the sides of the house begin to enter into discourse 
 with those that are carrying off the dead, they shall say, '<I>Hold thy 
 tongue;</I> do not stand preaching to us about the hand of Providence 
 in this calamity, for <I>we may not make mention of the name of the 
 Lord;</I> God is so angry with us that there is no speaking to him; he 
 is so extreme to mark what we do amiss that we dare not so much as make 
 mention of his name." ' Thus <I>the foolishness of men perverts their 
 way,</I> and brings them into distress, and then <I>their heart frets 
 against the Lord.</I> Even then they will not take notice of his hand, 
 nor suffer those about them to do it. Perhaps it was forbidden by some 
 of the idolatrous kings to make mention of the name of <I>Jehovah,</I> 
 as by the law of Moses it was forbidden to make mention of the names of 
 the heathen-gods: "We may not do it without incurring the penalty." 
 Note, Those hearts are wretchedly hardened indeed that will not be 
 brought to make mention of God's name, and to worship him, when the 
 hand of God has gone out against them, and when, as here, sickness and 
 death are in their families. Thus those <I>heap up wrath</I> who <I>cry 
 not when God binds them.</I> 
 
 3. Their houses shall be destroyed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 God <I>will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house
 with clefts;</I> they shall both be cracked so as to lose their beauty 
 and strength, and to be hastening towards a fall. The princes' palaces 
 are not above the rebuke of divine justice, nor the poor men's cottages 
 beneath it; neither shall escape. When sin has marked them for ruin
 God will find ways to bring it about. It is by order from him that
 breaches are made.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. How justly they are thus burdened. If we understand the matter 
 aright, we shall say, <I>The Lord is righteous.</I> 

 1. The methods used for their reformation had been all fruitless and
 ineffectual

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):
 
 <I>Shall horses run upon the rock,</I> to hurl or harrow the ground 
 there? Or will <I>one plough there with oxen?</I> No, for there will be 
 no profit to countervail the pains. God has sent them his prophets, to 
 <I>break up their fallow-ground;</I> but they found them as hard and 
 inflexible as the rock, rough and rugged, and they could do no good 
 with them, nor work upon them, and therefore they shall not attempt it 
 any more. They will not be reclaimed, and therefore shall not be 
 reproved, but quite abandoned. Note, Those who will not be cultivated 
 as fields and vineyards shall be rejected as barren rocks and deserts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:7,8">Heb. vi. 7, 8</A>.

 2. They had abused their power to the wrong and oppression of many,
 whose injured cause the sovereign Judge would not only right, but 
 revenge: <I>You have turned judgment into gall,</I> which is nauseous, 
 and <I>the fruit of righteousness into hemlock,</I> which is noxious; 
 it would make one sick to see how those that were entrusted with the 
 administration of public justice bore down equity with that power which 
 they out to have defended and supported it, and so turned its own 
 artillery against itself. Note, When our services of God are soured 
 with sin his providences will justly be embittered to us. 

 3. They had set the judgments of God at defiance, and, confiding in
 their own strength, thought themselves a match for Omnipotence,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 They <I>rejoiced in a thing of nought,</I> pleased themselves with a 
 fancy that no evil should befal them, though they had no ground at all 
 for that confidence, nothing to trust to that would bear any weight. 
 They said, "<I>Have we not taken to us horns;</I> have we not arrived 
 to great dignity and dominion, have we not pushed down our enemies and 
 pushed on our victories, and this <I>by our own strength,</I> our own 
 skill and courage, our own wealth and military force? Who then need we 
 be afraid of? Who then need we make court to? Not God himself." Note, 
 Prosperity and success commonly make men secure and haughty; and those 
 that have done much think they can do any thing, any thing without God, 
 nay, any thing against him. But those who trust in their own strength 
 rejoice in <I>a thing of nought,</I> and so they will find. Probably 
 they did not say this with their lips, <I>totidem verbis--in so many 
 words,</I> but it was the language of their hearts and of their 
 actions, both which God understands.</P>

 IV. How easily and effectually this burden shall be brought upon them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 He that brings it upon them is <I>the Lord the God of hosts,</I> who 
 both may do and can do what he pleases, who has all creatures at his 
 command, and who, when he has work to do, will not be at a loss for 
 instruments to do it with; though they are the house of Israel, yet he 
 will <I>raise up against them a nation</I> which they feared not, but 
 had many a time hoped in, even the Assyrians, and this nation shall 
 <I>afflict them,</I> bring them into straits, and put them to pain, 
 from the <I>entering in of Hamath,</I> in the north, to <I>the river of 
 the wilderness,</I> the river of Egypt, Sihor or Nile, in the south.
 The whole nation has shared in the iniquity, and therefore must expect 
 to share in the calamity. Note, When men are in any way instruments of 
 affliction to us we must see God raising them up against us, for they 
 are in his hand--the rod, the sword, in his hand. The Lord has bidden 
 Shimei curse David.</P>
