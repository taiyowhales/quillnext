 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter is designed for the comfort and encouragement of those 
 that fear God and keep his commandments, even when they walk in 
 darkness and have no light. Whether it was intended primarily for the 
 support of the captives in Babylon is not certain, probably it was; but 
 comforts thus generally expressed ought not to be so confined. Whenever 
 the church of God is in distress her friends and well-wishers may 
 comfort themselves and one another with these words, 

 I. That God, who raised his church at first out of nothing, will take
 care that it shall not perish, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. That the righteousness and salvation he designs for his church are
 sure and near, very near and very sure, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:4-6">ver. 4-6</A>.

 III. That the persecutors of the church are weak and dying creatures, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:7,8">ver. 7, 8</A>.

 IV. That the same power which did wonders for the church formerly is
 now engaged and employed for her protection and deliverance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:9-11">ver. 9-11</A>.
 
 V. That God himself, the Maker of the world, had undertaken both to
 deliver his people out of their distress and to comfort them under it, 
 and sent his prophet to assure them of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:12-16">ver. 12-16</A>.

 VI. That, deplorable as the condition of the church now was
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:17-20">ver. 17-20</A>),

 to the same woeful circumstances her persecutors and oppressors should
 shortly be reduced, and worse, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:21-23">ver. 21-23</A>.

 The first three paragraphs of this chapter begin with, "Hearken unto
 me," and they are God's people that are all along called to hearken;
 for even when comforts are spoken to them sometimes they "hearken not,
 through anguish of spirit"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:9">Exod. vi. 9</A>);

 therefore they are again and again called to hearken,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:1,4,7">ver. 1, 4, 7</A>.

 The two other paragraphs of this chapter begin with "Awake, awake;" in
 the former

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:9">ver. 9</A>)

 God's people call upon him to awake and help them; in the latter,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51: ">ver. 17</A>.

 God calls upon them to awake and help themselves.</P>

 the hole of the pit <I>whence</I> ye are digged.

 you: for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.
 &nbsp; 3  For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her
 waste places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her
 desert like the garden of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; joy and gladness shall be

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe,

 1. How the people of God are here described, to whom the word of this
 consolation is sent and who are called upon to hearken to it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 
 They are such as <I>follow after righteousness,</I> such as are very
 desirous and solicitous both to be justified and to be sanctified, are 
 pressing hard after this, to have the favour of God restored to them 
 and the image of God renewed on them. These are those <I>that seek the 
 Lord,</I> for it is only in the say of righteousness that we can seek 
 him with any hope of finding him. 

 2. How they are here directed to look back to their original, and the 
 smallness of their beginning: "<I>Look unto the rock whence you were 
 hewn</I>" (the idolatrous family in Ur of the Chaldees, out of which 
 Abraham was taken, the generation of slaves which the heads and fathers 
 of their tribes were in Egypt); "look unto <I>the hole of the pit out 
 of which you were digged,</I> as clay, when God formed you into a 
 people." Note, It is good for those that are privileged by a new birth 
 to consider what they were by their first birth, how they were 
 <I>conceived in iniquity and shapen in sin.</I> That which is <I>born 
 of the flesh is flesh.</I> How hard was that rock out of which we were 
 hewn, unapt to receive impressions, and how miserable <I>the hole of 
 that pit out of which we were digged!</I> The consideration of this 
 should fill us with low thoughts of ourselves and high thoughts of 
 divine grace. Those that are now advanced would do well to remember how 
 low they began

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>Look unto Abraham your father,</I> the father of all the faithful, 
 of all that follow after the righteousness of faith as he did 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:11">Rom. iv. 11</A>),

 <I>and unto Sarah that bore you,</I> and whose daughters you all are as
 long as you do well. Think how Abraham was <I>called alone,</I> and yet 
 was <I>blessed</I> and <I>multiplied;</I> and let that encourage you to 
 depend upon the promise of God even when a sentence of death seems to 
 be upon all the means that lead to the performance of it. Particularly 
 let it encourage the captives in Babylon, though they are reduced to a 
 small number, and few of them left, to hope that yet they shall 
 increase so as to replenish their own land again." When Jacob is very 
 small, yet he is not so small as Abraham was, who yet became father of 
 many nations. "Look unto Abraham, and see what he got by trusting in 
 the promise of God, and take example by him to follow God with an 
 implicit faith."

 3. How they are here assured that their present seedness of tears
 should at length end in a harvest of joys,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 The church of God on earth, even the gospel Zion, has sometimes had her
 deserts and waste places, many parts of the church, through either 
 corruption or persecution, made like a wilderness, unfruitful to God or 
 uncomfortable to the inhabitants; but God will find out a time and way 
 to <I>comfort Zion,</I> not only by speaking comfortably to her, but by 
 acting graciously for her. God has comforts in store even for the 
 <I>waste places</I> of his church, for those parts of it that seem not 
 regarded or valued.

 (1.) He will make them fruitful, and so give them cause to rejoice; her 
 wildernesses shall put on a new face, and look pleasant as Eden, and 
 abound in all good fruits, <I>as the garden of the Lord.</I> Note, It 
 is the greatest comfort of the church to be made serviceable to the 
 glory of God, and to be as his garden in which he delights. 

 (2.) He will make them cheerful, and so give them hearts to rejoice. 
 With the <I>fruits of righteousness, joy and gladness shall be found 
 therein;</I> for the more holiness men have, and the more good they do, 
 the more gladness they have. And where there is gladness, to their 
 satisfaction, it is fit that there should be thanksgiving, to God's 
 honour; for whatever is the matter of our rejoicing ought to be the 
 matter of our thanksgiving; and the returns of God's favour ought to be 
 celebrated with the voice of melody, which will be the more melodious 
 when God gives <I>songs in the night,</I> songs in the desert.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my
 nation: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my
 judgment to rest for a light of the people.
 &nbsp; 5  My righteousness <I>is</I> near; my salvation is gone forth, and
 mine arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me,
 and on mine arm shall they trust.
 &nbsp; 6  Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth
 beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the
 earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein
 shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and
 my righteousness shall not be abolished.
 &nbsp; 7  Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in
 whose heart <I>is</I> my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither
 be ye afraid of their revilings.
 &nbsp; 8  For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm
 shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever,
 and my salvation from generation to generation.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Both these proclamations, as I may call them, end alike with an 
 assurance of the perpetuity of God's righteousness and his salvation; 
 and therefore we put them together, both being designed for the comfort 
 of God's people. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Who they are to whom this comfort belongs: "<I>My people,</I> and
 <I>my nation,</I> that I have set apart for myself, that own me and are 
 owned by me." Those are God's people and his nation who are subject to 
 him as their King and their God, pay allegiance to him, and put 
 themselves under his protection accordingly. They are a people who 
 <I>know righteousness,</I> who not only have the means of knowledge, 
 and to whom righteousness is made known, but who improve those means, 
 and are able to form a right judgment of truth and falsehood, good and 
 evil. And, as they have good heads, so they have good hearts, for they 
 have the law of God in them, written and ruling there. Those God owns 
 for his people <I>in whose hearts his law is.</I> Even those who know 
 righteousness, and have the law of God in their hearts, may yet be in 
 great distress and sorrow, and loaded with reproach and contempt; but 
 their God will comfort them with the righteousness they know and the 
 law they have in their hearts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What the comfort is that belongs to God's people. 

 1. That the gospel of Christ shall be preached and published to the
 world: <I>A law shall proceed from me,</I> an evangelical law, the law 
 of Christ, the law of faith,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:3"><I>ch.</I> ii. 3</A>.

 This law is his judgment; for it is that law of liberty by which the
 world shall be governed and judged. This shall not only go forth, but 
 shall continue and rest, it shall take firm footing and deep root in 
 the world. It shall rest, not only for the benefit of the Jews, who had 
 the first notice of it, but <I>for a light of the people</I> of other 
 nations. It is this law, this judgment, that we are required to hearken 
 and give ear to, at our peril; for how shall we escape if we neglect it 
 and turn a deaf ear to it? When a law proceeds from God, <I>he that has 
 ears to hear, let him hear.</I> 

 2. That this law and judgment shall bring with them righteousness and 
 salvation, shall open a ready way to the children of men, that they may 
 be justified and saved, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 These are called <I>God's righteousness</I> and <I>his</I> salvation,
 because of his contriving and bringing them about. The former is a 
 righteousness which he will accept for us and accept us for, and a 
 righteousness which he will work in us and graciously accept of. The
 latter is the <I>salvation of the Lord,</I> for it arises from him and 
 terminates in him. Observe, There is no salvation without 
 righteousness; and, wherever there is the <I>righteousness of God,</I> 
 there shall be his salvation. All those, and those only, that are 
 justified and sanctified shall be glorified.

 3. That this righteousness and salvation shall very shortly appear: 
 <I>My righteousness is near.</I> It is near in time; behold, all things 
 are now ready. It is near in place, not far to seek, but the word is 
 nigh us, and Christ in the word, righteousness in the word, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:8">Rom. x. 8</A>.
 
 <I>My salvation has gone forth.</I> The decree has gone forth
 concerning it; it shall as certainly be introduced as if it had gone 
 forth already, and the time for it is at hand. 

 4. That this evangelical righteousness and salvation shall not be 
 confined to the Jewish nation, but shall be extended to the Gentiles; 
 <I>My arms shall judge the people.</I> Those that will not yield to the 
 judgments of God's mouth shall be crushed by the judgments of his hand. 
 Some shall thus be judged by the gospel, for <I>for judgment Christ 
 came into this world;</I> but others, and those of <I>the isles, shall 
 wait upon him,</I> and bid his gospel, and the commands as well as the 
 comforts of it, welcome. It was a comfort to God's people, to his 
 nation, that multitudes should be added to them, and the increase of 
 their number should be the increase of their strength and beauty. It is 
 added, <I>And on my arm shall they trust,</I> that <I>arm of the 
 Lord</I> which is revealed in Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:1"><I>ch.</I> liii. 1</A>.

 Observe, God's arm shall judge the people that are impenitent, and yet
 on his arm shall others trust and be saved by it; for it is to us as we 
 make it, a savour of life or of death. 

 5. That this righteousness and salvation <I>shall be for ever,</I> and
 shall never be abolished, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 It is an everlasting righteousness that the Messiah brings in

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:24">Dan. ix. 24</A>),

 an eternal redemption that he is the author of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:9">Heb. v. 9</A>.

 As it shall spread through all the nations of the earth, so it shall
 last through all the ages of the world. We must never expect any other 
 way of salvation, any other covenant of peace or rule of righteousness, 
 than what we have in the gospel, and what we have there shall continue 
 to the end, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:20">Mt. xxviii. 20</A>.

 It is for ever; for the consequences of it shall be to eternity, and by
 this law of liberty men's everlasting state will be determined. This
 perpetuity of the gospel and the blessed things it brings in is 
 illustrated by the fading and perishing of this world and all things in 
 it. Look up to the visible heavens above, which have continued 
 hitherto, and seem likely to continue, but they shall <I>vanish like 
 smoke</I> that soon spends itself and disappears; they shall be rolled 
 like a scroll, and their lights shall fall like leaves in autumn. Look 
 down to the earth beneath; that abides too for a short <I>ever</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:4">Eccl. i. 4</A>),

 but it shall <I>wax old like a garment</I> that will be the worse for
 wearing; <I>and those that dwell therein,</I> all the inhabitants of 
 the earth, even those that seem to have the best settlement in it, 
 <I>shall die in like manner:</I> the soul shall, as to this world, 
 vanish like smoke, and the body be thrown by like a garment waxen old. 
 They shall be easily crushed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:19">Job iv. 19</A>),

 and no loss of them. But when <I>heaven and earth pass away,</I> when
 all flesh and the glory of it wither as grass, the <I>word of the Lord 
 endures for ever,</I> and <I>not one iota or tittle of that shall fall 
 to the ground.</I> Those whose happiness is bound up in Christ's 
 righteousness and salvation will have the comfort of it when time and 
 days shall be no more.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What use they are to make of this comfort. If God's righteousness 
 and salvation are near to them, then let them <I>not fear the reproach 
 of men,</I> of mortal miserable men, nor be <I>afraid of their 
 revilings</I> or spiteful taunts, theirs who bid you sing them the 
 songs of Zion, or who ask you, in scorn, <I>Where is now your God?</I> 
 Let not those who embrace the gospel righteousness be afraid of those 
 who will call them <I>Beelzebub,</I> and will say all manner of evil 
 against them falsely. Let them not be afraid of them; let them not be
 disturbed by these opprobrious speeches, nor made uneasy by them, as if 
 they would be the ruin of their reputation and honour and they must for 
 ever lie under the load of them. Let them not be afraid of their 
 executing their menaces, nor be deterred thereby from their duty, nor 
 frightened into any sinful compliances, nor driven to take any indirect 
 courses for their own safety. Those can bear but little for Christ that 
 cannot bear a hard word for him. Let us not fear the reproach of men; 
 for, 
 
 1. They will be quickly silenced
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>The moth shall eat them up like a garment,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:9"><I>ch.</I> l. 9</A>.

 <I>The worm shall eat them like wool,</I> or woollen cloth. If we have
 the approbation of a living God, we may despise the censure of dying 
 men; the matter is not great what those say of us who must shortly be 
 food for worms. Or it intimates the judgments of God with which they 
 shall be visited, with which they shall be consumed, for their malice 
 against the people of God; they shall be slowly and silently, but 
 effectually destroyed, when God shall come to reckon with them <I>for 
 all their hard speeches,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:14,15">Jude 14, 15</A>.

 2. The cause we suffer for cannot be run down. The falsehood of their
 reproaches will be detected, but truth shall triumph, and the 
 righteousness of religion's injured cause shall be for ever plain.
 Clouds darken the sun, but give no obstruction to his progress.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A prayer that God would, in his providence, appear and act for the 
 deliverance of his people and the mortification of his and their 
 enemies. <I>Awake, awake! put on strength, O arm of the Lord!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 
 The arm of the Lord is Christ, or it is put for God himself, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:23">Ps. xliv. 23</A>.

 <I>Awake! why sleepest thou?</I> He that keeps Israel neither slumbers
 nor sleeps; but, when we pray that he would awake, we mean that he 
 would make it to appear that he watches over his people and is always 
 awake to do them good. The arm of the Lord is said to awake when the 
 power of God exerts itself with more than ordinary vigour on his 
 people's behalf. When a hand or arm is benumbed we say, It is asleep; 
 when it is stretched forth for action, It awakes. God needs not to be 
 reminded nor excited by us, but he gives us leave thus to be humbly 
 earnest with him for such appearances of his power as will be for his 
 own praise. "<I>Put on strength,</I>" that is, "put forth strength: 
 appear in thy strength, as we appear in the clothes we put on,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:13">Ps. xxi. 13</A>.

 The church sees her case bad, her enemies many and mighty, her friends
 few and feeble; and therefore she depends purely upon the strength of 
 God's arm for her relief. "<I>Awake, as in the ancient days,</I>" that 
 is, "do for us now as thou didst for our fathers formerly, repeat 
 <I>the wonders they told us of,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:13">Judg. vi. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The pleas to enforce this prayer. 

 1. They plead precedents, the experiences of their ancestors, and the
 great things God had done for them. "Let the arm of the Lord be made 
 bare on our behalf; for it has done great things formerly in defence of 
 the same cause, and we are sure it is neither shortened nor weakened. 
 It did wonders against the Egyptians, who enslaved and oppressed God's 
 son, his first-born; it <I>cut Rahab</I> to pieces with one direful 
 plague after another, <I>and wounded</I> Pharaoh, <I>the dragon,</I> 
 the Leviathan (as he is called, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:13,14">Ps. lxxiv. 13, 14</A>);

 it gave him his death's wound. It did wonders for Israel. <I>It dried
 up the sea,</I> even <I>the waters of the great deep,</I> as far as was 
 requisite to open <I>a way</I> through the sea <I>for the ransomed to 
 pass over,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 God is never at a loss for a way to accomplish his purposes concerning
 his people, but will either find one or make one. Past experiences, as 
 they are great supports to faith and hope, so they are good pleas in 
 prayer. <I>Thou hast; wilt thou not?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+85:1-6">Ps. lxxxv. 1-6</A>.

 2. They plead promises

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):
 
 <I>And the redeemed of the Lord shall return,</I> that is (as it may be 
 supplied), <I>thou hast said, They shall,</I> referring to 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:10"><I>ch.</I> xxxv. 10</A>,

 where we find this promise, that <I>the redeemed of the Lord,</I> when 
 they are released out of their captivity in Babylon, <I>shall come with 
 singing unto Zion.</I> Sinners, when they are brought out of the 
 slavery of sin into the glorious liberty of God's children, may come 
 singing, as a bird got loose out of the cage. The souls of believers, 
 when they are delivered out of the prison of the body, come to the 
 heavenly Zion with singing. Then this promise will have its full 
 accomplishment, and we may plead it in the mean time. He that designs
 such joy for us at last will he not work such deliverances for us in 
 the mean time as our case requires? When the saints come to heaven they 
 <I>enter into the joy of their Lord;</I> it crowns their heads with 
 immortal honour; it fills their hearts with complete satisfaction. 
 <I>They shall obtain</I> that <I>joy and gladness</I> which they could 
 never obtain in this vale of tears. In this world of changes it is a 
 short step from joy to sorrow, but in that world <I>sorrow and mourning 
 shall flee away,</I> never to return or come in view again.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The answer immediately given to this prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>I, even, I, am he that comforteth you.</I> They prayed for the 
 operations of his power; he answers them with the consolations of his 
 grace, which may well be accepted as an equivalent. If God do not wound 
 the dragon, and dry the sea, as formerly, yet, if he comfort us in soul 
 under our afflictions, we have no reason to complain. If God do not 
 answer immediately <I>with the saving strength of his right hand,</I> 
 we must be thankful if he answer us, as an angel himself was answered 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:13">Zech. i. 13</A>),

 <I>with good words and comfortable words.</I> See how God resolves to
 comfort his people: <I>I, even I,</I> will do it. He had ordered his 
 ministers to do it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:1"><I>ch.</I> xl. 1</A>);

 but, because they cannot reach the heart, he takes the work into his
 own hands: <I>I, even I,</I> will do it. See how he glories in it; he 
 takes it among the titles of his honour to be <I>the God that comforts 
 those that are cast down;</I> he delights in being so. Those whom God 
 comforts are comforted indeed; nay, his undertaking to comfort them is 
 comfort enough to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He comforts those that were in fear; and fear has torment, which 
 calls for comfort. The fear of man has a snare in it which we have need 
 of comfort to preserve us from. He comforts the timorous by chiding 
 them, and that is no improper way of comforting either others or 
 ourselves: <I>Why art thou cast down, and why disquieted?</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.

 God, who comforts his people, would not have them disquiet themselves
 with amazing perplexing fears of the reproach of men

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),
 
 or of their growing threatening power and greatness, or of any mischief 
 they may intend against us or our people. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The absurdity of those fears. It is a disparagement to us to give 
 way to them: <I>Who art thou, that thou shouldst be afraid?</I> In the 
 original, the pronoun is feminine, <I>Who art thou, O woman!</I> 
 unworthy the name of a man? Such a weak and womanish thing it is to 
 give way to perplexing fears. 

 [1.] It is absurd to be in such dread of a dying man. What! <I>afraid 
 of a man that shall die,</I> shall certainly and shortly die, <I>of the 
 son of man who shall be made as grass,</I> shall wither and be trodden 
 down or eaten up? The greatest men, and the most formidable, that are 
 <I>the terror of the mighty in the land of the living,</I> are <I>but 
 men</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:20">Ps. ix. 20</A>)

 and shall <I>die like men</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:7">Ps. lxxxi. 7</A>),

 are but grass sprung out of the earth, cleaving to it, and retiring
 again into it. Note, We ought to look upon every man as a man that 
 shall die. Those we admire, and love, and trust to, are men that shall 
 die; let us not therefore delight too much in them nor depend too much 
 upon them. Those we fear we must look upon as frail and mortal, and 
 consider what a foolish thing it is for the servants of the living God 
 to be afraid of dying men, that are here to-day and gone tomorrow. 

 [2.] It is absurd to <I>fear continually every day</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 to put ourselves upon a constant rack, so as never to be easy, nor to 
 have any enjoyment of ourselves. Now and then a danger may be imminent 
 and threatening, and it may be prudent to fear it; but to be always in 
 a toss, jealous of dangers at every step, and to tremble at the shaking 
 of every leaf, is to make ourselves all our lifetime <I>subject to 
 bondage</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:15">Heb. ii. 15</A>),

 and to bring upon ourselves that sore judgment which is threatened,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:66,67">Deut. xxviii. 66, 67</A>.
 
 <I>Thou shalt fear, day and night.</I>

 [3.] It is absurd to fear beyond what there is cause: "Thou art 
 <I>afraid of the fury of the oppressor.</I> It is true, there is an 
 oppressor, and he is furious, and he designs, it may be, when he has an 
 opportunity, to do thee a mischief, and it will be thy wisdom therefore 
 to stand upon thy guard; but thou art afraid of him, <I>as if he were 
 ready to destroy,</I> as if he were just now going to cut thy throat, 
 and as if there were no possibility of preventing it." A timorous 
 spirit is thus apt to make the worst of every thing, and to apprehend 
 the danger greater and nearer than really it is. Sometimes God is 
 pleased at once to show us the folly of so doing: "<I>Where is the fury 
 of the oppressor?</I> It is gone in an instant, and the danger is over 
 ere thou art aware." His heart is turned, or his hands are tied.
 <I>Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise,</I> and the king of Babylon no 
 more. What has become of all the furious oppressors of God's Israel, 
 that hectored them, and threatened them, and were a terror to them?
 they passed away, and, lo, they were not; and so shall these.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The impiety of those fears: "Thou art <I>afraid of a man that 
 shall die, and forgettest the Lord thy Maker,</I> who is also the Maker 
 of all the world, who <I>has stretched forth the heavens and laid the 
 foundations of the earth,</I> and therefore has all the hosts and all 
 the powers of both at his command and disposal." Note, Our inordinate 
 fear of man is a tacit forgetfulness of God. When we disquiet ourselves 
 with the fear of man we forget that there is a God above him, and that 
 the greatest of men have no power but what is given them from above; we 
 forget the providence of God, by which he orders and overrules all 
 events according to the counsel of his own will; we forget the promises 
 he has made to protect his people, and the experiences we have had of 
 his care concerning us, and his seasonable interposition for our relief 
 many a time, when we thought the oppressor ready to destroy; we forget 
 our Jehovah-jirehs, monuments of mercy in the mount of the Lord. Did we 
 remember to make God our fear and our dread, we should not be so much 
 afraid as we are of the frowns of men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:12,13"><I>ch.</I> viii. 12, 13</A>.

 Happy is the man that fears God always, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:14,Lu+12:4,5">Prov. xxviii. 14; Luke xii. 4, 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He comforts those that were in bonds, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.
 
 See here,

 (1.) What they do for themselves: <I>The captives exile hastens that he 
 may be loosed</I> and may return to his own country, from which he is 
 banished; his care is <I>that he may not die in the pit</I> (not die a 
 prisoner, through the inconveniences of his confinement), and that 
 <I>his bread should not fail,</I> either the bread he should have to 
 keep him alive in prison or that which should bear his charges home; 
 his stock is low, and therefore he hastens to be loosed. Now some 
 understand this as his fault. He is distrustfully impatient of delays, 
 cannot wait God's time, but thinks he is undone and must die in the pit 
 if he be not released immediately. Others take it to be his praise, 
 that when the doors are thrown open he does not linger, but applies 
 himself with all diligence to procure his discharge. And then it 
 follows, <I>But I am the Lord thy God,</I> which intimates, 

 (2.) What God will do for them, even that which they cannot do for 
 themselves. God has all power in his hand to help the captive exiles;
 for he has <I>divided the sea,</I> when the roaring of its waves was 
 more frightful than any of the impotent menaces of proud oppressors. He 
 has <I>stilled</I> or <I>quieted the sea,</I> so some think it should 
 be read, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:7,89:9">Ps. lxv. 7; lxxxix. 9</A>.

 This is not only a proof of what God can do, but a resemblance of what
 he has done, and will do, for his people; he will find out a way to 
 still the threatening storm, and bring them safely into the harbour. 
 <I>The Lord of hosts is his name,</I> his name for ever, the name by 
 which his people have long known him. And, as he is able to help them, 
 so he is willing and engaged to do it; for he is <I>thy God,</I> O 
 captive-exile! thine in covenant. This is a check to the desponding 
 captives. Let them not conclude that they must either be loosed 
 immediately or die in the pit; for he that is the Lord of hosts can 
 relieve them when they are brought ever so low. It is also an 
 encouragement to the diligent captives, who, when liberty is 
 proclaimed, are willing to lose no time; let them know that the Lord is 
 their God, and, while they thus strive to help themselves, they may be 
 sure he will help them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He comforts all his people who depended upon what the prophets said 
 to them in the name of the Lord, and built their hopes upon it. When 
 the deliverances which the prophets spoke of either did not come so 
 soon as they looked for them or did not come up to the height of their 
 expectation they began to be cast down in their own eyes; but, as to 
 this, they are encouraged 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 by what God says to his prophet, not to this only, but to all his 
 prophets, nor to this, or them, principally, but to Christ, the great 
 prophet. It is a great satisfaction to those to whom the message is 
 sent to hear the God of truth and power say to his messenger, as he 
 does here, <I>I have put my words in thy mouth, that</I> by them <I>I 
 may plant the heavens.</I> God undertook to comfort his people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);
 
 but still he does it by his prophets, by his gospel; and, that he may 
 do it by these, he here tells us, 

 (1.) That his word in them is very true. He owns what they have said to 
 be what he had directed and enjoined them to say: "<I>I have put my 
 words in thy mouth,</I> and therefore he that receives thee and them 
 receives me." This is a great stay to our faith, that Christ's doctrine 
 was not his, but his that sent him, and that the words of the prophets 
 and apostles were God's own words, which he put into their mouths. 
 God's Spirit not only revealed to them the things themselves they spoke 
 of, but dictated to them the words they should speak 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:21,1Co+2:13">2 Pet. i. 21; 1 Cor. ii. 13</A>);

 so that these are the true sayings of God, of a God that cannot lie.

 (2.) That it is very safe: I have <I>covered thee in the shadow of my 
 hand</I> (as before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:2"><I>ch.</I> xlix. 2</A>),

 which speaks the special protection not only of the prophets, but of
 their prophecies, not only of Christ, but of Christianity, of the 
 gospel of Christ; it is not only the faithful word of God which the 
 prophets deliver to us, but it shall be carefully preserved till it 
 have its accomplishment for the use of the church, notwithstanding the 
 restless endeavours of the powers of darkness to extinguish this light. 
 They shall <I>prophesy again</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+10:11">Rev. x. 11</A>),

 though not in their persons, yet in their writings, which God has
 always <I>covered in the shadow of his hand,</I> preserved by a special 
 providence, else they would have been lost ere this.

 (3.) That this word, when it comes to be accomplished, will be very 
 great and will not fall short of the pomp and grandeur of the prophecy: 
 "<I>I have put my words in thy mouth,</I> not that by the performance 
 of them I may plant a nation, or found a city, but <I>that I may plant 
 the heavens and lay the foundations of the earth,</I> may do that for 
 my people which will be a new creation." This must look as far forward 
 as to the great work done by the gospel of Christ and the setting up of 
 his holy religion in the world. As God by Christ made the world at 
 first 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:2">Heb. i. 2</A>),
 
 and by him formed the Old-Testament church

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:12">Zech. vi. 12</A>),

 so by him, and the words put into his mouth, he will set up,

 [1.] A new world, will again plant the heavens and found the earth.
 Sin having put the whole creation into disorder, Christ's taking away 
 the sin of the world put all into order again. <I>Old things have
 passed away, all things have become new;</I> things in heaven and 
 things on earth are reconciled, and so put into a new posture, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:20">Col. i. 20</A>.

 Through him, according to the promise, <I>we look for new heavens and a
 new earth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:13">2 Pet. iii. 13</A>),

 and to this the prophets bear witness.

 [2.] He will set up a new church, a New-Testament church: <I>He will
 say unto Zion, Thou art my people.</I> The gospel church is called 
 <I>Zion</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:22">Heb. xii. 22</A>)
 
 and <I>Jerusalem</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:26">Gal. iv. 26</A>);

 and, when the Gentiles are brought into it, it shall be said unto them,
 <I>You are my people.</I> When God works great deliverances for his 
 church, and especially when he shall complete the salvation of it in 
 the great day, he will thereby own that poor despised handful to be his 
 people, whom he has chosen and loved.</P>

 thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street, to them
 that went over.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God, having awoke for the comfort of his people, here calls upon them 
 to awake, as afterwards, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:1"><I>ch.</I> lii. 1</A>.

 It is a call to awake not so much out of the sleep of sin (though that
 also is necessary in order to their being ready for deliverance) as out 
 of the stupor of despair. When the inhabitants of Jerusalem were in
 captivity they, as well as those who remained upon the spot, were so 
 overwhelmed with the sense of their troubles that they had no heart or 
 spirit to mind any thing that tended to their comfort or relief; they 
 were as the disciples in the garden, <I>sleeping for sorrow</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:45">Luke xxii. 45</A>),

 and therefore, when the deliverance came, they are said to have been
 <I>like those that dream,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:1">Ps. cxxxvi. 1</A>.

 Nay, it is a call to awake, not only from sleep, but from death, like
 that to the dry bones to live, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:9">Ezek. xxxvii. 9</A>.

 "Awake, and look about thee, that thou mayest see the day of thy
 deliverance dawn, and mayest be ready to bid it welcome. Recover thy
 senses; sink not under thy load, but stand up, and bestir thyself for 
 thy own help." This may be applied to the Jerusalem that was in the 
 apostle's time, which is said to have been <I>in bondage with her 
 children</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:25">Gal. iv. 25</A>),

 and to have been under the power of <I>a spirit of slumber</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:8">Rom. xi. 8</A>);

 they are called to awake, and mind the things that belonged to their
 everlasting peace, and then the cup of trembling should be taken out of 
 their hands, peace should be spoken to them, and they should triumph 
 over Satan, who had blinded their eyes and lulled them asleep. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It is owned that Jerusalem had long been in a very deplorable 
 condition, and sunk into the depths of misery.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. She had lain under the tokens of God's displeasure. He had put into 
 her hand <I>the cup of his fury,</I> that is, her share of his 
 displeasure. The dispensations of his providence concerning her had 
 been such that she had reason to think he was angry with her. She had 
 provoked him to anger most bitterly, and was made to taste the bitter 
 fruits of it. The cup of God's fury is, and will be, a <I>cup of 
 trembling</I> to all those that have it put into their hands: damned 
 sinners will find it so to eternity. It is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+75:8">Ps. lxxv. 8</A>)

 that <I>the dregs of the cup,</I> the loathsome sediments in the bottom
 of it, <I>all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink 
 them;</I> but here Jerusalem, having made herself as the wicked of the 
 earth, is compelled to wring them out and drink them; for wherever 
 there has been a cup of fornication, as there had been in Jerusalem's 
 hand when she was idolatrous, sooner or later there will be a cup of 
 fury, a cup of trembling. Therefore <I>stand in awe and sin 
 not.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Those that should have helped her in her distress failed her, and 
 were either unable or unwilling to help her, as might have been 
 expected, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 She is intoxicated with the cup of God's fury, and, being so, staggers,
 and is very unsteady in her counsels and attempts. She knows not what
 she says or does, much less knows she what to say or do; and, in this 
 unhappy condition, <I>of all the sons that she has brought forth</I> 
 and brought up, that she was borne and educated (and there were many 
 famous ones, for of Zion it was said <I>that this and that man were 
 born there,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+87:5">Ps. lxxxvii. 5</A>),

 <I>there is none to guide her,</I> none to take her by the hand to keep
 her either from falling or from shaming herself, to lend either a hand 
 to help her out of her trouble or a tongue to comfort her under it. 
 Think it not strange if wise and good men are disappointed in their 
 children, and have not that succour from them which they expected, but 
 those that were arrows in their hand prove arrows in their heart, when 
 Jerusalem herself has none of all her sons, prince, priest, nor 
 prophet, that has such a sense either of duty or gratitude as to help 
 her when she has most need of help. Thus they complain, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:9">Ps. lxxiv. 9</A>.

 There is <I>none to tell us how long.</I> Now that which aggravated
 this disappointment was,

 (1.) That her trouble was very great, and yet there was none to pity or 
 help her: <I>These two things have come unto thee</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 to complete thy desolation and destruction, even <I>the famine and the 
 sword,</I> two sore judgments, and very terrible. Or the two things 
 were the <I>desolation and destruction</I> by which the city was wasted 
 and the famine and sword by which the citizens perished. Or the two 
 things were the trouble itself (made up of desolation, destruction, 
 famine, and sword) and her being helpless, forlorn, and comfortless, 
 under it. "Two sad things indeed, to be in this woeful case, and to 
 have none to pity thee, to sympathize with thee in thy griefs, or to 
 help to bear the burden of thy cares, to have none to comfort thee, by 
 suggesting that to thee which might help to alleviate thy grief or 
 doing that for thee which might help to redress thy grievances." Or 
 these two things that had come upon Jerusalem are the same with the two 
 things that were afterwards to come upon Babylon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:9"><I>ch.</I> xlvii. 9</A>),

 <I>loss of children and widowhood</I>--piteous case, and yet, "when
 thou hast brought it upon thyself by thy own sin and folly, <I>who 
 shall be sorry for thee?</I>--a case that calls for comfort, and yet, 
 when thou art froward under thy trouble, frettest, and makest thyself 
 uneasy, <I>by whom shall I comfort thee?</I>" Those that will not be 
 counselled cannot be helped.

 (2.) That those who should have been her comforters were their own 
 tormentors

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>They have fainted,</I> as quite dispirited and driven to despair; 
 they have no patience in which to keep possession of their own souls 
 and the enjoyment of themselves, nor any confidence in God's promise, 
 by which to keep possession of the comfort of that. They throw
 themselves upon the ground, in vexation at their troubles, and there 
 <I>they lie at the head of all the streets,</I> complaining to all that 
 pass by

 pining away for want of necessary food; there they lie like <I>a wild
 bull in a net,</I> fretting and raging, struggling and pulling, to help 
 themselves, but entangling themselves so much the more, and making 
 their condition the worse by their own passions and discontents. Those 
 that are of a meek and quiet spirit are, under affliction, like a dove 
 in a net, mourning indeed, but silent and patient. Those that are of a 
 froward peevish spirit are like a wild bull in a net, uneasy to 
 themselves, vexatious to their friends, and provoking to their God: 
 <I>They are full of the fury of the Lord, the rebuke of our God.</I> 
 God is angry with them, and contends with them, and they are full of 
 that only, and take no notice of his wise and gracious designs in 
 afflicting them, never enquire wherefore he contends with them, and 
 therefore nothing appears in them but anger at God and quarrelling with 
 him. They are displeased at God for the dispensations of his providence 
 concerning them, and so they do but make bad worse. This had long been 
 Jerusalem's woeful case, and God took cognizance of it. But,</P>

 II. It is promised that Jerusalem's troubles shall at length come to an 
 end, and be transferred to her persecutors 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>Nevertheless hear this, thou afflicted.</I> It is often the lot of 
 God's church to be afflicted, and God has always something to say to 
 her then which she will do well to hearken to. "Thou art <I>drunken, 
 not</I> as formerly <I>with wine,</I> not with the intoxicating cup of 
 Babylon's whoredoms and idolatries, but with the cup of affliction. 
 Know then, for thy comfort," 

 1. "That the Lord Jehovah is thy Lord and thy God, for all this." It
 is expressed emphatically

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 "<I>Thus saith thy Lord, the Lord, and thy God</I>--the Lord, who is 
 able to help thee, and has wherewithal to relieve thee,--<I>thy</I> 
 Lord, who has an incontestable right to thee, and will not alienate 
 it,--thy God, in covenant with thee, and who has undertaken to make 
 thee happy." Whatever the distresses of God's people may be, he will 
 not disown his relation to them, nor have they lost their interest in 
 him and in his promise. 

 2. "That he is the God <I>who pleads the cause of his people,</I> as
 their patron and protector, who takes what is done against them a done 
 against himself." The cause of God's people, and of that holy religion 
 which they profess, is a righteous cause, otherwise the righteous God 
 would not appear for it; yet it may for a time be run down, and seem as 
 if it were lost. But God will plead it, either by convincing the 
 consciences or confounding the mischievous projects of those that fight 
 against it. He will plead it by clearing up the equity and excellency 
 of it to the world and by giving success to those that act in defence 
 of it. It is his own cause; he has espoused it, and therefore will 
 plead it with jealousy. 

 3. That they should shortly take leave of their troubles and bid a
 final farewell to them: "<I>I will take out of thy hand the cup of 
 trembling,</I> that bitter cup; it shall pass from thee." Throwing away 
 the cup of trembling will not do, nor saying, "We will not, we cannot, 
 drink it;" but, if we patiently submit, he that put it into out hands 
 will himself take it out of our hands. Nay, it is promised, "<I>Thou 
 shalt no more drink it again.</I> God has let fall his controversy with 
 thee, and will not revive the judgment." 

 4. That their persecutors and oppressors should be made to drink of the 
 same bitter cup of which they had drunk so deeply, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.
 
 See here,

 (1.) How insolently they had abused and trampled upon the people of 
 God: <I>They have said to thy soul,</I> to thee, to thy life, <I>Bow 
 down, that we may go over.</I> Nay, they have said it to thy 
 conscience, taking a pride and pleasure in forcing thee to worship 
 idols. Herein the New-Testament Babylon treads in the steps of that old 
 oppressor, tyrannizing over men's consciences, giving law to them, 
 putting them upon the rack, and compelling them to sinful compliances.
 Those that set up an infallible head and judge, requiring an implicit 
 faith in his dictates and obedience to his commands, do in effect say 
 to men's souls, <I>Bow down, that we may go over,</I> and they say it 
 with delight. 

 (2.) How meanly the people of God (having by their sin lost much of 
 their courage and sense of honour) truckled to them: <I>Thou hast laid 
 thy body as the ground.</I> Observe, The oppressors required souls to 
 be subjected to them, that every man should believe and worship just as 
 they would have them. But all they could gain by their threats and 
 violence was that people laid their bodies on the ground; they brought 
 them to an external and hypocritical conformity, but conscience cannot 
 be forced, nor is it mentioned to their praise that they yielded thus 
 far. But observe, 

 (3.) How justly God will reckon with those who have carried it so 
 imperiously towards his people: <I>The cup of trembling shall be put 
 into their hand.</I> Babylon's case shall be as bad as ever Jerusalem's 
 was. Daniel's persecutors shall be thrown into Daniel's den; let them 
 see how they like it. And the Lord is known by these judgments which he 
 executes.</P>
