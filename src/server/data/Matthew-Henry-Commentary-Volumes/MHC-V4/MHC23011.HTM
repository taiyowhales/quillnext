 It is a very good transition in prophecy (whether it be so in rhetoric
 or no), and a very common one, to pass from the prediction of the
 temporal deliverances of the church to that of the great salvation,
 which in the fulness of time should be wrought out by Jesus Christ, of
 which the other were types and figures, to which all the prophets bore
 witness; and so the ancient Jews understood them. For what else was it
 that raised so great an expectation of the Messiah at the time he came.
 Upon occasion of the prophecy of the deliverance of Jerusalem from
 Sennacherib, here comes in a prophecy concerning Messiah the Prince.

 I. His rise out of the house of David,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. His qualifications for his great undertaking,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:2,3">ver. 2, 3</A>.

 III. The justice and equity of his government, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>.

 IV. The peaceableness of his kingdom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:6-9">ver. 6-9</A>.

 V. The accession of the Gentiles to it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:10">ver. 10</A>),

 and with them the remnant of the Jews, that should be united with them
 in the Messiah's kingdom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:11-16">ver. 11-16</A>)

 and of all this God would now shortly give them a type, and some dark 
 representation, in the excellent government of Hezekiah, the great 
 peace which the nation should enjoy under him, after the ruin of 
 Sennacherib's design, and the return of many of the ten tribes out of 
 their dispersion to their brethren of the land of Judah, when they 
 enjoyed that great tranquility.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse,
 and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:
 &nbsp; 2  And the spirit of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall rest upon him, the spirit of
 wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the
 spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>;
 &nbsp; 3  And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither
 reprove after the hearing of his ears:
 &nbsp; 4  But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove
 with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the
 earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips
 shall he slay the wicked.
 &nbsp; 5  And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and
 faithfulness the girdle of his reins.
 &nbsp; 6  The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard
 shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and
 the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.
 &nbsp; 7  And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall
 lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
 &nbsp; 8  And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and
 the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den.
 &nbsp; 9  They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for
 the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, as the
 waters cover the sea.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet had before, in this sermon, spoken of a child that should 
 be born, a son that should be given, on whose shoulders the government 
 should be, intending this for the comfort of the people of God in times 
 of trouble, as dying Jacob, many ages before, had intended the prospect 
 of Shiloh for the comfort of his seed in their affliction in Egypt. He 
 had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:27"><I>ch.</I> x. 27</A>)

 that <I>the yoke should be destroyed because of the anointing;</I> now
 here he tells us on whom that anointing should rest. He foretels,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That the Messiah should, in due time, arise out of the house of 
 David, as that <I>branch</I> of the Lord which he had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+4:2"><I>ch.</I> iv. 2</A>)
 
 should be excellent and glorious; the word is <I>Netzer,</I> which some
 think is referred to in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:23">Matt. ii. 23</A>,

 where it is said to be spoken by the prophets of the Messiah that he
 <I>should be called a Nazarene.</I> Observe here,

 1. Whence this branch should arise-from <I>Jesse.</I> He should be the
 son of David, with whom the covenant of royalty was made, and to whom 
 it was promised with an oath that <I>of the fruit of his loins God 
 would raise of Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:30">Acts ii. 30</A>.

 David is often called <I>the son of Jesse,</I> and Christ is called so,
 because he was to be not only the Son of David, but David himself,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+3:5">Hos. iii. 5</A>.

 2. The meanness of his appearance.

 (1.) He is called a <I>rod,</I> and a <I>branch;</I> both the words
 here used signify a weak, small, tender product, a <I>twig</I> and a 
 <I>sprig</I> (so some render them), such as is easily broken off. The 
 enemies of God's church were just before compared to strong and stately 
 boughs

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:33"><I>ch.</I> x. 33</A>),

 which will not, without great labour, be hewn down, but Christ to a
 tender branch

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:2"><I>ch.</I> liii. 2</A>);

 yet he shall be victorious over them. 

 (2.) He is said to come out of Jesse rather than David, because Jesse
 lived and died in meanness and obscurity; his family was of small 
 account

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:18">1 Sam. xviii. 18</A>),

 and it was in a way of contempt and reproach that David was sometimes
 called the <I>son of Jesse,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+22:7">1 Sam. xxii. 7</A>.

 (3.) He comes forth out of the <I>stem,</I> or <I>stump,</I> of Jesse.
 When the royal family, that had been as a cedar, was cut down, and only 
 the stump of it left, almost levelled with the ground and lost in the 
 grass of the field

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:15">Dan. iv. 15</A>),
 
 yet it shall sprout again

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+14:7">Job xiv. 7</A>);

 nay, it <I>shall grow out of his roots,</I> which are quite buried in
 the earth, and, like the roots of flowers in the winter, have no stem 
 appearing above ground. The house of David was reduced and brought
 very low at the time of Christ's birth, witness the obscurity and 
 poverty of Joseph and Mary. The Messiah was thus to begin his estate
 of humiliation, for submitting to which he should be highly exalted, 
 and would thus give early notice that his kingdom was not of this 
 world. The Chaldee paraphrase reads this, <I>There shall come forth a
 King from the sons of Jesse, and the Messiah</I> (or Christ) <I>shall 
 be anointed out of his sons' sons.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That he should be every way qualified for that great work to which 
 he was designed, that this tender branch should be so watered with the 
 dews of heaven as to become a strong rod for a sceptre to rule, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 1. In general, <I>the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him.</I> The 
 Holy Spirit, in all his gifts and graces, shall not only come, but rest 
 and abide upon him; he shall have the Spirit not by measure, but 
 without measure, the fulness of the Godhead dwelling in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:19,2:9">Col. i. 19; ii. 9</A>.
 
 He began his preaching with this

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:18">Luke iv. 18</A>),

 <I>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me.</I> 

 2. In particular, the spirit of government, by which he should be every
 way fitted for that judgment which the Father has committed to him and 
 <I>given him authority to execute</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:22,27">John v. 22, 27</A>),

 and not only so, but should be made the fountain and treasury of all
 grace to believers, that from his fulness they might all receive the 
 Spirit of grace, as all the members of the body derive animal spirits 
 from the head.

 (1.) He shall have <I>the spirit of wisdom and understanding, of
 counsel and knowledge;</I> he shall thoroughly understand the business 
 he is to be employed in. <I>No man knows the Father but the Son,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:27">Matt. xi. 27</A>.

 What he is to make known to the children of men concerning God, and his
 mind and will, he shall be himself acquainted with and apprised of, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:18">John i. 18</A>.

 He shall know how to administer the affairs of his spiritual kingdom in
 all the branches of it, so as effectually to answer the two great 
 intentions of it, the glory of God and the welfare of the children of 
 men. The terms of the covenant shall be settled by him, and ordinances 
 instituted, in wisdom: treasures of wisdom shall be hid in him; he 
 shall be our counsellor, and shall be made of God to us wisdom.

 (2.) <I>The spirit of courage,</I> or <I>might,</I> or fortitude. The
 undertaking was very great, abundance of difficulty must be broken 
 through, and therefore it was necessary that he should be so endowed 
 that he <I>might not fail or be discouraged,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:4"><I>ch.</I> xlii. 4</A>.

 He was famed for courage in his teaching the way of God in truth, and
 not caring for any man, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:16">Matt. xxii. 16</A>.

 (3.) The spirit of religion, or <I>the fear of the Lord;</I> not only
 he shall himself have a reverent affection for his Father, as his
 servant

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:1"><I>ch.</I> xlii. 1</A>),

 and he was heard in <I>that he feared</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:7">Heb. v. 7</A>),

 but he shall have a zeal for religion, and shall design the advancement
 of it in his whole undertaking. Our faith in Christ was never designed
 to supersede and jostle out, but to increase and support, our fear of
 the Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That he should be accurate, and critical, and very exact in the 
 administration of his government and the exercise of the power 
 committed to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 The Spirit wherewith he shall be clothed <I>shall make him of quick
 understanding in the fear of the Lord</I>--of an acute smell or scent
 (so the word is), for the apprehensions of the mind are often expressed
 by the sensations of the body. Note, 

 1. Those are most truly and valuably intelligent that are so in the
 fear of the Lord, in the business of religion, for that is both the 
 foundation and top-stone of wisdom. 

 2. By this it will appear that we have the Spirit of God, if we have
 spiritual senses exercised, and are of <I>quick understanding in the 
 fear of the lord.</I> Those have divine illumination that know their 
 duty and know how to go about it.

 3. <I>Therefore</I> Jesus Christ had the spirit without measure, that
 he might perfectly understand his undertaking; and he did so, as 
 appears not only in the admirable answers he gave to all that 
 questioned with him, which proved him to be of <I>quick understanding 
 in the fear of the Lord,</I> but in the management of his whole 
 undertaking. He has settled the great affair of religion so 
 unexpectedly well (so as effectually to secure both God's honour and 
 man's happiness) that, it must be owned, he thoroughly understood 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That he should be just and righteous in all the acts of his 
 government, and there should appear in it as much equity as wisdom. He 
 shall judge as he expresses it himself, and as he himself would be 
 judged of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:24">John vii. 24</A>.
 
 1. Not according to outward appearance
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):
 
 <I>he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes,</I> with respect of
 persons 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:19">Job xxxiv. 19</A>)

 and according to outward shows and appearances, not <I>reprove after
 the hearing of his ears,</I> by common fame and report, and the 
 representations of others, as men commonly do; nor does he judge of men 
 by the fair words they speak, <I>calling him, Lord, Lord,</I> or their 
 plausible actions before the eye of the world, which they do to be seen 
 of men; but he will judge by the hidden man of the heart, and the 
 inward principles men are governed by, of which he is an infallible 
 witness. Christ will judge the secrets of men

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:16">Rom. ii. 16</A>),

 will determine concerning them, not according to their own pretensions
 and appearances (that were to <I>judge after the sight of the 
 eyes</I>), not according to the opinion others have of them (that were 
 to judge after the hearing of the ears), but we are sure that <I>his 
 judgment is according to truth.</I> 
 
 2. He will judge righteous judgment

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins.</I> He shall be
 righteous in the administration of his government, and his 
 righteousness shall be his girdle; it shall constantly compass him and 
 cleave to him, shall be his ornament and honour; he shall gird himself 
 for every action, shall gird on his sword for war in righteousness; his 
 righteousness shall be his strength, and shall make him expeditious in 
 his undertakings, as a man with his loins girt. In conformity to 
 Christ, his followers must have the girdle of truth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:14">Eph. vi. 14</A>)

 and it will be the stability of the times. Particularly,

 (1.) He shall in righteousness plead for the people that are poor and
 oppressed; he will be their protector

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>With righteousness shall he judge the poor;</I> he shall judge in
 favour and defence of those that have right on their side, though they 
 are poor in the world, and because they are poor in spirit. It is the 
 duty of princes to defend and deliver the poor

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:3,4">Ps. lxxxii. 3, 4</A>),

 and the honour of Christ that he is the poor man's King, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:2,4">Ps. lxxii. 2, 4</A>.
 
 He shall <I>debate with evenness for the meek of the earth,</I> or of
 the land; those that bear the injuries done them with meekness and 
 patience are in a special manner entitled to the divine care and 
 protection. <I>I, as a deaf man, heard not, for thou wilt hear,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+38:13,14">Ps. xxxviii. 13, 14</A>.

 Some read it, <I>He shall reprove or correct the meek of the earth with
 equity.</I> If his own people, the meek of the land, do amiss, he will 
 <I>visit their transgression with the rod.</I>

 (2.) He shall in righteousness plead against his enemies that are proud
 and oppressors

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>But he shall smite the earth,</I> the man of the earth, that doth
 oppress (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:18">Ps. x. 18</A>),

 the men of the world, that <I>mind earthly things</I> only

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:14">Ps. xvii. 14</A>);

 these he shall smite <I>with the rod of his mouth,</I> the word of his
 mouth, speaking terror and ruin to them; his threatenings shall take 
 hold of them, and be executed upon them. <I>With the breath of his 
 lips,</I> by the operation of his Spirit, according to his word, and 
 working with and by it, <I>he shall slay the wicked.</I> He will do it 
 easily, with a word's speaking, as he laid those flat who came to seize 
 him, by saying <I>I am he,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:6">John xviii. 6</A>.

 Killing terrors shall arrest their consciences, killing judgments shall
 ruin them, their power, and all their interests; and in the other world 
 everlasting tribulation will be recompensed to those that trouble his 
 poor people. The apostle applies this to the destruction of the man of 
 sin, whom he calls <I>that wicked one</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:8">2 Thess. ii. 8</A>)

 <I>whom the Lord will consume with the spirit of his mouth.</I> And the
 Chaldee here reads it, <I>He shall slay that wicked Romulus,</I> or 
 Rome, as Mr. Hugh Broughton understands it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. That there should be great peace and tranquillity under his 
 government; this is an explication of what was said in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:6"><I>ch.</I> ix. 6</A>,

 that he should be the Prince of peace. Peace signifies two things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Unity or concord, which is intimated in these figurative promises, 
 that even <I>the wolf shall dwell</I> peaceably <I>with the lamb;</I> 
 men of the most fierce and furious dispositions, who used to bite and 
 devour all about them, shall have their temper so strangely altered by 
 the efficacy of the gospel and grace of Christ that they shall live in 
 love even with the weakest and such as formerly they would have made an 
 easy prey of. So far shall the sheep be from hurting one another, as 
 sometimes they have done 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:20,21">Ezek. xxxiv. 20, 21</A>),

 that even the wolves shall agree with them. Christ, who is our peace,
 came to slay all enmities and to settle lasting friendships among his 
 followers, particularly between Jews and Gentiles: when multitudes of 
 both, being converted to the faith of Christ, united in one sheep-fold, 
 then the wolf and the lamb dwelt together; the wolf did not so much as 
 threaten the lamb, nor was the lamb afraid of the wolf. <I>The leopard 
 shall</I> not only not tear the kid, but shall <I>lie down with 
 her:</I> even <I>their young ones shall lie down together,</I> and 
 shall be trained up in a blessed amity, in order to the perpetuating of 
 it. <I>The lion</I> shall cease to be ravenous and <I>shall eat straw 
 like the ox,</I> as some think all the beasts of prey did before the 
 fall. <I>The asp</I> and <I>the cockatrice</I> shall cease to be 
 venomous, so that parents shall let their children <I>play</I> with 
 them and <I>put their hands</I> among them. A generation of vipers 
 shall become a seed of saints, and the old complaint of <I>homo homini 
 lupus--man is a wolf to man,</I> shall be at an end. Those that inhabit 
 the holy mountain shall live as amicably as the creatures did that were 
 with Noah in the ark, and it shall be a means of their preservation, 
 for <I>they shall not hurt nor destroy</I> one another as they have 
 done. Now,

 (1.) This is fulfilled in the wonderful effect of the gospel upon the
 minds of those that sincerely embrace it; it changes the nature, and 
 makes those that trampled on the meek of the earth, not only meek like 
 them, but affectionate towards them. When Paul, who had persecuted the 
 saints, joined himself to them, then the <I>wolf dwelt with the 
 lamb.</I>

 (2.) Some are willing to hope it shall yet have a further
 accomplishment in the latter days, when <I>swords shall be beaten into 
 ploughshares.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Safety or security. Christ, the great Shepherd, shall take such care 
 of the flock that those who would hurt them shall not; they shall not 
 only not destroy one another, but no enemy from without shall be 
 permitted to give them any molestation. The property of troubles, and 
 of death itself, shall be so altered that they shall not do any real 
 hurt to, much less shall they be the destruction of, any that <I>have 
 their conversation in the holy mountain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:13">1 Pet. iii. 13</A>.

 <I>Who,</I> or what, <I>can harm us, if we be followers of him that is
 good?</I> God's people shall be delivered, not only from evil, but from 
 the fear of it. Even <I>the sucking child</I> shall without any terror
 <I>play upon the hole of the asp;</I> blessed Paul does so when he 
 says, <I>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?</I> and, <I>O 
 death! where is thy sting?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Lastly, Observe what shall be the effect, and what the cause, of this 
 wonderful softening and sweetening of men's tempers by the grace of 
 God. 

 1. The effect of it shall be tractableness, and a willingness to
 receive instruction: <I>A little child shall lead those</I> who 
 formerly scorned to be controlled by the strongest man. Calvin 
 understands it of their willing submission to the ministers of Christ, 
 who are to instruct with meekness and not to use any coercive power, 
 but to be as <I>little children,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:3">Matt. xviii. 3</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:5">2 Cor. viii. 5</A>.

 2. The cause of it shall be the knowledge of God. The more there is of
 that the more there is of a disposition to peace. They shall thus live 
 in love, <I>for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the 
 Lord,</I> which shall extinguish men's heats and animosities. The 
 better acquainted we are with the God of love the more shall we be 
 changed into the same image and the better affected shall we be to all 
 those that bear his image. The earth shall be as full of this knowledge 
 as the channels of the sea are of water--so broad and extensive shall 
 this knowledge be and so far shall it spread--so deep and substantial 
 shall this knowledge be, and so long shall it last. There is much more 
 of the knowledge of God to be got by the gospel of Christ than could be 
 got by the law of Moses; and, whereas <I>then</I> in <I>Judah</I> only 
 was God known, now <I>all shall know him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:11">Heb. viii. 11</A>.

 But that is knowledge falsely so called which sows discord among men;
 the right knowledge of God settles peace.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall
 stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek:
 and his rest shall be glorious.
 &nbsp; 11  And it shall come to pass in that day, <I>that</I> the Lord shall
 set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his
 people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and
 from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and
 from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.
 &nbsp; 12  And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall
 assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the
 dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.
 &nbsp; 13  The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries
 of Judah shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and
 Judah shall not vex Ephraim.
 &nbsp; 14  But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines
 toward the west; they shall spoil them of the east together: they
 shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of
 Ammon shall obey them.
 &nbsp; 15  And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall utterly destroy the tongue of the
 Egyptian sea; and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand
 over the river, and shall smite it in the seven streams, and make
 <I>men</I> go over dry-shod.
 &nbsp; 16  And there shall be a highway for the remnant of his people,
 which shall be left, from Assyria; like as it was to Israel in
 the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a further prophecy of the enlargement and advancement of 
 the kingdom of the Messiah, under the type and figure of the 
 flourishing condition of the kingdom of Judah in the latter end of 
 Hezekiah's reign, after the defeat of Sennacherib.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. This prediction was in part accomplished when the great things God 
 did for Hezekiah and his people proved as an ensign, inviting the 
 neighbouring nations to them <I>to enquire of the wonders done in the 
 land,</I> on which errand the king of Babylon's ambassadors came. To 
 them the Gentiles sought; and Jerusalem, the rest or habitation of the 
 Jews, was then glorious, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Then many of the Israelites who belonged to the kingdom of the ten 
 tribes, who upon the destruction of that kingdom by the king of Assyria 
 were forced to flee for shelter into all the countries about and to 
 some that lay very remote, even to the islands of the sea, were 
 encouraged to return to their own country and put themselves under the 
 protection and government of the king of Judah, the rather because it 
 was an Assyrian army by which their country had been ruined and that 
 was not routed. This is said to be a recovery of them <I>the second 
 time</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 such an instance of the power and goodness of God, and such a reviving
 to them, as their first deliverance out of Egypt was. Then the 
 <I>outcasts of Israel</I> should be gathered in, and brought home, and 
 those of Judah too, who, upon the approach of the Assyrian army, 
 shifted for their own safety. Then the old feud between Ephraim and
 Judah shall be forgotten, and they shall join against the Philistines 
 and their other common enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 Note, Those who have been sharers with each other in afflictions and 
 mercies, dangers and deliverances, ought in consideration thereof to 
 unite for their joint and mutual safety and protection; and it is 
 likely to be well with the church when Ephraim and Judah are one 
 against the Philistines. Then, whatever difficulties there may be in 
 the way of the return of the dispersed, the Lord shall find out some 
 way or other to remove them, as when he brought Israel out of Egypt he 
 dried up the Red Sea and Jordan

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 and led them to Canaan through the invincible embarrassments of a vast
 howling wilderness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 The like will he do this second time, or that which shall be 
 equivalent. When God's time has come for the deliverance of his people 
 mountains of opposition shall become plain before him. Let us not 
 despair therefore when the interests of the church seem to be brought 
 very low; God can soon turn gloomy days into glorious ones.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It had a further reference to the days of the Messiah and the
 accession of the Gentiles to his kingdom; for to these the apostle
 applies 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>,
 
 of which the following verses are a continuation.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:12">Rom. xv. 12</A>,

 <I>There shall be a root of Jesse; and he that shall rise to reign over 
 the Gentiles, in him shall the Gentiles trust.</I> That is a key to
 this prophecy, which speaks of Christ as the root of Jesse, or <I>a 
 branch out of his roots</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),
 
 <I>a root out of a dry ground,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:2"><I>ch.</I> liii. 2</A>.

 He is the <I>root of David</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:5">Rev. v. 5</A>),

 the <I>root and offspring of David</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:16">Rev. xxii. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>He shall stand,</I> or be set up, <I>for an ensign of the 
 people.</I> When he was crucified he was <I>lifted up from the 
 earth,</I> that, as an ensign of beacon, he might <I>draw</I> the eyes 
 and the hearts of <I>all men unto him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:32">John xii. 32</A>.

 He is set up as an ensign in the preaching of the everlasting gospel,
 in which the ministers, as standard-bearers, display the banner of his 
 love, to allure us to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:4">Cant. i. 4</A>),

 the banner of his truth, under which we may enlist ourselves, to engage
 in a holy war against sin and Satan. Christ is the ensign to which
 <I>the children of God that were scattered abroad are gathered 
 together</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:51">John xi. 51</A>),

 and in him they meet as the centre of their unity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>To him shall the Gentiles seek.</I> We read of Greeks that did so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:21">John xii. 21</A>,

 <I>We would see Jesus</I>), and upon that occasion Christ spoke of his
 being lifted up, to draw all men to him. The apostle, from the LXX. (or 
 perhaps the LXX. from the apostle, in the editions after Christ) reads 
 it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:12">Rom. xv. 12</A>),

 <I>In him shall the Gentiles trust;</I> they shall seek to him with a
 dependence on him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. <I>His rest shall be glorious.</I> Some understand this of the death 
 of Christ (the triumphs of the cross made even that glorious), others 
 of his ascension, when he sat down to rest at the right hand of God. Or 
 rather it is meant of the gospel church, that Mount Zion of which 
 Christ has said, <I>This is my rest,</I> and in which he resides. This, 
 though despised by the world, having upon it the beauty of holiness, is 
 truly glorious, a <I>glorious high throne,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:12">Jer. xvii. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Both Jews and Gentiles shall be gathered to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 A remnant of both, a little remnant in comparison, which shall be 
 recovered, as it were, with great difficulty and hazard. As formerly 
 God delivered his people, and gathered them out of all the countries 
 whither they were scattered

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:47,Jer+16:15,16">Ps. cvi. 47; Jer. xvi. 15, 16</A>),

 so he will a second time, in another way, by the powerful working of
 the Spirit of grace with the word. He <I>shall set his hand</I> to do 
 it; he shall exert his power, the <I>arm of the Lord shall be 
 revealed</I> to do it.

 (1.) There shall be a remnant of the Jews gathered in: <I>The outcasts
 of Israel and the dispersed of Judah</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 many of whom, at the time of the bringing of them in to Christ, were
 <I>Jews of the dispersion, the twelve tribes that were scattered 
 abroad</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:1,1Pe+1:1">James i. 1; 1 Pet. i. 1</A>),
 
 shall flock to Christ; and probably more of those scattered Jews were
 brought into the church, in proportion, than of those which remained in 
 their own land. 

 (2.) Many of <I>the nations,</I> the Gentiles, shall be brought in by
 the lifting up of the ensign. Jacob foretold concerning Shiloh that 
 <I>to him should the gathering of the people be.</I> Those that were 
 strangers and foreigners shall be made nigh. The Jews were jealous of 
 Christ's going to the dispersed among the Gentiles and of his 
 <I>teaching the Gentiles,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:35">John vii. 35</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. There shall be a happy accommodation between Judah and Ephraim, and 
 both shall be safe from their adversaries and have dominion over them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 The coalescence between Judah and Israel at that time was a type and 
 figure of the uniting of Jews and Gentiles, who had been so long at 
 variance in the gospel church. <I>The house of Judah shall walk with 
 the house of Israel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:18">Jer. iii. 18</A>)
 
 and become <I>one nation</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:22">Ezek. xxxvii. 22</A>);

 so the Jews and Gentiles are made of <I>twain one new man</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:15">Eph. ii. 15</A>),

 and, being at peace one with another, those that are adversaries to
 them both shall be cut off; for <I>they shall fly upon the shoulders of 
 the Philistines,</I> as an eagle strikes at her prey, shall spoil those 
 on the west side of them, and then they shall extend their conquests 
 eastward over the Edomites, Moabites, and Ammonites. The gospel of 
 Christ shall be successful in all parts, and some of all nations shall 
 become obedient to the faith.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. Every thing that might hinder the progress and success of the gospel 
 shall be taken out of the way. As when God brought Israel out of Egypt 
 he dried up the Red Sea and Jordan before them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:11,12"><I>ch.</I> lxiii. 11, 12</A>),

 and as afterwards when he brought up the Jews out of Babylon he
 <I>prepared them their way</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:10"><I>ch.</I> lxii. 10</A>),

 so when Jews and Gentiles are to be brought together into the gospel
 church all obstructions shall be removed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>),

 difficulties that seemed insuperable shall be strangely got over,
 <I>the blind shall be led by a way that they knew not.</I> See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:15,16,43:19,20"><I>ch.</I> xlii. 15, 16; xliii. 19, 20</A>.

 Converts shall be brought in chariots and in litters,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:20"><I>ch.</I> lxvi. 20</A>.

 Some think it is the further accession of multitudes to the church that
 is pointed at in that obscure prophecy of the drying up of the river 
 Euphrates, that the way of the kings of the east may be prepared 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:12">Rev. xvi. 12</A>),

 which seems to refer to this prophecy. Note, When God's time has come
 for the bringing of nations, or particular persons, home to himself, 
 divine grace will be victorious over all opposition. At the presence
 of the Lord the sea shall flee and Jordan be driven back; and those who 
 set their faces heavenward will find there are not such difficulties in 
 the way as they thought there were, for there is a highway thither,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:8"><I>ch.</I> xxxv. 8</A>.</P>
