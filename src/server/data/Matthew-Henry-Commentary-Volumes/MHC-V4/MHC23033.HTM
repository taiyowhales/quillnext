 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter relates to the same events as the foregoing chapter, the 
 distress of Judah and Jerusalem by Sennacherib's invasion and their 
 deliverance out of that distress by the destruction of the Assyrian 
 army. These are intermixed in the prophecy, in the way of a Pindaric. 
 Observe, 

 I. The great distress that Judah and Jerusalem should then be brought
 into, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:7-9">ver. 7-9</A>.

 II. The particular frights which the sinners in Zion should then be in, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:13,14">ver. 13, 14</A>.

 III. The prayers of good people to God in this distress, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:2">ver. 2</A>.

 IV. The holy security which they should enjoy in the midst of this
 trouble, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:15,16">ver. 15, 16</A>.

 V. The destruction of the army of the Assyrians 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>),

 in which God would be greatly glorified,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:5,10-12">ver. 5, 10-12</A>.

 VI. The enriching of the Jews with the spoil of the Assyrian camp,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:4,23,24">ver. 4, 23, 24</A>.

 VII. The happy settlement of Jerusalem, and the Jewish state, upon
 this. Religion shall be uppermost
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:6">ver. 6</A>),

 and their civil state shall flourish,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:17-22">ver. 17-22</A>.

 This was soon fulfilled, but is written for our learning.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou <I>wast</I> not spoiled; and
 dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with
 thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled;
 <I>and</I> when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they
 shall deal treacherously with thee.
 &nbsp; 2  O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou
 their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of
 trouble.
 &nbsp; 3  At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up
 of thyself the nations were scattered.
 &nbsp; 4  And your spoil shall be gathered <I>like</I> the gathering of the
 caterpillar: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run
 upon them.
 &nbsp; 5  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled
 Zion with judgment and righteousness.
 &nbsp; 6  And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times,
 <I>and</I> strength of salvation: the fear of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> his
 treasure.
 &nbsp; 7  Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors
 of peace shall weep bitterly.
 &nbsp; 8  The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath
 broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no
 man.
 &nbsp; 9  The earth mourneth <I>and</I> languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed
 <I>and</I> hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and
 Carmel shake off <I>their fruits.</I>
 &nbsp; 10  Now will I rise, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; now will I be exalted; now
 will I lift up myself.
 &nbsp; 11  Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your
 breath, <I>as</I> fire, shall devour you.
 &nbsp; 12  And the people shall be <I>as</I> the burnings of lime: <I>as</I>
 thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The proud and false Assyrian justly reckoned with for all his fraud 
 and violence, and laid under a woe, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. The sin which the enemy had been guilty of. He had spoiled the 
 people of God, and made a prey of them, and herein had broken his 
 treaty of peace with them, and dealt treacherously. Truth and mercy are 
 two such sacred things, and have so much of God in them, that those 
 cannot but be under the wrath of God that make conscience of neither, 
 but are perfectly lost to both, that care not what mischief they do, 
 what spoil they make, what dissimulations they are guilty of, nor what 
 solemn engagements they violate, to compass their own wicked designs. 
 Bloody and deceitful men are the worst of men. 

 2. The aggravation of this sin. He spoiled those that had never done 
 him any injury and that he had no pretence to quarrel with, and dealt 
 treacherously with those that had always dealt faithfully with him. 
 Note, The less provocation we have from men to do a wrong thing the 
 more provocation we give to God by doing it. 

 3. The punishment he should fall under for this sin. He that spoiled
 the cities of Judah shall have his own army destroyed by an angel and 
 his camp plundered by those whom he had made a prey of. The Chaldeans
 shall deal treacherously with the Assyrians and revolt from them. Two 
 of Sennacherib's own sons shall deal treacherously with him and basely 
 murder him at his devotions. Note, The righteous God often pays sinners 
 in their own coin. <I>He that leads into captivity shall go into 
 captivity,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:10,18:6">Rev. xiii. 10; xviii. 6</A>.

 4. The time when he shall be thus dealt with. When he shall <I>make an 
 end to spoil, and to deal treacherously,</I> not by repentance and 
 reformation, which might prevent his ruin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:27">Dan. iv. 27</A>),

 but when he shall have done his worst, when he shall have gone as far
 as God would permit him to go, to the utmost of his tether, then the 
 cup of trembling shall be put into his hand. When he shall have arrived 
 at his full stature in impiety, shall have filled up the measure of his 
 iniquity, then all shall be called over again. When he has done God 
 will begin, for his day is coming.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The praying people of God earnest at the throne of grace for mercy 
 for the land now in its distress 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>O Lord! be merciful to us.</I> Men are cruel; be thou gracious. We 
 have deserved thy wrath, but we entreat thy favour; and, if we may find 
 the propitious to us, we are happy; the trouble we are in cannot hurt 
 us, shall not ruin us. It is in vain to expect relief from creatures; 
 we have no confidence in the Egyptians, but <I>we have waited for 
 thee</I> only, resolving to submit to thee, whatever the issue of the 
 trouble be, and hoping that it shall be a comfortable issue." Those 
 that by faith humbly wait for God shall certainly find him gracious to 
 them. They prayed, 

 1. For those that were employed in military services for them: "<I>Be 
 thou their arm every morning.</I> Hezekiah, and his princes, and all 
 the men of war, need continual supplies of strength and courage from 
 thee; supply their need therefore, and be to them a God all-sufficient. 
 Every morning, when they go forth upon the business of the day, and 
 perhaps have new work to do and new difficulties to encounter, let them 
 be afresh animated and invigorated, and, <I>as the day, so let the 
 strength be.</I>" In our spiritual warfare our own hands are not 
 sufficient for us, nor can we bring any thing to pass unless God not 
 only strengthen our arms 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:24">Gen. xlix. 24</A>),

 but be himself our arm; so entirely do we depend upon him as our arm
 every morning, so constantly do we depend upon his power, as well as 
 his compassions, which are new every morning, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:23">Lam. iii. 23</A>.

 If God leaves us to ourselves any morning, we are undone; we must
 therefore every morning commit ourselves to him, and go forth in his 
 strength to do the work of the day in its day.

 2. For the body of the people: "<I>Be thou our salvation also in the
 time of trouble,</I> ours who sit still, and do not venture into the 
 high places of the field." They depend upon God not only as their 
 Saviour, to work deliverance for them, but as their salvation itself; 
 for, whatever becomes of their secular interests, they will reckon 
 themselves safe and saved if they have him for their God. If he 
 undertake to be their Saviour, he will be their salvation; for <I>as 
 for God his work is perfect.</I> Some read it thus: "<I>Thou who wast 
 their arm every morning,</I> who wast the continual strength and help 
 of our fathers before us, <I>be thou our salvation also in time of 
 trouble.</I> Help us as thou helpedst them; <I>they looked unto thee 
 and were lightened</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:5">Ps. xxxiv. 5</A>);

 let us then not walk in darkness."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The Assyrian army ruined and their camp made a rich but cheap and 
 easy prey to Judah and Jerusalem. No sooner is the prayer made 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)
 
 than it is answered 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 nay, it is outdone. They prayed that God would save them from their 
 enemies; but he did more than that; he gave them victory over their 
 enemies and abundant cause to triumph; for, 

 1. The strength of the Assyrian camp was broken

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 when the destroying angel slew so many thousands of them: <I>At the 
 noise of the tumult,</I> of the shrieks of the dying men (who, we may 
 suppose, did not die silently), the rest of <I>the people fled,</I> and 
 shifted every one for his own safety. When God did thus lift up himself 
 the several nations, or clans, of which the army was composed, were 
 scattered. It was time to stir when such an unprecedented plague broke 
 out among them. When God arises his enemies are scattered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:1">Ps. lxviii. 1</A>.

 2. The spoil of the Assyrian camp is seized, by way of reprisal, for
 all the desolations of the defenced cities of Judah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Your spoil shall be gathered</I> by the inhabitants of Jerusalem, 
 <I>like the gathering of the caterpillar,</I> and <I>as the running to 
 and fro of locusts,</I> that is, the spoilers shall as easily and as 
 quickly make themselves masters of the riches of the Assyrians as a 
 host of caterpillars, or locusts, make a field, or a tree, bare. Thus 
 <I>the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just</I> and Israel is 
 enriched with the spoil of the Egyptians. Some make the Assyrians to be 
 the caterpillars and locusts, which, when they are killed, are gathered 
 together in heaps, as the frogs of Egypt, and are run upon, and trodden 
 to dirt.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. God and his Israel glorified and exalted hereby. When the spoil of 
 the enemy is thus gathered, 

 1. God will have the praise of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):
 
 <I>The Lord is exalted.</I> It is his honour thus to abase proud men, 
 and hide them in the dust, together; thus he magnifies his own name, 
 and his people give him the glory of it, as Israel when the Egyptians 
 were drowned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:1,2">Exod. xv. 1, 2</A>,

 &c. He is exalted as one that dwells on high, out of the reach of their
 blasphemies, and that has an over-ruling power over them, and wherein 
 they deal proudly delights to show himself above them-that does what he 
 will, and they cannot resist him. 

 2. His people will have the blessing of it. When God lifts up himself 
 to scatter the nations that are in confederacy against Jerusalem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 then, as a preparative for that, or as the fruit and product of it, 
 <I>he has filled Zion with judgment and righteousness,</I> not only 
 with a sense of justice, but with a zeal for it and a universal care 
 that it be duly administered. It shall again be called, <I>The city of 
 righteousness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:26"><I>ch.</I> i. 26</A>.

 In this the grace of God is exalted, as much as his providence was in
 the destruction of the Assyrian army. We may conclude God has mercy in 
 store for a people when he fills them with judgment and righteousness, 
 when all sorts of people, and all their actions and affairs, are 
 governed by them, and they are so full of them that no other 
 considerations can crowd in to sway them against these. Hezekiah and 
 his people are encouraged 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 with an assurance that God would stand by them in their distress. Here 
 is, 

 (1.) A gracious promise of God for them to stay themselves upon: 
 <I>Wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, and 
 strength of salvation.</I> Here is a desirable end proposed, and that 
 is <I>the stability of our times,</I> that things be not disturbed and 
 unhinged at home, and the <I>strength of salvation,</I> deliverance 
 from, and success against, enemies abroad. The salvation that God 
 ordains for his people has strength in it; it is a horn of salvation.
 And here are the way and means for obtaining this end--<I>wisdom and 
 knowledge,</I> not only piety, but prudence. That is it which, by the 
 blessing of God, will be the <I>stability of our times and the strength 
 of salvation,</I> that wisdom which is first pure, then peaceable, and 
 which sacrifices private interests to a public good; such prudence as 
 this will establish truth and peace, and fortify the bulwarks in 
 defence of them.

 (2.) A pious maxim of state for Hezekiah and his people to govern 
 themselves by: <I>The fear of the Lord is his treasure.</I> It is God's 
 treasure in the world, from which he receives his tribute; or, rather, 
 it is the prince's treasure. A good prince accounts it so (that wisdom 
 is better than gold) and he shall find it so. Note, True religion is 
 the true treasure of any prince or people; it denominates them rich.
 Those places that have plenty of Bibles, and ministers, and serious 
 good people, are really rich; and it contributes to that which makes a 
 nation rich in this world. It is therefore the interest of a people to 
 support religion among them and to take heed of every thing that 
 threatens to hinder it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The great distress that Jerusalem was brought into described, that 
 those who believed the prophet might know beforehand what troubles were 
 coming and might provide accordingly, and that when the foregoing 
 promise of their deliverance should have its accomplishment the 
 remembrance of the extremity of their case might help to magnify God in 
 it and make them the more thankful, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:7-9"><I>v.</I> 7-9</A>.

 It is here foretold, 

 1. That the enemy would be very insolent and abusive and there would
 be no dealing with him, either by treaties of peace (<I>for he has 
 broken the covenant</I> without any hesitation, as if it were below him 
 to be a servant to his word), or by the preparations of war, for <I>he 
 has despised the cities;</I> he scorns to take notice either of their 
 appeals to justice or of their petitions for mercy. He makes himself 
 master of them so easily (though they are called <I>fenced cities</I>), 
 and meets with so little resistance, that he despises them, and has no 
 relentings when he puts all to the sword; for he regards no man, has no 
 pity or concern, no, not for those that he is under particular 
 obligations to. He neither fears God nor regards man, but is haughty 
 and imperious to every one. There are those that take a pride in 
 trampling upon all mankind, and have neither veneration for the 
 honourable nor compassion for the miserable. 

 2. That therefore he would not be brought to any terms of 
 reconciliation: <I>The valiant ones of Jerusalem,</I> being unable to 
 make their parts good with him, must be contentedly run down with noise 
 and insolence, which will make them cry without, because they cannot 
 serve their country as they might have done against a fair adversary. 
 <I>The ambassadors</I> sent by Hezekiah to treat <I>of peace,</I> 
 finding him so haughty and unmanageable, <I>shall weep bitterly</I> for 
 vexation at the disappointment they had met with in their negotiations; 
 they shall weep like children, as despairing to find out any expedient 
 to pacify him.

 3. That the country should be made quite desolate for a time by his
 army.

 (1.) No man durst travel the roads; so that a stop was put to trade and 
 commerce, and (which was worse) no man could safely go up to Jerusalem, 
 to keep the solemn feasts: <I>The highways lie waste.</I> While the 
 fields lie waste, trodden like the highways, the highways lie waste, 
 untrodden like the fields, for <I>the traveller ceases.</I> 

 (2.) No man had any profit from the grounds,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 The earth used to rejoice in its own productions for the service of 
 God's Israel, but now the enemies of Israel eat them up, or tread them 
 down: it <I>mourns and languishes;</I> the country looks melancholy and 
 the country people have misery in their countenances, wanting necessary 
 food for themselves and their families; the wonted joy of harvest is 
 turned into lamentation, so withering and uncertain are all worldly 
 joys. The desolation is universal. That part of the country which 
 belonged to the ten tribes was already laid waste: "<I>Lebanon</I> 
 famed for cedars, <I>Sharon</I> for roses, <I>Bashan</I> for cattle, 
 <I>Carmel</I> for corn, all very fruitful, have now become like 
 wildernesses, <I>are ashamed</I> to be called by their old names, they 
 are so unlike what they were. They <I>shake off their fruits</I> before 
 their time into the hand of the spoiler, which used to be gathered 
 seasonably by the hand of the owner."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. God appearing, at length, in his glory against his proud invader, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:10"><I>v.</I> 10-12</A>.

 When things are brought thus to the last extremity, 

 1. God will magnify himself. He had seemed to sit by as an unconcerned
 spectator: "But <I>now will I arise, saith the Lord;</I> now will I 
 appear and act, and therein I will be not only evidenced, but exalted." 
 He will not only demonstrate that there is a God that judges in the 
 earth, but that he is God over all, and higher than the highest. "Now 
 <I>will I lift up myself,</I> will prepare for action, will act 
 vigorously, and will be glorified in it." God's time to appear for his 
 people is when their affairs are reduced to the lowest ebb, <I>when 
 their strength is gone and there is none shut up nor left,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:36">Deut. xxxii. 36</A>.

 When all other helpers fail, then is God's time to help.

 2. He will bring down the Assyrian: "You, O Assyrians! are big with 
 hopes that you shall have all the wealth of Jerusalem for your own, and 
 are in pain till it be so; but all your hopes shall come to nothing: 
 <I>You shall conceive chaff, and bring forth stubble,</I> which is not 
 only worthless and good for nothing, but combustible and proper fuel 
 for the fire, which it cannot escape, when <I>your</I> own <I>breath as 
 fire shall devour you,</I> that is, the breath of God's wrath, provoked 
 against you by the breath of your sins--your malignant breath, the 
 threatenings and slaughter you breathe out against the people of God, 
 this shall devour you, and your blasphemous breath against God and his 
 name." God would make their own tongues to fall upon them, and their 
 own breath to blow the fire that should consume them; and then no 
 wonder that the people are <I>as the burnings of lime</I> in a 
 lime-kiln, all on fire together, and <I>as thorns cut up,</I> which are 
 dried and withered, and therefore easily take fire and are soon burnt 
 up. Such was the destruction of the Assyrian army; it was like the 
 burning up of thorns, which can well be spared, or the burning of lime, 
 which makes it good for something. The burning of that army enlightened 
 the world with the knowledge of God's power and made his name shine 
 brightly.</P>

 not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be
 removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.
 &nbsp; 21  But there the glorious L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>will be</I> unto us a place of
 broad rivers <I>and</I> streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars,

 dwell therein <I>shall be</I> forgiven <I>their</I> iniquity.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is a preface that commands attention; and it is fit that all 
 should attend, both near and afar off, to what God says and does 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Hear, you that are afar off,</I> whether in place or time. Let
 distant regions and future ages hear what God has done. They do so; 
 they will do so from the scripture, with as much assurance as those 
 that were near, the neighbouring nations and those that lived at that 
 time. But whoever hears what God has done, whether near or afar off, 
 let them acknowledge his might, that it is irresistible, and that he 
 can do every thing. Those are very stupid who hear what God has done 
 and yet will not acknowledge his might. Now what is it that God has 
 done which we must take notice of, and in which we must acknowledge his 
 might?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He has struck a terror upon the sinners in Zion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):
 
 <I>Fearfulness has surprised the hypocrites.</I> There are sinners in 
 Zion, hypocrites, that enjoy Zion's privileges and concur in Zion's 
 services, but their hearts are not right in the sight of God; they keep 
 up secret haunts of sin under the cloak of a visible profession, which 
 convicts them of hypocrisy. Sinners in Zion will have a great deal to 
 answer for above other sinners; and their place in Zion will be so far 
 from being their security that it will aggravate both their sin and 
 their punishment. Now those sinners in Zion, though always subject to 
 secret frights and terrors, were struck with a more than ordinary 
 consternation from the convictions of their own consciences. 

 1. When they saw the Assyrian army besieging Jerusalem, and ready to
 set fire to it and lay it in ashes, and burn the wasps in the nest. 
 Finding they could not make their escape to Egypt, as some had done, 
 and distrusting the promises God had made by his prophets that he would 
 deliver them, they were at their wits' end, and ran about like men 
 distracted, crying, "<I>Who among us shall dwell with devouring 
 fire?</I> Let us therefore abandon the city, and shift for ourselves 
 elsewhere; one had as good live in everlasting burnings as live here." 
 <I>Who will stand up for us against this devouring fire?</I> so some 
 read it. See here how the sinners in Zion are affected when the 
 judgments of God are abroad; while they were only threatened they 
 slighted them and made nothing of them; but, when they come to be 
 executed, they run into the other extreme, then they magnify them, and 
 make the worst of them; they call them <I>devouring fire</I> and 
 <I>everlasting burnings,</I> and despair of relief and succour. Those 
 that rebel against the commands of the word cannot take the comforts of 
 it in a time of need. Or, rather, 

 2. When they saw the Assyrian army destroyed; for the destruction of 
 that is the fire spoken of immediately before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 When the sinners in Zion saw what dreadful execution the wrath of God 
 made they were in a great fright, being conscious to themselves that 
 they had provoked this God by their secretly worshipping other gods; 
 and therefore they cry out, <I>Who among us shall dwell with this 
 devouring fire,</I> before which so vast an army is as thorns? <I>Who 
 among us shall dwell with</I> these <I>everlasting burnings,</I> which 
 have made the Assyrians <I>as the burnings of lime?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Thus they said, or should have said. Note, God's judgments upon the 
 enemies of Zion should strike a terror upon the sinners in Zion, nay, 
 David himself trembles at them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:120">Ps. cxix. 120</A>.

 God himself is this devouring fire,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:29">Heb. xii. 29</A>.

 Who is able to stand before him? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+6:20">1 Sam. vi. 20</A>.

 His wrath will burn those everlastingly that have made themselves fuel
 for it. It is a fire that shall never be quenched, nor will ever go out 
 of itself; for it is the wrath of an everlasting God preying upon the 
 conscience of an immortal soul. Nor can the most daring sinners bear up 
 against it, so as to bear either the execution of it or the fearful 
 expectation of it. Let this awaken us all to flee from the wrath to 
 come, by fleeing to Christ as our refuge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He has graciously provided for the security of his people that 
 trust in him: <I>Hear this, and acknowledge his</I> power in making 
 those that <I>walk righteously,</I> and <I>speak uprightly,</I> to 
 <I>dwell on high,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.
 
 We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The good man's character, which he preserves even in times of common 
 iniquity, in divers instances. 

 (1.) He walks righteously. In the whole course of his conversation he 
 acts by rules of equity, and makes conscience of rendering to all their 
 due, to God his due, as well as to men theirs. His walk is 
 righteousness itself; he would not for a world wilfully do an unjust 
 thing. 

 (2.) He speaks uprightly, <I>uprightnesses</I> (so the word is); he
 speaks what is true and right, and with an honest intention. He cannot 
 think one thing and speak another, nor look one way and row another. 
 His word is to him as sacred as his oath, and is not yea and nay. 

 (3.) He is so far from coveting ill-gotten gain that he despises it. He 
 thinks it a mean and sordid thing, and unbecoming a man of honour, to 
 enrich himself by any hardship put upon his neighbour. He scorns to do 
 a wrong thing, nay, to do a severe thing, though he might get by it. He 
 does not over-value gain itself, and therefore easily abhors the gain 
 that is not honestly come by. 

 (4.) If he have a bribe at any time thrust into his hand, to pervert 
 justice, <I>he shakes his hands from holding</I> it, with the utmost 
 detestation, taking it as an affront to have it offered him.

 (5.) <I>He stops his ears from hearing</I> any thing that tends to 
 cruelty or bloodshed, or any suggestions stirring him up to revenge, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:31">Job xxxi. 31</A>.

 He turns a deaf ear to those that delight in war and entice him to
 <I>cast in his lot among them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:14,16">Prov. i. 14, 16</A>.

 (6.) He <I>shuts his eyes from seeing evil.</I> He has such an 
 abhorrence of sin that he cannot bear to see others commit it, and does 
 himself watch against all the occasions of it. Those that would 
 preserve the purity of their souls must keep a strict guard upon the 
 senses of their bodies, must stop their ears to temptations, and turn 
 away their eyes from beholding vanity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The good man's comfort, which he may preserve even in times of 
 common calamity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 (1.) He shall be safe; he shall escape the devouring fire and the 
 everlasting burnings; he shall have access to, and communion with, that 
 God who is a devouring fire, but shall be to him a rejoicing light. 
 And, as to present troubles, <I>he shall dwell on high,</I> out of the 
 reach of them, nay, out of the hearing of the noise of them; he shall 
 not be really harmed by them, nay, he shall not be greatly frightened 
 at them: <I>The floods of great waters shall not come nigh him;</I> or, 
 if they should attack him, <I>his place of defence shall be the 
 munitions of rocks,</I> strong and impregnable, fortified by nature as 
 well as art. The divine power will keep him safe, and his faith in that 
 power will keep him easy. God, the rock of ages, will be his high 
 tower. 

 (2.) He shall be supplied; he shall want nothing that is necessary for 
 him: <I>Bread shall be given him,</I> even when the siege is straitest 
 and provisions are cut off; and <I>his waters shall be sure,</I> that 
 is, he shall be sure of the continuance of them, so that he shall not 
 drink his water by measure and with astonishment. Those that fear the 
 Lord shall not want any thing that is good for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He will protect Jerusalem, and deliver it out of the hands of the 
 invaders. This storm that threatened them should blow over, and they 
 should enjoy a prosperous state again. Many instances are here given of 
 this prosperity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Hezekiah shall put off his sackcloth and all the sadness of his 
 countenance, and shall appear publicly in his beauty, in his royal 
 robes and with a pleasing aspect 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 to the great joy of all his loving subjects. Those that walk uprightly 
 shall not only have bread given them, and their water sure, but they 
 shall with an eye of faith see the King of kings in his beauty, the 
 beauty of holiness, and that beauty shall be upon them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The siege being raised, by which they were kept close within the 
 walls of Jerusalem, they shall now be at liberty to go abroad upon 
 business or pleasure without danger of falling into the enemies' hand: 
 <I>They shall behold the land that is very far off;</I> they shall 
 visit the utmost corners of the nation, and take a prospect of the 
 adjacent countries, which will be the more pleasant after so long a 
 confinement. Thus believers behold the heavenly Canaan, that land that 
 is very far off, and comfort themselves with the prospect of it in evil 
 times.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The remembrance of the fright they were in shall add to the pleasure 
 of their deliverance 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>Thy heart shall meditate terror,</I> meditate it with pleasure when 
 it is over. Thou shalt think thou still hearest the alarm in thy ears, 
 when all the cry was, "Arm, arm, arm! every man to his post. <I>Where
 is the scribe</I> or secretary of war? Let him appear to draw up the
 muster-roll. <I>Where is the receiver</I> and pay-master of the army? 
 Let him see what he had in bank, to defray the charge of a defence. 
 <I>Where is he that counted the towers?</I> Let him bring in the 
 account of them, that care may be taken to put a competent number of 
 men in each." Or these words may be taken as Jerusalem's triumph over 
 the vanquished army of the Assyrians, and the rather because the 
 apostle alludes to them in his triumphs over the learning of this 
 world, when it was baffled by the gospel of Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:20">1 Cor. i. 20</A>.

 The virgin, the daughter of Zion, despises all their military
 preparations. Where is the scribe or muster-master of the Assyrian
 army? Where is their weigher (or treasurer), and where are their 
 engineers that counted the towers? They are all either dead or fled.
 There is an end of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They shall no more be terrified with the sight of the Assyrians, who 
 were a fierce people naturally, and were particularly fierce against 
 the people of the Jews, and were of a strange language, that could 
 understand neither their petitions nor their complaints, and therefore 
 had a pretence for being deaf to them, nor could themselves be 
 understood: "They are <I>of a deeper speech than thou canst 
 perceive,</I> which will make them the more formidable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Thy eyes shall no more see them thus fierce, but their countenances 
 changed when they shall all become dead corpses."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. They shall no more be under apprehensions of the danger of 
 Jerusalem-Zion, and the temple there 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 "<I>Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities,</I> the city where our 
 solemn sacred feasts are kept, where we used to meet to worship God in 
 religious assemblies." The good people among them, in the time of their 
 distress, were most in pain for Zion upon this account, that it was the 
 city of their solemnities, that the conquerors would burn their temple 
 and they should not have that to keep their solemn feasts in any more. 
 In times of public danger our concern should be most about our 
 religion, and the cities of our solemnities should be dearer to us than 
 either our strong cities or our store-cities. It is with an eye to this 
 that God will work deliverance for Jerusalem, because it is the city of 
 religious solemnities: let those be conscientiously kept up, as the 
 glory of a people, and we may depend upon God to create a defence upon 
 that glory. Two things are here promised to Jerusalem:--

 (1.) A well-grounded security. It shall be <I>a quiet habitation</I> 
 for the people of God; they shall not be molested and disturbed, as 
 they have been, by the alarms of the sword either of war or 
 persecution,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:20"><I>ch.</I> xxix. 20</A>.

 It shall be a quiet habitation, as it is the city of our solemnities.
 It is desirable to be quiet in our own houses, but much more so to be 
 quiet in God's house and have none to make us afraid there. Thus it 
 shall be with Jerusalem; and <I>the eyes shall see it,</I> which will 
 be a great satisfaction to a good man, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+128:5,6">Ps. cxxviii. 5, 6</A>.

 "<I>Thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem, and peace upon Israel;</I> 
 thou shalt live to see it and share in it."

 (2.) An unmoved stability. Jerusalem, the city of our solemnities, is 
 indeed but <I>a tabernacle,</I> in comparison with the New Jerusalem. 
 The present manifestations of the divine glory and grace are nothing in 
 comparison with those that are reserved for the future state. But it is 
 such a tabernacle as <I>shall not be taken down.</I> After this trouble 
 is over Jerusalem shall long enjoy a confirmed peace; and her sacred 
 privileges, which are the stakes and cords of her tabernacle, shall not 
 be removed from her, nor any disturbance given to the course and circle 
 of her religious services. God's church on earth is a tabernacle,
 which, though it may be shifted from one place to another, shall not be 
 taken down while the world stands; for in every age Christ will have a 
 seed to serve him. The promises of the covenant are its stakes, which 
 shall never be removed, and the ordinances and institutions of the 
 gospel are its cords, which shall never be broken. They are things
 which cannot be shaken, though heaven and earth be, but shall 
 remain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. God himself will be their protector and Saviour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.

 This the principal ground of their confidence: "He that is himself 
 <I>the glorious Lord</I> will display his glory for us and be a glory 
 to us, such as shall eclipse the rival-glory of the enemy." God, in 
 being a gracious Lord, is a glorious Lord; for his goodness is his 
 glory. God will be the Saviour of Jerusalem and her glorious Lord, 

 (1.) As a guard against their adversaries abroad. He will be <I>a place 
 of broad rivers and streams.</I> Jerusalem had no considerable river 
 running by it, as most great cities have, nothing but the brook Kidron, 
 and so wanted one of the best natural fortifications, as well as one of 
 the greatest advantages for trade and commerce, and upon this account 
 their enemies despised them and doubted not but to make an easy prey of 
 them; but the presence and power of God are sufficient at any time to 
 make up to us the deficiencies of the creature and of its strength and 
 beauty. We have all in God, all we need or can desire. Many external 
 advantages Jerusalem has not which other places have, but in God there 
 is more than an equivalent. But, if there be broad rivers and streams 
 about Jerusalem, may not these yield an easy access to the fleet of an 
 invader? No; these are rivers and streams <I>in which shall go no 
 galley with oars,</I> no man of war or gallant ship. If God himself be 
 the river, it must needs be inaccessible to the enemy; they can neither 
 find nor force their way by it. 

 (2.) As a guide to their affairs at home: "<I>For the Lord is our 
 Judge,</I> to whom we are accountable, to whose judgment we refer 
 ourselves, by whose judgment we abide, and who therefore (we hope) will 
 judge for us. <I>He is our lawgiver;</I> his word is a law to us, and 
 to him every thought within us is brought into obedience. <I>He is our 
 King,</I> to whom we pay homage and tribute, and an inviolable 
 allegiance, and therefore <I>he will save us.</I>" For, as protection 
 draws allegiance, so allegiance may expect protection, and shall have 
 it with God. By faith we take Christ for our prince and Saviour, and as 
 such depend upon him and devote ourselves to him. Observe with what an 
 air of triumph, and with what an emphasis laid upon the glorious name 
 of God, they comfort themselves with this: <I>Jehovah is our Judge, 
 Jehovah is our Lawgiver, Jehovah is our King, who, being self-existent, 
 is self-sufficient, and all-sufficient to us.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. The enemies shall be quite infatuated, and all their powers and 
 projects broken, like a ship at sea in stress of weather, that cannot 
 ride out the storm, but having her tackle torn, her masts split, and 
 nothing wherewith to repair them, is given up for a wreck, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.
 
 <I>The tacklings</I> of the Assyrian <I>are loosed;</I> they are like a 
 ship whose tacklings are loose, or forsaken by the ship's crew, when 
 they give it over for lost, finding that they cannot strengthen the 
 mast, but it will come down. They thought themselves sure of Jerusalem; 
 but when they were just entering the port as it were, and though all 
 was their own, they were quite becalmed, and <I>could not spread their 
 sail,</I> but lay wind-bound till God poured the fury of his wrath upon 
 them. The enemies of God's church are often disarmed and unrigged when 
 they think they have almost gained their point.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 8. The wealth of their camp shall be a rich booty for the Jews: <I>Then 
 is the prey of a great spoil divided.</I> When the greater part were 
 slain the rest fled in confusion, and with such precipitation that 
 (like the Syrians) they <I>left their tents as they were,</I> so that 
 all the treasure in them fell into the hands of the besieged; and even 
 <I>the lame take the prey.</I> Those that tarried at home did divide 
 the spoil. It was so easy to come at that not only the strong man might 
 make himself master of it, but even the lame man, whose hands were 
 lame, that he could not fight, and his feet, that he could not pursue. 
 As the victory shall cost them no peril, so the prey shall cost them no 
 toil. And there was such abundance of it that when those who were 
 forward, and came first, had carried off as much as they would, even 
 the lame, who came late, found sufficient. Thus God brought good out of 
 evil, and not only delivered Jerusalem, but enriched it, and abundantly 
 recompensed the losses they had sustained. Thus comfortably and well do 
 the frights and distresses of the people of God often end.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 9. Both sickness and sin shall be taken away; and then sickness is 
 taken away in mercy when this is all the fruit of it, and the recovery 
 from it, even the taking away of sin. 

 (1.) <I>The inhabitant shall not say, I am sick. As the lame shall take 
 the prey,</I> so shall the sick, notwithstanding their weakness, make a 
 shift to get to the abandoned camp and seize something for themselves; 
 or there shall be such a universal transport of joy upon this occasion 
 that even the sick shall, for the present, forget their sickness and 
 the sorrows of it, and join with the public in its rejoicings; the 
 deliverance of their city shall be their cure. Or it intimates that, 
 whereas infectious diseases are commonly the effect of long sieges, it 
 shall not be so with Jerusalem, but the inhabitants of it with their 
 victory and peace shall have health also, and there shall be no 
 complaining upon the account of sickness within their gates. Or those 
 that are sick shall bear their sickness without complaining as long as 
 they see it goes well with Jerusalem. Our sense of private grievances 
 should be drowned in our thanksgivings for public mercies. 

 (2.) <I>The people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their 
 iniquity,</I> not only the body of the nation forgiven their national 
 guilt in the removing of the national judgment, but particular persons, 
 that dwell therein, shall repent, and reform, and have their sins 
 pardoned. And this is promised as that which is at the bottom of all 
 other favours; he will do so and so for them, <I>for he will be 
 merciful to their unrighteousness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:12">Heb. viii. 12</A>.

 Sin is the sickness of the soul. When God pardons the sin he heals the
 disease; and, when the diseases of sin are healed by pardoning mercy, 
 the sting of bodily sickness is taken out and the cause of it removed; 
 so that either the inhabitant shall not be sick or at least shall not 
 say, <I>I am sick.</I> If iniquity be taken away, we have little reason
 to complain of outward affliction. <I>Son, be of good cheer; thy sins
 are forgiven thee.</I></P>
