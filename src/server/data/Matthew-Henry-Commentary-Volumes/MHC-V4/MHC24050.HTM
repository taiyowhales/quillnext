 In this chapter, and that which follows, we have the judgment of 
 Babylon, which is put last of Jeremiah's prophecies against the 
 Gentiles because it was last accomplished; and when the cup of God's 
 fury went round 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:17">
 <I>ch.</I>25:17</A>)

 the king of Sheshach, Babylon, drank last. Babylon was employed as the
 rod in God's hand for the chastising of all the other nations, and now 
 at length that rod shall be thrown into the fire. The destruction of 
 Babylon by Cyrus was foretold, long before it came to its height, by 
 Isaiah, and now again, when it has come to its height, by Jeremiah; 
 for, though at this time he saw that kingdom flourishing "like a green 
 bay-tree," yet at the same time he foresaw it withered and cut down. 
 And as Isaiah's prophecies of the destruction of Babylon and the 
 deliverance of Israel out of it seem designed to typify the evangelical 
 triumphs of all believers over the powers of darkness, and the great 
 salvation wrought out by our Lord Jesus Christ, so Jeremiah's 
 prophecies of the same events seem designed to point at the apocalyptic 
 triumphs of the gospel church in the latter days over the New-Testament 
 Babylon, many passages in the Revelation being borrowed hence. The 
 kingdom of Babylon being much larger and stronger than any of the 
 kingdoms here prophesied against, its fall was the more considerable in 
 itself; and, it having been more oppressive to the people of God than 
 any of the other, the prophet is very copious upon this subject, for 
 the comfort of the captives; and what was foretold in general often 
 before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:12,27:7"><I>ch.</I> xxv. 12 and xxvii. 7</A>)

 is here more particularly described, and with a great deal of prophetic
 heat as well as light. The terrible judgments God had in store for
 Babylon, and the glorious blessings he had in store for his people that 
 were captives there, are intermixed and counterchanged in the prophecy 
 of this chapter; for Babylon was destroyed to make way for the turning 
 again of the captivity of God's people. Here is,

 I. The ruin of Babylon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:1-3,9-16,21-32,35-46">ver. 1-3, 9-16, 21-32, and 35-46</A>.

 II. The redemption of God's people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:4-8,17-20,33,34">ver. 4-8, 17-20, and 33, 34</A>.

 And these being set the one against the other, it is easy to say which
 one would choose to take one's lot with, the persecuting Babylonians,
 who, though now in pomp, are reserved for so great a ruin, or the
 persecuted Israelites, who, though now in thraldom, are reserved for so
 great a glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The word that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake against Babylon <I>and</I> against
 the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet.
 &nbsp; 2  Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a
 standard; publish, <I>and</I> conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel
 is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are
 confounded, her images are broken in pieces.
 &nbsp; 3  For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her,
 which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein:
 they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast.
 &nbsp; 4  In those days, and in that time, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the children
 of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together,
 going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> their God.
 &nbsp; 5  They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward,
 <I>saying,</I> Come, and let us join ourselves to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in a
 perpetual covenant <I>that</I> shall not be forgotten.
 &nbsp; 6  My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused
 them to go astray, they have turned them away <I>on</I> the mountains:
 they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their
 restingplace.
 &nbsp; 7  All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries
 said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 the habitation of justice, even the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the hope of their
 fathers.
 &nbsp; 8  Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the
 land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is a word spoken against Babylon by him whose works all agree 
 with his word and none of whose words fall to the ground. The king of 
 Babylon had been very kind of Jeremiah, and yet he must foretel the 
 ruin of that kingdom; for God's prophets must not be governed by favour 
 or affection. Whoever are our friends, if, notwithstanding, they are 
 God's enemies, we dare not speak peace to them. 

 1. The destruction of Babylon is here spoken of as a thing done, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 let it be published to the nations as a piece of news, true news, and
 great news, and news they are all concerned in; let them hang out the 
 flag, as is usual on days of triumph, to give notice of it; let all the 
 world take notice of it: <I>Babylon is taken.</I> Let God have the 
 honour of it, let his people have the comfort of it, and therefore do 
 not conceal it. Take care that it be known, that <I>the Lord may be 
 known by those judgments which he executes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:16">Ps. ix. 16</A>.

 2. It is spoken of as a thing done thoroughly. For,

 (1.) The very idols of Babylon, which the people would protect with all
 possible care, and from which they expected protection, shall be 
 destroyed. Bel and Merodach were their two principal deities; they 
 shall be <I>confounded,</I> and the images of them <I>broken to 
 pieces.</I>

 (2.) The country shall be laid waste

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 out <I>of the north,</I> from Media, which lay north of Babylon, and 
 from Assyria, through which Cyrus made his descent upon Babylon; thence 
 the nation shall come that shall make <I>her land desolate.</I> Their 
 land was north of the countries that they destroyed, who were therefore 
 threatened with evil from the north (<I>Omne malum ab aquilone--Every 
 evil comes from the north</I>); but God will find out nations yet 
 further north to come upon them. The pomp and power of old Rome were 
 brought down by northern nations, the Goths and Vandals.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is a word spoken for the people of God, and for their comfort, 
 both <I>the children of Israel</I> and <I>of Judah;</I> for many there 
 were of the ten tribes that associated with those of the two tribes in 
 their return out of Babylon. Now here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is promised that they shall return to their God first and then to 
 their own land; and the promise of their conversion and reformation is 
 that which makes way for all the other promises, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 (1.) They shall <I>lament after the Lord</I> (as the whole house of 
 Israel did in Samuel's time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:2">1 Sam. vii. 2</A>);

 they shall <I>go weeping.</I> These tears flow not from the sorrow of
 the world as those when they went into captivity, but from godly 
 sorrow; they are tears of repentance for sin, tears of joy for the 
 goodness of God, in the dawning of the day of their deliverance, which, 
 for aught that appears, does more towards the bringing of them to mourn 
 for sin than all the calamities of their captivity; that prevails to 
 <I>lead them to repentance</I> when the other did not prevail to drive 
 them to it. Note, It is a good sign that God is coming towards a
 people in ways of mercy when they begin to be tenderly affected under 
 his hand.

 (2.) They shall <I>enquire after the Lord;</I> they shall not sink
 under their sorrows, but bestir themselves to find out comfort where it 
 is to be had: <I>They shall go weeping to seek the Lord their God.</I> 
 Those that seek the Lord must <I>seek him sorrowing,</I> as Christ's 
 parents sought him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:48">Luke ii. 48</A>.

 And those that sorrow must seek the Lord, and then their sorrow shall
 soon be turned into joy, for he will be found of those that so seek 
 him. They shall <I>seek the Lord as their God,</I> and shall now have 
 no more to do with idols. When they shall hear that the idols of 
 Babylon are <I>confounded and broken</I> it will be seasonable for them 
 to enquire after their own God and to return to him who lives for ever.
 <I>Therefore</I> men are deceived in false gods, that they may depend 
 on the true God only.

 (3.) They shall think of returning to their own country again; they
 shall think of it not only as a mercy, but as a duty, because there 
 only is the <I>holy hill of Zion,</I> on which once stood <I>the house 
 of the Lord their God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward.</I> 
 Zion was the city of their solemnities; they often thought of it in the 
 depth of their captivity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:1">Ps. cxxxvii. 1</A>);

 but, now that the ruin of Babylon gave them some hopes of a release,
 they talk of nothing else but of going back to Zion. Their hearts were 
 upon it before, and now they <I>set their faces thitherward.</I> They 
 long to be there; they set out for Zion, and resolve not to take up 
 short of it. The journey is long and they know not the road, but they 
 will <I>ask the way,</I> for they will press forward till they come to 
 Zion; and, as they are determined not to turn back, so they are in care 
 not to miss the way. This represents the return of poor souls to God.
 Heaven is the Zion they aim at as their end; on this they have set 
 their hearts; towards this they have <I>set their faces,</I> and 
 therefore they <I>ask the way</I> thither. They do not ask the way to 
 heaven and set their faces towards the world; nor set their faces 
 towards heaven and go on at a venture without asking the way. But in 
 all true converts there are both a sincere desire to attain the end and 
 a constant care to keep in the way; and a blessed sight it is to see 
 people thus asking the way to heaven with their faces thitherward.

 (4.) They shall renew their covenant to walk with God more closely for
 the future: <I>Come, and let us join ourselves to the Lord in a 
 perpetual covenant.</I> They had broken covenant with God, had in 
 effect separated themselves from him, but now they resolve to <I>join 
 themselves</I> to him again, by engaging themselves afresh to be his.
 Thus, when backsliders return, they must <I>do their first works,</I> 
 must renew the covenant they first made; and it must be a <I>perpetual 
 covenant,</I> that must never be broken; and, in order to that, must 
 never be forgotten; for a due remembrance of it will be the means of a 
 due observance of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Their present case is lamented as very sad, and as having been long 
 so: "<I>My people</I>" (for he owns them as his now that they are 
 returning to him) "<I>have been lost sheep</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 they have <I>gone from mountain to hill,</I> have been hurried from 
 place to place, and could find no pasture; <I>they have forgotten their 
 resting-place</I> in their own country and cannot find their way to 
 it." And that which aggravated their misery was, 

 (1.) That they were <I>led astray by their own shepherds,</I> their own
 princes and priests; they turned them from their duty, and so provoked 
 God to turn them out of their own land. It is bad with a people when 
 their leaders cause them to err, when those that should direct them, 
 and when those that should secure and advance their interests are the 
 betrayers of them.

 (2.) That in their wanderings they lay exposed to the beasts of prey,
 who thought they were entitled to them, as waifs and strays that had no 
 owner

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 it is with them as with wandering sheep, <I>all that found them have 
 devoured them</I> and made a prey of them; and when they did them the 
 greatest injuries they laughed at them, telling them it was what their 
 own prophets had many a time told them they deserved; that was far from 
 justifying those who did them wrong, yet they bantered them with this 
 excuse, <I>We offend not, because they have sinned against the 
 Lord;</I> but they could not pretend that they had sinned against them. 
 And see what notion they had of the Lord they had sinned against, not 
 as the only true and living God, but only as <I>the habitation of 
 justice and the hope of their fathers;</I> they had put a contempt upon 
 the temple and upon the tradition of their ancestors, and therefore 
 deserved to suffer these hard things. And yet it was indeed an 
 aggravation of their sin, and justified God, though it did not justify 
 their adversaries in what was done to them, that they had <I>forsaken 
 the habitation of justice</I> and him that was <I>the hope of their 
 fathers.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They are called upon to hasten away, as soon as ever the door of 
 liberty was opened to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>Remove,</I> not only out of the borders, but <I>out of the midst of 
 Babylon;</I> though you be ever so well seated there, think not to 
 settle there, but hasten to Zion, and <I>be as the he-goats before the 
 flocks;</I> strive which shall be foremost, which shall lead in so good 
 a work:" a he-goat is <I>comely in going</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:31">Prov. xxx. 31</A>)

 because he goes first. It is a graceful thing to be forward in a good 
 work and to set others a good example.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an
 assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall
 set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be
 taken: their arrows <I>shall be</I> as of a mighty expert man; none
 shall return in vain.
 &nbsp; 10  And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be
 satisfied, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 11  Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers
 of mine heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at
 grass, and bellow as bulls;
 &nbsp; 12  Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you
 shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations <I>shall
 be</I> a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
 &nbsp; 13  Because of the wrath of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> it shall not be inhabited,
 but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon
 shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.
 &nbsp; 14  Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye
 that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath
 sinned against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 15  Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her
 foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it <I>is</I>
 the vengeance of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: take vengeance upon her; as she hath
 done, do unto her.
 &nbsp; 16  Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the
 sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword
 they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee
 every one to his own land.
 &nbsp; 17  Israel <I>is</I> a scattered sheep; the lions have driven <I>him</I>
 away: first the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this
 Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones.
 &nbsp; 18  Therefore thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, the God of Israel;
 Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have
 punished the king of Assyria.
 &nbsp; 19  And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he
 shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied
 upon mount Ephraim and Gilead.
 &nbsp; 20  In those days, and in that time, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the
 iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and <I>there shall be</I>
 none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I
 will pardon them whom I reserve.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God is here by his prophet, as afterwards in his providence, proceeding 
 in his controversy with Babylon. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The commission and charge given to the instruments that were to be 
 employed in destroying Babylon. The army that is to do it is called 
 <I>an assembly of great nations</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 the Medes and Persians, and all their allies and auxiliaries; it is 
 called <I>an assembly,</I> because regularly formed by the divine will 
 and counsel to do this execution. God will <I>raise them up</I> to do 
 it, will incline them to and fir them for this service, and then he 
 will <I>cause them to come up,</I> for all their motions are under his 
 conduct and direction: he shall give the word of command, shall order 
 them to <I>put themselves in array against Babylon</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 and then <I>they shall put themselves in array</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 for what God appoints to be done shall be done; and <I>thence she shall 
 be</I> quickly <I>taken;</I> from their first sitting down before it 
 they shall be still gaining ground against it till it be taken. God 
 shall bid them <I>shoot at her and spare no arrows</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 and then <I>their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man,</I> that 
 has both skill and strength, a good eye and a good hand 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 <I>none shall return in vain.</I> When God gives commission he will 
 give success. Nay, they are bidden not only to <I>shoot at her</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 but to <I>shout against her</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 with a triumphant shout, as those that are already sure of victory.
 Those whom God directs to shoot may do so with shouting, for they are 
 sure not to miss the mark.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The desolation and destruction itself that shall be brought upon 
 Babylon. This is here set forth in a great variety of expressions. 

 1. The wealth of Babylon shall be a rich and easy prey to the
 conquerors

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>Chaldea shall be a spoil</I> to all her destroyers, who shall enrich 
 themselves by plundering her, and, which is strange, <I>all that spoil 
 her shall be satisfied;</I> they shall have so much that even they 
 themselves shall say that they have enough. 

 2. The country of Babylon shall be depopulated and lie uninhabited:
 <I>It shall be wholly desolate</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)

 to such a degree that <I>every one who goes by</I> shall triumph in her 
 fall, and, instead of condoling with them, shall <I>hiss at all her 
 plagues,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 3. Their ancestors shall be ashamed of their cowardice, in fleeing from 
 the first onset 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 or, <I>Your mother,</I> Babylon itself, the mother-city, <I>shall be 
 confounded,</I> when she sees herself deserted by those that should 
 have been her guards. Thus the former ages of Christians may justly be 
 confounded and ashamed to see how unlike them the latter ages are, and 
 how wretchedly they have degenerated; and no sin brings a surer and 
 sorer ruin upon persons, or people, than apostasy. 

 4. The great admirers of Babylon shall see it rendered very despicable:
 the last of kingdoms, the very tail of the nations, <I>shall it be, a 
 wilderness, a dry land, a desert,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 The country that was populous shall be dispeopled, that was enriched 
 with a fertile soil shall become barren.

 5. The great city, the head of it, shall be quite ruined. <I>Her 
 foundations have fallen,</I> and therefore <I>her walls are thrown 
 down;</I> for how can the walls stand when divine vengeance is at the 
 door and shakes the very foundations? It is the vengeance of the Lord,
 which nothing can contend with either in law or battle. 

 6. There shall not be left in Babylon so much as <I>the poor of the
 land, for vine-dressers and husbandmen,</I> as there was in Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>The sower shall be cut off from Babylon, and he that handles the 
 sickle;</I> the country shall be so emptied of people that there shall 
 be none to till the ground and gather in the fruits of it. Harvest 
 shall come, and there shall be no reapers; seed-time shall come, but 
 there shall be no sower; God will do his part, but there shall be no 
 men to do theirs. 

 7. All their auxiliary forces, which they have hired into their
 service, shall desert them, as mercenary men often do upon the approach 
 of danger

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>For fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his 
 people.</I> This was threatened before concerning Egypt,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:16"><I>ch.</I> xlvi. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The procuring provoking cause of this destruction. It comes from 
 God's displeasure; it is <I>because of the wrath of the Lord</I> that 
 Babylon <I>shall be wholly desolate</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 and his wrath is righteous, for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)

 <I>she hath sinned against the Lord,</I> therefore <I>spare no 
 arrows.</I> Note, It is sin that makes men a mark for the arrows of 
 God's judgments. An abundance of idolatry and immorality was to be 
 found in Babylon, yet those are not mentioned as the reason of God's 
 displeasure against them, but the injuries they had done to the people 
 of God, from a principle of enmity to them as his people. They have 
 been <I>the destroyers of God's heritage</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);

 herein indeed God made use of them for the necessary correction of his 
 people, and yet it is laid to their charge as a heinous crime, because 
 they designed nothing but their utter destruction. 

 1. What they did against Jerusalem they did with pleasure

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>You were glad, you rejoice.</I> God does not afflict his people 
 willingly, and therefore takes it very ill if the instruments he 
 employs afflict them willingly. When Titus Vespasian destroyed
 Jerusalem he wept over it, but these Chaldeans triumphed over it. 

 2. The spoils of Jerusalem they made use of to feed their own luxury:
 "<I>You have grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls;</I> 
 your having conquered Jerusalem has made you very wanton and proud, 
 easy to yourselves and formidable to all about you, and therefore you 
 must <I>be a spoil.</I>" Those that have thus swallowed down riches 
 must vomit them up again. Therefore they have <I>given their hand</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);

 they have surrendered themselves to the conqueror, have tamely yielded 
 so that now you may <I>take vengeance on her,</I> now you may make 
 reprisals and <I>do unto her as she hath done.</I> 

 3. They aimed at nothing less than the utter ruin of God's Israel:
 <I>Israel is a scattered sheep,</I> as before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 that is not only barked at and worried by dogs, but even lions, the 
 most potent adversaries, have roared upon him and <I>driven him 
 away,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 One king of Assyria carried the ten tribes quite away and devoured 
 them; another invaded Judah, and plundered and impoverished it, tore 
 the fleece and flesh of this poor sheep; and now at last this 
 Nebuchadnezzar, that is the terror and plague of all his neighbours, 
 has taken advantage of the low condition to which he is reduced, and he 
 has fallen upon him and <I>broken his bones,</I> has quite ruined him, 
 and therefore the king of Babylon must be punished as the king of 
 Assyria was, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Note, Those who pursue and prosecute the sins of their predecessors 
 must expect to be pursued and prosecuted by their plagues; if they do 
 as they did, let them fare as they fared.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The mercy promised to the Israel of God, which shall not only 
 accompany, but accrue from, the destruction of Babylon. 

 1. God will return their captivity; they shall be released out of their
 bondage, and <I>brought again to their own habitation</I> as sheep that 
 were scattered to their own fold

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 They still retained a title to the land of Canaan; it is their 
 habitation still. The discontinuance of their possession was not the 
 destruction of their right. But now they shall recover the enjoyment of 
 it again. 

 2. He will restore their prosperity; they shall not only live, but live
 comfortably, in their own land again; they shall <I>feed upon Carmel 
 and Bashan,</I> the richest and most fruitful parts of the country. 
 These sheep shall be gathered from the deserts to which they were 
 dispersed, and put again into good pasture, which their soul shall be 
 satisfied with though they shall come hungry to it, having been so long 
 stinted, and straitened, and kept short, yet they shall find enough to 
 satiate them and shall have hearts to be satiated with it. They
 <I>enquired the way to Zion</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 where God was to be served and worshipped. This was what they chiefly 
 aimed at in their return; but God will not only bring them thither, but 
 bring them also to Carmel and Bashan, where they shall abundantly feed 
 themselves. Note, Those that return to God and their duty shall find 
 true satisfaction of soul in so doing; and those that <I>seek first the 
 kingdom of God and the righteousness thereof,</I> that aim to make 
 their habitation in Zion, the holy hill, shall have <I>other things 
 added to them,</I> even all the comforts of <I>Ephraim and Gilead,</I> 
 the fruitful hills. 

 3. God will pardon their iniquity; this is the root of all the rest

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>In those days the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there 
 shall be none.</I> Not only the punishments of their iniquity shall be 
 taken off, but the offence which it gave to God shall be forgotten, and 
 he will be reconciled to them. Their sin shall be before him as if it 
 had never been; it shall be blotted out as a cloud, crossed out as a 
 debt, shall be cast behind his back; nay, it shall be cast into the 
 depth of the sea, shall be no longer sealed up among God's treasures, 
 nor in any danger of appearing again or rising up against them. This 
 denotes how fully God forgives sin; he <I>remembers it no more.</I> 
 Note, Deliverances out of trouble are then comforts indeed when they 
 are the fruits of the forgiveness of sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+38:17">Isa. xxxviii. 17</A>.

 Judah and Israel were so fully forgiven when they were brought back out
 of Babylon that they are said to have <I>received of the Lord's hand 
 double for all their sins,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:1">Isa. xl. 1</A>.

 This may include also a thorough reformation of their hearts and lives,
 as well as a full remission of their sins. If any seek for idols or
 any idolatrous customs among them, after their return, <I>there shall 
 be none,</I> they <I>shall not find them;</I> their dross shall be 
 purely purged away, and by that it shall appear that their guilt is so; 
 <I>for I will pardon those whom I reserve; I will be propitious to 
 them</I> (so the word is) and that must be through him who is the great 
 propitiation. Note, Those whose sins God pardons he reserves for 
 something very great; for <I>whom he justifies them he</I> 
 glorifies.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  Go up against the land of Merathaim, <I>even</I> against it, and
 against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after
 them, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and do according to all that I have
 commanded thee.
 &nbsp; 22  A sound of battle <I>is</I> in the land, and of great
 destruction.
 &nbsp; 23  How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken!
 how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!
 &nbsp; 24  I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O
 Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also
 caught, because thou hast striven against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 25  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the
 weapons of his indignation: for this <I>is</I> the work of the Lord
 G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.
 &nbsp; 26  Come against her from the utmost border, open her
 storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let
 nothing of her be left.
 &nbsp; 27  Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter:
 woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their
 visitation.
 &nbsp; 28  The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of
 Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God,
 the vengeance of his temple.
 &nbsp; 29  Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend
 the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape:
 recompense her according to her work; according to all that she
 hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 against the Holy One of Israel.
 &nbsp; 30  Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all
 her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 31  Behold, I <I>am</I> against thee, <I>O thou</I> most proud, saith the
 Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> of hosts: for thy day is come, the time <I>that</I> I will
 visit thee.
 &nbsp; 32  And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall
 raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it
 shall devour all round about him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 1. The forces are mustered and commissioned to destroy Babylon, and
 every thing is got ready for a descent upon that potent kingdom: <I>Go 
 up against</I> that <I>land</I> by <I>Merathaim,</I> the country of the 
 Mardi, that lay part in Assyria and part in Armenia; and go among 
 <I>the inhabitants of Pekod,</I> another country (mentioned

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:23">Ezek. xxiii. 23</A>)

 which Cyrus took in his way to Babylon. The forces of Cyrus are called
 to go up against Babylon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 to <I>come against her from the utmost border.</I> Let all come 
 together, for there will be both work and pay enough for them all, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Distance of place must not be their hindrance from engaging in this 
 work. <I>The archers</I> particularly must be <I>called together 
 against Babylon,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 Thus <I>the Lord hath opened his armoury</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 <I>his treasury</I> (so the word is), <I>and hath brought forth the 
 weapons of his indignation,</I> as great princes fetch out of their 
 magazines and stores all necessary provisions for their armies when 
 they undertake any great expedition. Media and Persia are now God's 
 armoury; thence he fetches the weapons of his wrath, Cyrus and his 
 great officers and armies, whom he will make use of for the destruction 
 of Babylon. Note, Great men are but instruments which the great God 
 makes use of to serve his own purposes. He has variety of instruments, 
 has them at command, has armouries ready to be opened according as the 
 occasion is. <I>This is the work of the Lord God of hosts.</I> Note, 
 When God has work to do he will make it appear that he is <I>God of 
 hosts,</I> and will not want instruments to do it with. 

 2. Instructions are given them what to do. In general, <I>Do according
 to all that I have commanded thee,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 It was said of Cyrus 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:28">Isa. xliv. 28</A>),

 <I>He shall perform all my pleasure,</I> in his expedition against
 Babylon. They must <I>waste and utterly destroy after them;</I> when 
 they have destroyed once they must go over them again, or destroy their 
 posterity that should come after them. They must <I>open her 
 store-houses</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 rifle her treasures, and turn her artillery against herself. They must 
 <I>cast her up as heaps;</I> let all the wealth and pomp of Babylon be 
 shovelled up in a heap of ruins and rubbish. <I>Tread her down as 
 heaps</I> (so the margin reads it) <I>and destroy her utterly.</I> See 
 how little account the great God makes of those things which men so 
 much value and value themselves so much upon. Their princes and great
 men, who are fat and bulky, shall fall by the sword, not as men of war 
 in the field of battle, which we call a bed of honour, but as beasts by 
 the butcher's hand 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>Slay all her bullocks,</I> all her mighty men; <I>let them go 
 down</I> sottishly and insensibly, as an ox <I>to the slaughter. Woe 
 unto them!</I> their case is the more sad for the little sense they 
 have of it. <I>Their day has come</I> to fall, <I>the time</I> when 
 they must be reckoned with, and they are not aware of it. 

 3. Assurances are given them of success. Let them do what God commands,
 and they shall accomplish what he threatens. A <I>great
 destruction</I> shall be made,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 <I>Babylon</I> shall <I>become a desolation</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>);

 <I>her young men and all her men of war shall be cut off in that 
 day</I> which should have been her defence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 God is <I>against</I> her 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>);
 
 he has <I>laid a snare for</I> her
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>);

 he has formed this enterprise against her, that she should be surprised 
 as a bird taken in a snare. Cyrus shall no doubt prevail, for he fights 
 under God. God <I>will kindle a fire</I> in the cities of Babylon 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>);

 and who can stand before him when he is angry, or quench the fire that 
 he has kindled? 

 4. Reasons are given for these severe dealings with Babylon. Those
 that are employed in this war may, if they please, know the grounds of 
 it, and be satisfied in the justice of it, which it is fit all should 
 be that are called to such work.

 (1.) Babylon has been very troublesome, vexatious, and injurious, to
 all its neighbours; it has been <I>the hammer of the whole earth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 beating, beating down, and beating to pieces, all the nations far and 
 near. It has done so long enough; it is time now that it be <I>cut 
 asunder and broken.</I> Note, He that is the god of nations will sooner 
 or later assert the injured rights of nations against those that 
 unjustly and violently invade them. The God of the whole earth will 
 break <I>the hammer of the whole earth.</I> 

 (2.) Babylon has bidden defiance to God himself: <I>Thou has striven
 against the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 <I>hast joined issue with him</I> (so the word signifies) as in law or 
 battle, hast openly opposed him, set up rivals with him, raised 
 rebellion against him; therefore <I>thou art</I> now <I>found, and 
 caught,</I> as in a snare. Note, Those that strive against the Lord 
 will soon find themselves over-matched. 

 (3.) Babylon ruined Jerusalem, the holy city, and the holy house there,
 and must now be called to an account for that. This is the manifesto 
 published in Zion, in the day of Babylon's visitation; it is <I>the 
 vengeance of the Lord our God, the vengeance of his temple,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 The burning of the temple, and the carrying away of its vessels, were 
 articles in the charge against Babylon on which greater stress was laid 
 than upon its being <I>the hammer of the whole earth;</I> for Zion was 
 <I>the joy</I> and glory <I>of the whole earth.</I> Note, Whatever 
 wrong is done to God's church (his temple in the world) it will 
 certainly be reckoned for; and no vengeance will be sorer nor heavier 
 than <I>the vengeance of the temple.</I> 

 (4.) Babylon has been very haughty and insolent, and therefore must
 have a fall; for it is the glory of God to <I>look upon those that are 
 proud and to abase them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:11">Job xl. 11</A>.

 <I>I am against thee, O thou most proud!</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>

 and again

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 <I>Thou pride</I> (so the word is), as proud as pride itself. Note, the 
 pride of men's hearts sets God against them and ripens them apace for 
 ruin; for God <I>resists the proud</I> and will bring them down. <I>The 
 most proud shall stumble and fall;</I> they shall fall not so much by 
 others' thrusting them down as by their own stumbling; for they hold 
 their heads so high that they never look under their feet, to choose 
 their way and avoid stumbling-blocks, but walk at all adventures.
 Babylon's pride must unavoidably be her ruin; for <I>she has been proud 
 against the Lord, against the Holy One of Israel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 has insulted him in insulting over his people; she has made him her 
 enemy, and therefore, when she has <I>fallen, none shall raise her 
 up,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 &nbsp; 34  Their Redeemer <I>is</I> strong; the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts <I>is</I> his name:
 he shall thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to

 &nbsp; 35  A sword <I>is</I> upon the Chaldeans, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and upon
 the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her
 wise <I>men.</I>
 &nbsp; 36  A sword <I>is</I> upon the liars; and they shall dote: a sword
 <I>is</I> upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed.
 &nbsp; 37  A sword <I>is</I> upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and
 upon all the mingled people that <I>are</I> in the midst of her; and
 they shall become as women: a sword <I>is</I> upon her treasures; and
 they shall be robbed.
 &nbsp; 38  A drought <I>is</I> upon her waters; and they shall be dried up:
 for it <I>is</I> the land of graven images, and they are mad upon
 <I>their</I> idols.
 &nbsp; 39  Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts
 of the islands shall dwell <I>there,</I> and the owls shall dwell
 therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither
 shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.
 &nbsp; 40  As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour
 <I>cities</I> thereof, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; <I>so</I> shall no man abide there,
 neither shall any son of man dwell therein.
 &nbsp; 41  Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great
 nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the
 earth.
 &nbsp; 42  They shall hold the bow and the lance: they <I>are</I> cruel, and
 will not shew mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and
 they shall ride upon horses, <I>every one</I> put in array, like a man
 to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.
 &nbsp; 43  The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his
 hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, <I>and</I> pangs as of a
 woman in travail.
 &nbsp; 44  Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of
 Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them
 suddenly run away from her: and who <I>is</I> a chosen <I>man, that</I> I
 may appoint over her? for who <I>is</I> like me? and who will appoint
 me the time? and who <I>is</I> that shepherd that will stand before
 me?
 &nbsp; 45  Therefore hear ye the counsel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that he hath
 taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed
 against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock
 shall draw them out: surely he shall make <I>their</I> habitation
 desolate with them.
 &nbsp; 46  At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved,
 and the cry is heard among the nations.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have in these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Israel's sufferings, and their deliverance out of those sufferings. 
 God takes notice of the bondage of his people in Babylon, as he did of 
 their bondage in Egypt; he has <I>surely seen</I> it, and has <I>heard 
 their cry. Israel and Judah were oppressed together,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 Those that remained of the captives of the ten tribes, upon the uniting 
 of the kingdoms of Assyria and Chaldea, seem to have come and mingled 
 with t hose of the two tribes, and to have mingled tears with them, so 
 that they were <I>oppressed together.</I> They were humble suppliants 
 for their liberty, and that was all; they could not attempt any thing 
 towards it, for <I>all that took them captives held them fast,</I> and 
 were much too hard for them. But this is their comfort in distress, 
 that, though they are weak, <I>their Redeemer is strong</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 <I>their Avenger</I> (so the word signifies), he that has a right to 
 them, and will claim his right and make good his claim. He is stronger 
 than their enemies that hold them fast; he can overpower all the force 
 that is against them, and put strength into his own people though they 
 are very weak. <I>The Lord of hosts is his name,</I> and he will answer 
 to his name, and make it to appear that he is what his people call him, 
 and will be that to them for which they depend upon him. Note, It is 
 the unspeakable comfort of the people of God that, though they have 
 hosts against them, they have <I>the Lord of hosts</I> for them and 
 <I>he shall thoroughly plead their cause,</I> pleading he shall plead 
 it, plead it with jealousy, plead it effectually, plead it and carry 
 it, <I>that he may give rest to the land,</I> and to his people's land, 
 rest from all their enemies round about. This is applicable to all 
 believers, who complain of the dominion of sin and corruption, and of 
 their own weakness and manifold infirmities. Let them know that 
 <I>their Redeemer is strong;</I> he is able to keep what they commit to 
 him, and he will plead their cause. Sin shall not have dominion over 
 them; he will <I>make them free,</I> and they shall be <I>free 
 indeed;</I> he will give them <I>rest,</I> that <I>rest which remains 
 for the people of God.</I></P>

 II. Babylon's sin, and their punishment for that sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The sins they are here charged with are idolatry and persecution. 
 
 (1.) They oppressed the people of God; they <I>held them fast,</I> and
 would not <I>let them go.</I> They <I>opened not the house of his 
 prisoners,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:17">Isa. xiv. 17</A>.

 This was God's quarrel with them, as of old with Pharaoh; it cost him
 dear, and yet they would not take warning. <I>The inhabitants of
 Babylon</I> must be <I>disquieted</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>)
 
 because they have disquieted God's people, whose honour and comfort he 
 is jealous for, and therefore will <I>recompense tribulation to those 
 that trouble them,</I> as well as <I>rest to those that are 
 troubled,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+1:6,7">2 Thess. i. 6, 7</A>.

 (2.) They wronged God himself, and robbed him, giving that glory to
 others which is due to him alone; for

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>)
 
 <I>it is the land of graven images.</I> All parts of the country 
 abounded with idols, and they were mad upon them, were in love with 
 them and doted on them, cared not what cost and pains they were at in 
 the worship of them, were unwearied in paying their respects to them; 
 and in all this they were wretchedly infatuated and acted like men out 
 of their wits; they were carried on in their idolatry without reason or 
 discretion, like men in a perfect fury. The word here used for idols 
 properly signifies <I>terrors--Enim,</I> the name given to giants that
 were formidable, because they made the images of their gods to look 
 frightful, to strike a terror upon fools and children. Their idols were 
 scarecrows, yet they doted on them. Babylon was <I>the mother of 
 harlots</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:5">Rev. xvii. 5</A>),

 the source of idolatry. Note, It is the maddest thing in the world to 
 make a god of any creature; and those who are proud against the Lord, 
 the true God, are justly given up to strong delusions, to be mad upon 
 idols that cannot profit. But this madness is wickedness, for which 
 sinners will be certainly and severely reckoned with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The judgments of God upon them for these sins are such as will quite 
 lay them waste and ruin them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) All that should be their defence and support shall be cut off by 
 the sword. The Chaldeans had long been God's sword, wherewith he had 
 done execution upon the sinful nations round about: but now, they being 
 as bad as any of them, or worse, <I>a sword</I> is brought upon them, 
 even <I>upon the inhabitants of Babylon</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>),

 a sword of war; and, as it is in God's hand, sent and directed by him, 
 it is a sword of justice. It shall be, 

 [1.] <I>Upon their princes;</I> they shall fall by it, and their
 dignity, wealth, and power, shall not secure them.

 [2.] <I>Upon their wise men,</I> their philosophers, their statesmen,
 and privy-counsellors; their learning and policy shall neither secure 
 them nor stand the public in any stead. 

 [3.] <I>Upon</I> their soothsayers and astrologers, here called <I>the
 liars</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>),

 for they cheated with their prognostications of peace and prosperity; 
 the sword upon them shall make them dote, so that they shall talk like 
 fools, and be as men that have lost all their wits. Note, God has a
 sword that can reach the soul and affect the mind, and bring men under 
 spiritual plagues. 

 [4.] <I>Upon their mighty men.</I> A sword shall be upon their spirits;
 if they are not slain, yet <I>they shall be dismayed,</I> and shall be 
 no longer <I>mighty men;</I> for what stead will their hands stand them 
 in when their hearts fail them?
 
 [5.] Upon their militia

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>):

 <I>The sword shall be upon their horses and chariots;</I> the invaders 
 shall make themselves masters of all their warlike stores, shall seize 
 their horses and chariots for themselves, or destroy them. The troops 
 of other nations that were in their service shall be quite 
 disheartened: <I>The mingled people shall become as</I> weak and 
 timorous as <I>women.</I> 

 [6.] Upon their exchequer: The <I>sword</I> shall be <I>upon her
 treasures,</I> which are the sinews of war, <I>and they shall be 
 robbed,</I> and made use of by the enemy against them. See what
 universal destruction the sword makes when it comes with 
 commission.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The country shall be made desolate 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>):

 <I>The waters shall be dried up,</I> the water that secures the city. 
 Cyrus drew the river Euphrates into so many channels as made it 
 passable for his army, so that they got with ease to the walls of 
 Babylon, which, if was thought, that river had rendered inaccessible. 
 "The water likewise that made the country fruitful shall <I>be dried 
 up,</I> so that it shall be turned into barrenness, and shall be no 
 more inhabited by the children of men, but by <I>the wild beasts of the 
 desert,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 This was foretold concerning Babylon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+13:19-21">Isa. xiii. 19-21</A>.

 It shall become like <I>Sodom and Gomorrah,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.

 The same was foretold concerning Edom,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:18"><I>ch.</I> xlix. 18</A>.

 As the Chaldeans had laid Edom waste, so they shall themselves be laid
 waste.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The king and kingdom shall be put into the utmost confusion and 
 consternation by the enemies' invading them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:41-43"><I>v.</I> 41-43</A>.

 All the expressions here used to denote the formidable power of the 
 invaders, the terrors wherewith they should array themselves, and the 
 great fright which both court and country should be put into thereby, 
 we met with before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:22-24"><I>ch.</I> vi. 22-24</A>)

 concerning the Chaldeans' invading the land of Judah. The battle which
 is there said to be <I>against thee, O daughter of Zion!</I> is here 
 said to be <I>against thee, O daughter of Babylon!</I> to intimate that 
 they should be paid in their own coin. God can find out such as shall
 be for terror and destruction to those that are for terror and 
 destruction to others; and those who have dealt cruelly, and have shown 
 no mercy, may expect to be cruelly dealt with, and to find no mercy. 
 Only there is one difference between these passages; there it is said, 
 <I>We have heard the fame thereof and our hands wax feeble;</I> here it 
 is said, <I>The king of Babylon has heard the report and his hands 
 waxed feeble,</I> which intimates that that proud and daring prince 
 shall, in the day of his distress, be as weak and dispirited as the 
 meanest Israelites were in the day of their distress.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) That they shall be as much hurt as frightened, for the invader 
 shall <I>come up like a lion</I> to tear and destroy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>)

 and shall make them and their <I>habitation desolate</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>),

 and the desolation shall be so astonishing that all the nations about 
 shall be terrified by it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>.
 
 These three verses we had before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:19-21"><I>ch.</I> xlix. 19-21</A>)

 in the prophecy of the destruction of Edom, which was accomplished by
 the Chaldeans, and they are here repeated, <I>mutatis mutandis--with a
 few necessary alterations,</I> in the prophecy of the destruction of 
 Babylon, which was to be accomplished upon the Chaldeans, to show that 
 though the distributions of Providence may appear unequal for a time 
 its retributions will be equal at last; when thou shalt make <I>an end 
 to spoil thou shalt be spoiled,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:1,Re+13:10">Isa. xxxiii. 1; Rev. xiii. 10</A>.</P>
