 W<FONT SIZE=-1>HEN</FONT> we entered upon the writings of the prophets, 
 which speak of the <I>things that should be hereafter,</I> we seemed to 
 have the same call that St. John had

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:1">Rev. iv. 1</A>),

 <I>Come up hither;</I> but, when we enter upon the prophecy of this
 book, it is as if the voice said, <I>Come up higher;</I> as we go
 forward in time (for Ezekiel prophesied in the captivity, as Jeremiah
 prophesied just before it), so we soar upward in discoveries yet more
 sublime of the divine glory. These waters of the sanctuary still grow
 deeper; so far are they from being fordable that in some places they
 are scarcely fathomable; yet, deep as they are, out of them flow
 streams which <I>make glad the city of our God, the holy place of the
 tabernacles of the Most High.</I> As to this prophecy now before us, we
 may enquire,

 I. Concerning the penman of it--it was Ezekiel; his name signifies,
 <I>The strength of God,</I> or one <I>girt</I> or <I>strengthened of 
 God.</I> He girded up the loins of his mind to the service, and God put 
 strength into him. Whom God calls to any service he will himself enable 
 for it; if he give commission, he will give power to execute it. 
 Ezekiel's name was answered when God said (and no doubt did as he 
 said), <I>I have made thy face strong against their faces.</I> The 
 learned Selden, in his book <I>De Diis Syris,</I> says that it was the 
 opinion of some of the ancients that the prophet Ezekiel was the same 
 with that Nazaratus Assyrius whom Pythagoras (as himself relates) had 
 for his tutor for some time, and whose lectures he attended. It is 
 agreed that they lived much about the same time; and we have reason to 
 think that many of the Greek philosophers were acquainted with the 
 sacred writings and borrowed some of the best of their notions from 
 them. If we may give credit to the tradition of the Jews, he was put to 
 death by the captives in Babylon, for his faithfulness and boldness in 
 reproving them; it is stated that they dragged him upon the stones till 
 his brains were dashed out. An Arabic historian says that he was put to 
 death and was buried in the sepulchre of Shem the son of Noah. So 
 Hottinger relates, <I>Thesaur. Philol. lib. 2 cap. 1.</I>

 II. Concerning the date of it--the place whence it is dated and the
 time when. The scene is laid in Babylon, when it was a <I>house of 
 bondage</I> to the <I>Israel of God;</I> there the prophecies of this 
 book were preached, there they were written, when the prophet himself, 
 and the people to whom he prophesied, were captives there. Ezekiel and 
 Daniel are the only writing prophets of the Old Testament who lived and 
 prophesied any where but in the land of Israel, except we add Jonah, 
 who was sent to Nineveh to prophesy. Ezekiel prophesied in the 
 beginning of the captivity, Daniel in the latter end of it. It was an 
 indication of God's good-will to them, and his gracious designs 
 concerning them in their affliction, that he raised up prophets among 
 them, both to convince them when, in the beginning of their troubles, 
 they were secure and unhumbled, which was Ezekiel's business, and to 
 comfort them when, in the latter end of their troubles, they were 
 dejected and discouraged. If the Lord had been pleased to kill them, he 
 would not have used such apt and proper means to cure them. 

 III. Concerning the matter and scope of it.

 1. There is much in it that is very mysterious, dark, and hard to be 
 understood, especially in the beginning and the latter end of it, which 
 therefore the Jewish rabbin forbade the reading of to their young men, 
 till they came to be thirty years of age, lest by the difficulties they 
 met with there they should be prejudiced against the scriptures; but if 
 we read these difficult parts of scripture with humility and reverence, 
 and search them diligently, though we may not be able to untie all the 
 knots we meet with, any more than we can solve all the phenomena in the 
 book of nature, yet we may from them, as from the book of nature, 
 gather a great deal for the confirming of our faith and the encouraging 
 of our hope in the God we worship. 

 2. Though the visions here be intricate, such as an elephant may swim 
 in, yet the sermons are mostly plain, such as a lamb may wade in; and 
 the chief design of them is to <I>show God's people their 
 transgressions,</I> that in their captivity they might be repenting and 
 not repining. It should seem the prophet was constantly attended (for 
 we read of their <I>sitting before him as God's people sat to hear his 
 words,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:31"><I>ch.</I> xxxiii. 31</A>),

 and that he was occasionally consulted, for we read of the elders of
 Israel who came to <I>enquire of the Lord</I> by him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:1,3"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 1, 3</A>.

 And as it was of great use to the oppressed captives themselves to have
 a prophet with them, so it was a testimony to their holy religion 
 against their oppressors who ridiculed it and them.

 3. Though the reproofs and the threatenings here are very sharp and
 bold, yet towards the close of the book very comfortable assurances are 
 given of great mercy God had in store for them; and there, at length, 
 we shall meet with something that has reference to gospel times, and 
 which was to have its accomplishment in the kingdom of the Messiah, of 
 whom indeed this prophet speaks less than almost any of the prophets. 
 But by opening the <I>terrors of the Lord</I> he prepares Christ's way. 
 By the law is the knowledge of sin, and so it becomes our 
 <I>school-master to bring us to Christ.</I> The visions which were the 
 prophet's credentials we have

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:1-3:27"><I>ch.</I> i.-iii.</A>,

 the reproofs and threatenings

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+4:1-24:27"><I>ch.</I> iv.-xxiv.</A>

 betwixt which and the comforts which we have in the latter part of the
 book we have messages sent to the nations that bordered upon the land
 of Israel, whose destruction is foretold

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:1-35:15"><I>ch.</I> xxv.-xxxv.</A>),

 to make way for the restoration of God's Israel and the
 re-establishment of their city and temple, which are foretold

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:1-38"><I>ch.</I> xxxvi.</A>

 to the end. Those who would apply the comforts to themselves must apply
 the convictions to themselves.</P>
