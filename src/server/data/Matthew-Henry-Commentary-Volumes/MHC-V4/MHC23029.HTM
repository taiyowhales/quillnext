 This woe to Ariel, which we have in this chapter, is the same with the
 "burden of the valley of vision"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:1"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 1</A>),

 and (it is very probable) points at the same event--the besieging of
 Jerusalem by the Assyrian army, which was cut off there by an angel;
 yet it is applicable to the destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans,
 and its last desolations by the Romans. Here is,

 I. The event itself foretold, that Jerusalem should be greatly
 distressed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:1-4,6">ver. 1-4, 6</A>),

 but that their enemies, who distressed them, should be baffled and
 defeated,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:5,7,8">ver. 5, 7, 8</A>.

 II. A reproof to three sorts of sinners:--

 1. Those that were stupid, and regardless of the warnings which the
 prophet gave them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:9-12">ver. 9-12</A>.

 2. Those that were formal and hypocritical in their religious
 performances, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:13,14">ver. 13, 14</A>.

 3. Those politicians that atheistically and profanely despised God's
 providence, and set up their own projects in competition with it, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:15,16">ver. 15, 16</A>.

 III. Precious promises of grace and mercy to a distinguished remnant
 whom God would sanctify, and in whom he would be sanctified, when their 
 enemies and persecutors should be cut off, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:17-24">ver. 17-24</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city <I>where</I> David dwelt! add ye
 year to year; let them kill sacrifices.
 &nbsp; 2  Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and
 sorrow: and it shall be unto me as Ariel.
 &nbsp; 3  And I will camp against thee round about, and will lay siege
 against thee with a mount, and I will raise forts against thee.
 &nbsp; 4  And thou shalt be brought down, <I>and</I> shalt speak out of the
 ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy
 voice shall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the
 ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.
 &nbsp; 5  Moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small
 dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones <I>shall be</I> as chaff
 that passeth away: yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly.
 &nbsp; 6  Thou shalt be visited of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts with thunder, and
 with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the
 flame of devouring fire.
 &nbsp; 7  And the multitude of all the nations that fight against
 Ariel, even all that fight against her and her munition, and that
 distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision.
 &nbsp; 8  It shall even be as when a hungry <I>man</I> dreameth, and,
 behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as
 when a thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he
 awaketh, and, behold, <I>he is</I> faint, and his soul hath appetite:
 so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against
 mount Zion.

 That it is Jerusalem which is here called <I>Ariel</I> is agreed, for 
 that was the city where David dwelt; that part of it which was called 
 <I>Zion</I> was in a particular manner the city of David, in which both 
 the temple and the palace were. But why it is so called is very 
 uncertain: probably the name and the reason were then well known. 
 Cities, as well as persons, get surnames and nicknames. <I>Ariel</I> 
 signifies <I>the lion of God,</I> or <I>the strong lion:</I> as the 
 lion is king among beasts, so was Jerusalem among the cities, giving 
 law to all about her; it was <I>the city of the great King</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:1,2">Ps. xlviii. 1, 2</A>);

 it was the head-city of Judah, who is called <I>a lion's whelp</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:9">Gen. xlix. 9</A>)

 and whose ensign was a lion; and he that is the lion of the tribe of
 Judah was the glory of it. Jerusalem was a terror sometimes to the
 neighbouring nations, and, while she was a righteous city, was bold as
 a lion. Some make <I>Ariel</I> to signify <I>the altar of
 burnt-offerings,</I> which devoured the beasts offered in sacrifice as
 the lion does his prey. Woe to that altar in the city where David
 dwelt; that was destroyed with the temple by the Chaldeans. I rather
 take it as a woe to Jerusalem, Jerusalem; it is repeated here, as it is
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:37">Matt. xxiii. 37</A>,
 
 that it might be the more awakening. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The distress of Jerusalem foretold. Though Jerusalem be a strong 
 city, as a lion, though a holy city, as a lion of God, yet, if iniquity 
 be found there, woe be to it. It was <I>the city where David dwelt;</I> 
 it was he that brought that to it which was its glory, and which made 
 it a type of the gospel church, and his dwelling in it was typical of 
 Christ's residence in his church. This mentioned as an aggravation of 
 Jerusalem's sin, that in it were set both the testimony of Israel and 
 the <I>thrones of the house of David.</I> 

 1. Let Jerusalem know that her external performance of religious
 services will not serve as an exemption from the judgments of God 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 "<I>Add year to year;</I> go on in the road of your annual feasts, let 
 all your males appear there three times a year before the Lord, and 
 none empty, according to the law and custom, and let them never miss 
 any of these solemnities: <I>let them kill the sacrifices,</I> as they 
 used to do; but, as long as their lives are unreformed and their hearts 
 unhumbled, let them not think thus to pacify an offended God and to 
 turn away his wrath." Note, Hypocrites may be found in a constant track 
 of devout exercises, and treading around in them, and with these they 
 may flatter themselves, but can never please God nor make their peace 
 with him.

 2. Let her know that God is coming forth against her in displeasure, 
 that she shall be <I>visited of the Lord of hosts</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 her sins shall be enquired into and punished: God will reckon for them 
 with terrible judgments, with the frightful alarms and rueful 
 desolations of war, which shall be like <I>thunder and earthquakes, 
 storms and tempests, and devouring fire,</I> especially upon the 
 account of the <I>great noise.</I> When a foreign enemy was not in the 
 borders, but in the bowels of their country, roaring and ravaging, and 
 laying all waste (especially such an army as that of the Assyrians, 
 whose commanders being so very insolent, as appears by the conduct of 
 Rabshakeh, the common soldiers, no doubt, were much more rude), they 
 might see the Lord of those hosts visiting them with thunder and storm.
 Yet, this being here said to be <I>a great noise,</I> perhaps it is 
 intimated that they shall be worse frightened than hurt. Particularly,

 (1.) Jerusalem shall be besieged, straitly besieged. He does not say, 
 <I>I will destroy Ariel,</I> but I <I>will distress Ariel;</I> and she 
 is <I>therefore</I> brought into distress, that, being thereby awakened 
 to repent and reform, she may not be brought to destruction. <I>I will

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 encamp against thee round about.</I> It was the enemy's army that
 encamped against it; but God says that he will do it, for they are his 
 hand, he does it by them. God had often and long, by a host of angels, 
 encamped for them round about them for their protection and 
 deliverance; but now he was <I>turned to be their enemy</I> and fought 
 against them. The siege laid against them was of his laying, and the 
 forts raised against them were of his raising. Note, When men fight 
 against us we must, in them, see God contending with us.

 (2.) She shall be in grief to see the country laid waste and all the 
 fenced cities of Judah in the enemies' hand: <I>There shall be 
 heaviness and sorrow</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 <I>mourning and lamentation</I>--so these two words are sometimes 
 rendered. Those that are most merry and jovial are commonly, when they 
 come to be in distress, most overwhelmed with heaviness and sorrow; 
 their laughter is then turned into mourning. "All Jerusalem
 <I>shall</I> then <I>be unto me as Ariel,</I> as the altar, with fire 
 upon it and slain victims about it:" so it was when Jerusalem was 
 destroyed by the Chaldeans; and many, no doubt, were slain when it was 
 besieged by the Assyrians. "the whole city shall be an altar, in which 
 sinners, falling by the judgments that are abroad, shall be as victims 
 to divine justice." Or thus:--"<I>There shall be heaviness and 
 sorrow;</I> they shall repent, and reform, and return to God, and then 
 it shall be to me as Ariel. Jerusalem shall be like itself, shall
 become to me a Jerusalem again, a holy city,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:26"><I>ch.</I> i. 26</A>.

 (3.) She shall be humbled, and mortified, and made submissive 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):
 
 "<I>Thou shalt be brought down</I> from the height of arrogancy and 
 insolence to which thou hast arrived: the proud looks and the proud 
 language shall be brought down by one humbling providence after 
 another." Those that despise God's judgments shall be humbled by them; 
 for the proudest sinners shall either bend or break before him. They 
 had talked big, had <I>lifted up the horn on high,</I> and had 
 <I>spoken with a stiff neck</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+75:5">Ps. lxxv. 5</A>);

 but now <I>thou shalt speak out of the ground, out of the dust, as one
 that has a familiar spirit, whispering out of the dust.</I> This 
 intimates,

 [1.] That they should be faint and feeble, not able to speak up, nor to 
 say all they would say; but as those who are sick, or whose spirits are 
 ready to fail, their speech shall be low and interrupted. 

 [2.] That they should be fearful, and in consternation, forced to speak 
 low as being afraid lest their enemies should overhear them and take 
 advantage against them.

 [3.] That they should be tame, and obliged to submit to the conquerors.
 When Hezekiah submitted to the king of Assyria, saying, <I>I have 
 offended, that which thou puttest on me I will bear</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:14">2 Kings xviii. 14</A>),
 
 then his speech was low, out of the dust. God can make those to crouch
 that have been most daring, and quite dispirit them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The destruction of Jerusalem's enemies is foretold, for the comfort 
 of all that were her friends and well-wishers in this distress 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:5,7"><I>v.</I> 5, 7</A>):

 "<I>Thou shalt be brought down</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 <I>to speak out of the dust;</I> so low thou shalt be reduced.
 <I>But</I>" (so it may be rendered) "<I>the multitude of thy strangers 
 and thy terrible ones,</I> the numerous armies of the enemy, 
 <I>shall</I> themselves <I>be like small dust,</I> not able to speak at 
 all, or as much as whisper, but <I>as chaff that passes away.</I> Thou 
 shalt be abased, but they shall be quite dispersed, smitten and slain 
 after another manner

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:7"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 7</A>);
 
 they shall pass away, <I>yea it shall be in an instant, suddenly:</I>
 the enemy shall be surprised with the destruction, and you with the 
 salvation." The army of the Assyrians was by an angel laid dead upon 
 the spot, in an instant, suddenly. Such will be the destruction of the 
 enemies of the gospel Jerusalem. <I>In one hour shall their judgment 
 come,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:10">Rev. xviii. 10</A>.
 
 Again
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 <I>"Thou shalt be visited,</I> or (as it used to be rendered) <I>She 
 shall be visited with thunder and a great noise.</I> Thou shalt be put 
 into a fright which thou shalt soon recover. But 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>)

 <I>the multitude of the nations that fight against her shall be as a 
 dream of a night-vision;</I> they and their prosperity and success 
 shall soon vanish past recall." <I>The multitude of the nations that 
 fight against Zion shall be as a hungry man who dreams that he 
 eats,</I> but still is hungry; that is,

 1. Whereas they hoped to make a prey of Jerusalem, and to enrich
 themselves with the plunder of that opulent city, their hopes shall 
 prove vain dreams, with which their fancies may please and sport 
 themselves for a while, but they shall be disappointed. They fancied 
 themselves masters of Jerusalem, but shall never be so. 

 2. They themselves, and all their pomp, and power, and prosperity, 
 shall vanish like a dream when one awakes, shall be of as little value 
 and as short continuance. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:20">Ps. lxxiii. 20</A>.

 He shall <I>fly away as a dream</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:8">Job xx. 8</A>.

 The army of Sennacherib vanished and was gone quickly, though it had
 filled the country as a dream fills a man's head, especially as a dream 
 of meat fills the head of him that went to bed hungry. Many understand 
 these verses as part of the threatening of wrath, when God comes to 
 distress Jerusalem, and lay siege to her.

 (1.) The multitude of her friends, whom she relies upon for help shall 
 do her no good; for, though they are terrible ones, they shall be like 
 the small dust, and shall pass away. 

 (2.) The multitude of her enemies shall never think they can do her 
 mischief enough; but, when they have devoured her much, still they 
 shall be but like a man who dreams he eats, hungry, and greedy to 
 devour her more.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are
 drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong
 drink.
 &nbsp; 10  For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep
 sleep, and hath closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers,
 the seers hath he covered.
 &nbsp; 11  And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a
 book that is sealed, which <I>men</I> deliver to one that is learned,
 saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it
 <I>is</I> sealed:
 &nbsp; 12  And the book is delivered to him that is not learned,
 saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.
 &nbsp; 13  Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near
 <I>me</I> with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have
 removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is
 taught by the precept of men:
 &nbsp; 14  Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work
 among this people, <I>even</I> a marvellous work and a wonder: for the
 wisdom of their wise <I>men</I> shall perish, and the understanding of
 their prudent <I>men</I> shall be hid.
 &nbsp; 15  Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth
 us? and who knoweth us?
 &nbsp; 16  Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed
 as the potter's clay: for shall the work say of him that made it,
 He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed
 it, He had no understanding?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. The prophet stands amazed at the stupidity of the greatest part of 
 the Jewish nation. They had Levites, who taught <I>the good knowledge 
 of the Lord</I> and had encouragement from Hezekiah in doing so, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:22">2 Chron. xxx. 22</A>.

 They had prophets, who brought them messages immediately from God, and
 signified to them what were the causes and what would be the effects of 
 God's displeasure against them. Now, one would think, <I>surely this 
 great nation,</I> that has all the advantages of divine revelation, is 
 <I>a wise and understanding people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:6">Deut. iv. 6</A>.

 But, alas! it was quite otherwise,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 The prophet addresses himself to the sober thinking part of them,
 calling upon them to be affected with the general carelessness of their 
 neighbours. It may be read, "They delay, they put off, their 
 repentance, but wonder you that they should be so sottish. They sport 
 themselves with their own deceivings; they riot and revel; but do you 
 <I>cry out,</I> lament their folly, cry to God by prayer for them. The 
 more insensible they are of the hand of God gone out against them the 
 more do you lay to heart these things." Note, The security of sinners 
 in their sinful way is just matter of lamentation and wonder to all 
 serious people, who should think themselves concerned to pray for those 
 that do not pray for themselves. But what is the matter? What are we
 thus to wonder at?

 1. We may well wonder that the generality of the people should be so
 sottish and brutish, and so infatuated, as if they were intoxicated: 
 <I>They are drunken, but not with wine</I> (not with wine only, though 
 with that they were often drunk), and they <I>erred through wine,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:7"><I>ch.</I> xxviii. 7</A>.
 
 They were drunk with the love of pleasures, with prejudices against
 religion, and with the corrupt principles they had imbibed. Like 
 drunken men, they know not what they do or say, nor whither they go. 
 They are not sensible of the divine rebukes they are under. <I>They 
 have beaten me, and I felt it not,</I> says the drunkard, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:35">Prov. xxiii. 35</A>.
 
 God speaks to them once, yea, twice; but, like men drunk, they perceive
 it not, they understand it not, but forget the law. <I>They stagger</I> 
 in their counsels, are unstable and unsteady, and stumble at every 
 thing that lies in their way. There is such a thing as spiritual 
 drunkenness. 

 2. It is yet more strange that God himself should have <I>poured out 
 upon them a spirit of deep sleep, and closed their eyes</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),
 
 that he who bids them awake and open their eyes should yet lay them to 
 sleep and shut their eyes; but it is in away of righteous judgment, to 
 punish them for their <I>loving darkness rather than light,</I> their 
 loving sleep. When God by his prophets called them they said, <I>Yet a 
 little sleep, a little slumber;</I> and therefore he gave them up to 
 strong delusions, and said, <I>Sleep on now.</I> This is applied to the 
 unbelieving Jews, who rejected the gospel of Christ, and were justly 
 hardened in their infidelity, till wrath came upon them to the 
 uttermost. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:8">Rom. xi. 8</A>,

 <I>God has given them the spirit of slumber.</I> And we have reason to 
 fear it is the woeful case of many who live in the midst of gospel 
 light.

 3. It is very sad that this should be the case with those who were
 their prophets, and rulers, and seers, that those who should have been 
 their guides were themselves blindfolded; and it is easy to tell what 
 the fatal consequences will be when the blind lead the blind. This was 
 fulfilled when, in the latter days of the Jewish church, the chief 
 priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, were the great 
 opposers of Christ and his gospel, and brought themselves under a 
 judicial infatuation. 

 4. The sad effect of this was that all the means of conviction, 
 knowledge, and grace, which they enjoyed, were ineffectual, and did not 
 answer the end 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>):

 "<I>The vision of all the</I> prophets, true and false, <I>has become 
 to you as the words of a book,</I> or letter, <I>that is sealed up;</I> 
 you cannot discern the truth of the real visions and the falsehood of 
 the pretended ones." Or, every vision particularly that this prophet 
 had seen for them, and published to them, had become unintelligible; 
 they had it among them, but were never the wiser for it, any more than 
 a man (though a good scholar) is for a book delivered to him sealed up, 
 and which he must not open the seals of. He sees it is a book, and that 
 is all; he knows nothing of what is in it. So they knew that what 
 Isaiah said was a vision and prophecy, but the meaning of it was hidden 
 from them; it was only a sound of words to them, which they were not at 
 all alarmed by, nor affected with; it answered not the intention, for 
 it made no impression at all upon them. Neither the learned nor the 
 unlearned were the better for all the messages God sent them by his 
 servants the prophets, nor desired to be so. The ordinary sort of 
 people excused themselves from regarding what the prophets said with 
 their want of learning and a liberal education, as if they were not 
 concerned to know and do the will of God because they were not bred 
 scholars: <I>It is nothing to me, I am not learned.</I> Those of better 
 rank pretended that the prophet had a peculiar way of speaking, which 
 was obscure to them, and which, though they were men of letters, they 
 had not been used to; and, <I>Si non vis intelligi, debes negligi--If 
 you wish not to be understood, you deserve to be neglected.</I> Both 
 these are groundless pretences; for God's prophets have been no 
 unfaithful debtors either to the wise or to the unwise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:14">Rom. i. 14</A>.

 Or we may take it thus:--The book of prophecy was given to them sealed,
 so that they could not read it, as a just judgment upon them; because 
 it had often been delivered to them unsealed, and they would not take 
 pains to learn the language of it, and then made excuse for their not 
 reading it because they were not learned. But observe, "The vision has 
 become thus to you whose minds the god of this world has blinded; but 
 it is not so in itself, it is not so to all; the same vision which to 
 you is a <I>savour of death unto death</I> to others is and shall be a 
 <I>savour of life unto life.</I>" Knowledge is easy to him that 
 understands.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The prophet, in God's name, threatens those that were formal and 
 hypocritical in their exercises of devotion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The sin that is here charged upon them--dissembling with God in their
 religious performances, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 He that knows the heart, and cannot be imposed upon with shows and
 pretences, charges it upon them, whether their hearts condemn them for 
 it or no. He that is greater than the heart, and knows all things,
 knows that though they <I>draw nigh to him with their mouth,</I> and 
 <I>honour him with their lips,</I> yet they are not sincere 
 worshippers. To worship God is to make our approaches to him, and to 
 present our adorations of him; it is to draw nigh to him as those that 
 have business with him, with an intention therein to honour him. This 
 we are to do with our mouth and our lips, in speaking of him and in 
 speaking to him; we must <I>render to him the calves of our lips,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:2">Hosea xiv. 2</A>.

 And, if the heart be full of his love and fear, out of the abundance of
 that the mouth will speak. But there are many whose religion is 
 lip-labour only. They say that which expresses an approach to God and 
 an adoration of him, but it is only from the teeth outward. For,

 (1.) They do not apply their minds to the service. When they pretend
 to be speaking to God they are thinking of a thousand impertinences: 
 <I>The have removed their hearts far from me,</I> that they might not 
 be employed in prayer, nor come within reach of the word. When work was 
 to be done for God, which required the heart, that was sent out of the 
 way on purpose, with the fool's eyes, into the ends of the earth. 

 (2.) They do not make the word of God the rule of their worship, nor 
 his will their reason: <I>Their fear towards me is taught by the 
 precept of men.</I> They worshipped the God of Israel, not according to 
 his appointment, but their own inventions, the directions of their 
 false prophets or their idolatrous kings, or the usages of the nations 
 that were round about them. The tradition of the elders was of more 
 value and validity with them than the laws which God commanded Moses. 
 Or, if they did worship God in a way conformable to his institution in 
 the days of Hezekiah, a great reformer, they had more an eye to the 
 precept of the king than to God's command. This our Saviour applies to 
 the Jews in his time, who were formal in their devotions and wedded to 
 their own inventions, and pronounces concerning them that in vain they 
 did worship God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:8,9">Matt. xv. 8, 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It is a spiritual judgment with which God threatens to punish them 
 for their spiritual wickedness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>I will proceed to do a marvellous work.</I> They did one strange 
 thing; they removed all sincerity from their hearts. Now God will go on 
 and do another; he will remove all sagacity from their heads. <I>The 
 wisdom of their wise men shall perish.</I> They played the hypocrite, 
 and thought to put a cheat upon God, and now they are left to 
 themselves to play the fool, and not only to put a cheat upon 
 themselves, but to be easily cheated by all about them. Those that make 
 religion no more than a pretence, to serve a turn, are out in their 
 politics; and it is just with God to deprive those of their 
 understanding who part with their uprightness. This was fulfilled in
 the wretched infatuation which the Jewish nation were manifestly under, 
 after they had rejected the gospel of Christ; they removed their hearts 
 far from God, and therefore God justly removed wisdom far from them, 
 and hid from their eyes the things that belonged even to their temporal 
 peace. This is a marvelous work; it is surprising, it is astonishing, 
 that wise men should of a sudden lose their wisdom and be given up to 
 strong delusions. Judgments on the mind, though least taken notice of, 
 are to be most wondered at.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He shows the folly of those that though to act separately and 
 secretly from God, and were carrying on designs independent upon God 
 and which they projected to conceal from his all-seeing eye. Here we 
 have, 

 1. Their politics described 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 They <I>seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord,</I> that he may 
 not know either what they do or what they design; they say, "Who sees 
 us? No man, and therefore not God himself." The consultations they had 
 about their own safety they kept to themselves, and never asked God's 
 advice concerning them; nay, they knew they were displeasing to him, 
 but thought they could conceal them from him; and, if he did not know 
 them, he could not baffle and defeat them. See what foolish fruitless 
 pains sinners take in their sinful ways; they seek deep, they sink 
 deep, to hide their counsel from the Lord, who sits in heaven and 
 laughs at them. Note, A practical disbelief of God's omniscience is at 
 the bottom both of the carnal worships and of the carnal confidences of 
 hypocrites; 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+94:7,Eze+8:12,9:9">Ps. xciv. 7; Ezek. viii. 12; ix. 9</A>.

 2. The absurdity of their politics demonstrated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 "<I>Surely your turning of things upside down</I> thus, your various 
 projects, turning your affairs this and that way to make them shape as 
 you would have them--or rather your inverting the order of things, and 
 thinking to make God's providence give attendance to your projects, and 
 that God must know no more than you think fit, which is perfectly 
 turning things upside down and beginning at the wrong end--<I>shall be 
 esteemed as the potter's clay.</I> God will turn and manage you, and 
 all your counsels, with as much ease and as absolute a power as the 
 potter forms and fashions his clay." See how God despises, and 
 therefore what little reason we have to dread, those contrivances of 
 men that are carried on without God, particularly those against him.

 (1.) Those that think to hide their counsels from God do in effect deny 
 him to be their Creator. It is as if the work should say of him that 
 made it, "He made me not; I made myself." If God made us, he certainly 
 knows us as the Psalmist shows, 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:1,13-16">Ps. cxxxix. 1, 13-16</A>);

 so that those who say that he does not see them might as well say that
 he did not make them. Much of the wickedness of the wicked arises from 
 this, they forget that God formed them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:18">Deut. xxxii. 18</A>.
 
 Or,

 (2.) Which comes to the same thing, they deny him to be a wise Creator: 
 <I>The thing framed saith of him that framed it, He had no 
 understanding;</I> for if he had understanding to make us so curiously, 
 especially to make us intelligent beings and to <I>put understanding 
 into the inward part</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:36">Job xxxviii. 36</A>),

 no doubt he has understanding to know us and all we say and do. As
 those that quarrel with God, so those that think to conceal themselves 
 from him, do in effect charge him with folly; but <I>he that formed the 
 eye, shall he not see?</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  <I>Is</I> it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be
 turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be
 esteemed as a forest?
 &nbsp; 18  And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book,
 and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of
 darkness.
 &nbsp; 19  The meek also shall increase <I>their</I> joy in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and
 the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
 &nbsp; 20  For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner
 is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off:
 &nbsp; 21  That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for
 him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a
 thing of nought.
 &nbsp; 22  Therefore thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, who redeemed Abraham,
 concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed,
 neither shall his face now wax pale.
 &nbsp; 23  But when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in
 the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the
 Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.
 &nbsp; 24  They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding,
 and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Those that thought to hide their counsels from the Lord were said to 
 turn things upside down 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 and they intended to do it unknown to God; but God here tells them that 
 he will turn things upside down his way; and let us see whose word 
 shall stand, his or theirs. They disbelieve Providence: "Wait awhile," 
 says God, "and you shall be convinced by ocular demonstration that 
 there is a God who governs the world, and that he governs it and orders 
 all the changes that are in it for the good of his church." The 
 wonderful revolution here foretold may refer primarily to the happy 
 settlement of the affairs of Judah and Jerusalem after the defeat of 
 Sennacherib's attempt, and the repose which good people then enjoyed, 
 when they were delivered from the alarms of the sword both of war and 
 persecution. But it may look further, to the rejection of the Jews at 
 the first planting of the gospel (for their hypocrisy and infidelity 
 were here foretold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)

 and the admission of the Gentiles into the church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. In general, it is a great and surprising change that is here 
 foretold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 <I>Lebanon,</I> that was a forest, <I>shall be turned into a fruitful
 field;</I> and Carmel, that was a fruitful field, shall become a 
 forest. It is a counterchange. Note, Great changes, both for the
 better and for the worse, are often made in a very little while. It was 
 a sign given them of the defeat of Sennacherib that the ground should 
 be more than ordinarily fruitful

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:30"><I>ch.</I> xxxvii. 30</A>):

 <I>You shall eat this year such as grows of itself;</I> food for man
 shall be (as food for beasts is) the spontaneous product of the soil. 
 Then Lebanon became a fruitful field, so fruitful that that which used 
 to be reckoned a fruitful field in comparison with it was looked upon 
 but as a forest. When a great harvest of souls was gathered in to
 Christ from among the Gentiles then the wilderness was turned into a 
 fruitful field; and the Jewish church, that had long been a fruitful 
 field, became a desolate and deserted forest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:1"><I>ch.</I> liv. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. In particular,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Those that were ignorant shall become intelligent, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Those that understood not this prophecy (but it was to them as a sealed
 book,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)

 shall, when it is accomplished, understand it, and shall acknowledge,
 not only the hand of God in the event, but the voice of God in the 
 prediction of it: <I>The deaf shall then hear the words of the 
 book.</I> The fulfilling of prophecy is the best exposition of it. The
 poor Gentiles shall then have divine revelation brought among them; and 
 those that sat in darkness shall see a great light, those that were 
 blind shall see out of obscurity; for the gospel was sent to them to 
 <I>open their eyes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:18">Acts xxvi. 18</A>.

 Observe, In order to the making of men fruitful in good affections and
 actions, the course God's grace takes with them is to open their 
 understandings and make them hear the words of God's book.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Those that were erroneous shall become orthodox 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>Those that erred in spirit,</I> that were under mistakes and 
 misapprehensions concerning the words of the book and the meaning of 
 them, shall come to understanding, to a right understanding of things; 
 the Spirit of truth shall rectify their mistakes and lead them into all 
 truth. This should encourage us to pray for <I>those that have erred 
 and are deceived,</I> that God can, and often does, bring such to 
 understanding. Those that murmured at the truths of God as hard 
 sayings, and loved to pick quarrels with them, shall learn the true 
 meaning of these doctrines, and then they will be better reconciled to 
 them. Those that erred concerning the providence of God as to public 
 affairs, and murmured at the disposals of it, when they shall see the 
 issue of things shall better understand them and be aware of what God 
 was designing in all, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:9">Hos. xiv. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Those that were melancholy shall become cheerful and pleasant 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>The meek also shall increase their joy in the Lord.</I> Those who 
 are poor in the world and poor in spirit, who, being in affliction, 
 accommodate themselves to their affliction, are purely passive and not 
 passionate, when they see God appearing for them, they shall 
 <I>add,</I> or <I>repeat, joy in the Lord.</I> This intimates that even 
 in their distress they kept up their joy in the Lord, but now they 
 increased it. Note, Those who, when they are in trouble, can truly 
 rejoice in God, shall soon have cause given them greatly to rejoice in 
 him. When joy in the world is decreasing and fading joy in God is 
 increasing and getting round. This shining light shall shine more and 
 more; for that which is aimed at is that <I>this joy may be full.</I> 
 Even <I>the poor among men</I> may rejoice in the Holy One of Israel, 
 and their poverty needs not deprive them of that joy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:17,18">Hab. iii. 17, 18</A>.
 
 And the meek, the humble, the patient, and dispassionate, shall grow in
 this joy. Note, The grace of meekness will contribute very much to the 
 increase of our holy joy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The enemies, that were formidable, shall become despicable. 
 Sennacherib, that <I>terrible one,</I> and his great army, that put the 
 country into such a consternation, shall be <I>brought to nought</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 shall be quite disabled to do any further mischief. The power of Satan, 
 that terrible one indeed, shall be broken by the prevalency of Christ's 
 gospel; and those that were subject to bondage through fear of him that 
 had the power of death shall be delivered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:14,15">Heb. ii. 14, 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The persecutors, that were vexatious, shall be quieted, and so those 
 they were troublesome to shall be quiet from the fear of them. To 
 complete the repose of God's people, not only the terrible one from 
 abroad shall be brought to nought, but the scorners at home too shall 
 be consumed and cut off by Hezekiah's reformation. Those are a happy 
 people, and likely to be so, who, when God gives them victory and 
 success against their terrible enemies abroad, take care to suppress 
 vice, and profaneness, and the spirit of persecution, those more 
 dangerous enemies at home. Or, They shall be consumed and cut off by 
 the judgments of God, shall be singled out to be made examples of. Or, 
 They shall insensibly waste away, being put to confusion by the 
 fulfilling of those predictions which they had made a jest of. Observe 
 what had been the wickedness of these scorners, for which they should 
 be cut off. They had been persecutors of God's people and prophets, 
 probably of the prophet Isaiah particularly, and therefore he complains 
 thus feelingly of them and of their subtle malice. Some as informers 
 and persecutors, others as judges, did all they could to take away his 
 life, or at least his liberty. And this is very applicable to the chief 
 priests and Pharisees, who persecuted Christ and his apostles, and for 
 that sin they and their nation of scorners were cut off and consumed. 
 
 (1.) They ridiculed the prophets and the serious professors of 
 religion; they despised them, and did their utmost to bring them into 
 contempt; they were scorners, and sat in the seat of the scornful. 

 (2.) They lay in wait for an occasion against them. By their spies they 
 <I>watch for iniquity,</I> to see if they can lay hold of any thing 
 that is said or done that may be called an iniquity. Or they themselves 
 watch for an opportunity to do mischief, as Judas did to betray our 
 Lord Jesus. 

 (3.) They took advantage against them for the least slip of the tongue; 
 and, if a thing were ever so little said amiss, it served them to 
 ground an indictment upon. They <I>made a man,</I> though he were ever 
 so wise and good a man, though he were a man of God, <I>an offender for 
 a word,</I> a word mischosen or misplaced, when they could not but know 
 that it was well meant, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 They cavilled at every word that the prophets spoke to them by way of
 admonition, though ever so innocently spoken, and without any design to 
 affront them. They put the worst construction upon what was said, and 
 made it criminal by strained innuendoes. Those who consider how apt we 
 all are to speak unadvisedly, and to mistake what we hear, will think 
 it very unjust and unfair to <I>make a man an offender for a word.</I>

 (4.) They did all they could to bring those into trouble that dealt 
 faithfully with them and told them of their faults. Those that
 <I>reprove in the gates,</I> reprovers by office, that were bound by 
 the duty of their place, as prophets, as judges, and magistrates, to 
 show people their transgressions, they hated these, and laid snares for 
 them, as the Pharisees' emissaries, who were sent to watch our Saviour 
 that they might <I>entangle him in his talk</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:15">Matt. xxii. 15</A>),

 that they might have something to lay to his charge which might render
 him odious to the people or obnoxious to the government. <I>So 
 persecuted they the prophets;</I> and it is next to impossible for the 
 most cautious to place their words so warily as to escape such snares. 
 See how base wicked people are, who bear ill-will to those who, out of 
 good-will to them, seek to save their souls from death; and see what 
 need reprovers have both of courage to do their duty and of prudence to 
 avoid the snare.

 (5.) They pervert judgment, and will never let an honest man carry an 
 honest cause: <I>They turn aside the just for a thing of nought;</I> 
 they condemn him, or give the cause against him, upon no evidence, no 
 colour or pretence whatsoever. They run a man down, and misrepresent 
 him, by all the little arts and tricks they can devise, as they did our 
 Saviour. We must not think it strange if we see the best of men thus 
 treated; <I>the disciple is not greater than his Master.</I> But wait 
 awhile, and God will not only <I>bring forth their righteousness,</I> 
 but cut off and consume these scorners.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. Jacob, who was made to blush by the reproaches, and made to tremble 
 by the threatenings, of his enemies, shall now be relieved both against 
 his shame and against his fear, by the rolling away of those reproaches 
 and the defeating of those threatenings 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>Thus the Lord saith who redeemed Abraham,</I> that is, called him 
 out of Ur of the Chaldees, and so rescued him from the idolatry of his 
 fathers and plucked him as a <I>brand out of the fire.</I> He that 
 redeemed Abraham out of his snares and troubles will redeem all that 
 are by faith his genuine seed out of theirs. He that began his care of 
 his church in the redemption of Abraham, when it and its Redeemer were 
 in his loins, will not now cast off the care of it. Because the enemies 
 of his people are so industrious both to blacken them and to frighten 
 them, therefore he will appear for the house of Jacob, and they shall 
 not be ashamed as they have been, but shall have wherewith to answer 
 those that reproach them, nor shall <I>their faces now wax pale;</I> 
 but they shall gather courage, and look their enemies in the face 
 without change of countenance, as those have reason to do who have the 
 God of Abraham on their side.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. Jacob, who thought his family would be extinct and the entail of 
 religion quite cut off, shall have the satisfaction of seeing a 
 numerous progeny devoted to God for a generation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 (1.) He shall see his children, multitudes of believers and praying 
 people, the spiritual seed of faithful Abraham and wrestling Jacob. 
 Having his quiver full of these arrows, he <I>shall not be ashamed</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>)

 but shall speak with his enemy in the gate, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+127:5">Ps. cxxvii. 5</A>.

 Christ shall <I>not be ashamed</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:7"><I>ch.</I> l. 7</A>),

 for <I>he shall see his seed</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:10"><I>ch.</I> liii. 10</A>);

 he sees some, and foresees more, <I>in the midst of him,</I> flocking
 to the church, and residing there. 

 (2.) His children are the work of God's hands; being formed by him, 
 they are formed for him, his <I>workmanship, created unto good 
 works.</I> It is some comfort to parents to think that their children 
 are God's creatures, the work of the hands of his grace. 

 (3.) He and his children shall sanctify the name of God as their God, 
 as <I>the Holy One of Jacob,</I> and shall fear and worship the God of 
 Israel. This is opposed to his being ashamed and waxing pale; when he
 is delivered from his contempts and dangers he shall not magnify 
 himself, but <I>sanctify the Holy One of Jacob.</I> If God make our 
 condition easy, we must endeavour to make his name glorious. Parents 
 and children are ornaments and comforts indeed to each other when they 
 join in sanctifying the name of God. When parents give up their
 children, and children give up themselves, to God, to be <I>to him for 
 a name and a praise,</I> then the forest will soon become a fruitful 
 field.</P>
