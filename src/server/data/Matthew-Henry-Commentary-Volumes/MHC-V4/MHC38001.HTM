 In this chapter, after the introduction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:1">ver. 1</A></A>),

 we have,

 I. An awakening call to a sinful people to repent of their sins and
 return to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:2-6">ver. 2-6</A>.

 II. Great encouragement given to hope for mercy. 

 1. By the vision of the horses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:7-11">ver. 7-11</A>.

 2. By the prayer of the angel for Jerusalem, and the answer to that 
 prayer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:12-17">ver. 12-17</A>.

 3. By the vision of the four carpenters that were employed to cut off
 the four horns with which Judah and Jerusalem were scattered,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the
 word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of
 Iddo the prophet, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath been sore displeased with your fathers.
 &nbsp; 3 Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts;
 Turn ye unto me, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, and I will turn unto
 you, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts.
 &nbsp; 4 Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have
 cried, saying, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts; Turn ye now from
 your evil ways, and <I>from</I> your evil doings: but they did not
 hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 5 Your fathers, where <I>are</I> they? and the prophets, do they
 live for ever?
 &nbsp; 6 But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants
 the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they
 returned and said, Like as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts thought to do unto
 us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath
 he dealt with us.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The foundation of Zechariah's ministry; it is laid in a divine 
 authority: <I>The word of the Lord came to him.</I> He received a 
 divine commission to be God's mouth to the people and with it 
 instructions what to say. He received of the Lord that which also he 
 delivered unto them. <I>The word of the Lord was to him;</I> it came in 
 the evidence and demonstration of the Spirit, as a real thing, and not 
 a fancy. For the ascertaining of this, we have here, 

 1. The time when the word of the Lord came first to him, or when the
 word that next follows came to him: it was <I>in the second year of 
 Darius.</I> Before the captivity the prophets dated their writings by 
 the reigns of the kings of Judah and Israel; but now by the reigns of 
 the kings of Persia, to whom they were subjects. Such a melancholy 
 change had sin made of their circumstances. Zerubbabel took not so much 
 state upon him as to have public acts dated by the years of his 
 government, and in things of this nature the prophets, as is fit, 
 complied with the usage of the time, and scrupled not to reckon by the 
 years of the heathen kings, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:1,8:1">Dan. vii. 1; viii. 1</A>.

 Zechariah preached his first sermon in the <I>eighth month</I> of this
 <I>second year</I> of Darius; Haggai preached his in the sixth month of 
 the same year,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:1">Hag. i. 1</A>.

 The people being readily obedient to the word of the Lord in the mouth
 of Haggai, God blessed them with another prophet; for to him that has,
 and uses well what he has, more shall be given. 

 2. The name and family of the prophet to whom the word of the Lord
 came; He was <I>Zechariah, the son of Barachiah, the son of Iddo,</I> 
 and he was <I>the prophet,</I> as Haggai is called <I>the prophet,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:1">Hag. i. 1</A>.

 For, though in former ages there was one Iddo a prophet

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:15">2 Chron. xii. 15</A>),

 yet we have no reason to think that Zechariah was of his progeny, or
 should be denominated from him. The learned Mr. Pemble is decidedly of 
 opinion that this Zechariah, the son of Barachiah, is the same that our 
 Saviour says was <I>slain between the temple and the altar,</I> perhaps 
 many years after the rebuilding of the temple

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:35">Matt. xxiii. 35</A>),

 and that our Saviour does not mean (as is commonly thought) Zechariah
 the son of Jehoiada, for why should Jehoiada be called Barachiah? And 
 he thinks the manner of Christ's account persuades us to think so; for, 
 reckoning up the innocent blood shed by the Jews, he begins at Abel, 
 and ends even in the last of the holy prophets. Whereas, after 
 Zechariah the son of Jehoiada, many prophets and righteous men were put 
 to death by them. It is true there is no mention made in any history of 
 their slaying this Zechariah, but Josephus might industriously conceal 
 that shame of his nation. Perhaps what Zechariah spoke in his 
 prophesying concerning Christ of his being sold, his being wounded in 
 the house of his friends, and the shepherd being smitten, was verified 
 in the prophet himself, and so he became a type of Christ. Probably, 
 being assaulted by his persecutors, he took sanctuary in the court of 
 the priests (and some think he was himself a priest), and so was slain 
 between the porch and the altar.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The first-fruits of Zechariah's ministry. Before he came to visions 
 and revelations, and delivered his prophetic discourses, he preached 
 that which was plain and practical; for it is best to begin with that. 
 Before he published the promises of mercy, he published calls to 
 repentance, for thus <I>the way of the Lord</I> must be 
 <I>prepared.</I> Law must be first preached, and then gospel. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The prophet here puts them in mind of the controversy God had had 
 with their fathers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>The Lord has been sorely displeased with your fathers,</I> and has 
 laid them under the tokens of his displeasure. You have heard with your 
 ears, and your fathers have told you of it; you have seen with your 
 eyes the woeful remains of it. God's quarrel with you has been of long 
 standing, and therefore it is time for you to think of taking it up." 
 Note, The judgments of God, which those that went before us were under, 
 should be taken as warnings to us not to tread in their steps, and 
 calls to repentance, that we may cut off the entail of the curse and 
 get it turned into a blessing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He calls them, in God's name, to return to him, and make their peace 
 with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 God by him says that to this backsliding people which he had often said 
 by his servants the prophets: "<I>Turn you to me</I> in a way of faith 
 and repentance, duty and obedience, and <I>I will turn to you</I> in a 
 way of favour and mercy, peace and reconciliation." Let the rebels 
 return to their allegiance, and they shall be taken under the 
 protection of the government and enjoy all the privileges of good 
 subjects. Let them change their way, and God will change his. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:7">Mal. iii. 7</A>.

 But that which is most observable here is that God is called here the
 <I>Lord of hosts</I> three times: "<I>Thus saith the Lord of hosts.</I> 
 It is he that speaks, and therefore you are bound to regard what he 
 says." <I>Turn you to me, saith the Lord of hosts</I> (this intimates 
 the authority and obligation of the command), <I>and I will turn to 
 you, saith the Lord of hosts</I>--this intimates the validity and value 
 of the promise; so that it is no vain repetition. Note, The
 consideration of God's almighty power and sovereign dominion should 
 both engage and encourage sinners to repent and turn to him. It is very 
 desirable to have the Lord of hosts our friend and very dreadful to 
 have him our enemy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He warns them not to persist in their impenitence, as their fathers 
 had done 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Be you not as your fathers.</I> Instead of being hardened in their 
 evil courses by the example of their fathers' sins, let them rather be 
 deterred from them by the example of their fathers' punishment. We are 
 apt to be governed very much by precedent, and we are well or ill 
 governed according to the use we make of the precedents before us. The 
 same examples to some are a savour of life unto life, to others a 
 savour of death unto death. Some argued, "Shall we be wiser than our 
 fathers? They never minded the prophets, and why then should we mind 
 them? They made laws against them, and why should we tolerate them?" 
 But they are here taught how they should argue: "Our fathers slighted 
 the prophets, and God was sorely displeased with them for it; therefore 
 let us the more carefully regard what God says to us by his prophets." 
 "Review what is past, and observe,"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) "What was the message that God sent by his servants the prophets 
 to your fathers: <I>The former prophets cried to your fathers.</I> 
 cried aloud, and did not spare, not spare themselves, not spare your 
 fathers; they cried as men in earnest, as men that would be heard; they 
 spoke not as from themselves, but in the name of <I>the Lord of 
 hosts;</I> and this was the substance of what they said, the burden of 
 every song, the application of every sermon--<I>Turn you now from your
 evil ways, and from your evil doings;</I> the very same that we now 
 preach to you. Be persuaded to leave your sins; resolve to have no more 
 to do with them. A speedy reformation is the only way to prevent an 
 approaching ruin: <I>Turn you now</I> from sin to God without 
 delay."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) "How little this message was regarded by your fathers: <I>But they 
 did not hear,</I> they did not heed. They turned a deaf ear to these 
 calls: <I>They would not hearken unto me, saith the Lord.</I> They 
 would not be reclaimed, would not be ruled, by the word I sent them; 
 say not then that you will do as your fathers did, for they did amiss;" 
 see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+44:17">Jer. xliv. 17</A>.

 Note, We must not follow the examples of our dear fathers unless they
 were God's dear children, nor any further than they were dutiful and 
 obedient to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) "What has become both of your fathers and of the prophets that 
 preached to them? They are all dead and gone," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 [1.] <I>Your fathers, where are they?</I> The whole generation of them 
 is swept away, and their place knows them no more. Note, When we think 
 of our ancestors, that have gone through the world and gone out of it 
 before us, we should think, <I>Where are they?</I> Here they were, in 
 the towns and countries where we live, passing and repassing in the 
 same streets, dwelling in the same houses, trading in the same shops 
 and exchanges, worshipping God in the same churches. But where are 
 they? They are somewhere still; when they died there was not an end of
 them. They are in eternity, in the world of spirits, the unchangeable
 world, to which we are hastening apace. Where are they? Those of them 
 that lived and died in sin are in torment, and we are warned by Moses 
 and the prophets, Christ and his apostles, to look to it that we 
 <I>come not to that place of torment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:28,29">Luke xvi. 28, 29</A>.

 Those of them that lived and died in Christ are in paradise; and, if we
 live and die as they did, we shall be with them shortly, with them 
 eternally.

 [2.] <I>The prophets</I> also, <I>did they live for ever?</I> No, they 
 are gone too. The treasure is put into earthen vessels, the water of 
 life into earthen pitchers, often cracked, and brought home broken at 
 last. Christ is a prophet that lives for ever, but all other prophets
 have a period put to their office. Note, Ministers are dying men, and 
 live not for ever in this world. They are to look upon themselves as 
 such, and to preach accordingly, as those that must be silenced 
 shortly, and know not which sermon may be the last. People are to look 
 upon them as such, and to hear accordingly, as those that yet a little 
 while have the <I>light with them,</I> that they may walk and work 
 <I>while they have the light.</I> Oh that this weighty consideration 
 had its due weight given it, that we are dying ministers dealing with 
 dying people about the concerns of immortal souls and an awful 
 eternity, which both they and we are standing upon the brink of! It 
 concerns us to think of the prophets that are gone, that were <I>before 
 us of old,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+28:8">Jer. xxviii. 8</A>.

 Those that were the glory of men withered and fell; but the <I>word of
 the Lord endures for ever,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:24,25">1 Pet. i. 24, 25</A>.

 The prophets that are now, do <I>we live for ever?</I> (so some read
 it); no, Haggai and Zechariah will not be long with you, and prophecy 
 itself shall shortly cease. In another world both we and our prophets 
 shall live for ever; and to prepare for that world ought to be our 
 great care and business in this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) "What were the effects of the word which God spoke to them by his 
 prophets, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 The preachers died, and the hearers died, but the word of God died not; 
 that took effect, and not one iota or tittle of it fell to the ground." 
 As the <I>rain</I> and <I>snow</I> from heaven, <I>it shall not return 
 void,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:11">Isa. lv. 11</A>.
 
 He appealed to themselves; they knew very well,
 
 [1.] That the judgments God had threatened were executed upon their
 fathers, and they were made to feel what they would not believe and 
 fear: "<I>My statutes which I commanded my servants the prophets,</I> 
 the precepts with the penalties annexed, which I charged them with the 
 delivery of, <I>did they not take hold of your fathers?</I>" Though 
 God's prophets could not fasten convictions upon them, the calamities 
 threatened overtook them, and they could not escape them, nor get out 
 of the reach of them. God's words took hold of them as the bailiff 
 arrests the debtor, and takes him in execution for contempt. Note, The 
 unbelief of man cannot make the threatenings of God's word of no 
 effect, but, sooner or later, they will take place, if the prescribed 
 course be not taken to prevent the execution of them. God's anger will
 certainly take hold of those that will not be taken hold of by his 
 authority; for when he judges he will overcome. 

 [2.] That they themselves could not but own the accomplishment of the 
 word of God in the judgments of God that were upon them, and that 
 therein he was righteous, and had done them no wrong: <I>They returned, 
 and said</I> (they changed their mind, and when it was too late to 
 prevent the ruin of their nation they acknowledged), <I>Like as the 
 Lord of hosts thought to do unto us according to our ways and 
 doings,</I> to reckon with us for them, <I>so has he dealt with us,</I> 
 and we must acknowledge both his truth and his justice, must blame 
 ourselves only, and have no blame to lay to him. <I>Sero sapiunt 
 Phryges--It is late before the Phrygians become wise.</I> This 
 after-wit, as it is a proof of the truth of God, so it is a proof of 
 the folly of men, who will look no further than they can see. They 
 would never be persuaded to say in time, "God will be as good as his 
 word, for he is faithful; he will deal with us according to our 
 deserts, for he is righteous." But now they see both plainly enough 
 when the sentence is executed; now he that runs may read, and publish 
 the exact agreement that appears between the present providences and 
 the former predictions which then were slighted, between the present 
 punishments and the former sins which then were persisted in. Now they 
 cannot but say, <I>The Lord is righteous,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7 Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which
 <I>is</I> the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo
 the prophet, saying,
 &nbsp; 8 I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and
 he stood among the myrtle trees that <I>were</I> in the bottom; and
 behind him <I>were there</I> red horses, speckled, and white.
 &nbsp; 9 Then said I, O my lord, what <I>are</I> these? And the angel that
 talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these <I>be.</I>
 &nbsp; 10 And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and
 said, These <I>are they</I> whom the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath sent to walk to and fro
 through the earth.
 &nbsp; 11 And they answered the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> that stood among the
 myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the
 earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.
 &nbsp; 12 Then the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> answered and said, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of
 hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the
 cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these
 threescore and ten years?
 &nbsp; 13 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> answered the angel that talked with me <I>with</I>
 good words <I>and</I> comfortable words.
 &nbsp; 14 So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou,
 saying, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem
 and for Zion with a great jealousy.
 &nbsp; 15 And I am very sore displeased with the heathen <I>that are</I> at
 ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward
 the affliction.
 &nbsp; 16 Therefore thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; I am returned to Jerusalem
 with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of
 hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 17 Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts; My cities
 through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall
 yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We not come to visions and revelations of the Lord; for in that way God 
 chose to speak by Zechariah, to awaken the people's attention, and to 
 engage their humble reverence of the word and their humble enquiries 
 into it, and to fix it the more in their minds and memories. Most of 
 the following visions seem designed for the comfort of the Jews, now 
 newly returned out of captivity, and their encouragement to go on with 
 the building of the temple. The scope of this vision (which is as an 
 introduction to the rest) is to assure the Jews of the care God took of 
 them, and the eye of his providence that was upon them for good, now in 
 their present state, when they seem to be deserted, and their case 
 deplorable. The vision is dated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>)

 <I>the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month,</I> three months after 
 he preached that sermon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 in which he calls them to repentance from the consideration of God's 
 judgments. Finding that that sermon had a good effect, and that they 
 returned to God in a way of duty, the assurances he had given them are 
 confirmed, that God would return to them in a way of mercy. Now observe 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What the prophet saw, and the explication of that. 

 1. He saw a grove of <I>myrtle-trees,</I> a dark shady grove, down
 <I>in a bottom,</I> hidden by the adjacent hills, so that you were not 
 aware of it till you were just upon it. This represented the low, dark, 
 solitary, melancholy condition of the Jewish church at this time. They 
 were over-topped by all their neighbours, buried in obscurity; what 
 friends they had were hidden, and there appeared no way of relief and 
 succour for them. Note, The church has not been always visible, but 
 sometimes hidden, as the <I>woman in the wilderness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:6">Rev. xii. 6</A>.

 2. He saw <I>a man</I> mounted upon <I>a red horse,</I> standing in the 
 midst of this shady myrtle-grove. This man is no other than the <I>man 
 Christ Jesus,</I> the same that appeared to Joshua with <I>his sword 
 drawn in his hand</I> as <I>captain of the host of the Lord</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+5:13,14">Josh. v. 13, 14</A>)
 
 and to John with his <I>bow</I> and his <I>crown,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:2">Rev. vi. 2</A>.

 Though the church was in a low condition, yet Christ was present in the 
 midst of it. Was it hidden by the hills? He was much more hidden in the 
 myrtle-grove, yet hidden as in an ambush, ready to appear for the 
 seasonable relief of his people, to their happy surprise. Compare 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:15">Isa. xlv. 15</A>,

 <I>Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself,</I> and yet <I>Israel's 
 God and Saviour</I> at the same time, their <I>Holy One in the midst of 
 them.</I> He was <I>riding,</I> as a man of war, as a man in haste, 
 <I>riding on the heavens for the help</I> of his people,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:26">Deut. xxxiii. 26</A>.

 He rode on a <I>red horse,</I> either naturally so or dyed red with the
 blood of war, as this same victorious prince appeared <I>red in his
 apparel,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:1,2">Isa. lxiii. 1, 2</A>.

 Red is a fiery colour, denoting that he is <I>jealous for Jerusalem</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)

 and very angry at her enemies. Christ, under the law, appeared on a red
 horse, denoting the terror of that dispensation, and that he had yet 
 his conflict before him, when he was to <I>resist unto blood.</I> But, 
 under the gospel, he appears on <I>a white horse</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:2,19:11">Rev. vi. 2,
 and again <I>ch.</I> xix. 11</A>),

 denoting that he has now gained the victory, and rides in triumph, and
 hangs out the white, not the bloody flag. 

 3. He saw a troop of horse attending him, ready to receive and obey his
 orders: <I>Behind him there were some red horses, and</I> some 
 <I>speckled, and</I> some <I>white,</I> angels attending the Lord 
 Jesus, ready to be employed by him for the service of his church, some 
 in acts of judgment, others of mercy, others in mixed events. Note, The 
 King of the church has angels at command, not only to do him honour, 
 but to minister for the good of those that are his. 

 4. He enquired into the signification of this vision. He had an angel
 talking with him, as his instructor, besides those he saw in the 
 vision; so had Ezekiel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:3"><I>ch.</I> xl. 3</A>),
 
 and Daniel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:16"><I>ch.</I> viii. 16</A>.

 Zechariah asked him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 <I>O my Lord! what are these?</I> And, it should seem this <I>angel 
 that talked with him</I> was Christ himself, the <I>man on the red 
 horse,</I> whom the rest were attendants on; to him immediately 
 Zechariah addresses himself. Would we be acquainted with the mysteries 
 of the kingdom of heaven, we must make our application, not to angels 
 (they are themselves learners), but to Christ himself, who is alone 
 <I>able to take the book, and open the seals,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:7">Rev. v. 7</A>.

 The prophet's question implies a humble acknowledgment of his own 
 ignorance and an earnest desire to be informed. O let me know what 
 these are! This he desired, not for the satisfying of his curiosity,
 but that he might be furnished with something proper for the comfort 
 and encouragement of the people of God, in their present distress. 

 5. He received from the <I>angel that talked with</I> him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 and from <I>the man that stood among the myrtle-trees</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 the interpretation of this vision. Note, Jesus Christ is ready to 
 instruct those that are humbly desirous to be taught the things of God. 
 He immediately said, <I>I will show thee what these are.</I> What 
 knowledge we have, or may have, concerning the world of spirits, we are 
 indebted to Christ for. The account given him was, <I>These are those 
 whom the Lord has sent:</I> they are his messengers, his envoys, 
 appointed (as his eyes are said to do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+16:9">2 Chron. xvi. 9</A>)

 to <I>walk,</I> to <I>run,</I> to fly swiftly <I>through the earth,</I>
 to observe what is done in it and to execute the divine commands. God 
 needs them not, but he is pleased to employ them, and we need the 
 comfort arising from the doctrine of their administration.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What the prophet heard, and what instructions were thereby given 
 him. Faith comes by hearing, and, generally, in visions there was 
 something said.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He heard the report or representation which the angels made to 
 Christ of the present state of the world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 They had been out abroad, as flying posts (<I>being hastened by the
 King of kings' commandment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+3:15">Esth. iii. 15</A>),

 and, having returned, they give this account to the <I>Angel that stood 
 among the myrtle-trees</I> (for to the Lord Jesus angels themselves are 
 accountable): <I>We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, 
 behold all the earth sits still and is at rest.</I> We are taught to 
 pray that the will of God may be done by men on earth as it is done by 
 the angels in heaven; and here we see what need we have to pray so, for 
 it is far from being so. For,

 (1.) We find the world of angels here very busy. Those that are
 employed in the court above rest not day nor night from praising God, 
 which is their business there; and those that are employed in the camp 
 below are never idle, nor lose time; they are still <I>ascending and 
 descending</I> upon <I>the Son of man</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:51">John i. 51</A>,
 
 as on Jacob's ladder,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+28:12">Gen. xxviii. 12</A>);

 they are still <I>walking to and fro through the earth.</I> Thus
 active, thus industrious, <I>Satan</I> owns himself to be in doing 
 mischief, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:7">Job i. 7</A>.

 It is well for us that good angels bestir themselves as much to do
 good, and that here in this earth we have guardians going about 
 continually seeking to do us a kindness, as we have adversaries which, 
 as roaring lions, go about continually, seeking to devour us. Though
 holy angels in this earth meet with a great deal that is disagreeable, 
 yet, while they are going on God's errands, they hesitate not to 
 <I>walk to and fro through it.</I> Their own habitation, which those 
 that fell liked not, they will like the better when they return.

 (2.) We find the world of mankind here very careless: <I>All the earth
 sits still, and is at rest,</I> while all the church is made uneasy, 
 <I>tossed with tempests and not comforted.</I> Those that are strangers 
 to the church are secure; those that are enemies to it are successful.
 The Chaldeans and Persians dwell at ease, while the poor Jews are 
 continually alarmed; as when <I>the king and Haman sat down to drink, 
 but the city Shushan was perplexed.</I> The children of men are merry 
 and jovial, but <I>none grieve for the affliction</I> of God's 
 children. Note, It is sad to think what a deep sleep the world is cast 
 into, what a spirit of slumber has seized the generality of mankind, 
 that are under God's wrath and Satan's power, and yet secure and 
 unconcerned! They sit still and are at rest,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:26">Luke xvii. 26</A>,

 &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He heard Christ's intercession with the Father for his afflicted 
 church, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 The angels related the posture of affairs in this lower world, but we 
 read not of any prayers they made for the redress of the grievances 
 they had made a remonstrance of. No; it is <I>the Angel among the 
 myrtle-trees</I> that is the great intercessor. Upon the report of the 
 angels he immediately turned heavenward, and said, <I>Lord, wilt thou 
 not have mercy</I> on thy church? 

 (1.) The thing he intercedes for is <I>mercy;</I> as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+85:7">Ps. lxxxv. 7</A>,

 <I>Show us thy mercy, O Lord!</I> Note, God's mercy is all in all to
 the church's comfort; and all his mercy must be hoped for through 
 Christ's mediation.

 (2.) The thing he complains of is the delay of this mercy: <I>How long
 wilt thou not have mercy!</I> He knows that <I>mercies</I> through him 
 <I>shall be built up for ever</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:2">Ps. lxxxix. 2</A>),

 but thinks it long that the building is deferred.

 (3.) The objects of compassion recommended to the divine mercies are,
 Jerusalem, the holy city, and the other cities of Judah that were now 
 in ruins; for God had had <I>indignation against them</I> now 
 <I>threescore and ten years.</I> He mentions seventy years because that 
 was the time fixed in the divine councils for the continuance of the 
 captivity; so long the indignation lasted, and though <I>now for a 
 little space grace</I> had been <I>shown them from the Lord their 
 God,</I> to <I>give them some reviving</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+9:8">Ezra ix. 8</A>),

 yet the scars of those seventy years' captivity still remained so deep,
 so painful, that this is the melancholy string they still harp 
 upon--the divine indignation during those seventy years. Dr. Lightfoot 
 thinks that whereas the seventy years of the captivity were reckoned 
 from Jehoiakim's fourth year, and ended in the first of Cyrus, these 
 seventy years are to be computed from the eleventh of Zedekiah, when 
 Jerusalem and the temple were burnt, about nineteen years after the 
 first captivity, and which ended in this second year of Darius 
 Hystaspes, about seventeen years after Cyrus's proclamation, as that 
 seventy years mentioned

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+7:5"><I>ch.</I> vii. 5</A>

 was about nineteen years after; the captivity went off, as it came on,
 gradually. "Lord, we are still under the burden of the seventy years' 
 wrath, <I>and wilt thou be angry with us for ever?</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He heard a gracious reply given to this intercession of Christ's for 
 his church; for it is a prevailing intercession, always acceptable, 
 <I>and him the Father heareth always</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>The Lord answered the angel,</I> this angel of the covenant, <I>with 
 good words and comfortable words,</I> with promises of mercy and 
 deliverance, and the perfecting of what he had begun in favour to them. 
 These were comfortable words to Christ, who is grieved in the 
 grievances of his church, and comfortable to all that mourn with Zion. 
 God often answers prayer with good words, when he does not immediately 
 appear in great works; and those good words are real answers to prayer. 
 Men's good words will not feed the body 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:16">Jam. ii. 16</A>),

 but God's good words will feed the faith, for saying and doing with him
 are not two things, though they are with us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He heard that reply which was given to the angel repeated to 
 himself, with a commission to publish it to the children of his people, 
 for their comfort. <I>The revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to 
 him</I> he <I>signified to his servant John,</I> and by him <I>to the 
 churches,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:1,4">Rev. i. 1, 4</A>.

 Thus all the good words and comfortable words of the gospel we receive 
 from Jesus Christ, as he received them from the Father, in answer to 
 the prayer of his blood, and his ministers are appointed to preach them 
 <I>to all the world.</I> Now that God would <I>speak comfortably to 
 Jerusalem,</I> Zechariah is <I>the voice of one crying in the 
 wilderness, Prepare you the way of the Lord. The voice said, Cry. Cry 
 then.</I> The prophets must now cry as loudly to show God's people 
 their comforts as ever they did formerly to show them <I>their 
 transgressions,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:2,3,6">Isa. xl. 2, 3, 6</A>.

 And if he ask, <I>What shall I cry?</I> he is here instructed. 

 (1.) He must proclaim the wrath God has in store for the enemies of
 Jerusalem. He is <I>jealous for Zion with great jealousy,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 He takes himself to be highly affronted by the injuries and indignities 
 that are done to his church, as he had been formerly by the iniquities 
 found in his church. The earth <I>sat still and was at rest</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 not relenting at all, nor showing the least remorse, for all the 
 mischief they had done to Jerusalem, as Joseph's brethren, who, when 
 they had sold him, sat down to eat bread; and this God took very ill 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>I am very sorely displeased with the heathen, that are at ease,</I> 
 and have no concern for the afflicted church. Much more will he be 
 displeased with those that are <I>at ease in Zion</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:1">Amos vi. 1</A>),

 with Zion's own sons, that sympathize not with her in her sorrows. But
 this was not all; they were not only not concerned for her, but they 
 were concerned against her: <I>I was but a little displeased</I> with 
 my people, and designed to correct them moderately, but those that were 
 employed as instruments of the correction cast off all pity, and with 
 the greatest rage and malice <I>helped forward the affliction</I> and 
 added to it, <I>persecuting those whom God had smitten</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:26">Ps. lxix. 26</A>)
 
 and insulting over those whom he had troubled. See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:6,Isa+10:5,Eze+25:12,15">Isa. xlvii. 6; x. 5; 
 Ezek. xxv. 12, 15</A>.

 Note, God is displeased with those who help forward the affliction even
 of such as suffer justly; for true humanity, in such a case, is good
 divinity. 

 (2.) He must proclaim the mercy God has in store for Jerusalem and the 
 <I>cities of Judah,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 He must cry, "<I>Thus saith the Lord, I have returned to Jerusalem with
 mercies.</I> I was going away in wrath, but I am now returning in love.
 <I>Cry yet</I> to the same purport," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 There must now be line upon line for consolation, as formerly there had 
 been for conviction. <I>The Lord,</I> even the Lord of hosts, assures
 them, 

 [1.] That the temple shall be built that is now but in the building. 
 This good work which they are now about, though it meet with much 
 discouragement, shall be perfected, and they shall have the tokens of 
 God's presence, and opportunities of conversing with him, and 
 worshipping him, as formerly. Note, It is good news indeed to any
 place to hear that God will build his house in it.

 [2.] That Jerusalem shall again be <I>built as a city compact 
 together,</I> which had formerly been its glory, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+122:3">Ps. cxxii. 3</A>.

 <I>A line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem,</I> in order to the
 rebuilding of it with great exactness and uniformity.

 [3.] That the nation shall again become populous and rich, though now 
 diminished and impoverished. Not only Jerusalem, but other cities that 
 are reduced and lie in a little compass, shall yet <I>spread 
 abroad,</I> or be diffused; their suburbs shall extend far, and 
 colonies shall be transplanted from them; and this <I>through 
 prosperity:</I> they shall be so numerous, and so wealthy, that there 
 shall not be room for them; they shall complain that <I>the place is 
 too strait,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:20">Isa. xlix. 20</A>.

 As they had been scattered and spread abroad, through their calamities, 
 so they should now be through their prosperity. <I>Let thy fountains be 
 dispersed,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:16">Prov. v. 16</A>.

 The cities that should thus increase God calls his cities; they are
 <I>blessed</I> by him, and they are <I>fruitful and multiply, and 
 replenish the land.</I> 

 [4.] That all their present sorrows should not only be balanced, but 
 for ever silenced, by divine consolations: <I>The Lord shall yet 
 comfort Zion.</I> Yet at length, though her griefs and grievances may 
 continue long, God has comforts in reserve for Zion and all her 
 mourners.

 [5.] That all this will be the fruit of God's preventing distinguishing 
 favour: He shall yet <I>choose Jerusalem,</I> shall renew his choice, 
 renew his covenant, shall make it appear that he has chosen Jerusalem.
 As he first built them up into a people when he brought them out of 
 Egypt, so he will now rebuild them, when he brings them out of Babylon, 
 not for any worthiness of theirs, but in pursuance of his own choice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:7,8">Deut. vii. 7, 8</A>.

 Jerusalem is the city he has chosen, and he will not cast it off.</P>

 &nbsp; 21 Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying,
 These <I>are</I> the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man

 out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up <I>their</I> horn over
 the land of Judah to scatter it.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is the comfort and triumph of the church 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:19">Isa. lix. 19</A>)

 that <I>when the enemy shall come in like a flood,</I> with mighty
 force and fury, then the <I>Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard 
 against him.</I> Now, in this vision (the second which this prophet 
 had), we have an illustration of that, God's Spirit making a stand, and 
 making head, against the formidable power of the church's 
 adversaries.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We have here the enemies of the church bold and daring, and 
 threatening to be its death, to <I>cut off the name of Israel;</I> such 
 the people of God had lately been insulted by: <I>I looked and behold 
 four horns</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),
 
 which are explained 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 They <I>are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and 
 Jerusalem,</I> that is, the Jews both in the country and in the city, 
 because they were the Israel of God. They have <I>tossed them</I> (so 
 some read it), as furious bulls with their horns toss that which they 
 are enraged at. They have scattered them, <I>so that no man did lift
 up his head,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 No man durst show his face for fear of them, much less give them any 
 opposition, or make head against them. They are <I>horns,</I> denoting 
 their dignity and dominion--<I>horns exalted,</I> denoting also their 
 strength, and power, and violence. They are <I>four horns,</I> for the
 Jews are surrounded with them on every side; when they avoid one horn 
 that pushes at them they run upon another. The men of Judah and the
 inhabitants of Jerusalem, and many of Israel that joined themselves to 
 them, set about the building of the temple; but the enemies of that 
 work from all sides pushed at them, and drove them from it. Rehum, and 
 Shimshai, and the other Samaritans that opposed the building of the 
 temple, were these horns, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:8">Ezra iv. 8</A>.

 So were Sanballat and Tobiah, and the Ammonites and Arabians, that
 opposed the building of the wall,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+4:7">Neh. iv. 7</A>.

 Note, The church's enemies have horns, and use them to the hindrance of 
 every good work. The great enemy of the New-Testament church has 
 <I>seven heads and ten horns</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:3">Rev. xvii. 3</A>),

 so that those who endeavour to do the church any service must expect to
 be pushed at.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We have here the friends of the church active and prevailing. The 
 prophet did himself lift up his eyes and see the four horns, and saw 
 them so formidable that he began to despair of the safety of every good 
 man, and the success of every good work; but <I>the Lord</I> then 
 <I>showed him four carpenters,</I> or <I>smiths,</I> who were empowered 
 to cut off these horns, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.

 With an eye of sense we see the power of the enemies of the church; 
 look which way we will, the world shows us that. But it is with an eye 
 of faith that we see it safe, notwithstanding; it is the Lord that 
 shows us that, as he opened the eyes of the prophet's servant to see 
 the angelic guards round about his master, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+6:17">2 Kings vi. 17</A>.

 Observe, Those that were to fray or break the horns of the Gentiles,
 and to cast them out, were,

 1. <I>Carpenters</I> or <I>smiths</I> (for they are supposed by some to
 have been horns of iron), men who had skill and ability to do it, whose 
 proper business it was, and who understood their business and had tools 
 at hand to do it with. Note, God calls those to serve the interests of 
 his church whom he either finds, or makes, fit for it. If there be 
 horns (which denote the force and fury of beasts) against the church, 
 there are carpenters (which denote the wisdom and forecast of men) for 
 the church, by which they find ways to master the strongest beasts, for 
 <I>every kind of beasts is tamed, and has been tamed, of mankind,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:7">Jam. iii. 7</A>.

 2. They were <I>four carpenters,</I> as many horns so many hands to saw
 them off. Note, Which way soever the church is threatened with 
 mischief, and opposition given to its interests, God can find out ways 
 and means to check the force, to restrain the wrath, and make it turn 
 to his praise. Some by these four carpenters understand Zerubbabel and
 Joshua, Ezra and Nehemiah, who carried on the work of God in spite of 
 the opposition given to it. Those horned beasts broke into God's 
 vineyard to tread it down; but the good magistrates and the good 
 ministers whom God raised up, though they had not power to <I>cut off 
 the horns of the wicked</I> (as David did,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+75:5,10">Ps. lxxv. 5, 10</A>),
 
 yet frightened them and cast them out. Note, When God has work to do
 he will raise up some to do it and others to defend it and protect 
 those that are employed in the doing of it.</P>
