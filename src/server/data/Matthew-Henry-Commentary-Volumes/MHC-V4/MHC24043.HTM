 Jeremiah had faithfully delivered his message from God in the foregoing 
 chapter, and the case was made so very plain by it that one would have 
 thought there needed no more words about it; but we find it quite 
 otherwise. Here is, 

 I. The people's contempt of this message; they denied it to be the word
 of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+43:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>)

 and then made no difficulty of going directly contrary to it. Into
 Egypt they went, and took Jeremiah himself along with them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+43:4-7">ver. 4-7</A>.

 II. God's pursuit of them with another message, foretelling the king of
 Babylon's pursuit of them into Egypt,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And it came to pass, <I>that</I> when Jeremiah had made an end of
 speaking unto all the people all the words of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> their God,
 for which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> their God had sent him to them, <I>even</I> all
 these words,
 &nbsp; 2  Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son
 of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou
 speakest falsely: the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God hath not sent thee to say, Go
 not into Egypt to sojourn there:
 &nbsp; 3  But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, for
 to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put
 us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon.
 &nbsp; 4  So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
 forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to
 dwell in the land of Judah.
 &nbsp; 5  But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
 forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from
 all nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land
 of Judah;
 &nbsp; 6  <I>Even</I> men, and women, and children, and the king's
 daughters, and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the
 guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of
 Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah.
 &nbsp; 7  So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the
 voice of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: thus came they <I>even</I> to Tahpanhes.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 What God said to the builders of Babel may be truly said of this people 
 that Jeremiah is now dealing with: <I>Now nothing will be restrained 
 from them which they have imagined to do,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+11:6">Gen. xi. 6</A>.

 They have a fancy for Egypt, and to Egypt they will go, whatever God
 himself says to the contrary. Jeremiah made them hear all he had to 
 say, though he saw them uneasy at it; it was what the Lord their God 
 had sent him to speak to them, and they shall have it all. And now let 
 us see what they have to say to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They deny it to be a message from God: <I>Johanan, and all the proud 
 men, said to Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+43:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 See here, 

 1. What was the cause of their disobedience--it was pride; only by
 that comes contention both with God and man. They were <I>proud
 men</I> that gave the lie to the prophet. They could not bear the 
 contradiction of their sentiments and the control of their designs, no, 
 not by the divine wisdom, by the divine will itself. Pharaoh said, 
 <I>Who is the Lord, that I should obey him?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+5:2">Exod. v. 2</A>.

 The proud unhumbled heart of man is one of the most daring enemies God
 has on this side hell. 

 2. What was the colour for their disobedience. They would not
 acknowledge it to be the word of God: <I>The Lord hath not sent 
 thee</I> on this errand to us. Either they were not convinced that what 
 was said came from God or (which I rather think) though they were 
 convinced of it they would not own it. The light shone strongly in 
 their face, but they either shut their eyes against it or would not 
 confess that they saw it. Note, The reason why men deny the scriptures 
 to be the word of God is because they are resolved not to conform to 
 scripture-rules, and so an obstinate infidelity is made the sorry 
 subterfuge of a wilful disobedience. If God had spoken to them by an 
 angel, or as he did from Mount Sinai, they would have said that it was 
 a delusion. Had they not consulted Jeremiah as a prophet? Had he not 
 waited to receive instructions from God what to say to them? Had not 
 what he said all the usual marks of prophecy upon it? Was not the 
 prophet himself embarked in the same bottom with them? What interests 
 could he have separate from theirs? Had he not always approved himself 
 an Israelite indeed? And had not God proved him a prophet indeed? Had
 any of his words ever fallen to the ground? Why, truly, they had some 
 good thoughts of Jeremiah, but they suggest

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+43:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 <I>Baruch sets thee on against us.</I> A likely thing, that Baruch 
 should be in a plot to <I>deliver them into the hands of the 
 Chaldeans;</I> and what would he get by that? If Jeremiah and he had 
 been so well affected to the Chaldeans as they would represent them, 
 they would have gone away at first with Nebuzaradan, when he courted 
 them, to Babylon, and not have staid to take their lot with this 
 despised ungrateful remnant. But the best services are no fences 
 against malice and slander. Or, if Baruch had been so ill disposed, 
 could they think Jeremiah would be so influenced by him as to make 
 God's name an authority to patronise so villainous a purpose? Note, 
 Those that are resolved to contradict the great ends of the ministry 
 are industrious to bring a bad name upon it. When men will persist in
 sin they represent those that would turn them from it as designing men 
 for themselves, nay, as ill-designing men against their neighbours. It 
 is well for persons who are thus misrepresented that their witness is 
 in heaven and their record on high.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They determine to go to Egypt notwithstanding. They resolve not to 
 <I>dwell in the land of Judah,</I> as God had ordered them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+43:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 but to go themselves with one consent and to take all that they had 
 under their power along with them to Egypt. Those that came <I>from
 all the nations whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of 
 Judah,</I> out of a sincere affection to that land, they would not 
 leave to their liberty, but forced them to go with them into Egypt 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+43:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 <I>men, women, and children</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+43:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 a long journey into a strange country, an idolatrous country, a country 
 that had never been kind of faithful to Israel; yet thither they would 
 go, though they deserted their own land and threw themselves out of 
 God's protection. It is the folly of men that they know not when they
 are well off, and often ruin themselves by endeavouring to better 
 themselves; and it is the pride of great men to force those they have 
 under their power to follow them, though ever so much against their 
 duty and interest. These proud men compelled even Jeremiah the prophet 
 and Baruch his scribe to go along with them to Egypt; they carried them 
 away as prisoners, partly to punish them (and a greater punishment they 
 could not inflict upon them than to force them against their 
 consciences; theirs is the worst of tyranny who say to men's souls, 
 even to good men's souls, <I>Bow down, that we may go over</I>), partly 
 to put some reputation upon themselves and their own way. Though the 
 prophets were under a force, they would make the world believe that 
 they were voluntary in going along with them; and who could have blamed 
 them for acting contrary to the word of the Lord if the prophets 
 themselves had acted so? They <I>came to Tahpanhes,</I> a famous city 
 of Egypt (so called from a queen of that name, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:19">1 Kings xi. 19</A>),

 the same with <I>Hanes</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:4">Isa. xxx. 4</A>);

 it was now the metropolis, for Pharaoh's house was there,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+43:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 No place could serve these proud men to settle in but the royal city 
 and near the court, so little mindful were they of Joseph's wisdom, who 
 would have his brethren settle in Goshen. If they had had the spirit of 
 Israelites, they would have chosen rather to dwell in the wilderness of 
 Judah than in the most pompous populous cities of Egypt.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  Then came the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes,
 saying,
 &nbsp; 9  Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in
 the brick-kiln, which <I>is</I> at the entry of Pharaoh's house in
 Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;
 &nbsp; 10  And say unto them, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, the God of
 Israel; Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of
 Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones
 that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over
 them.
 &nbsp; 11  And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, <I>and
 deliver</I> such <I>as are</I> for death to death; and such <I>as are</I> for
 captivity to captivity; and such <I>as are</I> for the sword to the
 sword.
 &nbsp; 12  And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt;
 and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he
 shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth
 on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.
 &nbsp; 13  He shall break also the images of Beth-shemesh, that <I>is</I> in
 the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians
 shall he burn with fire.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here, as also in the next chapter, Jeremiah prophesying in 
 Egypt. Jeremiah was now in Tahpanhes, for there his lords and masters 
 were; he was there among idolatrous Egyptians and treacherous 
 Israelites; but there, 

 1. He received <I>the word of the Lord;</I> it <I>came to him.</I> God
 can find his people, with the visits of his grace, wherever they are; 
 and, when his ministers are bound, yet the word of the Lord is not 
 bound. The spirit of prophecy was not confined to the land of Israel. 
 When Jeremiah went into Egypt, not out of choice, but by constraint, 
 God withdrew not his wonted favour from him.

 2. What he received of the Lord he delivered to the people. Wherever we 
 are we must endeavour to do good, for that is our business in this 
 world. Now we find two messages which Jeremiah was appointed and
 entrusted to deliver when he was in Egypt. We may suppose that he 
 rendered what services he could to his countrymen in Egypt, at least as 
 far as they would be acceptable, in performing the ordinary duties of a 
 prophet, praying for them and instructing and comforting them; but only 
 two messages of his, which he had received immediately from God, are 
 recorded, one in this chapter, relating to Egypt itself and foretelling 
 its destruction, the other in the next chapter, relating to the Jews in 
 Egypt. God had told them before that if they went into Egypt the sword 
 they feared should follow them; here he tells them further that the 
 sword of Nebuchadnezzar, which they were in a particular manner afraid 
 of, should follow them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. This is foretold by a sign. Jeremiah must take <I>great stones,</I> 
 such as are used for foundations, and <I>lay them in the clay of 
 the</I> furnace, or <I>brick-kiln,</I> which is in <I>the open way,</I> 
 or <I>beside the way</I> that leads <I>to Pharaoh's house</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+43:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),
 
 some remarkable place in view of the royal palace. Egypt was famous for 
 brick-kilns, witness the slavery of the Israelites there, whom they 
 forced to make bricks 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+5:7">Exod. v. 7</A>),

 which perhaps was now remembered against them. The foundation of
 Egypt's desolation was laid in those brick-kilns, in <I>that clay.</I> 
 This he must do, not in the sight of the Egyptians (they knew not 
 Jeremiah's character), but <I>in the sight of the men of Judah</I> to 
 whom he was sent, that, since he could not prevent their going into 
 Egypt, he might bring them to repent of their going.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It is foretold in express words, as express as can be, 

 1. That the king, the present king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar, the very
 same that had been employed in the destruction of Jerusalem, should 
 come in person against the land of Egypt, should make himself master 
 even of this royal city, by the same token that he should <I>set his 
 throne</I> in that very place where <I>these stones</I> were laid,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+43:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 This minute circumstance is particularly foretold, that, when it was 
 accomplished, they might be put in mind of the prophecy and confirmed 
 in their belief of the extent and certainly of the divine prescience, 
 to which the smallest and most contingent events are evident. God calls 
 Nebuchadnezzar his servant, because herein he executed God's will, 
 accomplished his purposes, and was instrumental to carry on his 
 designs. Note, The world's princes are God's servants and he makes what 
 use he pleases of them, and even those that know him not, nor aim at 
 his honour, are the tools which his providence makes use of. 

 2. That he should destroy many of the Egyptians, and have them all at 
 his mercy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+43:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>He shall smite the land of Egypt;</I> and, though it has been always 
 a warlike nation, yet none shall be able to make head against him, but 
 whom he will he shall slay, and by what sort of death he will, whether 
 pestilence (for that is here meant by <I>death,</I> as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:2"><I>ch.</I> xv. 2</A>)

 by shutting them up in places infected, or by the sword of war or
 justice, in cold blood or hot. And whom he will he shall save alive and 
 carry into <I>captivity.</I> The Jews, by going into Egypt, brought the 
 Chaldeans thither, and so did but ill repay those that entertained 
 them. Those who promised to protect Israel from the king of Babylon 
 exposed themselves to him. 

 3. That he shall destroy the idols of Egypt, both the temples and the
 images of their gods

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+43:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>He shall burn, the houses of the gods of Egypt,</I> but it shall be 
 with a fire of God's kindling; the fire of God's wrath fastens upon 
 them, and then he burns some of them and carries others captive, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:1">Isa. xlvi. 1</A>.

 <I>Beth-shemesh,</I> or <I>the house of the sun,</I> was so called from
 a temple there built to the sun, where at certain times there was a 
 general meeting of the worshippers of the sun. The statues or standing 
 images there he shall <I>break in pieces</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+43:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)

 and carry away the rich materials of them. It intimates that he should 
 lay all waste when even the temple and the images should not escape the 
 fury of the victorious army. The king of Babylon was himself a great 
 idolater and a patron of idolatry; he had his temples and images in 
 honour of the sun as well as the Egyptians; and yet he is employed to 
 destroy the idols of Egypt. Thus God sometimes makes one wicked man, or 
 wicked nation, a scourge and plague to another. 

 4. That he shall make himself master of the land of Egypt, and none
 shall be able to plead its cause or avenge its quarrel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+43:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>He shall array himself with the rich spoils of the land of 
 Egypt,</I> both beautify and fortify himself with them. He shall array 
 himself with them as ornaments and as armour; and this, though it shall 
 be a rich and heavy booty, being expert in war, and expeditious, he 
 shall slip on with as much ease and in as little time, in comparison, 
 <I>as a shepherd slips on his garment,</I> when he goes to turn out his 
 sheep in a morning. And being loaded with the wealth of many other 
 nations, the fruits of his conquests, he shall make no more of the 
 spoils of the land of Egypt than of a shepherd's coat. And when he has 
 taken what he pleases (as Benhadad threatened to do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:6">1 Kings xx. 6</A>)

 he shall <I>go forth in peace,</I> without any molestation given him,
 or any precipitation for fear of it, so effectually reduced shall the 
 land of Egypt be. This destruction of Egypt by the king of Babylon is 
 foretold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:19,30:10">Ezek. xxix. 19 and xxx. 10</A>.

 Babylon lay at a great distance from Egypt, and yet thence the
 destruction of Egypt comes; for God can make those judgments strike 
 home which are far-fetched.</P>
