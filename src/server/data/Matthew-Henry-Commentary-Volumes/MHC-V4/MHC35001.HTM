 In this chapter, 

 I. The prophet complains to God of the violence done by the abuse of 
 the sword of justice among his own people and the hardships thereby put 
 upon many good people, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. God by him foretels the punishment of that abuse of power by the
 sword of war, and the desolations which the army of the Chaldeans
 should make upon them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:5-11">ver. 5-11</A>.

 III. Then the prophet complains of that too, and is grieved that the
 Chaldeans prevail so far

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:12-17">ver. 12-17</A>), 

 so that he scarcely knows which is more to be lamented, the sin or the 
 punishment of it, for in both many harmless good people are very great 
 sufferers. It is well that there is a day of judgment, and a future 
 state, before us, in which it shall be eternally well with all the
 righteous, and with them only, and ill with all the wicked, and them
 only; so the present seeming disorders of Providence shall be set to
 rights, and there will remain no matter of complaint whatsoever.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.
 &nbsp; 2 O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! <I>even</I>
 cry out unto thee <I>of</I> violence, and thou wilt not save!
 &nbsp; 3 Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause <I>me</I> to behold
 grievance? for spoiling and violence <I>are</I> before me: and there
 are <I>that</I> raise up strife and contention.
 &nbsp; 4 Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go
 forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore
 wrong judgment proceedeth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are told no more in the title of this book (which we have, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)
 
 than that the penman was <I>a prophet,</I> a man divinely inspired and 
 commissioned, which is enough (if that be so, we need not ask 
 concerning his tribe or family, or the place of his birth), and that 
 the book itself is <I>the burden which</I> he <I>saw;</I> he was as 
 sure of the truth of it as if he had seen it with his bodily eyes 
 already accomplished. Here, in these verses, the prophet sadly laments 
 the iniquity of the times, as one sensibly touched with grief for the 
 lamentable decay of religion and righteousness. It is a very melancholy 
 complaint which he here makes to God, 

 1. That no man could call what he had his own; but, in defiance of the
 most sacred laws of property and equity, he that had power on his side 
 had what he had a mind to, though he had no right on his side: The land
 was <I>full of violence,</I> as the old world was,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:11">Gen. vi. 11</A>.
 
 The prophet <I>cries out of violence</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 <I>iniquity</I> and <I>grievance, spoil</I> and <I>violence.</I> In 
 families and among relations, in neighbour-hoods and among friends, in 
 commerce and in courts of law, every thing was carried with a high 
 hand, and no man made any scruple of doing wrong to his neighbour, so 
 that he could but make a good hand of it for himself. It does not
 appear that the prophet himself had any great wrong done him (in losing 
 times it fared best with those that had nothing to lose), but it 
 grieved him to see other people wronged, and he could not but mingle 
 his tears with those of the oppressed. Note, Doing wrong to harmless 
 people, as it is an iniquity in itself, so it is a great grievance to 
 all that are concerned for God's Jerusalem, who <I>sigh and cry for 
 abominations</I> of this kind. He complains 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)

 that <I>the wicked doth compass about the righteous.</I> One honest 
 man, one honest cause, shall have enemies besetting it on every side; 
 many wicked men, in confederacy against it, run it down; nay, one 
 wicked man (for it is singular) with so many various arts of mischief 
 sets upon a righteous man, that he perfectly besets him. 

 2. That the kingdom was broken into parties and factions that were
 continually biting and devouring one another. This is a lamentation to 
 all the sons of peace: <I>There are that raise up strife and 
 contention</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),
 
 that foment divisions, widen breaches, incense men against one another, 
 and sow discord among brethren, by doing the work of him that is the 
 accuser of the brethren. Strifes and contentions that have been laid
 asleep, and begun to be forgotten, they awake, and industriously raise 
 up again, and blow up the sparks that were hidden under the embers.
 And, if <I>blessed are the peace-makers,</I> cursed are such 
 peace-breakers, that make parties, and so make mischief that spreads 
 further, and lasts longer, than they can imagine. It is sad to see bad 
 men warming their hands at those flames which are devouring all that is 
 good in a nation, and stirring up the fire too. 

 3. That the torrent of violence and strife ran so strongly as to bid
 defiance to the restraints and regulations of laws and the 
 administration of justice,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Because God did not appear against them, nobody else would; 
 <I>therefore the law is slacked,</I> is silent; it breathes not; <I>its 
 pulse beats not</I> (so, it is said, the word signifies); it intermits, 
 <I>and judgment does not go forth</I> as it should; no cognizance is 
 taken of those crimes, no justice done upon the criminals; nay, 
 <I>wrong judgment proceeds;</I> if appeals be made to the courts of 
 equity, the righteous shall be condemned and the wicked justified, so 
 that the remedy proves the worst disease. The legislative power takes 
 no care to supply the deficiencies of the law for the obviating of 
 those growing threatening mischiefs; the executive power takes no care 
 to answer the good intentions of the laws that are made; the stream of 
 justice is dried up by violence, and has not its free course. 

 4. That all this was open and public, and impudently avowed; it was
 barefaced. The prophet complains that this iniquity was shown him; he
 <I>beheld it</I> which way soever he turned his eyes, nor could he look 
 off it: <I>Spoiling and violence are before me.</I> Note, The abounding 
 of wickedness in a nation is a very great eye-sore to good people, and, 
 if they did not see it, they could not believe it to be so bad as it 
 is. Solomon often complains of the vexation of this kind which he
 <I>saw under the sun;</I> and the prophet would therefore gladly turn 
 hermit, that he might not see it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:2">Jer. ix. 2</A>.

 But <I>then we must needs go out of the world,</I> which
 <I>there-fore</I> we should long to do, that we may remove to that 
 world where holiness and love reign eternally, and no spoiling and 
 violence shall be before us. 

 5. That he complained of this to God, but could not obtain a redress of
 those grievances: "<I>Lord,</I>" says he, "<I>why dost thou show me 
 iniquity?</I> Why hast thou cast my lot in a time and place when and 
 where it is to be seen, and why do I continue to <I>sojourn in 
 Mesech</I> and <I>Kedar? I cry to thee</I> of this violence; I cry 
 aloud; I have cried long; but <I>thou wilt not hear, thou wilt not 
 save;</I> thou dost not take vengeance on the oppressors, nor do 
 justice to the oppressed, as if thy arm were shortened or thy ear 
 heavy." When God seems to connive at the wickedness of the wicked, nay, 
 and to countenance it, by suffering them to prosper in their 
 wickedness, it shocks the faith of good men, and proves a sore 
 temptation to them to say, <I>We have cleansed our hearts in vain</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:13">Ps. lxxiii. 13</A>),

 and hardens those in their impiety who say, <I>God has forsaken the
 earth.</I> We must not think it strange if wickedness be suffered to 
 prevail far and prosper long. God has reasons, and we are sure they are 
 good reasons, both for the reprieves of bad men and the rebukes of good 
 men; and therefore, though we plead with him, and humbly expostulate 
 concerning his judgments, yet we must say, "He is wise, and righteous, 
 and good, in all," and must believe the day will come, though it may be 
 long deferred, when the cry of sin will be heard against those that do
 wrong and the cry of prayer for those that suffer it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5 Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder
 marvellously: for <I>I</I> will work a work in your days, <I>which</I> ye
 will not believe, though it be told <I>you.</I>
 &nbsp; 6 For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, <I>that</I> bitter and hasty
 nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to
 possess the dwelling-places <I>that are</I> not theirs.
 &nbsp; 7 They <I>are</I> terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their
 dignity shall proceed of themselves.
 &nbsp; 8 Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more
 fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread
 themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall
 fly as the eagle <I>that</I> hasteth to eat.
 &nbsp; 9 They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up
 <I>as</I> the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the
 sand.
 &nbsp; 10 And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be
 a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they
 shall heap dust, and take it.
 &nbsp; 11 Then shall <I>his</I> mind change, and he shall pass over, and
 offend, <I>imputing</I> this his power unto his god.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an answer to the prophet's complaint, giving him assurance 
 that, though God bore long, he would not bear always with this 
 provoking people; for the day of vengeance was in his heart, and he 
 must tell them so, that they might by repentance and reformation turn 
 away the judgment they were threatened with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The preamble to the sentence is very awful 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Behold, you among the heathen, and regard.</I> Since they will not 
 be brought to repentance by the long-suffering of God, he will take 
 another course with them. No resentments are so keen, so deep, as those 
 of abused patience. The Lord will inflict upon them, 

 1. A public punishment, which shall be beheld and regarded among the
 heathen, which the neighbouring nations shall take notice of and stand 
 amazed at; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:25,25">Deut. xxix. 24, 25</A>.

 This will aggravate the desolations of Israel, that they will thereby
 be made a spectacle to the world.

 2. An amazing punishment, so strange and surprising, and so much out of
 the common road of Providence, that it shall not be paralleled among 
 the heathen, shall be sorer and heavier than what God has usually 
 inflicted upon the nations that know him not; nay, it shall not be 
 credited even by those that had the prediction of it from God before it 
 comes, or the report of it from those that were eye-witnesses of it 
 when it comes: <I>You will not believe it, though it be told you;</I> 
 it will be thought incredible that so many judgments should combine in 
 one, and every circumstance so strangely concur to enforce and 
 aggravate it, that so great and potent a nation should be so reduced 
 and broken, and that God should deal so severely with a people that had 
 been taken into the bond of the covenant and that he had done so much 
 for. The punishment of God's professing people cannot but be the 
 astonishment of all about them. 

 3. A speedy punishment: "<I>I will work a work in your days,</I> now
 quickly; this generation shall not pass till the judgment threatened be 
 accomplished. The sins of former days shall be reckoned for in your 
 days; for now the measure of the iniquity is full," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:36">Mt. xxiii. 36</A>.

 4. It shall be a punishment in which much of the hand of God shall
 appear; it shall be a work of his own working, so that all who see it 
 shall say, <I>This is the Lord's doing;</I> and it will be found a 
 fearful thing to fall into his hands; woe to those whom he takes to 
 task! 

 5. It shall be such a punishment as will typify the destruction to be
 brought upon the despisers of Christ and his gospel, for to that these 
 words are applied 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:41">Acts xiii. 41</A>,

 <I>Behold, you despisers, and wonder, and perish.</I> The ruin of
 Jerusalem by the Chaldeans for their idolatry was a figure of their 
 ruin by the Romans for rejecting Christ and his gospel, and it is a 
 very marvellous thing, and almost incredible. <I>Is there not a strange 
 punishment to the workers of iniquity?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The sentence itself is very dreadful and particular 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Lo, I raise up the Chaldeans.</I> There were those that raised up a 
 great deal of strife and contention among them, which was their sin; 
 and now God will raise up the Chaldeans against them, who shall strive 
 and contend with them, which shall be their punishment. Note, When 
 God's professing people quarrel among themselves, snarl at, and devour 
 one another, it is just with God to bring the common enemy upon them, 
 that shall make peace by making a universal devastation. The contending 
 parties in Jerusalem were inveterate one against another, when the 
 Romans came and <I>took away their place and nation.</I> The Chaldeans 
 shall be the instruments of the destruction threatened, and, though 
 themselves acting unrighteously, they shall <I>execute the 
 righteousness of the Lord</I> and punish the unrighteousness of Israel.
 Now, here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A description of the people that shall be raised up against Israel, 
 to be a scourge to them. 

 (1.) They are <I>a bitter and hasty nation,</I> cruel and fierce, and 
 what they do is done with violence and fury; they are precipitate in 
 their counsels, vehement in their passions, and push on with resolution 
 in their enterprises; they show no mercy and they spare no pains. 
 Miserable is the case of those that are given up into the hand of these 
 cruel ones. 

 (2.) They are strong, and therefore formidable, and such as there is no 
 standing before, and yet no fleeing from

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>They are terrible and dreadful,</I> famed for the gallant troops 
 they bring into the field 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 <I>their horses are swifter than leopards</I> to charge and pursue, and 
 <I>more fierce</I> than the <I>evening wolves;</I> and wolves are 
 observed to be the most ravenous towards the evening, after they have 
 been kept hungry all day, waiting for that darkness under the 
 protection of which <I>all the beasts of the forest creep forth,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:20">Ps. civ. 20</A>.

 Their squadrons of horse shall be very numerous: "<I>Their horse-men 
 shall spread themselves</I> a great way, for they shall <I>come from 
 far,</I> from all parts of their own country, and shall be dispersed 
 into all parts of the country they invade, to plunder it, and enrich 
 themselves with the spoil of it. And, <I>in making speed to spoil, they 
 shall hasten to the prey</I> (as those,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:1">Isa. viii. 1</A>,

 <I>margin</I>), for they shall <I>fly as the eagle</I> towards the
 earth when she <I>hastens to eat</I> and strikes at the prey she has an
 eye upon."

 (3.) Their own will is a law to them, and, in the fierceness of their
 pursuits, they will not be governed by any laws of humanity, equity, or 
 honour: <I>Their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of 
 themselves,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Appetite and passion rule them, and not reason nor conscience. Their 
 principle is, <I>Quicquid libet, licet</I>--<I>My will is my law.</I> 
 And, <I>Sic volo, sic jubeo; stat pro ratione voluntas--This is my 
 wish, this is my command; it shall be done because I choose it.</I> 
 What favour can be hoped for from such an enemy? Note, Those who have 
 been unjust and unmerciful, among whom <I>the law is slacked, and 
 judgment doth not go forth,</I> will justly be paid in their own coin 
 and fall into the hands of those who will deal unjustly and 
 unmercifully with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. A prophecy of the terrible execution that shall be made by this 
 terrible nation: <I>They shall march through the breadth of the 
 earth</I> (so it may be read); for in a little time the Chaldean forces 
 subdued all the nations in those parts, so that they seemed to have 
 conquered the world; they overran Asia and part of Africa. Or, through 
 the breadth of <I>the land</I> of Israel, which was wholly laid waste 
 by them. It is here foretold, 

 (1.) That they shall seize all as their own that they can lay their 
 hands on. They shall come to <I>possess the dwelling-places that are 
 not theirs,</I> which they have no right to, but that which their sword 
 gives them. 

 (2.) That they shall push on the war with all possible vigour: <I>They 
 shall all come for violence</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 not to determine any disputed right by the sword, but, right or wrong, 
 to enrich themselves with the spoil. <I>Their faces shall sup up as the 
 east wind;</I> their very countenances shall be so fierce and frightful 
 that a look will serve to make them masters of all they have a mind to; 
 so that they shall <I>swallow up</I> all, as the east wind nips and 
 blasts the buds and flowers. <I>Their faces shall look towards the 
 east</I> (so some read it); they shall still have an eye to their own 
 country, which lay eastward from Judea, and all the spoil they seize 
 they shall remit thither. 

 (3.) That they shall take a vast number of prisoners, and send them 
 into Babylon: <I>They shall gather the captivity as the sand</I> for 
 multitude, and shall never know when they have enough, as long as there 
 are any more to be had.

 (4.) That they shall make nothing of the opposition that is given to 
 them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Do the distressed Jews depend upon their great men to make a stand, and 
 with their wisdom and courage to give check to the victorious arms of 
 the Chaldeans? Alas! they will make nothing of them. <I>They shall
 scoff</I> (he shall, so it is in the original, meaning Nebuchadnezzar, 
 who being puffed up with his successes, shall scoff) <I>at the 
 kings</I> and commanders of the forces that think to make head against 
 him; and <I>the princes shall be a scorn to them,</I> so unequal a 
 match shall they appear to be. Do they depend upon their garrisons and 
 fortified towns? <I>He shall deride every stronghold,</I> for to him it 
 shall be weak, and <I>he shall heap dust, and take it;</I> a little 
 soil, thrown up for ramparts, shall serve to give him all the advantage 
 against them that he can desire; he shall make but a jest of them, and 
 a sport of taking them. 

 (5.) By all this he shall be puffed up with an intolerable pride, which 
 shall be his destruction

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>Then shall his mind change</I> for the worse. The spirit both of the 
 people and of the king shall grow more haughty and insolent. Those
 that will not be content with their own rights will not be content when 
 they have made themselves masters of other people's rights too; but as 
 the condition rises the mind rises too. This victorious king shall 
 <I>pass over</I> all the bounds of reason, equity, and modesty, and 
 break through all their bonds, and thereby <I>he shall offend,</I> 
 shall make God his enemy, and so prepare ruin for himself by 
 <I>imputing this his power to his god,</I> whereas he had it from the 
 God of Israel. <I>Bel</I> and <I>Nebo</I> were the gods of the
 Chaldeans, and to them they gave the glory of their successes; they 
 were hardened in their idolatry, and blasphemously argued that because 
 they had conquered Israel their gods were too strong for the God of 
 Israel. Note, It is a great offence (and the common offence of proud 
 people) to take that glory to ourselves, or to give it to gods of our 
 own making, which is due to the living and true God only. These closing 
 words of the sentence give a glimpse of comfort to the afflicted people 
 of God; it is to be hoped that they will change their minds, and grow 
 better, and ripen for deliverance; and they did so. However, their 
 enemies will change their minds, and grow worse, and ripen for
 destruction, which will inevitably come in God's due time; for a
 haughty spirit, lifted up against God, <I>goes before a fall.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet, having received of the Lord that which he was to deliver 
 to the people, now turns to God, and again addresses himself to him for 
 the ease of his own mind under the burden which he saw. And still he is 
 full of complaints. If he look about him, he sees nothing but violence 
 done by Israel; if he look before him, he sees nothing but violence 
 done against Israel; and it is hard to say which is the more melancholy 
 sight. His thoughts of both he pours out before the Lord. It is our 
 duty to be affected both with the iniquities and with the calamities of 
 the church of God and of the times and places wherein we live; but we 
 must take heed lest we grow peevish in our resentments, and carry them 
 too far, so as to entertain any hard thoughts of God, or lose the 
 comfort of our communion with him. The world is bad, and always was so, 
 and will be so; it is out of our power to mend it; but we are sure that 
 God governs the world, and will bring glory to himself out of all, and 
 therefore we must resolve to make the best of it, must be ourselves 
 better, and long for the better world. The prospect of the prevalence 
 of the Chaldeans drives the prophet to his knees, and he takes the 
 liberty to plead with God concerning it. In his plea we may 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The truths which he lays down, which he resolves to abide by, and 
 with which he endeavours to comfort himself and his friends, under the 
 growing threatening power of the Chaldeans; and they will furnish us 
 with pleasing considerations for our support in the like case.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. However it be, yet God is <I>the Lord our God,</I> and <I>our Holy 
 One.</I> The victorious Chaldeans impute their power to their idols, 
 but we are taught to tell them that the <I>God of Israel is the true 
 God, the living God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:10,11">Jer. x. 10, 11</A>.

 (1.) He is <I>Jehovah,</I> the fountain of all being, power, and
 perfection. <I>Our rock</I> is not <I>as theirs.</I> 

 (2.) "He is <I>my God.</I>" He speaks in the people's name; every 
 Israelite may say, "He is <I>mine.</I> Though we are thus sore broken, 
 and <I>all this has come upon us, yet have we not forgotten the name of 
 our God,</I> nor quitted our relation to him, yet have we not disowned 
 him, nor hath he disowned us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:17">Ps. xliv. 17</A>.

 We are an offending people; he is an offended God; yet he is ours, and
 we will not entertain any hard thoughts of him, nor of his service, for 
 all this."

 (3.) "He is <I>my Holy One.</I>" This intimates that the prophet loved 
 God as a holy God, loved him for the sake of his holiness. "He is 
 <I>mine</I> because he is a <I>Holy One;</I> and <I>therefore</I> he 
 will be my sanctifier and my Saviour, because he is <I>my Holy One.</I> 
 Men are unholy, but <I>my God is holy.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Our God is from everlasting. This he pleads with him: <I>Art thou 
 not from everlasting, O Lord my God?</I> It is matter of great and 
 continual comfort to God's people, under the troubles of this present 
 life, that their God is from everlasting. This intimates,

 (1.) The eternity of his nature; if he is from everlasting, he will be 
 to everlasting, and we must have recourse to this first principle, when 
 things seen, which are temporal, are discouraging, that we have hope 
 and help sufficient in a god that is not seen, that is eternal. "Art 
 thou not from everlasting, and then wilt thou not make bare thy 
 everlasting arm, in pursuance of thy everlasting counsels, to make unto 
 thyself an everlasting name?" 

 (2.) The antiquity of his covenant: "Art thou not <I>from of old,</I> a 
 God in covenant with thy people" (so some understand it), "and hast 
 thou not done great things for them <I>in the days of old,</I> which we 
 have heard with our ears, and which our fathers have told us of; and 
 art thou not the same God still that thou ever wast? Thou art <I>God, 
 and changest not.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. While the world stands God will have a church in it. Thou art from 
 everlasting, and then <I>we shall not die.</I> The Israel of God shall 
 not be extirpated, nor the name of Israel blotted out, though it may 
 sometimes seem to be very near it; like the apostles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:9">2 Cor. vi. 9</A>),
 
 <I>chastened, and not killed; chastened sorely, but not delivered over
 to death,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+118:18">Ps. cxviii. 18</A>.

 See how the prophet infers the perpetuity of the church from the
 eternity of God; for Christ has said, <I>Because I live,</I> and 
 therefore as long as I live, <I>you shall live also,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:19">John xiv. 19</A>.

 He is the rock on which the church is so firmly built that the <I>gates
 of hell shall not, cannot, prevail against it. We shall not 
 die.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Whatever the enemies of the church may do against her, it is 
 according to the counsel of God, and is designed and directed for wise 
 and holy ends: <I>Thou hast ordained them; thou hast established 
 them.</I> It was God that gave the Chaldeans their power, made them a 
 formidable people, and in his counsel determined what they should do, 
 nor had they any power against his Israel but what was <I>given them 
 from above.</I> He gave them their commission <I>to take the spoil and 
 to take the prey,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:6">Isa. x. 6</A>.

 Herein God appears a mighty God, that the power of mighty men is
 derived from him, depends upon him, and is under his check; he says 
 concerning it, <I>Hitherto shall it come, and no further.</I> Those 
 whom God ordains shall do no more than what God has ordained, which is 
 a great comfort to God's suffering people. Men are God's hand, the rod 
 in his hand,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:14">Ps. xvii. 14</A>.

 And he has <I>ordained them for judgment,</I> and <I>for
 correction.</I> God's people need correction, and deserve it; they must 
 expect it; they shall have it; when wicked men are let loose against 
 them, it is not for their destruction, that they may be ruined, but for 
 their correction, that they may be reformed; they are not intended for 
 a sword, to cut them off, but for a rod, to drive out the foolishness 
 that is found in their hearts, though they <I>mean not so, neither does 
 their heart think so,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:7">Isa. x. 7</A>.

 Note, It is matter of great comfort to us, in reference to the troubles
 and afflictions of the church, that, whatever mischief men design to 
 them, God designs to bring good out of them, and we are sure that 
 <I>his counsel shall stand.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Though the wickedness of the wicked may prosper for a while, yet God 
 is a holy God, and does not approve of that wickedness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil.</I> The prophet, 
 observing how very vicious and impious the Chaldeans were, and yet what 
 great success they had against God's Israel, found a temptation arising 
 from it to say that it was vain to serve God, and that it was 
 indifferent to him what men were. But he soon suppresses the thought, 
 by having recourse to his first principle, That God is not, that he 
 cannot be, the author or patron of sin; as he cannot do iniquity 
 himself, so he is <I>of purer eyes than to behold it</I> with any 
 allowance or approbation; no, it is that <I>abominable thing which the 
 Lord hates.</I> He sees all the sin that is committed in the world, and 
 it is an offence to him, it is odious in his eyes, and those that 
 commit it are thereby made obnoxious to his justice. There is in the 
 nature of God an antipathy to those dispositions and practices that are 
 contrary to his holy law; and, though an expedient is happily found out 
 for his being reconciled to sinners, yet he never will, nor can, be 
 reconciled to sin. And this principle we must resolve to abide by, 
 though the dispensations of his providence may for a time, and in some 
 instances, seem to be inconsistent with it. Note, God's connivance at 
 sin must never be interpreted into a giving countenance to it; for 
 <I>he is not a God that has pleasure in wickedness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+5:4,5">Ps. v. 4, 5</A>.

 The iniquity which, it is here said, God does not look upon, may be
 meant especially of the mischief done to God's people by their 
 persecutors; though God sees cause to permit it, yet he does not 
 approve of it; so it agrees with that of Balaam

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:21">Num. xxiii. 21</A>),

 <I>He has not be held iniquity against Jacob,</I> nor <I>seen,</I> with
 allowance, <I>perverseness against Israel,</I> which is very 
 comfortable to the people of God, in their afflictions by the rage of 
 men, that they cannot infer God's anger from it; though the instruments 
 of their trouble hate them, it does not therefore follow that God does; 
 nay, he loves them, and it is in love that he corrects them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The grievances he complains of, and finds hard to reconcile with 
 these truths: "Since we are sure that thou art a holy God, why have 
 atheists temptation given them to question whether thou art so or no? 
 <I>Wherefore lookest thou upon the Chaldeans</I> that <I>deal 
 treacherously</I> with thy people, and givest them success in their 
 attempts upon us? Why dost thou suffer thy sworn enemies, who blaspheme 
 thy name, to deal thus cruelly, thus perfidiously, with thy sworn 
 subjects, who desire to fear thy name? What shall we say to this?" This 
 was a temptation to Job 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:7,24:1"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 7; xxiv. 1</A>),

 to David

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:2,3">Ps. lxxiii. 2, 3</A>),

 to Jeremiah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:1,2"><I>ch.</I> xii. 1, 2</A>.

 1. That God permitted sin, and was patient with the sinners. He
 <I>looked upon them;</I> he saw all their wicked doings and designs, 
 and did not restrain nor punish them, but suffered them to speed in 
 their purposes, to go on and prosper, and to carry all before them. 
 Nay, his looking upon them intimates that he not only gave them no 
 check or rebuke, but that he gave them encouragement and assistance, as 
 if he smiled upon them and favoured them. He <I>held his tongue</I> 
 when they went on in their wicked courses, said nothing against them, 
 gave no orders to stop them. <I>These things thou hast done, and I kept 
 silence.</I> 

 2. That his patience was abused, and, <I>because sentence</I> against
 these evil works and workers <I>was not executed speedily,</I> 
 therefore <I>their hearts</I> were the more <I>fully set in them to do 
 evil.</I>

 (1.) They were false and deceitful, and there was no credit to be given 
 them, nor any confidence to be put in them. They deal
 <I>treacherously;</I> under colour of peace and friendship, they 
 prosecute and execute the most mischievous designs, and make no 
 conscience of their word in any thing.

 (2.) They hated and persecuted men because they were better than 
 themselves, as Cain hated Abel because <I>his own works were evil and 
 his brother's righteous. The wicked devours the man that is more 
 righteous than he,</I> for that very reason, because he shames him; 
 they have an ill will to the image of God, and <I>therefore</I> devour 
 good men, because they bear that image. Though many of the Jews were as 
 bad as the Chaldeans themselves, and worse, yet there were those among 
 them that were much more righteous, and yet were devoured by them. 

 (3.) They made no more of killing men that of catching fish. The 
 prophet complains that, Providence having delivered up the weaker to be 
 prey to the stronger, they were, in effect, made as <I>the fishes of 
 the sea,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 So they had been among themselves, preying upon one another as the 
 greater fishes do upon the less 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and they were made so to the common enemy. They were <I>as the creeping 
 things,</I> or <I>swimming</I> things (for the word is used for 
 <I>fish,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:20">Gen. i. 20</A>),

 <I>that have no ruler</I> over them, either to restrain them from
 devouring one another or to protect them from being devoured by their 
 enemies. They are given up to the Chaldeans as fish to the fishermen. 
 Those proud oppressors make no conscience of killing them, any more 
 than men do of pulling fish out of the water, so small account do they 
 make of human lives. They make no difficulty of killing them, but do it 
 with as much ease as men catch fish, that make no resistance, but are 
 unguarded and unarmed, and it is rather a pastime than any pains to 
 take them. They make no distinction among them, but all is fish that 
 comes to their net; and they reckon every thing their own that they can 
 lay their hands on. They have various ways of spoiling and destroying, 
 as men have of taking fish. Some they <I>take up with the angle</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 one by one; others <I>they catch</I> in shoals, and by wholesale, <I>in 
 their net,</I> and <I>gather them in their drag,</I> their enclosing 
 net. Such variety of methods have they to destroy those by whom they 
 hope to enrich themselves. 

 (4.) They gloried in what they got, and pleased themselves with it, 
 though it was got dishonestly: <I>Their portion is fat, and their meat 
 plenteous;</I> they prosper in their oppression and fraud; they have a 
 great deal, and it is of the best; their land is good, and they have 
 abundance of it. And therefore,

 [1.] They have great complacency in themselves, and are very pleasant; 
 they live merrily

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>Therefore they rejoice and are glad,</I> because their wealth is
 great, and their projects succeed for the increase of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:25">Job xxxi. 25</A>.
 
 <I>Soul, take thy ease,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:19">Luke xii. 19</A>.

 [2.] They have a great conceit of themselves, and are great admirers of
 their own ingenuity and management: They <I>sacrifice to their own net,
 and burn incense to their own drag;</I> they applaud themselves for
 having got so much money, though ever so dishonestly. Note, There is a
 proneness in us to take the glory of our outward prosperity to
 ourselves, and to say, <I>My might, and the power of my hands, have
 gotten me this wealth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:17">Deut. viii. 17</A>.

 This is idolizing ourselves, sacrificing to the dragnet, because it is 
 our own, which is as absurd a piece of idolatry as sacrificing to 
 Neptune or Dagon. That which makes them adore their net thus is
 because by it <I>their portion is fat.</I> Those that make a god of 
 their money will make a god of their drag-net, if they can but get 
 money by it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The prophet, in the close, humbly expresses his hope that God will 
 not suffer these destroyers of mankind always to go on and prosper 
 thus, and expostulates with God concerning it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 "<I>Shall they therefore empty their net?</I> Shall they enrich 
 themselves, and fill their own vessels, with that which they have by 
 violence and oppression taken away from their neighbours? Shall they 
 empty their net of what they have caught, that they may cast it into 
 the sea again, to catch more? And wilt thou suffer them to proceed in 
 this wicked course? Shall they not <I>spare continually to slay the 
 nations?</I> Must the numbers and wealth of nations be sacrificed to 
 their net? As if it were a small thing to rob men of their estates, 
 shall they rob God of his glory? Is not God the king of nations, and
 will he not assert their injured rights? Is he not jealous for his own
 honour, and will he not maintain that?" The prophet lodges the matter
 in God's hand, and leaves it with him, as the psalmist does.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:22">Ps. lxxiv. 22</A>,

 <I>Arise, O God! Plead thy own cause.</I></P>
