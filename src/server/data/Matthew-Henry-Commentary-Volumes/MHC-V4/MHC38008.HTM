 The work of ministers is rightly to divide the word of truth and to
 give every one his portion. So the prophet is here instructed to do, in
 the further answer he gives to the case of conscience proposed about
 continuing the public fasts. His answer, in the foregoing chapter, is
 by way of reproof to those that were disobedient and would not obey the
 truth. But here he is ordered to change his voice, and to speak by way
 of encouragement to the willing and obedient. Here are two words from
 the Lord of hosts, and they are both good words and comfortable words.
 In the former of these messages 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:1">ver. 1</A>)

 God promises that Jerusalem shall be restored, reformed, replenished

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:2-8">ver. 2-8</A>),

 that the country shall be rich, and the affairs of the nation shall be
 successful, their reputation retrieved, and their state in all respects
 the reverse of what it had been for many years past
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:9-15">ver. 9-15</A>);

 he then exhorts them to reform what was amiss among them, that they 
 might be ready for these favours designed them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:16,17">ver. 16, 17</A>).

 In the latter of these messages

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:18">ver. 18</A>)

 he promises that their fasts should be superseded by the return of
 mercy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:19">ver. 19</A>),

 and that thereupon they should be replenished, enriched, and
 strengthened, by the accession of foreigners to them,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Again the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts came <I>to me,</I> saying,
 &nbsp; 2 Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with
 great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury.
 &nbsp; 3 Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell
 in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city
 of truth; and the mountain of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts the holy
 mountain.

 women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his
 staff in his hand for very age.
 &nbsp; 5 And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls
 playing in the streets thereof.
 &nbsp; 6 Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes

 marvellous in mine eyes? saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts.

 Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God,
 in truth and in righteousness.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet, in his foregoing discourses, had left his hearers under a 
 high charge of guilt and a deep sense of wrath; he had left them in a 
 melancholy view of the desolations of their pleasant land, which was 
 the effect of their fathers' disobedience; but because he designed to 
 bring them to repentance, not to drive them to despair, he here sets 
 before them the great things God had in store for them, encouraging 
 them hereby to hope that their case of conscience would shortly 
 determine itself and that God's providence would as loudly call them to 
 <I>joy and gladness</I> as ever it called them to <I>fasting and 
 mourning.</I> It is here promised,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That God will appear for Jerusalem, and will espouse and plead her
 cause. 
 
 1. He will be revenged on Zion's enemies
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>I was jealous for Zion,</I> or <I>of</I> Zion; that is, "I have of 
 late been heartily concerned for her honour and interests, <I>with 
 great jealousy.</I> The great wrath that was against her

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+7:12"><I>ch.</I> vii. 12</A>)

 now turns against her adversaries. I am now <I>jealous for her with
 great fury,</I> and can no more bear to have her abused in her 
 afflictions than I could bear to be abused by her provocations." This 
 he had said before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:14,15"><I>ch.</I> i. 14, 15</A>),

 that they might promise themselves as much from the power of his anger,
 when it was turned for them, as they had felt from it when it was 
 against them. The sins of Zion were her worst enemies, and had done her 
 the most mischief; and therefore God, in his jealousy for her honour 
 and comfort, will <I>take away her sins,</I> and then, whatever other 
 enemies injured her, it was at their peril. 

 2. He will be resident in Zion's palaces

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>I have returned to Zion,</I> after I had seemed so long to stand at 
 a distance, and I will again <I>dwell in the midst of Jerusalem</I> as 
 formerly." This secures to them the tokens of his presence in his 
 ordinances and the instances of his favour in his providences.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That there shall be a wonderful reformation in Jerusalem, and 
 religion, in the power of it, shall prevail and flourish there. 
 "<I>Jerusalem,</I> that has dealt treacherously both with God and man, 
 shall become so famous for fidelity and honesty that it <I>shall be 
 called</I> and known by the name of <I>a city of truth,</I> and the 
 inhabitants of it shall be called <I>children that will not lie.</I> 
 The <I>faithful city</I> has become a <I>harlot</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:21">Isa. i. 21</A>),

 but shall now become a <I>faithful city</I> again, faithful to the
 <I>God of Israel</I> and to the worship of him only." This was
 fulfilled; for the Jews after the captivity, though there was much
 amiss among them, were never guilty of idolatry. Jerusalem shall be
 called <I>the mountain of the Lord of hosts,</I> owning him and owned
 by him, and therefore <I>the holy mountain,</I> cleared from idols and
 consecrated to God, and not, as it had been, the <I>mount of
 corruption,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:13">2 Kings xxiii. 13</A>.

 Note, The city of God ought to be <I>a city of truth</I> and the
 <I>mountain of the Lord of hosts a holy mountain.</I> Those that 
 profess religion, and relation to God, must study to adorn their 
 profession by all instances of godliness and honesty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That there shall be in Jerusalem a great increase of people, and 
 all the marks and tokens of a profound tranquillity, When it has become 
 a <I>city of truth</I> and a <I>mountain of holiness,</I> it is then 
 peaceable and prosperous, and every thing in it looks bright and 
 pleasant. 

 1. You may look with pleasure upon the generation that is going off the
 stage, and see them fairly quitting it in the ordinary course of 
 nature, and not driven off from it by war, famine, or pestilence

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>In the streets of Jerusalem,</I> that had been filled with the 
 bodies of the slain, or deserted and left desolate, shall now dwell 
 <I>old men</I> and <I>old women,</I> who have not been cut off by 
 untimely deaths (either through their own intemperance or God's 
 vengeance), but have the even thread of their days spun out to a full 
 length; they shall feel no distemper but the decay of nature, and go to 
 their grave in a full age, as a <I>shock of corn in his season.</I> 
 They shall have <I>every one his staff in his hand, for very age,</I> 
 to support him, as Jacob, who <I>worshipped, leaning upon the top of 
 his staff,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:21">Heb. xi. 21</A>.

 Old age needs a support, and should not be ashamed to use it, but
 should furnish itself with divine graces, which will be the strength of 
 the heart and a better support than a staff in the hand. Note, The 
 hoary head, as it is a crown of glory to those that wear it, so it is 
 to the places where they live. It is a graceful thing to a city to see 
 abundance of old people in it; it is a sign, not only of the 
 healthfulness of the air, but of the prevalence of virtue and the 
 suppression and banishment of those many vices which cut off the number 
 of men's months in the midst; it is a sign, not only that the climate 
 is temperate, but that the people are so. 

 2. You may look with as much pleasure upon the generation that is
 rising up in their room

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>The streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in 
 the streets.</I> This intimates, 

 (1.) That they shall be blessed with a multitude of children; their 
 families shall increase and multiply, and replenish the city, which was 
 an early product of the divine blessing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:28">Gen. i. 28</A>.

 Happy the man, happy the nation, whose quiver is full of these arrows!
 They shall have of both sexes, <I>boys and girls,</I> in whom their 
 families shall afterwards be joined, and another generation raised up.

 (2.) That their children shall be healthful, and strong, and active; 
 their boys and girls shall not lie sick in bed, or sit pining in the 
 corner, but (which is a pleasant sight to parents) shall be hearty and 
 cheerful, and play in the streets. It is their pleasant playing age; 
 let us not grudge it to them; much good may it do them and no harm. 
 <I>Evil days</I> will come time enough, and <I>years</I> of which they 
 will <I>say</I> that they have <I>no pleasure in them,</I> in 
 consideration of which they are concerned not to spend all their time 
 in play, but to remember their Creator. 

 (3.) That they shall have great plenty, meat enough for all their 
 mouths. In time of famine we find the children <I>swooning as the 
 wounded, in the streets of the city,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:11,12">Lam. ii. 11, 12</A>.

 If they are playing in the streets, it is a good sign that they want
 for nothing.

 (4.) That they shall not be terrified with the alarms of war, but enjoy
 a perfect security. There shall be <I>no breaking</I> in of invaders, 
 <I>no going out</I> of deserters, <I>no complaining in the streets</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+144:14">Ps. cxliv. 14</A>);

 for, when there is playing in the streets, it is a sign that there is
 little care or fear there. Time was when the enemy hunted their steps
 so closely that they could not go in their streets

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:18">Lam. iv. 18</A>),

 but now they shall <I>play in the streets</I> and fear no evil.

 (5.) That they shall have love and peace among themselves. The boys and 
 girls shall not be fighting in the streets, as sometimes in cities that 
 are divided into factions and parties the children soon imbibe and 
 express the mutual resentments of the parents; but they shall be 
 innocently and lovingly <I>playing in the streets,</I> not devouring, 
 but diverting, one another. 

 (6.) That the sports and diversions used shall be all harmless and 
 inoffensive; the boys and girls shall have no other play than what they 
 are willing that persons should see <I>in the streets,</I> no play that 
 seeks corners, no playing the fool, or playing the wanton, for it is 
 the mountain of the Lord, the <I>holy mountain,</I> but honest and 
 modest recreations, which they have no reason to be ashamed of. 

 (7.) That childish youthful sports shall be confined to the age of 
 childhood and youth. It is pleasing to see the <I>boys and girls 
 playing in the streets,</I> but it is ill-favoured to see men and women 
 playing there, who should fill up their time with work and business. It 
 is well enough for <I>children</I> to be <I>sitting in the 
 market-place,</I> crossing questions 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:16,17">Matt. xi. 16, 17</A>),

 but it is no way fit that men, who are able to <I>work in the
 vineyard,</I> should <I>stand all the day idle</I> there, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:3">Matt. xx. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That the scattered Israelites shall be brought together again from 
 all parts whither they were dispersed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "<I>I will save my people from the east country, and from the west;</I> 
 I will save them from being lost, or losing themselves, in Babylon, or 
 in Egypt, or in any other country whither they were driven." They shall 
 neither be detained by the nations among whom they sojourn nor shall 
 they incorporate with them; but I will <I>save them,</I> will separate 
 them, and will bring them to their own land again; by the prosperity of 
 their land I will invite them back, and at the same time incline them 
 to return; and <I>they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem,</I> shall 
 choose to dwell there, because it is the holy city, though, upon many 
 other accounts, it was more eligible to dwell in the country; and 
 therefore we find 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+11:2">Neh. xi. 2</A>)

 that <I>the people blessed all the men who willingly offered themselves
 to dwell at Jerusalem.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. That God would renew his covenant with them, would be faithful to 
 them and make them so to him: <I>They shall be my people and I will be 
 their God.</I> That is the foundation and crown of all these promises, 
 and is inclusive of all happiness. They shall obey God's laws, and God 
 will secure and advance all their interests. This contract shall be 
 made, shall be new-made, <I>in truth</I> and <I>in righteousness.</I> 
 Some think that the former denotes God's part of the covenant (he will 
 be <I>their God in truth,</I> he will make good all his promises of 
 favour to them) and the latter man's part of the covenant--they shall be
 his people in <I>righteousness,</I> they shall be a righteous people 
 and shall abound in the <I>fruits of righteousness,</I> and shall not, 
 as they have done, deal treacherously and unjustly with their God. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:19,20">Hos. ii. 19, 20</A>.

 God will never leave nor forsake them in a way of mercy, as he has
 promised them; and they shall never leave nor forsake him in a way of 
 duty, as they have promised him. These promises were fulfilled in the 
 flourishing state of the Jewish church, for some ages, between the 
 captivity and Christ's time; they were to have a further and a fuller 
 accomplishment in the gospel-church, that <I>heavenly Jerusalem,</I> 
 which is from above, is free, and is the <I>mother of us all;</I> but 
 the fullest accomplishment of all will be in the future state.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 All these precious promises are here ratified, and the doubts of God's 
 people silenced, with that question 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>If it be marvellous in the eyes of this people, should it be 
 marvellous in my eyes?</I> If it seem unlikely to you that ever 
 Jerusalem should be thus repaired, should be thus replenished, is it 
 therefore impossible with God?" The <I>remnant of this people</I> (and 
 God's people in this world are but a remnant), being few and feeble, 
 thought all this was too good news to be true, especially <I>in these 
 days,</I> these difficult days, these cloudy and dark days. Considering 
 how bad the times are, it is highly improbable, it is morally 
 impossible, they should ever come to be so good as the prophet speaks. 
 How can these things be? How can dry bones live? But should it 
 therefore appear so in the eyes of God? Note, We do both God and 
 ourselves a deal of wrong if we think that, when we are 
 <I>nonplussed,</I> he is so, and that he cannot get over the 
 difficulties which to us seem insuperable. <I>With men this is
 impossible; but with God all things are possible;</I> so far are God's 
 thoughts and ways above ours.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9 Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye
 that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets,
 which <I>were</I> in the day <I>that</I> the foundation of the house of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built.
 &nbsp; 10 For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any
 hire for beast; neither <I>was there any</I> peace to him that went
 out or came in because of the affliction: for I set all men every
 one against his neighbour.
 &nbsp; 11 But now I <I>will</I> not <I>be</I> unto the residue of this people as
 in the former days, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts.
 &nbsp; 12 For the seed <I>shall be</I> prosperous; the vine shall give her

 hands be strong.
 &nbsp; 14 For thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts; As I thought to punish
 you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of
 hosts, and I repented not:
 &nbsp; 15 So again have I thought in these days to do well unto
 Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.
 &nbsp; 16 These <I>are</I> the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man
 the truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and
 peace in your gates:
 &nbsp; 17 And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his
 neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these <I>are things</I>
 that I hate, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God, by the prophet, here gives further assurances of the mercy he had 
 in store for Judah and Jerusalem. Here is line upon line for their 
 comfort, as before there was for their conviction. These verses contain 
 strong encouragements with reference to the difficulties they now 
 laboured under. And we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Who they were to whom these encouragements did belong--to those who,
 in obedience to the call of God by his prophets, applied in good 
 earnest to the building of the temple 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>Let your hands be strong,</I> that are busy at work for God, <I>you 
 that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets,</I> 
 and are not disobedient to them <I>as your fathers were,</I> in the 
 former days, to the words of those prophets that were sent to them. You 
 may take the comfort of the promises, and shall have the benefit of 
 them, who have obeyed the precepts given you <I>in the day that the 
 foundation of the house of the Lord was laid,</I> when you were told 
 that, having begun with it, you must go on, <I>that the temple might be 
 built;</I> God told you that you must go on with it, and you have 
 laboured hard at it for some time, in obedience to the heavenly vision. 
 Now you are those whose hands must be strengthened and whose hearts 
 must be comforted, with these precious promises; to you is the word of 
 this consolation sent." Note, Those, and those only, that are employed 
 for God, may expect to be encouraged by him; those who lay their hands 
 to the plough of duty shall have them strengthened with the promises of 
 mercy; and those who avoid their fathers' faults, not only cut off the 
 entail of the curse, but have it turned into a blessing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What the discouragements were which they had hitherto laboured 
 under, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 These are mentioned as a foil to the blessings God was now about to 
 bestow upon them, to make them appear the more strange, to the glory of 
 God, and the more sweet, to their comfort. The truth was the times had 
 long been very bad, and the calamities and difficulties of them were 
 many and great. 

 1. Trade was dead; there was nothing to be done and therefore nothing
 to be got. <I>Before these days</I> of reformation began <I>there was 
 no hire for man, nor any hire for beasts.</I> The fruits of the earth 
 (though it had long lain fallow, and therefore, one would think, should 
 have been the more fertile) were thin and poor, so that the husbandman 
 had no occasion to hire harvest people to reap his corn, nor teams to 
 carry it home, for he could be scarcely said to have any. Merchants had 
 no goods to import or export, so that they needed not to hire either 
 men or beasts; hence the poor people, who lived by their labour, had no 
 way of getting bread for themselves and their families. 

 2. Travelling was dangerous, so that all commerce both by sea and land
 was cut off; nay, none durst stir abroad so much as to visit their 
 friends, for <I>their was no peace to him that went out, or came in, 
 because of the affliction.</I> The Samaritans, and Ammonites, and their 
 other evil neighbours, made inroads upon them in small parties, and 
 seized all they could lay their hands on; the roads were infested with 
 highwaymen, and both city and country with housebreakers; so that 
 neither men's persons nor their goods were safe at home or abroad. 

 3. There was no such thing as friendship or good neighbourship among
 them: <I>I set all men every one against his neighbour.</I> In this 
 there was a great deal of sin, for these wars and fightings came from 
 men's lust, and this God was not the author of; but there was in it a 
 great deal of misery also, and so God was in it a just avenger of their 
 disobedience to him; because they were of an <I>evil spirit</I> towards 
 him, a spirit of contradiction to his laws, God sent among them an evil 
 spirit, to make them vexatious one to another. Those that throw off the 
 love of God forfeit the comfort of brotherly love.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What encouragement they shall now have to proceed in the good work 
 they are about, and to hope that it shall yet be well with them: "Thus 
 and thus you have been harassed and afflicted, but now God will change 
 his way towards you, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Now that you return to your duty God will comfort you according to the
 time that he has afflicted you; the ebbing tide shall flow again." 

 1. God will not proceed in his controversy with them; <I>I will not be
 to them as in the former days.</I> Note, It is with us well or ill 
 according as God is to us; for every creature is that to us which he 
 makes it to be. And, if we walk not contrary to God as in the former 
 days, he will not walk contrary to us as in the former days; for it is 
 only <I>with the froward</I> that he will <I>wrestle.</I> 

 2. They shall have great plenty and abundance of all goods things 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>The seed</I> sown <I>shall be prosperous,</I> and yield a great 
 increase; <I>the vine shall give her fruit,</I> which makes glad the 
 heart, and <I>the ground</I> its products, which strengthen the heart; 
 they shall have all they can desire, not only for necessity, but for 
 ornament and delight. The <I>heavens shall give their dew,</I> without 
 which the earth would not yield her increase, which is a constant 
 intimation to us of the beneficence of the God of heaven to men on 
 earth and of their dependence on him. It is said of a <I>sweeping 
 rain</I> that it <I>leaves no food</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:3">Prov. xxviii. 3</A>);

 but here the <I>gentle dew</I> waters the earth, that it may give 
 <I>seed to the sower and bread to the eater.</I> And thus God will 
 <I>cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things.</I> 
 They are but a <I>remnant,</I> a <I>residue,</I> very few, one would 
 think scarcely worth looking after; but, now that they are at work for 
 God, he will take care that they shall want nothing which is fit for 
 them. This confirms what the prophet's colleague had said, a little 
 before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:16,19">Hag. ii. 16, 19</A>),

 <I>From this day will I bless you.</I> Note, God's people, that serve
 him faithfully, have great possessions. "<I>All</I> is yours, for you
 are Christ's." 

 3. They shall recover their credit among their neighbours

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>You were a curse among the heathen.</I> Every one censured and
 condemned them, spoke ill of them, and wished ill to them, upon the 
 account of the great disgrace that they were under; some think that 
 they were made a form of execration, so that if a man would load his 
 enemy with the heaviest curse he would say, <I>God make thee like a 
 Jew!</I> "But now, <I>I will save you, and you shall be a blessing.</I> 
 Your restoration shall be as much taken notice of to your honour as 
 ever your desolation and dispersion were to your reproach; you shall be 
 applauded and admired as much as ever you were vilified and run down, 
 shall be courted and caressed as much as ever you were slighted and 
 abandoned." Most men smile or frown upon their neighbours according as 
 Providence smiles or frowns upon them; but those whom God plainly 
 blesses as his own, shows favour to and puts honour upon, we ought also 
 to respect and be kind to. The blessed of the Lord are the blessing of 
 the land, and should be so accounted by us. This is here promised to 
 the house both of Israel and Judah; for many of the ten tribes returned 
 out of captivity with the two tribes, and shared with them in those 
 blessings; and, it is probable, besides what came at first, many, very 
 many, flocked to them afterwards, when they saw their affairs take this 
 turn. 
 
 4. God himself will determine to do them good,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 All their comforts take rise from the thoughts of the love that God had
 towards them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:11">Jer. xxix. 11</A>.

 Compare these promises with the former threatenings.

 (1.) When they <I>provoked him</I> to anger with <I>their sins,</I> he
 said that he would <I>punish them,</I> and so he did; it was his 
 declared purpose to bring destroying judgments upon them, and, because 
 they repented not of their rebellions against him, he repented not of 
 his threatenings against them, but let the sentence of the law take its 
 course. Note, God's punishing sinners is never a sudden and hasty 
 resolve, but is always the product of thought, and there is a counsel 
 in that part of the will of God. If the sinner turn not, God will not 
 turn. 

 (2.) Now that they pleased him with their services; he said that he 
 would <I>do them good;</I> and will he not be as true to his promises 
 as he was to his threatenings? No doubt he will: "<I>So again have I 
 thought to do well to Jerusalem in those days,</I> when you begin to 
 hearken to the voice of God speaking to you by his prophets; and these 
 thoughts also shall be performed."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The use they are to make of these encouragements.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Let them take the comfort which these promises give to them: <I>Fear 
 you not</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);

 <I>let your hands be strong</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);
 
 and both together 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),
 
 <I>Fear not, but let your hands be strong.</I> 

 (1.) The difficulties they met with in their work must not drive them 
 from it, nor make them go on heavily in it, for the issue would be good 
 and the reward great. Let this therefore animate them to proceed with
 vigour and cheerfulness. 

 (2.) The dangers they were exposed to from their enemies must not 
 terrify them; those that have God for them, engaged to do them good, 
 need not fear <I>what man can do against them.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Let them do the duty which those promises call for from them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 The very same duties which the former prophets pressed upon their 
 fathers from the consideration of the wrath threatened

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+7:9,10"><I>ch.</I> vii. 9, 10</A>)

 this prophet presses upon them from the consideration of the mercy 
 promised: "Leave it to God, to perform for you what he has promised, in 
 his own way and time, but upon condition that you make conscience of 
 your duty. <I>These are the things then that you shall do;</I> this is 
 your part of the covenant; these are the articles which you are to 
 perform, fulfil, and keep, that you may not put a bar in your own door 
 and stop the current of God's favours." 

 (1.) "You must never tell a lie, but always speak as you think, and as 
 the matter is, to the best of your knowledge: <I>Speak you every man 
 the truth to his neighbour,</I> both in bargains and in common 
 converse; dread every word that looks like a lie." This precept the 
 apostle quotes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:25">Eph. iv. 25</A>),

 and backs it with this reason, <I>We are members one of another.</I>

 (2.) Those that are entrusted with the administration of public justice
 must see to it, not only that none be wronged by it, but that those who 
 are wronged be righted by it: <I>Execute the judgment of truth and 
 peace in your gates.</I> Let the judges that sit in the gates in all 
 their judicial proceedings have regard both to truth and to peace; let 
 them take care to do justice, to accommodate differences, and to 
 prevent vexatious suits. It must be a judgment of truth in order to
 peace, and making those friends that were at variance, and a judgment 
 of peace as far as is consistent with truth, and no further.

 (3.) No man must bear malice against his neighbour upon any account; 
 this is the same with what we had

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+7:10"><I>ch.</I> vii. 10</A>.

 We must not only keep our hands from doing evil, but we must watch over
 our hearts, that they <I>imagine not any evil</I> against our 
 neighbour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:29">Prov. iii. 29</A>.

 Injury and mischief must be crushed in the thought, in the embryo. 

 (4.) Great reverence must be had for an oath, and conscience made of 
 it: "Never take a false oath, nay, <I>love no false oath;</I> that is, 
 hate it, dread it, keep at a distance from it. Love not to impose
 oaths upon others, lest they swear falsely; love not that any should 
 take a false oath for your benefit, and forswear themselves to do you a 
 kindness." A very good reason is annexed against all these corrupt and 
 wicked practices: "For <I>all these are things that I hate,</I> and 
 therefore you must hate them if you expect to have God your friend." 
 These things here forbidden are all of them found among the <I>seven 
 things which the Lord hates,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:16-19">Prov. vi. 16-19</A>.

 Note, We must forbear sin, not only because God is angry at it, and 
 therefore it is dangerous to us, but because he hates it, and therefore 
 it ill becomes us and is a very ungrateful thing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>18 And the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 19 Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts; The fast of the fourth
 <I>month,</I> and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh,
 and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and

 peace.
 &nbsp; 20 Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts; <I>It shall</I> yet <I>come to pass,</I>
 that there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities:
 &nbsp; 21 And the inhabitants of one <I>city</I> shall go to another,

 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts: I will go also.

 &nbsp; 23 Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts; In those days <I>it shall come
 to pass,</I> that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of

 Jew, saying, We will go with you: for we have heard <I>that</I> God
 <I>is</I> with you.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These verses contain two precious promises, for the further 
 encouragement of those pious Jews that were hearty in building the 
 temple.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That a happy period should be put to their fasts, and there should 
 be no more occasion for them, but they should be converted into 
 thanksgiving days, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 This is a direct answer to the enquiry concerning their fasts,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+7:3"><I>ch.</I> vii. 3</A>.

 Those of them that fasted in hypocrisy had their doom in the foregoing
 chapter, but those that in sincerity humbled themselves before God, and 
 sought his face, have here a comfortable assurance given them of a 
 large share in the happy times approaching. The four <I>yearly 
 fasts</I> which they had religiously observed should be <I>to the house 
 of Judah joy and gladness, and solemn feasts,</I> and those cheerful 
 ones. Note, Joyous times will come to the church after troublous times; 
 if weeping endure for more than a night, and joy come not next morning, 
 yet the morning will come that will introduce it at length. And, when 
 God comes towards us in ways of mercy, we must meet him with joy and 
 thankfulness; when God turns judgments into mercies we must turn fasts 
 into festivals, and thus <I>walk after the Lord.</I> And those who 
 <I>sow in tears</I> with Zion shall <I>reap in joy</I> with her; those 
 who submit to the restraints of her solemn fasts while they continue 
 shall share in the triumphs of her cheerful feasts when they come, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:10">Isa. lxvi. 10</A>.

 The inference from this promise is, "<I>Therefore love the truth and
 peace;</I> be faithful and honest in all your dealings, and let it be a 
 pleasure to you to be so, though thereby you cut yourselves short of 
 those gains which you see others get dishonestly; and, as much as in 
 you lies, live peaceably with all men, and be in your element when you 
 are in charity. Let the truths of God rule in your heads, and let the 
 peace of God rule in your hearts."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That a great accession should be made to the church by the 
 conversion of many foreigners, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:20-23"><I>v.</I> 20-23</A>.

 This was fulfilled but in part when, in the latter times of the Jewish 
 church, there were abundance of proselytes from all the countries 
 about, and some that lay very remote, who came yearly to worship at 
 Jerusalem, which added very much both to the grandeur and wealth of 
 that city, and contributed greatly to the making of it so considerable 
 as it came to be before our Saviour's time, though now it was but just 
 peeping out of its ruins. But it would be accomplished much more fully 
 in the conversion of the Gentiles to the faith of Christ, and the 
 incorporating of them with the believing Jews in one great body, under 
 Christ the head, a <I>mystery</I> which is <I>made manifest</I> by the 
 <I>scriptures of the prophets</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:26">Rom. xvi. 26</A>),

 and by this among the rest, which makes it strange that when it was
 accomplished it was so great a surprise and stumbling-block to the 
 Jews. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Who they are that shall be added to the church--<I>people, and the
 inhabitants of many cities</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>);

 not only a few ignorant country people that may be easily imposed upon, 
 or some idle people that have nothing else to do, but intelligent 
 inquisitive citizens, men of business and acquaintance with the world, 
 shall embrace the gospel of Christ; <I>yea, many people and strong 
 nations</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),
 
 some of <I>all languages,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 By this it appears that they are brought into the church, not by human 
 persuasion, for they are of different languages, not by external force, 
 for they are strong nations, able to have kept their ground if they had 
 been so attacked, but purely by the effectual working of divine truth 
 and grace. Note, God has his remnant in all parts; and in the general 
 assembly of the church of the first-born some will be found <I>out of 
 all nations and kindreds,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:9">Rev. vii. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How their accession to the church is described: They shall come 
 <I>to pray before the Lord and to seek the Lord of hosts</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>);
 
 and, to show that this is the main matter in which their conversion 
 consists, it is repeated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 They <I>shall come to seek the Lord of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray 
 before the Lord.</I> No mention is made of their offering sacrifices, 
 not only because these were not expected from the proselytes of the 
 gate, but because, when the Gentiles should be brought in, sacrifice 
 and offering should be quite abolished. See who are to be accounted 
 converts to God and members of the church: and all that are converts to 
 God are members of the church.

 (1.) They are such as <I>seek the Lord of hosts,</I> such as enquire 
 for <I>God their Maker,</I> covet and court his favour, and are truly 
 desirous to know his mind and will and sincerely devoted to his honour 
 and glory. <I>This is the generation of those that seek him.</I> 

 (2.) They are such as <I>pray before the Lord,</I>--such as make 
 conscience, and make a business, of the duty of prayer,--such as dare 
 not, would not, for all the world, live without it,--such as by prayer 
 pay their homage to God, own their dependence upon him, maintain their 
 communion with him, and fetch in mercy and grace from him. 

 (3.) They are such as herein have an eye to the divine revelation and 
 institution, which is signified by their doing this <I>in 
 Jerusalem,</I> the place which God had chosen, where his word was, 
 where his temple was, which was a type of Christ and his mediation, 
 which all faithful worshippers will have a believing regard to.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. How unanimous they shall be in their accession to the church, and 
 how zealous in exciting one another to it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>The inhabitants of one city shall go to another,</I> as formerly 
 when they went up from all parts of the country to worship at the 
 yearly feasts; and they shall say, <I>Let us go speedily to pray before 
 the Lord; I will go also.</I> This intimates, 

 (1.) That those who are brought into an acquaintance with Christ 
 themselves should do all they can to bring others acquainted with him; 
 thus Andrew invited Peter to Christ and Philip invited Nathanael. True 
 grace hates monopolies. 

 (2.) That those who are duly sensible of their need of Christ, and of 
 the favour of God through him, will stir up themselves and others 
 without delay to hasten to him: "<I>Let us go speedily to pray;</I> it 
 is for our lives, and the lives of our souls, that we are to petition, 
 and therefore it concerns us to lose no time; in a matter of such 
 moment delays are dangerous." 

 (3.) That our communion with God is very much assisted and furthered by 
 the communion of saints. It is pleasant to go <I>to the house of God in 
 company</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+55:14">Ps. lv. 14</A>),
 
 <I>with the multitude</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:4">Ps. xlii. 4</A>),

 and it is of good use to those that do so to excite one another to go
 speedily and lose no time; we should be glad when it is said to us,
 <I>Let us go,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+122:1">Ps. cxxii. 1</A>.

 As iron sharpens iron, so may good men sharpen the countenances and
 spirits one of another in that which is good.

 (4.) That those who stir up others to that which is good must take heed 
 that they do not turn off, or tire, or draw back themselves; he that 
 says, <I>Let us go,</I> says, <I>I will go also.</I> What good we put 
 others upon doing we must see to it that we do ourselves, else we shall 
 be judged out of our own mouths. Not, "Do you go, and I will stay at
 home;" but, "Do you go, and I will go with you." "A singular pattern 
 (says Mr. Pemble) of zealous charity, that neither leaves others behind 
 nor turns others before it."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Upon what inducement they shall join themselves to the church, not 
 for the church's sake, but for his sake who dwells in it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):
 
 <I>Ten men</I> of different nations and languages <I>shall take hold of 
 the skirt of him that is a Jew,</I> begging of him not to outgo them, 
 but to take them along with him. This intimates the great honour they 
 have for a Jew, as one of the chosen people of God, and therefore well 
 worthy their acquaintance; they cannot all come to take him by the 
 hand, or embrace him in their arms, but are ambitious to take hold of 
 the skirt of his robe, to touch the hem of his garment, saying, <I>We
 will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.</I> The 
 gospel was preached to the Jews first (for of that nation the apostles 
 were) and by them it was carried to the Gentiles. St. Paul was a Jew 
 whose skirt many took hold of when they welcomed him as <I>an angel of 
 God,</I> and begged him to take them along with him to Christ; thus the 
 Greeks took hold of Philip's skirt, saying, <I>Sir, we would see 
 Jesus,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:21">John xii. 21</A>.

 Note, It is the privilege of the saints that they have God with them,
 have him among them--the knowledge, and fear, and worship of him; they 
 have his favour and gracious presence, and this should invite us into 
 communion with them. It is good being with those who have God with 
 them, and those who <I>join themselves to the Lord</I> must <I>join 
 themselves to his disciples;</I> if we take God for our God, we must 
 take his people for our people, cast in our lot among them, and be 
 willing to take our lot with them.</P>
