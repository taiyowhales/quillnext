 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter, though it has the same number of verses with the 1st, 
 2nd, and 4th, is not alphabetical, as they were, but the scope of it is 
 the same with that of all the foregoing elegies. We have in it, 

 I. A representation of the present calamitous state of God's people in
 their captivity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:1-16">ver. 1-16</A>.

 II. A protestation of their concern for God's sanctuary, as that which
 lay nearer their heart than any secular interest of their own,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:17,18">ver. 17, 18</A>.

 III. A humble supplication to God and expostulation with him, for the
 returns of mercy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:19-22">ver. 19-22</A>);

 for those that lament and do not pray sin in their lamentations. Some
 ancient versions call this chapter, "The Prayer of Jeremiah."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Remember, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, what is come upon us: consider, and behold
 our reproach.
 &nbsp; 2  Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.
 &nbsp; 3  We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers <I>are</I> as widows.
 &nbsp; 4  We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto
 us.
 &nbsp; 5  Our necks <I>are</I> under persecution: we labour, <I>and</I> have no
 rest.
 &nbsp; 6  We have given the hand <I>to</I> the Egyptians, <I>and to</I> the
 Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.
 &nbsp; 7  Our fathers have sinned, <I>and are</I> not; and we have borne
 their iniquities.
 &nbsp; 8  Servants have ruled over us: <I>there is</I> none that doth
 deliver <I>us</I> out of their hand.
 &nbsp; 9  We gat our bread with <I>the peril of</I> our lives because of the
 sword of the wilderness.
 &nbsp; 10  Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible
 famine.
 &nbsp; 11  They ravished the women in Zion, <I>and</I> the maids in the
 cities of Judah.
 &nbsp; 12  Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders
 were not honoured.
 &nbsp; 13  They took the young men to grind, and the children fell
 under the wood.
 &nbsp; 14  The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from
 their music.
 &nbsp; 15  The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into
 mourning.
 &nbsp; 16  The crown is fallen <I>from</I> our head: woe unto us, that we
 have sinned!
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Is any afflicted? let him pray;</I> and let him in prayer pour out 
 his complaint to God, and make known before him his trouble. The people 
 of God do so here; being overwhelmed with grief, they give vent to 
 their sorrows at the footstool of the throne of grace, and so give 
 themselves ease. They complain not of evils feared, but of evils felt: 
 "<I>Remember what has come upon us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 What was of old threatened against us, and was long in the coming, has 
 now at length <I>come upon us,</I> and we are ready to sink under it. 
 <I>Remember what is</I> past, <I>consider and behold</I> what is 
 present, and <I>let not all the trouble</I> we are in <I>seem little to 
 thee,</I> and not worth taking notice of," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:32">Neh. ix. 32</A>.

 Note, As it is a great comfort to us, so it ought to be a sufficient
 one, in our troubles, that God sees, and considers, and remembers, all 
 that <I>has come upon us;</I> and in our prayers we need only to 
 recommend our case to his gracious and compassionate consideration. The 
 one word in which all their grievances are summer up is <I>reproach: 
 Consider, and behold our reproach.</I> The troubles they were in 
 compared with their former dignity and plenty, were a greater reproach 
 to them than they would have been to any other people, especially 
 considering their relation to God and dependence upon him, and his 
 former appearances for them; and therefore this they complain of very 
 sensibly, because, as it was a reproach, it reflected upon the name and 
 honour of that God who had owned them for his people. <I>And what wilt 
 thou do unto thy great name?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They acknowledge the reproach of sin which they bear, <I>the 
 reproach of their youth</I> (which Ephraim bemoans himself for, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:19">Jer. xxxi. 19</A>),

 of the early days of their nation. This comes in in the midst of their
 complaints

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 but may well be put in the front of them: <I>Our fathers have sinned 
 and are not;</I> they are dead and gone, but <I>we have borne their 
 iniquities.</I> This is not here a peevish complaint, nor an imputation 
 of unrighteousness to God, like that which we have, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:29,Eze+18:2">Jer. xxxi. 29, Ezek. xviii. 2</A>.

 <I>The fathers did eat sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on
 edge,</I> and therefore <I>the ways of the Lord are not equal.</I> But 
 it is a penitent confession of the sins of their ancestors, which they 
 themselves also had persisted in, for which they now justly suffered; 
 the judgments God brought upon them were so very great that it appeared 
 that God had in them an eye to the sins of their ancestors (because 
 they had not been remarkably punished in this world) as well as to 
 their own sins; and thus God was justified both in his connivance at 
 their ancestors (he <I>laid up their iniquity for their children</I>) 
 and in his severity with them, on whom he visited that iniquity, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:35,36">Matt. xxiii. 35, 36</A>.

 Thus they do here,

 1. Submit themselves to the divine justice: "Lord, thou art just in all
 that is brought upon us, for we are a seed of evil doers, children of 
 wrath, and heirs of the curse; we are sinful, and we have it by kind." 
 Note, The sins which God looks back upon in punishing we must look back 
 upon in repenting, and must take notice of all that which will help to 
 justify God in correcting us. 

 2. They refer themselves to the divine pity: "Lord, <I>our fathers have 
 sinned,</I> and we justly smart for their sins; but <I>they are 
 not;</I> they were taken away from the evil to come; they lived not to 
 see and share in these miseries that have <I>come upon us,</I> and we 
 are left to <I>bear their iniquities.</I> Now, though herein God is 
 righteous, yet it must be owned that our case is pitiable, and worthy 
 of compassion." Note, If we be penitent and patient under what we 
 suffer for the sins of our fathers, we may expect that he who punishes 
 will pity, and will soon return in mercy to us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They represent the reproach of trouble which they bear, in divers 
 particulars, which tend much to their disgrace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They are disseised of that good land which God gave them, and their 
 enemies have got possession of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Canaan was their inheritance; it was theirs by promise. God gave it to 
 them and their seed, and they held it by grant from his crown, 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:21,22">Ps. cxxxvi. 21, 22</A>);

 but now, "It is turned to strangers; those possess it who have no right
 to it, who are <I>strangers to the commonwealth of Israel and aliens 
 from the covenants of promise;</I> they dwell in the houses that we 
 built, and this is our reproach." It is the happiness of all God's 
 spiritual Israel that the heavenly Canaan is an inheritance that they 
 cannot be disseised of, that shall never be turned to strangers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Their state and nation are brought into a condition like that of 
 widows and orphans 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>We are fatherless</I> (that is, helpless); we have none to protect 
 us, to provide for us, to take any care of us. Our king, who is the 
 father of the country, is cut off; nay, God our Father seems to have 
 forsaken us and cast us off; <I>our mothers,</I> our cities, that were 
 as fruitful mothers in Israel, <I>are</I> now <I>as widows,</I> are as 
 wives whose husbands are dead, destitute of comfort, and exposed to 
 wrong and injury, and this is our reproach; for we who made a figure 
 are now looked on with contempt."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They are put hard to it to provide necessaries for themselves and 
 their families, whereas once they lived in abundance and had plenty of 
 every thing. Water used to be free and easily come by, but now 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),
 
 <I>We have drunk our water for money,</I> and the saying is no longer 
 true, <I>Usus communis aquarum</I>--<I>Water is free to all.</I> So
 hardly did their oppressors use them that they could not have a draught 
 of fair water but they must purchase it either with money or with work. 
 Formerly they had fuel too for the fetching; but now, "<I>Our wood is 
 sold to us,</I> and we pay dearly for every faggot." Now were they 
 punished for employing their children to gather wood for fire with 
 which to <I>bake cakes for the queen of heaven,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:18">Jer. vii. 18</A>.

 They were perfectly proscribed by their oppressors, were forbidden the
 use both of fire and water, according to the ancient form, <I>Interdico 
 tibi aqua et igni</I>--<I>I forbid thee the use of water and fire.</I> 
 But what must they do for bread? Truly that was as hard to come at as 
 any thing, for

 (1.) Some of them sold their liberty for it
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):
 
 "<I>We have given the hand to the Egyptians and to the Assyrians,</I> 
 have made the best bargain we could with them, to serve them, that we 
 might <I>be satisfied with bread.</I> We were glad to submit to the 
 meanest employment, upon the hardest terms, to get a sorry livelihood; 
 we have yielded ourselves to be their vassals, have parted with all to 
 them, as the Egyptians did to Pharaoh in the years of famine, that we 
 might have something for ourselves and families to subsist on." The 
 neighbouring nations used to trade with Judah for wheat 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:17">Ezek. xxvii. 17</A>),
 
 for it was a fruitful land; but now it <I>eats up the inhabitants,</I>
 and they are glad to make court to the Egyptians and Assyrians. 

 (2.) Others of them ventured their lives for it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>We got our bread with the peril of our lives;</I> when, being 
 straitened by the siege and all provisions cut off, they either sallied 
 or stole out of the city, to fetch in some supply, they were in danger 
 of falling into the hands of the besiegers and being put to the sword, 
 <I>the sword of the wilderness</I> it is called, or <I>of the plain</I> 
 (for so the word signifies), the besiegers lying dispersed every where 
 in the plains that were about the city. Let us take occasion hence to 
 bless God for the plenty that we enjoy, that we get our bread so 
 easily, scarcely with the sweat of our face, much less <I>with the 
 peril of our lives;</I> and for the peace we enjoy, that we can go out, 
 and enjoy not only the necessary productions, but the pleasures of the 
 country, without any fear of <I>the sword of the wilderness.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Those are brought into slavery who were a free people, and not only 
 their own masters, but masters of all about them, and this is as much 
 as any thing their reproach 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Our necks are under</I> the grievous and intolerable yoke of 
 <I>persecution</I> (the iron yoke which Jeremiah foretold should be 
 laid upon them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+28:14">Jer. xxviii. 14</A>);

 we are used like beasts in the yoke, that wholly serve their owners,
 and are at the command of their drivers. That which aggravated the
 servitude was,

 (1.) That their labours were incessant, like those of Israel in Egypt,
 who were daily tasked, nay, overtasked: <I>We labour and have no 
 rest,</I> neither leave nor leisure to rest. The oxen in the yoke are 
 unyoked at night and have rest; so they have, by a particular provision 
 of the law, on the sabbath day; but the poor captives in Babylon, who 
 were compelled to work for their living, <I>laboured and had no 
 rest,</I> no night's rest, no sabbath-rest; they were quite tired out 
 with continual toil.

 (2.) That their masters were insufferable
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Servants have ruled over us;</I> and nothing is more vexatious than 
 <I>a servant when he reigns,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:22">Prov. xxx. 22</A>.

 They were not only the great men of the Chaldeans that commanded them, 
 but even the meanest of their servants abused them at pleasure, and 
 insulted over them; and they must be at their beck too. The curse of 
 Canaan had now become the doom of Judah: <I>A servant of servants shall 
 he be.</I> They would not be ruled by their God, and by his servants 
 the prophets, whose rule was gentle and gracious, and therefore justly 
 are they ruled with rigour by their enemies and their servants. 

 (3.) That they saw no probable way for the redress of their grievances:
 "<I>There is none that doth deliver us out of their hand;</I> not only 
 none to rescue us out of our captivity, but none to check and restrain 
 the insolence of the servants that abuse us and trample upon us," which 
 one would think their masters should have done, because it was a 
 usurpation of their authority; but, it should seem, they connived at it 
 and encouraged it, and, as if they were not worthy of the correction of 
 gentlemen, they are turned over to the footmen to be spurned by them.
 Well might they pray, <I>Lord, consider and behold our 
 reproach.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Those who used to be feasted are now famished 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>Our skin was black like an oven,</I> dried and parched too, 
 <I>because of the terrible famine,</I> the <I>storms of famine</I> (so 
 the word is); for, though famine comes gradually upon a people, yet it 
 comes violently, and bears down all before it, and there is no 
 resisting it; and this also is their disgrace; hence we read of <I>the 
 reproach of famine,</I> which in captivity their received among the 
 heathen, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:30">Ezek. xxxvi. 30</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. All sorts of people, even those whose persons and characters were 
 most inviolable, were abused and dishonoured. 

 (1.) The <I>women</I> were <I>ravished,</I> even <I>the women in
 Zion,</I> that holy mountain,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 The committing of such abominable wickednesses there is very justly and 
 sadly complained of. 

 (2.) The great men were not only put to death, but put to ignominious
 deaths. <I>Princes were hanged,</I> as if they had been slaves, <I>by 
 the hands</I> of the Chaldeans

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 who took a pride in doing this barbarous execution with <I>their own 
 hands.</I> Some think that the dead bodies of the princes, after they 
 were slain with the sword, were hung up, as the bodies of Saul's sons, 
 in disgrace to them, and as it were to expiate the nation's guilt. 

 (3.) No respect was shown to magistrates and those in authority: <I>The
 faces of elders,</I> elders in age, elders in office, <I>were not 
 honoured.</I> This will be particularly remembered against the 
 Chaldeans another day.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:6">Isa. xlvii. 6</A>,

 <I>Upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke.</I>

 (4.) The tenderness of youth was no more considered than the gravity of 
 old age

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>They took the young men to grind</I> at the hand-mills, nay, perhaps 
 at the horse-mills. <I>The young men have carried the grist</I> (so
 some), <I>have carried the mill,</I> or <I>mill-stones,</I> so others. 
 They loaded them as if they had been beasts of burden, and so broke 
 their backs while they were young, and made the rest of their lives the 
 more miserable. Nay, they made <I>the</I> little <I>children</I> carry 
 their wood home for fuel, and laid such burdens upon them that they 
 <I>fell</I> down <I>under</I> them, so very inhuman were these cruel 
 taskmasters!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. An end was put to all their gladness, and their joy was quite 
 extinguished 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>The young men,</I> who used to be disposed to mirth, have ceased 
 <I>from their music,</I> have hung their harps upon the willow-trees. 
 It does indeed well become old men to cease from their music; it is 
 time to lay it by with a gracious contempt when <I>all the daughters of 
 music are brought low;</I> but it speaks some great calamity upon a 
 people when their young men are made to cease from it. It was so with 
 the body of the people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>The joy of their heart ceased;</I> they never knew what joy was 
 since the enemy came in upon them like a flood, for ever since <I>deep 
 called unto deep,</I> and one wave flowed in upon the neck of another, 
 so that they were quite overwhelmed: <I>Our dance is turned into 
 mourning,</I> instead of leaping for joy, as formerly, we sink and lie 
 down in sorrow. This may refer especially to the joy of their solemn 
 feasts, and the dancing used in them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+21:21">Judg. xxi. 21</A>),

 which was not only modest, but sacred, dancing; this was <I>turned into
 mourning,</I> which was doubled on their festival days, in remembrance 
 of their former pleasant things.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 8. An end was put to all their glory. 

 (1.) The public administration of justice was their glory, but that was
 gone: <I>The elders have ceased from the gate</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);

 the course of justice, which used to run down like a river, is now 
 stopped; the courts of justice, which used to be kept with so much 
 solemnity, are put down; for the judges are slain, or carried captive. 
 
 (2.) The royal dignity was their glory, but that also was gone: <I>The
 crown has fallen from our head,</I> not only the <I>king</I> himself 
 fallen into disgrace, but <I>the crown;</I> he has no successor; the 
 regalia are all lost. Note, Earthly crowns are fading falling things; 
 but, blessed be God, there is <I>a crown of glory that fades not 
 away,</I> that never falls, <I>a kingdom that cannot be moved.</I> Upon 
 this complaint, but with reference to all the foregoing complaints, 
 they make that penitent acknowledgment, "<I>Woe unto us that we have 
 sinned!</I> Alas for us! Our case is very deplorable, and it is all 
 owing to ourselves; we are undone, and, which aggravates the matter, we 
 are undone by our own hands. God is righteous, for <I>we have 
 sinned.</I>" Note, All our woes are owing to our own sin and folly. If 
 <I>the crown of our head be fallen</I> (for so the words run), if we 
 lose our excellency and become mean, we may thank ourselves, we have by 
 our own iniquity profaned our crown and <I>laid our honour in the 
 dust.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  For this our heart is faint; for these <I>things</I> our eyes are

 &nbsp; 18  Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the

 &nbsp; 19  Thou, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. The people of God express the deep concern they had for the ruins of 
 the temple, more than for any other of their calamities; the interests 
 of God's house lay nearer their hearts than those of their own 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>):

 <I>For this our heart is faint,</I> and sinks under the load of its own 
 heaviness; <I>for these things our eyes are dim,</I> and our sight is 
 gone, as is usual in a deliquium, or fainting fit. "It is <I>because of 
 the mountain of Zion, which is desolate,</I> the holy mountain, and the 
 temple built upon that mountain. For other desolations our hearts 
 grieve and our eyes weep; but for this our hearts faint and our eyes 
 are dim." Note, Nothing lies so heavily upon the spirits of good people 
 as that which threatens the ruin of religion or weakens its interests; 
 and it is a comfort if we can appeal to God that that afflicts us more 
 than any temporal affliction to ourselves. "The people have polluted
 the <I>mountain of Zion</I> with their sins, and therefore God has 
 justly made it <I>desolate,</I> to such a degree that <I>the foxes walk 
 upon it</I> as freely and commonly as they do in the woods." It is sad 
 indeed when the <I>mountain of Zion</I> has become <I>a portion for 
 foxes</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:10">Ps. lxiii. 10</A>);

 but sin had first made it so,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They comfort themselves with the doctrine of God's eternity, and 
 the perpetuity of his government 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 But <I>thou, O Lord! remainest for ever.</I> This they are taught to
 do by that psalm which is entitled, <I>A prayer of the afflicted,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:27,28">Ps. cii. 27, 28</A>.

 When all our creature-comforts are removed from us, and our hearts fail
 us, we may then encourage ourselves with the belief,

 1. Of God's eternity: <I>Thou remainest for ever.</I> What shakes the
 world gives no disturbance to him who made it; whatever revolutions 
 there are on earth there is no change in the Eternal Mind; God is still 
 the same, and <I>remains for ever</I> infinitely wise and holy, just 
 and good; with him there is <I>no variableness nor shadow of 
 turning.</I> 

 2. Of the never-failing continuance of his dominion: <I>Thy throne is
 from generation to generation;</I> the throne of glory, the throne of 
 grace, and the throne of government, are all unchangeable, immovable; 
 and this is matter of comfort to us when <I>the crown has fallen from 
 our head.</I> When the thrones of princes, that should be our 
 protectors, are brought to the dust, and buried in it, God's throne 
 continues still; he still rules the world, and rules it for the good of 
 the church. The Lord reigns, reigns for ever, even <I>thy God, O 
 Zion!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They humbly expostulate with God concerning the low condition they 
 were now in, and the frowns of heaven they were now under 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):
 
 "<I>Wherefore dost thou forsake us so long time,</I> as if we were 
 quite deprived of the tokens of thy presence? Wherefore dost thou
 defer our deliverance, as if thou hadst utterly abandoned us? Thou art 
 the same, and, though the throne of thy sanctuary is demolished, thy 
 throne in heaven is unshaken. But wilt thou not be the same to us?" Not 
 as if they thought God had forgotten and forsaken them, much less 
 feared his forgetting and forsaking them for ever; but thus they 
 express the value they had for his favour and presence, which they 
 thought it long that they were deprived of the evidence and comfort of. 
 The 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:22">last verse</A>

 may be read as such an expostulation, and so the margin reads it:
 "<I>For wilt thou utterly reject us? Wilt thou be perpetually wroth 
 with us,</I> not only not smile upon us and remember us in mercy, but 
 frown upon us and lay us under the tokens of thy wrath, not only not 
 draw nigh to us, but cast us out of thy presence and forbid us to draw 
 nigh unto thee? How ill this be reconciled with thy goodness and 
 faithfulness, and the stability of thy covenant?" We read it, "<I>But 
 thou hast rejected us;</I> thou hast given us cause to fear that thou 
 hast. Lord, how long shall we be in this temptation?" Note, Thou we may 
 not quarrel with God, yet we may plead with him; and, though we may not 
 conclude that he has cast off, yet we may (with the prophet, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:1">Jer. xii. 1</A>)
 
 humbly reason with him concerning his judgments, especially the
 continuance of the desolations of his sanctuary.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. They earnestly pray to God for mercy and grace: "Lord, do not 
 reject <I>us for ever,</I> but <I>turn thou us unto thee; renew our 
 days,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Though these words are not put last, yet the Rabbin, because they would 
 not have the book to conclude with those melancholy words 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:22">v. 22</A>),
 
 repeat this prayer again, that the sun may not set under a cloud, and 
 so make these the last words both in writing and reading this chapter. 
 They here pray, 

 1. For converting grace to prepare and qualify them for mercy: <I>Turn
 us to thee, O Lord!</I> They had complained that God had forsaken and 
 forgotten them, and then their prayer is not, <I>Turn thou to us,</I> 
 but, <I>Turn us to thee,</I> which implies an acknowledgment that the 
 cause of the distance was in themselves. God never leaves any till they 
 first leave him, nor stands afar off from any longer than while they 
 stand afar off from him; if therefore he turn them to him in a way of 
 duty, no doubt but he will quickly return to them in a way of mercy. 
 This agrees with that repeated prayer

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:3,7,19">Ps. lxxx. 3, 7, 19</A>),

 <I>Turn us again, and then cause thy face to shine. Turn us</I> from
 our idols to thyself, by a sincere repentance and reformation, 
 <I>and</I> then <I>we shall be turned.</I> This implies a further 
 acknowledgment of their own weakness and inability to turn themselves. 
 There is in our nature a proneness to backslide from God, but no 
 disposition to return to him till his grace works in us both <I>to will 
 and to do.</I> So necessary is that grace that we may truly say, 
 <I>Turn us or we shall not be turned,</I> but shall wander endlessly; 
 and so powerful and effectual is that grace that we may as truly say, 
 <I>Turn us, and we shall be turned;</I> for it is a day of power, 
 almighty power, in which God's people are made a <I>willing people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:3">Ps. cx. 3</A>.

 2. For restoring mercy: <I>Turn us to thee,</I> and then <I>renew our
 days as of old,</I> put us into the same happy state that our ancestors 
 were in long ago and that they continued long in; let it be with us as 
 it was <I>at the first,</I> and <I>at the beginning,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:26">Isa. i. 26</A>.
 
 Note, If God by his grace renew our hearts, he will be his favour
 <I>renew our days,</I> so that we shall <I>renew our youth as the 
 eagle,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:5">Ps. ciii. 5</A>.

 Those that <I>repent, and do their first works,</I> shall rejoice, and
 recover their first comforts. God's mercies to his people have been 
 <I>ever of old</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+25:6">Ps. xxv. 6</A>);

 and therefore they may hope, even then when he seems to have forsaken
 and forgotten them, that the mercy which was <I>from everlasting</I> 
 will be <I>to everlasting.</I></P>
