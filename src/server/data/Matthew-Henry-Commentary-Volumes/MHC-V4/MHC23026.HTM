 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter is a song of holy joy and praise, in which the great 
 things God had engaged, in the foregoing chapter, to do for his people 
 against his enemies and their enemies are celebrated: it is prepared to 
 be sung when that prophecy should be accomplished; for we must be 
 forward to meet God with our thanksgivings when he is coming towards us 
 with his mercies. Now the people of God are here taught, 

 I. To triumph in the safety and holy security both of the church in
 general and of every particular member of it, under the divine 
 protection, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. To triumph over all opposing powers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:5,6">ver. 5, 6</A>.

 III. To walk with God, and wait for him, in the worst and darkest
 times, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:7-9">ver. 7-9</A>.

 IV. To lament the stupidity of those who regarded not the providence of
 God, either merciful or afflictive,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:10,11">ver. 10, 11</A>.

 V. To encourage themselves, and one another, with hopes that God would 
 still continue to do them good 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:12,14">ver. 12, 14</A>),

 and engage themselves to continue in his service,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:13">ver. 13</A>.

 VI. To recollect the kind providences of God towards them in their low
 and distressed condition, and their conduct under those providences, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:15-18">ver. 15-18</A>.

 VII. To rejoice in hope of a glorious deliverance, which should be as a
 resurrection to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:19">ver. 19</A>),

 and to retire in the expectation of it, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:20,21">ver. 20, 21</A>.

 And this is written for the support and assistance of the faith and 
 hope of God's people in all ages, even those upon whom the ends of the 
 world have come.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We
 have a strong city; salvation will <I>God</I> appoint <I>for</I> walls and
 bulwarks.
 &nbsp; 2  Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth
 the truth may enter in.
 &nbsp; 3  Thou wilt keep <I>him</I> in perfect peace, <I>whose</I> mind <I>is</I>
 stayed <I>on thee:</I> because he trusteth in thee.
 &nbsp; 4  Trust ye in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> for ever: for in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> JEHOVAH <I>is</I>
 everlasting strength:
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 To the prophecies of gospel grace very fitly is a song annexed, in 
 which we may give God the glory and take to ourselves the comfort of 
 that grace: <I>In that day,</I> the gospel day, which the day of the 
 victories and enlargements of the Old-Testament church was typical of 
 (to some of which perhaps this has a primary reference), <I>in that day 
 this song shall be sung;</I> there shall be persons to sing it, and 
 cause and hearts to sing it; it shall be sung <I>in the land of 
 Judah,</I> which was a figure of the gospel church; for the gospel 
 covenant is said to be made <I>with the house of Judah,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:8">Heb. viii. 8</A>.
 
 Glorious things are here said of the church of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That it is strongly fortified against those that are bad 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):
 
 <I>We have a strong city.</I> It is a city incorporated by the charter
 of the everlasting covenant, fitted for the reception of all that are 
 made free by that charter, for their employment and entertainment; it 
 is a strong city, as Jerusalem was, while it was a city compact 
 together, and had God himself a wall of fire round about it, so strong 
 that none would have believed that an enemy could ever <I>enter into 
 the gates of Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:12">Lam. iv. 12</A>.

 The church is a strong city, for it has <I>walls and bulwarks,</I> or
 counterscarps, and those of God's own appointing; for he has, in his 
 promise, appointed salvation itself to be its defence. Those that are 
 designed for salvation will find that to be their protection, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:4">1 Pet. i. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That it is richly replenished with those that are good, and they 
 are instead of fortifications to it; for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, 
 if they are such as they should be, are its strength, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:5">Zech. xii. 5</A>.

 The gates are here ordered to be opened, <I>that the righteous nation,
 which keeps the truth, may enter in,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 They had been banished and driven out by the iniquity of the former
 times, but now the laws that were made against them are repealed, and 
 they have liberty to enter in again. Or, There is an act for a general 
 naturalization of all the righteous, whatever nation they are of, 
 encouraging them to come and settle in Jerusalem. When God has done 
 great things for any place or people he expects that thus they should 
 render according to the benefit done unto them; they should be kind to 
 his people, and take them under their protection and into their bosom. 
 Note,

 1. It is the character of righteous men that they keep the truths of
 God, a firm belief of which will have a commanding influence upon the 
 regularity of the whole conversation. Good principles fixed in the head 
 will produce good resolutions in the heart and good practices in the 
 life. 

 2. It is the interest of states to countenance such, and court them
 among them, for they bring a blessing with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That all who belong to it are safe and easy, and have a holy 
 security and serenity of mind in the assurance of God's favour. 

 1. This is here the matter of a promise

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Thou wilt keep him in peace, peace,</I> in <I>perfect peace,</I>
 inward peace, outward peace, peace with God, peace of conscience, peace 
 at all times, under all events; this peace shall <I>he</I> be put into, 
 and kept in the possession of, <I>whose mind is stayed upon God, 
 because it trusts in him.</I> It is the character of every good man 
 that he trusts in God, puts himself under his guidance and government, 
 and depends upon him that it shall be greatly to his advantage to do 
 so. Those that trust in God must have their minds stayed upon him, must 
 trust him at all times, under all events, must firmly and faithfully 
 adhere to him, with an entire satisfaction in him; and such as do so 
 God will keep in perpetual peace, and that peace shall keep them. When 
 evil tidings are abroad <I>those</I> shall calmly expect the event, and 
 not be disturbed by frightful apprehensions arising from them, whose 
 hearts are <I>fixed, trusting in the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:7">Ps. cxii. 7</A>.

 2. It is the matter of a precept

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "Let us make ourselves easy by <I>trusting in the Lord for ever;</I>
 since God has promised peace to those that stay themselves upon him, 
 let us not lose the benefit of that promise, but repose an entire 
 confidence in him. Trust in him for ever, at all times, when you have 
 nothing else to trust to; trust in him for that peace, that portion, 
 which will be for ever." Whatever we trust to the world for, it will be 
 but for a moment: all we expect from it is confined within the limits 
 of time. But what we trust in God for will last as long as we shall 
 last. For in the <I>Lord Jehovah-Jah, Jehovah,</I> in him who was, and 
 is, and is to come, there is a rock of ages, a firm and lasting 
 foundation for faith and hope to build upon; and the house built on 
 that rock will stand in a storm. Those that trust in God shall not only 
 find in him, but receive <I>from him, everlasting strength,</I> 
 strength that will carry them to everlasting life, to that blessedness 
 which is for ever; and therefore let them trust in him for ever, and 
 never cast away nor change their confidence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city,
 he layeth it low; he layeth it low, <I>even</I> to the ground; he
 bringeth it <I>even</I> to the dust.
 &nbsp; 6  The foot shall tread it down, <I>even</I> the feet of the poor,
 <I>and</I> the steps of the needy.
 &nbsp; 7  The way of the just <I>is</I> uprightness: thou, most upright,
 dost weigh the path of the just.
 &nbsp; 8  Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, have we waited for
 thee; the desire of <I>our</I> soul <I>is</I> to thy name, and to the
 remembrance of thee.
 &nbsp; 9  With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my
 spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments
 <I>are</I> in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn
 righteousness.
 &nbsp; 10  Let favour be showed to the wicked, <I>yet</I> will he not learn
 righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly,
 and will not behold the majesty of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 11  L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>when</I> thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: <I>but</I>
 they shall see, and be ashamed for <I>their</I> envy at the people;
 yea, the fire of thine enemies shall devour them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the prophet further encourages us to trust in the Lord for ever, 
 and to continue waiting on him; for,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He will make humble souls that trust in him to triumph over their 
 proud enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 Those that exalt themselves shall be abased: For he <I>brings down
 those that dwell on high;</I> and wherein they deal proudly he is, and 
 will be, above them. Even the lofty city Babylon itself, or Nineveh,
 he lays it low,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:12"><I>ch.</I> xxv. 12</A>.

 He can do it, be it ever so well fortified. He has often done it. He
 will do it, for he resists the proud. It is his glory to do it, for he 
 proves himself to be God by <I>looking on the proud and abasing 
 them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:12">Job xl. 12</A>.

 But, on the contrary, those that humble themselves shall be exalted;
 for <I>the feet of the poor</I> shall tread upon the lofty cities, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 He does not say, Great armies shall tread them down; but, When God will
 have it done, even the feet of the poor shall do it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:3">Mal. iv. 3</A>.
 
 <I>You shall tread down the wicked. Come, set your feet on the necks of
 these kings.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:6,Ro+16:20">Ps. cxlvii. 6; Rom. xvi. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He takes cognizance of the way of his people and has delight in it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>The way of the just is evenness</I> (so it may be read): it is their
 endeavour and constant care to walk with God in an even steady course 
 of obedience and holy conversation. <I>My foot stands in an even 
 place,</I> goes in an even path, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+26:12">Ps. xxvi. 12</A>.

 And it is their happiness that God makes their way plain and easy
 before them: <I>Thou, most upright, dost level</I> (or <I>make even) 
 the path of the just,</I> by preventing or removing those things that 
 would be stumbling-blocks to them, so that nothing shall offend them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:165">Ps. cxix. 165</A>.

 God <I>weighs</I> it (so we read it); he considers it, and will give
 them grace sufficient for them, to help them over all the difficulties 
 they may meet with in their way. Thus with the upright God will show 
 himself upright.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. It is our duty, and will be our comfort, to wait for God, and to 
 keep up holy desires towards him in the darkest and most discouraging 
 times, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 This has always been the practice of God's people, even when God has
 frowned upon them,

 1. To keep up a constant dependence upon him: "<I>In the way of thy
 judgments we</I> have still <I>waited for thee;</I> when thou hast 
 corrected us we have looked to no other hand than thine to relieve us," 
 as the servant looks only <I>to the hand of his master, till he have 
 mercy upon him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+123:2">Ps. cxxiii. 2</A>.

 We cannot appeal from God's justice but to his mercy. If God's
 judgments continue long, if it be <I>a road of judgments</I> (so the 
 word signifies), yet we must not be weary but continue waiting. 

 2. To send up holy desires towards him. Our troubles, how pressing
 soever, must never put us out of conceit with our religion, nor turn us 
 away from God; but still <I>the desire of our soul must be to his name 
 and to the remembrance of him;</I> and in the night, the darkest 
 longest night of affliction, <I>with our souls must we desire him.</I>

 (1.) Our great concern must be for God's name, and our earnest desire
 must be that his name may be glorified, whatever becomes of us and our 
 names. This is that which we must wait for, and pray for. "<I>Father, 
 glorify thy name,</I> and we are satisfied."

 (2.) Our great comfort must be in the remembrance of that name, of all
 that whereby God has made himself known. The remembrance of God must be 
 our great support and pleasure; and, though sometimes we be unmindful 
 of him, yet still our desire must be towards the remembrance of him and 
 we must take pains with our own hearts to have him always in mind.

 (3.) Our desires towards God must be inward, fervent, and sincere. With
 our soul we must desire him, with our soul we must pant after him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:1">Ps. xlii. 1</A>),

 and with our spirits within us, with the innermost thought and the
 closest application of mind, we must seek him. We make nothing of our 
 religion, whatever our profession be, if we do not make heart-work of 
 it.

 (4.) Even in the darkest night of affliction our desires must be
 towards God, as our sun and shield; for, however God is pleased to deal 
 with us, we must never think the worse of him, nor cool in our love to 
 him.

 (5.) If our desires be indeed towards God, we must give evidence that
 they are so by seeking him, and seeking him early, as those that desire 
 to find him, and dread the thoughts of missing him. Those that would 
 seek God and find him must seek betimes, and seek him earnestly. Though 
 we come ever so early, we shall find him ready to receive us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. It is God's gracious design, in sending abroad his judgments, 
 thereby to bring men to seek him and serve him: <I>When thy judgments 
 are upon the earth,</I> laying all waste, then we have reason to expect 
 that not only God's professing people, but even <I>the inhabitants of 
 the world, will learn righteousness,</I> will have their mistakes 
 rectified and their lives reformed, will be brought to acknowledge 
 God's righteousness in punishing them, will repent of their own 
 unrighteousness in offending God, and so be brought to walk in right 
 paths. They will do this; that is, judgments are designed to bring them 
 to this, they have a natural tendency to produce this effect, and, 
 though many continue obstinate, yet some even of the inhabitants of the 
 world will profit by this discipline, and will learn righteousness; 
 surely they will; they are strangely stupid if they do not. Note, The 
 intention of afflictions is to teach us righteousness; and blessed is 
 the man whom God chastens, and thus teaches, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+94:12">Ps. xciv. 12</A>.

 <I>Discite justitiam, moniti, et non temnere divos--Let this rebuke
 teach you to cultivate righteousness, and cease from despising the 
 gods.</I>--Virgil.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Those are wicked indeed that will not be wrought upon by the 
 favourable methods God takes to subdue and reform them; and it is 
 necessary that God should deal with them in a severe way by his 
 judgments, which shall prevail to humble those that would not otherwise 
 be humbled. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How sinners walk contrary to God, and refuse to comply with the 
 means used for their reformation and to answer the intentions of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 (1.) <I>Favour is shown</I> to them. They receive many mercies from
 God; he causes his sun to shine and his rain to fall upon them, nay, he 
 prospers them, and into their hands he brings plentifully; they escape 
 many of the strokes of God's judgments, which others less wicked than 
 they have been cut off by; in some particular instances they seem to be 
 remarkably favoured above their neighbours, and the design of all this 
 is that they may be won upon to love and serve that God who thus 
 favours them; and yet it is all in vain: <I>They will not learn 
 righteousness,</I> will not be led to repentance by the goodness of 
 God, and therefore it is requisite that God should send his judgments 
 into the earth, to reckon with men for abused mercies.

 (2.) They live <I>in a land of uprightness,</I> where religion is
 professed and is in reputation, where the word of God is preached, and 
 where they have many good examples set them,--in a land of 
 <I>evenness,</I> where there are not so many stumbling-blocks as in 
 other places,--in a land of <I>correction,</I> where vice and 
 profaneness are discountenanced and punished; yet there they will 
 <I>deal unjustly,</I> and go on frowardly in their evil ways. Those 
 that do wickedly deal unjustly both with God and man, as well as with 
 their own souls; and those that will not be reclaimed by the justice of 
 the nation may expect the judgments of God upon them. Nor can those 
 expect a place hereafter in the land of blessedness who now conform not 
 to the laws and usages, nor improve the privileges and advantages, of 
 the land of uprightness; and why do they not? It is because they 
 <I>will not behold the majesty of the Lord,</I> will not believe, will 
 not consider, what a God of terrible majesty he is whose laws and 
 justice they persist in the contempt of. God's majesty appears in all 
 the dispensations of his providence; but they regard it not, and 
 therefore study not to answer the ends of those dispensations. Even 
 when we receive of the mercy of the Lord we must still behold the 
 <I>majesty of the Lord and his goodness.</I>

 (3.) God lifts up his hand to give them warning, that they may, by
 repentance and prayer, make their peace with him; but they take no 
 notice of it, are not aware that God is angry with them, or coming 
 forth against them: <I>They will not see,</I> and none so blind as 
 those who will not see, who shut their eyes against the clearest 
 conviction of guilt and wrath, who ascribe that to chance, or common 
 fate, which is manifestly a divine rebuke, who regard not the 
 threatening symptoms of their own ruin, but cry Peace to themselves, 
 when the righteous God is waging war with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How God will at length be too hard for them; for, when he judges, he 
 will overcome: <I>They will not see, but they shall see,</I> shall be 
 made to see, whether they will or no, that God is angry with them. 
 Atheists, scorners, and the secure, will shortly feel what now they 
 will not believe, that <I>it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands 
 of the living God.</I> They will not see the evil of sin, and 
 particularly the sin of hating and persecuting the people of God; but 
 they shall see, by the tokens of God's displeasure against them for it 
 and the deliverances in which God will plead his people's cause, that 
 what is done against them he takes as done against himself and will 
 reckon for it accordingly. They shall see that they have done God's 
 people a great deal of wrong, and therefore shall be ashamed of their 
 enmity and envy towards them, and their ill usage of such as deserved 
 better treatment. Note, Those that bear ill-will to God's people have 
 reason to be ashamed of it, so absurd and unreasonable is it; and, 
 sooner or later, they shall be ashamed of it, and the remembrance of it 
 shall fill them with confusion. Some read it, <I>They shall see and be 
 confounded for the zeal of the people,</I> by the zeal God will show 
 for his people; when they shall be made to know how jealous God is for 
 the honour and welfare of his people they shall be confounded to think 
 that they might have been of that people and would not. Their doom 
 therefore is that, since they slighted the happiness of God's friends, 
 <I>the fire of his enemies shall devour them,</I> that is, the fire 
 which is prepared for his enemies and with which they shall be 
 devoured, the fire designed for the devil and his angels. Note, Those 
 that are enemies to God's people, and envy them, God looks upon as his 
 enemies, and will deal with them accordingly.</P>

 prayer <I>when</I> thy chastening <I>was</I> upon them.
 &nbsp; 17  Like as a woman with child, <I>that</I> draweth near the time of

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet in these verses looks back upon what God had done with 
 them, both in mercy and judgment, and sings unto God of both, and then 
 looks forward upon what he hoped God would do for them. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His reviews and reflections are mixed. When he looks back upon the 
 state of the church he finds,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That God had in many instances been very gracious to them and had 
 done great things for them. 
 
 (1.) In general
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>Thou hast wrought all our works in us,</I> or <I>for</I> us.
 Whatever good work is done by us, it is owing to a good work wrought by 
 the grace of God in us; it is he that puts good thoughts and affections 
 into our hearts if at any time they be there, and that <I>works in us 
 both to will and to do of his good pleasure. Acti, agimus--Being acted 
 upon, we act.</I> And if any kindness be shown us, or any of our 
 affairs be prosperous and successful, it is God that works it for us. 
 Every creature, every business, that is in any way serviceable to our 
 comfort, is made by him to be so; and sometimes he makes that to work 
 for us which seemed to make against us.

 (2.) In particular
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 "<I>Thou hast increased the nation, O Lord!</I> so that a little one
 has become a thousand (in Egypt they multiplied exceedingly, and 
 afterwards in Canaan, so that they filled the land); and in this 
 <I>thou art glorified,</I>" for the multitude of the people is the 
 honour of the prince, and therein God was glorified as faithful to his 
 covenant with Abraham, that he would make him a father of many nations. 
 Note, God's nation is a growing nation, and it is the glory of God that 
 it is so. The increase of the church, that holy nation, is 
 <I>therefore</I> to be rejoiced in because it is the increase of those 
 that make it their business to glorify God in this world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That yet he had laid them under his rebukes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The neighbouring nations had sometimes oppressed them and
 tyrannised over them 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 "<I>O Lord our God!</I> thou who hast the sole right to rule us, whose
 subjects and servants we are, to thee we complain (for whither else 
 should we go with our complaints?) that <I>other lords besides thee 
 have had dominion over us.</I>" Not only in the days of the Judges, but 
 afterwards, God frequently sold them into the hand of their enemies, or 
 rather, by their iniquities, they <I>sold themselves,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:3-5"><I>ch.</I> lii. 3-5</A>.

 When they had been careless in the service of God, God suffered their
 enemies to have dominion over them, that they might know the difference 
 between his service <I>and the service of the kingdoms of the 
 countries.</I> It may be understood as a confession of sin, their 
 serving other gods, and subjecting themselves to the superstitious laws 
 and customs of their neighbours, by which other lords (for they called 
 their idols <I>baals, lords</I>) had dominion over them, besides God. 
 But now they promise that it shall be so no more: "Henceforth <I>by 
 thee only will we make mention of thy name;</I> we will worship thee 
 only, and in that way only which thou hast instituted and appointed." 
 The same may be our penitent reflection: <I>Other lords, besides God, 
 have had dominion over us;</I> every lust has been our lord, and we 
 have been led captive by it; and it is has been long enough, and too 
 long, that we have thus wronged both God and ourselves. The same 
 therefore must be our pious resolution, that henceforth we will make 
 mention of God's name only and by him only, that we will keep close to 
 God and to our duty and never desert it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They had sometimes been carried into captivity before their 
 enemies 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 "The nation which at first thou didst increase, and make to take root,
 thou hast now diminished, and plucked up, and <I>removed to all the 
 ends of the earth, driven out to the utmost parts of heaven,</I>" as is 
 threatened, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:4,De+28:64">Deut. xxx. 4; xxviii. 64</A>.

 But observe, Between the mention of the increasing of them and that of
 the removing of them it is said, <I>Thou art glorified;</I> for the 
 judgments God inflicts upon his people for their sins are for his 
 honour, as well as the mercies he bestows upon them in performance of 
 his promise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The prophet remembers that when they were thus oppressed and 
 carried captive they cried unto God, which was a good evidence that 
 they neither had quite forsaken him nor were quite forsaken of him, and 
 that there were merciful intentions in the judgments they were under 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>Lord, in trouble have they visited thee.</I> This was usual with the 
 people of Israel, as we find frequently in the story of the Judges. 
 When <I>other lords had dominion over them</I> they <I>humbled 
 themselves, and said, The Lord is righteous,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:6">2 Chron. xii. 6</A>.
 
 See here,

 [1.] The need we have of afflictions. They are necessary to stir up
 prayer; when it is said, <I>In trouble have they visited thee,</I> it 
 is implied that in their peace and prosperity they were strangers to 
 God, kept at a distance from him, and seldom came near him, as if, when 
 the world smiled upon them, they had no occasion for his favours. 

 [2.] The benefit we often have by afflictions. They bring us to God,
 quicken us to our duty, and show us our dependence upon him. Those that 
 before seldom looked at God now visit him; they come frequently, they 
 become friendly, and make their court to him. Before, prayer came drop 
 by drop, but now they <I>pour out a prayer;</I> it comes now like water 
 from a fountain, not like water from a still. They poured out <I>a 
 secret speech;</I> so the margin. Praying is speaking to God, but it is 
 a secret speech; for it is the language of the heart, otherwise it is 
 not praying. Afflictions bring us to secret prayer, in which we may be 
 more free and particular in our addresses to him than we can be in 
 public. In affliction those will seek God early who before sought him 
 slowly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:15">Hos. v. 15</A>.

 It will make men fervent and fluent in prayer. "They poured out a
 prayer, as the drink-offerings were poured out, when thy chastening was 
 upon them." But it is to be feared, when the chastening is off them, 
 they will by degrees return to their former carelessness, as they had 
 often done.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) He complains that their struggles for their own liberty had been 
 very painful and perilous, but that they had not been successful, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.

 [1.] They had the throes and pangs they dreaded: "We have been like a
 woman in labour, that cries out in her pangs; we have with a great deal 
 of anxiety and toil endeavoured to help ourselves, and our troubles 
 have been increased by those attempts;" as when Moses came to deliver 
 Israel the tale of bricks was doubled. Their prayers were quickened by 
 the acuteness of their pains, and became as strong and vehement as the 
 cries of a woman in sore travail. <I>So have we been in thy sight, O 
 Lord!</I> It was a comfort and satisfaction to them, in their distress, 
 that God had his eye upon them, that all their miseries were in his 
 sight; he was no stranger to their pangs or their prayers. <I>Lord,
 all my desire is before thee, and my groaning is not hidden from 
 thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+38:9">Ps. xxxviii. 9</A>.

 Whenever they came to <I>present themselves before the Lord</I> with
 their complaints and petitions they were in agonies like those of a 
 woman in travail.

 [2.] They came short of the issue and success they desired and hoped
 for: "<I>We have been with child;</I> we have had great expectation of 
 a speedy and happy deliverance, have been big with hopes, and, when we 
 have been in pain, have comforted ourselves with this, that the joyful 
 birth would make us forget <I>our misery,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:21">John xvi. 21</A>.

 But, alas! <I>we have as it were brought forth wind;</I> it has proved
 a false conception; our expectations have been frustrated, and our 
 pains have been rather dying pains than travailing ones; we have had a 
 miscarrying womb and dry breasts. All our efforts have proved abortive: 
 <I>We have not wrought any deliverance in the earth,</I> for ourselves 
 or for our friends and allies, but rather have made our own case and 
 theirs worse; <I>neither have the inhabitants of the world,</I> whom we 
 have been contesting with, <I>fallen</I> before us, either in their 
 power or in their hopes; but they are still as high and arrogant as 
 ever." Note, A righteous cause may be strenuously pleaded both by 
 prayer and endeavour, both with God and man, and yet for a great while 
 may be left under a cloud, and the point may not be gained.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His prospects and hopes are very pleasant. In general, "<I>Thou 
 wilt ordain peace for us</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 that is, all that good which the necessity of our case calls for." What
 peace the church has, or hopes for, it is of God's ordaining; and we 
 may comfort ourselves with this, that, what trouble soever may for a 
 time be appointed to the people of God, peace will at length be 
 ordained for them; for the <I>end of those men is peace.</I> And, if 
 God by his Spirit <I>work all our works in us,</I> he will ordain peace 
 for us (for the work of righteousness shall be peace), and that is true 
 and lasting peace, such as the world can neither give nor take away, 
 which God ordains; for, to those that have it, it shall be unchangeable 
 as the ordinances <I>of the day and of the night.</I> Moreover, from 
 what God has done for us, we may encourage ourselves to hope that he 
 will yet further do us good. "Thou hast heard the desire of the humble, 
 and therefore wilt

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:17">Ps. x. 17</A>);
 
 and, when this peace is ordained for us, then <I>by thee only will we
 make mention of thy name</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 we will give the glory of it to thee only, and not to any other, and we
 will depend upon thy grace only to enable us to do so." We cannot 
 praise God's name but by his strength. Two things in particular the 
 prophet here comforts the church with the prospect of:--

 1. The amazing ruin of her enemies

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):
 
 <I>They are dead,</I> those <I>other lords</I> that <I>have had
 dominion over us;</I> their power is irrecoverably broken; they are 
 quite cut off and extinguished: and <I>they shall not live,</I> shall 
 never be able to hold up the head any more. Being <I>deceased, they 
 shall not rise,</I> but, like Haman, when they have begun to fall 
 before the seed of the Jews they shall sink like a stone. Because they 
 are sentenced to this final ruin, therefore, in pursuance of that 
 sentence, God himself has visited them in wrath, as a righteous Judge, 
 and has cut off both the men themselves (<I>he has destroyed them</I>) 
 and <I>the remembrance of them:</I> they and their names are buried 
 together in the dust. He has <I>made all their memory to perish;</I> 
 they are either forgotten or made mention of with detestation. Note, 
 The cause that is maintained in opposition to God and his kingdom among 
 men, though it may prosper awhile, will certainly sink at last, and all 
 that adhere to it will perish with it. The Jewish doctors, comparing 
 this with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>,

 infer that the resurrection of the dead belong to the Jews only, and
 that those of other nations shall not rise. But we know better; we know 
 that <I>all who are in their graves shall hear the voice of the Son of 
 God,</I> and that this speaks of the final destruction of Christ's 
 enemies, which is the second death.

 2. The surprising resurrection of her friends, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Though the church rejoices not in the birth of the man-child, of which
 she travailed in pain, <I>but has as it were brought forth wind</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 yet the disappointment shall be balanced in a way equivalent: <I>Thy
 dead men shall live;</I> those who were thought to be dead, who had 
 received a sentence of death within themselves, who were cast out as if 
 they had been naturally dead, shall appear again in their former 
 vigour. A spirit of life from God shall enter into the slain witnesses, 
 and they shall prophesy again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:11">Rev. xi. 11</A>.

 The <I>dry bones shall live,</I> and become an <I>exceedingly great
 army,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:10">Ezek. xxxvii. 10</A>.

 <I>Together with my dead body shall they arise.</I> If we believe the
 resurrection of the dead, of our dead bodies at the last day, as Job 
 did, and the prophet here, that will facilitate our belief of the 
 promised restoration of the church's lustre and strength in this world.
 When God's time shall have come, how low soever she may be brought, 
 they shall arise, even Jerusalem, the city of God, but now lying like a 
 dead body, a carcase to which the eagles are gathered together. God 
 owns it still for his, so does the prophet; but it shall arise, shall 
 be rebuilt, and flourish again. And therefore let the poor, desolate, 
 melancholy remains of its inhabitants, that dwell as in dust, <I>awake 
 and sing;</I> for they shall see Jerusalem, the <I>city of their 
 solemnities, a quiet habitation again,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:20"><I>ch.</I> xxxiii. 20</A>.

 The dew of God's favour shall be to it as the evening dew to the herbs
 that were parched with the heat of the sun all day, shall revive and 
 refresh them. And as the spring-dews, that water the earth, and make 
 the herbs that lay buried in it to put forth and bud, so shall they 
 flourish again, and <I>the earth shall cast out the dead,</I> as it 
 casts the herbs out of their roots. The earth, in which they seemed to 
 be lost, shall contribute to their revival. When the church and her 
 interests are to be restored neither the dew of heaven nor the fatness 
 of the earth shall be wanting to do their part towards the restoration. 
 Now this (as Ezekiel's vision, which is a comment upon it) may be fitly 
 accommodated, 

 (1.) To the spiritual resurrection of those that were dead in sin, by 
 the power of Christ's gospel and grace. So Dr. Lightfoot applies it,
 <I>Hor. Hebr. in Joh.</I> 12.24. "The Gentiles shall live; with my body
 shall they arise; that is, they shall be called in after Christ's 
 resurrection, shall rise with him, and sit with him in heavenly places; 
 nay, they shall arise my body (says he); they shall become the mystical 
 body of Christ, and shall arise as part of him."

 (2.) To the last resurrection, when dead saints shall live, and rise
 together with Christ's dead body; for he arose as the first-fruits, and 
 believers shall arise by virtue of their union with him and their 
 communion in his resurrection.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These two verses are supposed not to belong to the song which takes up 
 the rest of the chapter, but to begin a new matter, and to be rather an 
 introduction to the following chapter than the conclusion of this. Of 
 whereas, in the foregoing song, the people of God had spoken to him, 
 complaining of their grievances, here he returns an answer to their 
 complaints, in which,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He invites them into their chambers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 "<I>Come, my people,</I> come to me, come with me" (he calls them
 nowhere but where he himself will accompany them); "let the storm that 
 disperses others bring you nearer together. Come, and <I>enter into thy 
 chambers;</I> stay not abroad, lest you be caught in the storm, as the 
 Egyptians in the hail," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:21">Exod. ix. 21</A>.

 1. "Come into chambers of <I>distinction;</I> come into your own
 apartments, and continue not any longer mixed with the children of 
 Babylon. <I>Come out from among them, and be you separate,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:17,Re+18:4">2 Cor. vi. 17; Rev. xviii. 4</A>.

 If God has set apart those that are godly for himself, they ought to
 set themselves apart.

 2. "Into chambers of <I>defence,</I> in which by the secresy or the
 strength of them you may be safe in the worst of times." The attributes 
 of God are the <I>secret of his tabernacle,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:5">Ps. xxvii. 5</A>.

 His name is a strong tower, into which we may run for shelter, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:10">Prov. xviii. 10</A>.

 We must be faith find a way into these chambers, and there hide
 ourselves; that is, with a holy security and serenity of mind, we must 
 put ourselves under the divine protection. Come, as Noah into the ark, 
 for he <I>shut the doors about him.</I> When dangers are threatening it 
 is good to retire, and lie hid, as Elijah did by the brook Cherith.

 3. Into chambers of <I>devotion.</I> "Enter into thy closet, and
 <I>shut thy door,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:6">Matt. vi. 6</A>.

 Be private with God: <I>Enter into thy chamber,</I> to examine thyself,
 and commune with thy own heart, to pray, and humble thyself before 
 God." This work is to be done in times of distress and danger; and thus 
 we hide ourselves, that is, we recommend ourselves to God to hide us, 
 and he will hide us either under heaven or in heaven. Israel must keep 
 within doors when the destroying angel is slaying the first-born of 
 Egypt, else the blood on the door-posts will not secure them. So must 
 Rahab and her family when Jericho is being destroyed. Those are most
 safe that are least seen. <I>Qui bene latuit, benevixit--He has lived
 well who has sought a proper degree of concealment.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He assures them that the trouble would be over in a very short 
 time, that they should not long be in any fright or peril: "<I>Hide 
 thyself for a moment,</I> the smallest part of time we can conceive, 
 like an atom of matter; may, if you can imagine one moment shorter than 
 another, it is but for a <I>little</I> moment, and that with a 
 <I>quasi</I> too, <I>as it were for a little moment,</I> less than you 
 think of. When it is over it will seem as nothing to you; you will 
 wonder how soon it is gone. You shall not need to lie long in
 confinement, long in concealment. The indignation will presently be 
 over-past; that is, the indignation of the enemies against you, their 
 persecuting power and rage, which force you to abscond. <I>When the 
 wicked rise, a man is hid.</I> This will soon be over; God will cut 
 them off, will break their power, defeat their purposes, and find a way 
 for your enlargement." When Athanasius was banished from Alexandria by 
 an edict of Julian, and his friends greatly lamented it, he bade them 
 be of good cheer. <I>Nubecula est qu&aelig; cito pertransibit--It is a little
 cloud, that will soon blow over. You shall have tribulation ten 
 days;</I> that is all, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:10">Rev. ii. 10</A>.

 This enables God's suffering people to call their afflictions light,
 that they are but for a moment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He assures them that their enemies should be reckoned with for all 
 the mischief they had done them by the sword, either of war or 
 persecution, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 The Lord will punish them for the blood they have shed. Here is,

 1. The judgment set, and process issued out: <I>The Lord comes out of
 his place, to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their 
 iniquity,</I> in giving such disturbance to all about them. There is a 
 great deal of iniquity among the inhabitants of the earth; but though 
 they all combine in it, though hand join in hand to carry it on, yet 
 <I>it shall not go unpunished.</I> Besides the everlasting punishment 
 into which the wicked shall go hereafter, there are often remarkable 
 punishments of cruelty, oppression, and persecution, in this world. 
 When men's indignation is over-past, and they have done their worst, 
 let them then expect God's indignation, for <I>he sees that his day is 
 coming,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:13">Ps. xxxvii. 13</A>.

 God <I>comes out of his place to punish.</I> He shows himself in an
 extraordinary manner from heaven, the firmament of his power, from the 
 sanctuary, the residence of his grace. He is <I>raised up out of his 
 holy habitation,</I> where he seemed before to conceal himself; and now 
 he will do something great, the product of his wise, just, and secret 
 counsels, as a prince that goes to take the chair or take the field,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:13">Zech. ii. 13</A>.

 Some observe that God's place is the mercy-seat; there he delights to
 be; when he punishes he comes out of his place, for he has no pleasure 
 in the death of sinners.

 2. The criminals convicted by the notorious evidence of the face:
 <I>The earth shall disclose her blood;</I> the innocent blood, the 
 blood of the saints and martyrs, which has been shed upon the earth 
 like water, and has soaked into it, and been concealed and covered by 
 it, shall not be brought to light, and brought to account; for God will 
 make inquisition for it, and will give those that shed it blood to 
 drink, for they are worthy. Secret murders, and other secret 
 wickednesses, shall be discovered, sooner or later. And the slain which 
 the earth has long covered she shall no longer cover, but they shall be 
 produced as evidence against the murderers. The voice of Abel's blood 
 cries from the earth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:10,11,Job+20:27">Gen. ix. 10, 11; Job xx. 27</A>.

 Those sins which seemed to be buried in oblivion will be called to
 mind, and called over again, when the day of reckoning comes. Let God's 
 people therefore wait awhile with patience, for behold the Judge stands 
 before the door.</P>
