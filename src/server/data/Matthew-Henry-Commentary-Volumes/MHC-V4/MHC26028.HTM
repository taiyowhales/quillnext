 In this chapter we have, 

 I. A prediction of the fall and ruin of the king of Tyre, who, in the
 destruction of that city, is particularly set up as a mark for God's 
 arrows, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:1-10">ver. 1-10</A>.

 II. A lamentation for the king of Tyre, when he has thus fallen, though
 he falls by his own iniquity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:11-19">ver. 11-19</A>.

 III. A prophecy of the destruction of Zidon, which as in the
 neighbourhood of Tyre and had a dependence upon it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:20-23">ver. 20-23</A>.

 IV. A promise of the restoration of the Israel of God, though in the
 day of their calamity they were insulted over by their neighbours,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came again unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord
 G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Because thine heart <I>is</I> lifted up, and thou hast said, I
 <I>am</I> a God, I sit <I>in</I> the seat of God, in the midst of the seas;
 yet thou <I>art</I> a man, and not God, though thou set thine heart as
 the heart of God:
 &nbsp; 3  Behold, thou <I>art</I> wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that
 they can hide from thee:
 &nbsp; 4  With thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten
 thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures:
 &nbsp; 5  By thy great wisdom <I>and</I> by thy traffick hast thou increased
 thy riches, and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches:
 &nbsp; 6  Therefore thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Because thou hast set
 thine heart as the heart of God;
 &nbsp; 7  Behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon thee, the
 terrible of the nations: and they shall draw their swords against
 the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness.
 &nbsp; 8  They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die the
 deaths of <I>them that are</I> slain in the midst of the seas.
 &nbsp; 9  Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I <I>am</I> God?
 but thou <I>shalt be</I> a man, and no God, in the hand of him that
 slayeth thee.
 &nbsp; 10  Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand
 of strangers: for I have spoken <I>it,</I> saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We had done with Tyrus in the foregoing chapter, but now the prince of 
 Tyrus is to be singled out from the rest. Here is something to be said 
 to him by himself, a <I>message to him from God,</I> which the prophet 
 must send him, whether he will hear or whether he will forbear.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He must tell him of his pride. His people are proud 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:3"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 3</A>)

 and so is he; and they shall both be made to know that <I>God resists
 the proud.</I> Let us see, 

 1. What were the expressions of his pride: <I>His heart was lifted
 up,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 He had a great conceit of himself, was puffed up with an opinion of his 
 own sufficiency, and looked with disdain upon all about him. Out of the 
 abundance of the pride of his heart he said, <I>I am a god;</I> he did 
 not only say it in his heart, but had the impudence to speak it out. 
 God has said of princes, <I>They are gods</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:6">Ps. lxxxii. 6</A>);

 but it does not become them to say so of themselves; it is a high
 affront to him who is <I>God alone,</I> and will not give his glory to 
 another. He thought that the city of Tyre had as necessary a dependence 
 upon him as the world has upon the God that made it, and that he was 
 himself independent as God and unaccountable to any. He thought himself 
 to have as much wisdom and strength as God himself, and as 
 incontestable an authority, and that his prerogatives were as absolute 
 and his word as much a law as the word of God. He challenged divine 
 honours, and expected to be praised and admired as a god, and doubted 
 not to be deified, among other heroes, after his death as a great 
 benefactor to the world. Thus the king of Babylon said, <I>I will be 
 like the Most High</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:14">Isa. xiv. 14</A>),

 not like the <I>Most Holy. "I am the strong God,</I> and therefore will
 not be contradicted, because I cannot be controlled. <I>I sit in the 
 seat of God;</I> I sit <I>as high</I> as God, my throne equal with his.
 <I>Divisum imperium cum Jove C&aelig;sar habet--C&aelig;sar divides 
 dominion with Jove.</I> I sit as safely as God, as safely <I>in the 
 heart of the seas,</I> and as far out of the reach of danger, as he in 
 the <I>height of heaven.</I>" He thinks his guards of men of war about 
 his throne as pompous and potent as the hosts of angels that are about 
 the throne of God. He is put in mind of his meanness and mortality, 
 and, since he needs to be told, he shall be told, that self-evident 
 truth, <I>Thou art a man, and not God,</I> a depending creature; thou 
 art <I>flesh, and not spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+31:3">Isa. xxxi. 3</A>.

 Note, Men must be made to know that they are <I>but men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:20">Ps. ix. 20</A>.
 
 The greatest wits, the greatest potentates, the greatest saints, are
 <I>men, and not gods.</I> Jesus Christ was both God and man. The king 
 of Tyre, though he has such a mighty influence upon all about him, and 
 with the help of his riches bears a mighty sway, though he has tribute 
 and presents brought to his court with as much devotion as if they were 
 sacrifices to his altar, though he is flattered by his courtiers and 
 made a god of by his poets, yet, after all, he is <I>but a man;</I> he 
 knows it; he fears it. But <I>he sets his heart as the heart of 
 God;</I> "Thou hast conceited thyself to be a god, hast compared 
 thyself with God, thinking thyself as wise and strong, and as fit to 
 govern the world, as he." It was the ruin of our first parents, and 
 ours in them, that they would be <I>as gods,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:5">Gen. iii. 5</A>.

 And still that corrupt nature which inclines men to set up themselves
 as their own masters, to do what they will, and their own carvers, to 
 have what they will, their own end, to live to themselves, and their 
 own felicity, to enjoy themselves, <I>sets their hearts as the heart of 
 God,</I> invades his prerogatives, and catches at the flowers of his 
 crown--a presumption that cannot go unpunished.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. We are here told what it was that he was proud of. 

 (1.) His wisdom. It is probable that this prince of Tyre was a man of
 very good natural parts, a philosopher, and well read in all the parts 
 of learning that were then in vogue, at least a politician, and one 
 that had great dexterity in managing the affairs of state. And then he 
 thought himself <I>wiser than Daniel,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 We found, before, that Daniel, though now but a young man, was 
 celebrated for his prevalency in prayer,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:14"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 14</A>.

 Here we find he was famous for his prudence in the management of the
 affairs of this world, a great scholar and statesman, and withal a 
 great saint, and yet not a prince, but a poor captive. It was strange 
 that under such external disadvantages his lustre should shine forth, 
 so that he had become <I>wise to a proverb.</I> When the king of Tyre 
 dreams himself to be a god he says, I am <I>wiser than Daniel. There is 
 no secret that they can hide from thee.</I> Probably he challenged all 
 about him to <I>prove him with questions,</I> as Solomon was proved, 
 and he had unriddled all their enigmas, had solved all their problems, 
 and none of them all could puzzle him. He had perhaps been successful 
 in discovering plots, and diving into the counsels of the neighbouring 
 princes, and therefore thought himself omniscient, and that no thought 
 could be withholden from him; therefore he said, <I>I am a god.</I> 
 Note, <I>Knowledge puffeth up;</I> it is hard to know much and not to 
 know it too well and to be elevated with it. He that was <I>wiser than 
 Daniel</I> was prouder than Lucifer. Those therefore that are knowing
 must study to be humble and to evidence that they are so. 

 (2.) His wealth. That way his wisdom led him; it is not said that by 
 his wisdom he searched into the arcana either of nature or government, 
 modelled the state better than it was, or made better laws, or advanced 
 the interests of the commonwealth of learning; but his <I>wisdom and 
 understanding</I> were of use to him in <I>traffic.</I> As some of the 
 kings of Judah <I>loved husbandry</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+26:10">2 Chron. xxvi. 10</A>),

 so the king of Tyre loved merchandise, and by it he <I>got riches,
 increased his riches, and filled his treasures with gold and 
 silver,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 See what the wisdom of this world is; those are cried up as the wisest 
 men that know how to get money and by right or wrong to raise estates; 
 and yet really <I>this their way is their folly,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:13">Ps. xlix. 13</A>.

 It was the folly of the king of Tyre,

 [1.] That he attributed the increase of his wealth to himself and not 
 to the providence of God, forgetting him who <I>gave him power to get 
 wealth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:17,18">Deut. viii. 17, 18</A>.

 [2.] That he thought himself a wise man because he was a rich man; 
 whereas a fool may have an estate 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:19">Eccl. ii. 19</A>),

 yea, and a fool may get an estate, for the world has been often 
 observed to favour such, <I>when bread is not to the wise,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:11">Eccl. ix. 11</A>.

 [3.] That <I>his heart was lifted up because of his riches,</I> because 
 of the increase of his wealth, which made him so haughty and secure, so 
 insolent and imperious, and which <I>set his heart as the heart of 
 God.</I> The <I>man of sin,</I> when he had a great deal of worldly 
 pomp and power, <I>showed himself as a god,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:4">2 Thess. ii. 4</A>.

 Those who are rich in this world have therefore need to charge that
 upon themselves which the word of God charges upon them, <I>that they 
 be not high-minded,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:17">1 Tim. vi. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Since <I>pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before 
 a fall,</I> he must bell him of that destruction, of that fall, which 
 was now hastening on as the just punishment of his presumption in 
 setting up himself a rival with God. "Because thou hast pretended to
 be a god 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 therefore thou shalt not be long a man," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The instruments of his destruction: <I>I will bring strangers upon 
 thee</I>--the Chaldeans, whom we do not find mentioned among the many
 nations and countries that traded with Tyre, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:1-36"><I>ch.</I> xxvii.</A>

 If any of those nations had been brought against it, they would have
 had some compassion upon it, for old acquaintance-sake; but these 
 strangers will have none. They are people of a <I>strange language,</I> 
 which the king of Tyre himself, wise as he is, perhaps understands not. 
 They are the <I>terrible of the nations;</I> it was an army made up of 
 many nations, and it was at this time the most formidable both for 
 strength and fury. These God has at command, and these he will bring
 upon the king of Tyre.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The extremity of the destruction: <I>They shall draw their swords 
 against the beauty of thy wisdom</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 against all those things which thou gloriest in as thy beauty and the 
 production of thy wisdom. Note, It is just with God that our enemies
 should make that their prey which we have made our pride. The king of 
 Tyre's palace, his treasury, his city, his navy, his army, these he 
 glories in as his brightness, these, he thinks, made him illustrious 
 and glorious as a god on earth. But all these the victorious enemy
 shall defile, shall deface, shall deform. He thought them sacred, 
 things that none durst touch; but the conquerors shall seize them as 
 common things, and spoil the brightness of them. But, whatever becomes 
 of what he has, surely his person is sacred. No 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>They shall bring thee down to the pit,</I> to the grave; thou shalt 
 <I>die the death.</I> And, 

 (1.) It shall not be an honourable death, but an ignominious one. He 
 shall be so vilified in his death that he may despair of being deified 
 after his death. He shall die <I>the deaths of those that are slain in 
 the midst of the seas,</I> that have no honour done them at their 
 death, but their dead bodies are immediately thrown overboard, without 
 any ceremony or mark of distinction, to be a feast for the fish. Tyre 
 is <I>likely to be destroyed in the midst of the sea</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:32"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 32</A>)

 and the prince of Tyre shall fare no better than the people. 

 (2.) It shall not be a happy death, but a miserable one. He shall 
 <I>die the deaths of the uncircumcised</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 of those that are strangers to God and not in covenant with him, and 
 therefore die under his wrath and curse. It is <I>deaths,</I> a double 
 death, temporal and eternal, the death both of body and soul. He shall 
 die the <I>second death;</I> that is dying miserably indeed. The 
 sentence of death here passed upon the king of Tyre is ratified by a 
 divine authority: <I>I have spoken it, saith the Lord God.</I> And what 
 he has said he will do. None can gainsay it, nor will he unsay it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The effectual disproof that this will be of all his pretensions to 
 deity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "When the conqueror sets his sword to thy breast, and thou seest no way 
 of escape, <I>wilt thou then say, I am God?</I> Wilt thou then have 
 such a conceit of thyself as thou now hast? No; thy being overpowered 
 by death, and by the fear of it, will force thee to own that thou art 
 not a god, but a weak, timorous, trembling, dying man. <I>In the hand 
 of him that slays thee</I> (in the hand of God, and of the instruments 
 that he employed) <I>thou shalt be a man, and not God,</I> utterly
 unable to resist, and help thyself." <I>I have said, You are gods; but 
 you shall die like men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:6,7">Ps. lxxxii. 6, 7</A>.

 Note, Those who pretend to be rivals with God shall be forced one way
 or other to let fall their claims. Death at furthest, when we come into 
 his hand, will make us know that we are men.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  Moreover the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 12  Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus,
 and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Thou sealest up the
 sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.
 &nbsp; 13  Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious
 stone <I>was</I> thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond,
 the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald,
 and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and
 of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast
 created.
 &nbsp; 14  Thou <I>art</I> the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set
 thee <I>so:</I> thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast
 walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.
 &nbsp; 15  Thou <I>wast</I> perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast
 created, till iniquity was found in thee.
 &nbsp; 16  By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the
 midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I
 will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will
 destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of
 fire.
 &nbsp; 17  Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast
 corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast
 thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may
 behold thee.
 &nbsp; 18  Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine
 iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I
 bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee,
 and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all
 them that behold thee.
 &nbsp; 19  All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished
 at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never <I>shalt</I> thou <I>be</I> any
 more.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As after the prediction of the ruin of Tyre 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:1-21"><I>ch.</I> xxvi.</A>)

 followed a pathetic lamentation for it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:1-36"><I>ch.</I> xxvii.</A>),

 so after the ruin of the king of Tyre is foretold it is bewailed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. This is commonly understood of the prince who then reigned over 
 Tyre, spoken to, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 His name was <I>Ethbaal,</I> or <I>Ithobalus,</I> as Diodorus Siculus 
 calls him that was king of Tyre when Nebuchadnezzar destroyed it. He 
 was, it seems, upon all external accounts an accomplished man, very 
 great and famous; but his iniquity was his ruin. Many expositors have 
 suggested that besides the literal sense of this lamentation there is 
 an allegory in it, and that it is an allusion to the fall of the angels 
 that sinned, who undid themselves by their pride. And (as is usual in 
 texts that have a mystical meaning) some passages here refer primarily 
 to the king of Tyre, as that of his merchandises, others to the angels, 
 as that of being <I>in the holy mountain of God.</I> But, if there be 
 any thing mystical in it (as perhaps there may), I shall rather refer 
 it to the fall of Adam, which seems to be glanced at, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 <I>Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God, and that in the day thou 
 wast created.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Some think that by <I>the king of Tyre</I> is meant the whole royal 
 family, this including also the foregoing kings, and looking as far 
 back as Hiram, king of Tyre. The then governor is called <I>prince</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 but he that is here lamented is called <I>king.</I> The court of Tyre 
 with its kings had for many ages been famous; but sin ruins it. Now we
 may observe two things here:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What was the renown of the king of Tyre. He is here spoken of as 
 having lived in great splendour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:12-15"><I>v.</I> 12-15</A>.

 He as a man, but it is here owned that he was a very considerable man 
 and one that made a mighty figure in his day. 

 (1.) He far exceeded other men. Hiram and other kings of Tyre had done 
 so in their time; and the reigning king perhaps had not come short of 
 any of them: <I>Thou sealest up the sum full of wisdom and perfect in 
 beauty.</I> But the powers of human nature and the prosperity of human 
 life seemed in him to be at the highest pitch. He was looked upon to
 be as wise as the reason of men could make him, and as happy as the 
 wealth of this world and the enjoyment of it could make him; in him you 
 might see the utmost that both could do; and therefore <I>seal up the 
 sum,</I> for nothing can be added; he is a complete man, perfect <I>in 
 suo genere--in his kind.</I> 

 (2.) He seemed to be as wise and happy as Adam in innocency

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 "<I>Thou hast been in Eden,</I> even <I>in the garden of God;</I> thou 
 hast lived as it were in paradise all thy days, hast had a full 
 enjoyment of every thing that is <I>good for food</I> or <I>pleasant to 
 the eyes,</I> and an uncontroverted dominion over all about thee, as 
 Adam had." One instance of the magnificence of the king of Tyre is, 
 that he outdid all others princes in jewels, which those have the 
 greatest plenty of that trade most abroad, as he did: <I>Every precious 
 stone</I> was <I>his covering.</I> There is a great variety of precious 
 stones; but he had of every sort and in such plenty that besides what 
 were treasured up in his cabinet, and were the ornaments of his crown, 
 he had his clothes trimmed with them; they were his <I>covering.</I> 
 Nay 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 he <I>walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire,</I> that 
 is, these precious stones, which glittered and sparkled like fire. His 
 rooms were in a manner set round with jewels, so that he walked in the 
 midst of them, and then fancied himself as glorious as if, like God, he 
 had been surrounded by so many angels, who are compared to a <I>flame 
 of fire.</I> And, if he be such an admirer of precious stones as to 
 think them as bright as angels, no wonder that he is such an admirer of 
 himself as to think himself as great as God. Nine several sorts of 
 previous stones are here named, which were all in the high priest's 
 ephod. Perhaps they are particularly named because he, in his pride, 
 used to speak particularly of them, and tell those about him, with a 
 great deal of foolish pleasure, "This is such a precious stone, of such 
 a value, and so and so are its virtues." Thus is he upbraided with his 
 vanity. <I>Gold</I> is mentioned last, as far inferior in value to 
 those precious stones; and he used to speak of it accordingly. Another 
 thing that made him think his palace a paradise was the curious music 
 he had, the <I>tabrets and pipes,</I> hand-instruments and 
 wind-instruments. The <I>workmanship</I> of these was extraordinary, 
 and they were prepared for him on purpose; prepared <I>in thee,</I> the 
 pronoun is feminine--<I>in thee,</I> O Tyre! or it denotes that the 
 king was effeminate in doting on such things. They were prepared <I>in 
 the day he was created,</I> that is, either born, or created king; they 
 were made on purpose to celebrate the joys either of his birth-day or 
 of his coronation-day. These he prided himself much in, and would have 
 all that came to see his palace take notice of them.

 (3.) He looked like an incarnate angel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>Thou art the anointed cherub that covers</I> or <I>protects;</I> 
 that is, he looked upon himself as a guardian angel to his people, so 
 bright, so strong, so faithful, appointed to this office and qualified 
 for it. Anointed kings should be to their subjects as anointed 
 cherubim, that cover them with the wings of their power; and, when they 
 are such, God will own them. Their advancement was from him: <I>I have 
 set thee so.</I> Some think, because mention was made of Eden, that it 
 refers to the cherub set on the east of Eden to cover it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:24">Gen. iii. 24</A>.

 He thought himself as able to guard his city from all invaders as that
 angel was for his charge. Or it may refer to the cherubim in the most 
 holy place, whose wings covered the ark; he thought himself as bright 
 as one of them.

 (4.) He appeared in as much splendour as the high priest when he was 
 clothed with his garments for glory and beauty: "<I>Thou wast upon the 
 holy mountain of God,</I> as president of the temple built on that holy 
 mountain; thou didst look as great, and with as much majesty and 
 authority, as ever the high priest did when he walked in the temple, 
 which was <I>garnished with precious stones</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+3:6">2 Chron. iii. 6</A>),

 and had his habit on, which had precious stones both in the breast and
 on the shoulders; in that he seemed to <I>walk in the midst of the 
 stones of fire.</I>" Thus glorious is the king of Tyre; at least he 
 thinks himself so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Let us now see what was the ruin of the king of Tyre, what it was 
 that stained his glory and laid all this honour in the dust 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):
 
 "<I>Thou wast perfect in thy ways;</I> thou didst prosper in all thy 
 affairs and every thing went well with thee; thou hadst not only a 
 clear, but a bright reputation, <I>from the day thou wast created,</I> 
 the day of thy accession to the throne, <I>till iniquity was found in 
 thee;</I> and that spoiled all." This may perhaps allude to the 
 deplorable case of the angels that fell, and of our first parents, both 
 of whom <I>were perfect in their ways till iniquity was found in 
 them.</I> And when iniquity was once <I>found in him</I> it increased; 
 he grew worse and worse, as appears 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "<I>Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries;</I> thou hast lost the benefit 
 of all that which thou thoughtest sacred, and in which, as in a 
 sanctuary, thou thoughtest to take refuge; these thou hast 
 <I>defiled,</I> and so exposed thyself <I>by the multitude of thy 
 iniquities.</I>" Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What the iniquity was that was the ruin of the king of Tyre. 

 [1.] The <I>iniquity of his traffic</I> (so it is called, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 both his and his people's, for their sin is charged upon him, because 
 he connived at it and set them a bad example 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of 
 thee with violence,</I> and thus <I>thou hast sinned.</I> The king had 
 so much to do with his merchandise, and was so wholly intent upon the 
 gains of that, that he took no care to do justice, to give redress to 
 those that suffered wrong and to protect them from violence; nay, in 
 the multiplicity of business, wrong was done to many by oversight; and 
 in his dealings he made use of his power to invade the rights of those 
 he dealt with. Note, Those that have much to do in the world are in
 great danger of doing much amiss; and it is hard to deal with many 
 without violence to some. Trades are called mysteries; but too many 
 make them mysteries of iniquity.

 [2.] His pride and vain-glory 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 "<I>Thy heart was lifted up because of thy beauty;</I> thou wast in 
 love with thyself, and thy own shadow. And thus <I>thou hast corrupted 
 thy wisdom by reason of the brightness,</I> the pomp and splendour, 
 wherein thou livedst." He gazed so much upon this that it dazzled his 
 eyes and prevented him from seeing his way. He appeared so puffed up 
 with his greatness that it bereaved him both of his wisdom and of the 
 reputation of it. He really became a <I>fool in glorying.</I> Those 
 make a bad bargain for themselves that part with their wisdom for the 
 gratifying of their gaiety, and, to please a vain humour, lose a real 
 excellency.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What the ruin was that this iniquity brought him to. 

 [1.] He was thrown out of his dignity and dislodged from his palace, 
 which he took to be his paradise and temple 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God.</I> His 
 kingly power was high as a <I>mountain,</I> setting him above others; 
 it was a <I>mountain of God,</I> for the powers that be are ordained of 
 God, and have something in them that is sacred; but, having abused his 
 power, he is reckoned profane, and is therefore deposed and expelled. 
 He disgraces the crown he wears, and so has forfeited it, and shall be 
 destroyed <I>from the midst of the stones of fire,</I> the precious 
 stones with which his palace was garnished, as the temple was; and they 
 shall be no protection to him.

 [2.] He was exposed to contempt and disgrace, and trampled upon by his 
 neighbours: "<I>I will cast thee to the ground</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 will cast thee among the <I>pavement-stones,</I> from the midst of the 
 <I>precious stones,</I> and will <I>lay thee</I> a rueful spectacle 
 <I>before kings, that they may behold thee</I> and take warning by thee 
 not to be proud and oppressive."

 [3.] He was quite consumed, his city and he in it: <I>I will bring 
 forth a fire from the midst of thee.</I> The conquerors, when they have 
 plundered the city, will kindle a fire in the heart of it, which shall 
 lay it, and the palace particularly, in ashes. Or it may be taken more 
 generally for the fire of God's judgments, which shall devour both 
 prince and people, and bring all the glory of both <I>to ashes upon the 
 earth;</I> and this fire shall be <I>brought forth from the midst of 
 thee.</I> All God's judgments upon sinners take rise from themselves; 
 they are devoured by a fire of their own kindling.

 [4.] He was hereby made a terrible example of divine vengeance. Thus he 
 is reduced <I>in the sight of all those that behold him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):
 
 <I>Those that know him shall be astonished at him,</I> and shall wonder 
 how one that stood so high could be brought so low. The king of Tyre's
 palace, like the temple at Jerusalem, when it is destroyed shall be 
 <I>an astonishment and a hissing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+7:20,21">2 Chron. vii. 20, 21</A>.

 So fell the king of Tyre.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  Again the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 21  Son of man, set thy face against Zidon, and prophesy against
 it,
 &nbsp; 22  And say, Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Behold, I <I>am</I> against

 &nbsp; 25  Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; When I shall have gathered the
 house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered,
 and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then
 shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant

 &nbsp; 26  And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses,
 and plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell with confidence, when
 I have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round
 about them; and they shall know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> their God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God's glory is his great end, both in all the good and in all the evil 
 which <I>proceed out of the mouth of the Most High;</I> so we find in 
 these verses. 

 1. God will be glorified in the destruction of Zidon, a city that lay 
 near to Tyre, was more ancient, but not so considerable, had a 
 dependence upon it and stood and fell with it. God says here, <I>I am 
 against thee, O Zidon! and I will be glorified in the midst of 
 thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 And again, "Those that would not know be gentler methods shall be made 
 to <I>know that I am the Lord,</I> and I alone, and that I am a just 
 and jealous God, <I>when I shall have executed judgments in her,</I> 
 destroying judgments, when I shall have done execution according to 
 justice and according to the sentence passed, and so shall be 
 <I>sanctified in her.</I>" The Zidonians, it should seem, were more 
 addicted to idolatry than the Tyrians were, who, being men of business 
 and large conversation, were less under the power of bigotry and 
 superstition. The Zidonians were noted for the worship of Ashtaroth; 
 Solomon introduced it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:5">1 Kings xi. 5</A>.

 Jezebel was daughter to the king of Zidon, who brought the worship of
 Baal into Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+16:31">1 Kings xvi. 31</A>);

 so that God had been much dishonoured by the Zidonians. Now, says he,
 <I>I will be glorified, I will be sanctified.</I> The Zidonians were 
 borderers upon the land of Israel, where God was known, and where they 
 might have got the knowledge of him and have learned to glorify him; 
 but, instead of that, they seduced Israel to the worship of their 
 idols. Note, When God is sanctified he is glorified, for his holiness 
 is his glory; and those whom he is not sanctified and glorified by he 
 will be sanctified and glorified upon, by executing judgments upon 
 them, which declare him a just avenger of his own and his people's 
 injured honour. The judgments that shall be executed upon Zidon are war 
 and pestilence, two wasting depopulating judgments,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 They are God's messengers, which he sends on his errands, and they 
 shall accomplish that for which he sends them. <I>Pestilence</I> and 
 <I>blood</I> shall be sent <I>into her streets;</I> there the dead 
 bodies of those shall lie who perished, some by the plague, occasioned 
 perhaps through ill diet when the city was besieged, and some by the 
 sword of the enemy, most likely the Chaldean armies, when the city was 
 taken, and all were put to the sword. Thus the wounded shall be judged; 
 when they are dying of their wounds they shall judge themselves, and 
 others shall say, They justly fall. Or, as some read it, <I>They shall 
 be punished by the sword,</I> that sword which has commission to 
 destroy <I>on every side.</I> It is God that judges, and he will 
 overcome. Nor is it Tyre and Zidon only on which God would execute 
 judgments, but on all those that despised his people Israel, and 
 triumphed in their calamities; for this was now God's controversy with 
 the nations that were <I>round about them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Note, When God's people are under his correcting hand for their faults 
 he takes care, as he did concerning malefactors that were scourged, 
 <I>that they shall not seem vile</I> to those that are about them, and 
 therefore takes it ill of those who despise them and so <I>help forward 
 the affliction</I> when he is but <I>a little displeased,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:15">Zech. i. 15</A>.

 God regards them even in their low estate; and therefore let not men
 despise them.

 2. God will be glorified in the restoration of his people to their
 former safety and prosperity. God had been dishonoured by the sins of 
 his people, and their sufferings too had given occasion to the enemy to 
 blaspheme 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:5">Isa. lii. 5</A>);

 but God will now both cure them of their sins and ease them of their
 troubles, and so <I>will be sanctified in them in the sight of the 
 heathen,</I> will recover the honour of his holiness, to the 
 satisfaction of all the world,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 
 For, 

 (1.) They shall return to the possession of their own land again: <I>I 
 will gather the house of Israel</I> out of their dispersions, in answer 
 to that prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:27">Ps. cvi. 27</A>),

 <I>Save us, O Lord our God! and gather us from among the heathen;</I>
 and in pursuance of that promise

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:4">Deut. xxx. 4</A>),

 Thence will <I>the Lord thy God gather thee.</I> Being gathered, they
 shall be brought in a body, to <I>dwell in the land that I have given 
 to my servant Jacob.</I> God had an eye to the ancient grant, in 
 bringing them back, for that remained in force, and the discontinuance 
 of the possession was not a defeasance of the right. He that gave it
 will again give it.

 (2.) They shall enjoy great tranquillity there. When those that have
 been vexatious to them are taken off they shall live in quietness; 
 there shall be no more <I>a pricking brier nor a grieving thorn,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 They shall have a happy settlement, for they shall <I>build houses,</I> 
 and <I>plant vineyards;</I> and they shall enjoy a happy security and 
 serenity there; they shall <I>dwell safely,</I> shall <I>dwell with 
 confidence,</I> and there shall be none to disquiet them or make them 
 afraid, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 This never had full accomplishment in the body of that people, for 
 after their return out of captivity they were ever and anon molested by 
 some bad neighbour or other. Nor has the gospel-church been ever quite 
 free from pricking briers and grieving thorns; yet sometimes <I>the 
 church has rest,</I> and believers always dwell safely under the divine 
 protection and may be <I>quiet from the fear of evil.</I> But the full 
 accomplishment of this promise is reserved for the heavenly Canaan, 
 when all the saints shall be gathered together, and every thing that 
 offends shall be removed, and all griefs and fears for ever 
 banished.</P>
