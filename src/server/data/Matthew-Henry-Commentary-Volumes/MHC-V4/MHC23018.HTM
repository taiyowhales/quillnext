 Whatever country it is that is meant here by "the land shadowing with 
 wings," here is a woe denounced against it, for God has, upon his 
 people's account, a quarrel with it. 

 I. They threaten God's people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+18:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. All the neighbours are hereupon called to take notice what will be
 the issue, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+18:3">ver. 3</A>.

 III. Though God seem unconcerned in the distress of his people for a
 time, he will at length appear against their enemies and will
 remarkable cut them off, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+18:4-6">ver. 4-6</A>.

 IV. This shall redound very much to the glory of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+18:7">ver. 7</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which <I>is</I> beyond the
 rivers of Ethiopia:
 &nbsp; 2  That sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of
 bulrushes upon the waters, <I>saying,</I> Go, ye swift messengers, to
 a nation scattered and peeled, to a people terrible from their
 beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden down, whose
 land the rivers have spoiled!
 &nbsp; 3  All ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth,
 see ye, when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains; and when
 he bloweth a trumpet, hear ye.
 &nbsp; 4  For so the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto me, I will take my rest, and I will
 consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs, <I>and</I>
 like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.
 &nbsp; 5  For afore the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour
 grape is ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the sprigs
 with pruning hooks, and take away <I>and</I> cut down the branches.
 &nbsp; 6  They shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains,
 and to the beasts of the earth: and the fowls shall summer upon
 them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.
 &nbsp; 7  In that time shall the present be brought unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of
 hosts of a people scattered and peeled, and from a people
 terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and
 trodden under foot, whose land the rivers have spoiled, to the
 place of the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, the mount Zion.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Interpreters are very much at a loss where to find this land that lies 
 beyond the rivers of Cush. Some take it to be Egypt, a maritime 
 country, and full of rivers, and which courted Israel to depend upon 
 them, but proved broken reeds; but against this it is strongly objected 
 that the next chapter is distinguished from this by the title of <I>the 
 burden of Egypt.</I> Others take it to be Ethiopia, and read it, 
 <I>which lies near,</I> or <I>about, the rivers of Ethiopia,</I> not 
 that in Africa, which lay south of Egypt, but that which we call 
 <I>Arabia,</I> which lay east of Canaan, which Tirhakah was now king 
 of. He thought to protect the Jews, as it were, under <I>the shadow of 
 his wings,</I> by giving a powerful diversion to the king of Assyria, 
 when he made a descent upon his country, at the time that he was 
 attacking Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+19:9">2 Kings xix. 9</A>.

 But though by his ambassadors he bade defiance to the king of Assyria,
 and encouraged the Jews to depend upon him, God by the prophet slights 
 him, and will not go forth with him; he may take his own course, but 
 God will take another course to protect Jerusalem, while he suffers the 
 attempt of Tirhakah to miscarry and his Arabian army to be ruined; for 
 the Assyrian army shall become a present or sacrifice to the Lord of 
 hosts, and to the place of his name, by the hand of an angel, not by 
 the hand of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+18:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 This is a very probable exposition of this chapter. But from a hint of
 Dr. Lightfoot's, in his Harmony of the Old Testament, I incline to 
 understand this chapter as a prophecy against Assyria, and so a 
 continuation of the prophecy in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+17:12-14">last three verses</A>

 of the foregoing chapter, with which therefore this should be joined.
 That was against the army of the Assyrians which rushed in upon Judah; 
 this is against the land of Assyria itself, which lay beyond the rivers 
 of Arabia, that is, the rivers Euphrates and Tigris, which bordered on 
 <I>Arabia Deserta.</I> And in calling it <I>the land shadowing with 
 wings</I> he seems to refer to what he himself had said of it 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:8"><I>ch.</I> viii. 8</A>),

 that <I>the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy
 land, O Immanuel!</I> The prophet might perhaps describe the Assyrians 
 by such dark expressions, not naming them, for the same reason that St. 
 Paul, in his prophecy, speaks of the Roman empire by a periphrasis: 
 <I>He who now letteth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:7">2 Thess. ii. 7</A>.
 
 Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The attempt made by this land (whatever it is) upon <I>a nation 
 scattered and peeled,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+18:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Swift messengers are sent by water to proclaim war against them, as a
 nation marked by Providence, and <I>meted out,</I> to be trodden under 
 foot. Whether this refer to the Ethiopians waging war with the
 Assyrians, or the Assyrians with Judah, it teaches us, 

 1. That a people which have been terrible from their beginning, have
 made a figure and borne a mighty sway, may yet become scattered and 
 peeled, and may be spoiled even by their own rivers, that should enrich 
 both the husbandman and the merchant. Nations which have been 
 formidable, and have kept all in awe about them, may by a concurrence 
 of accidents become despicable and an easy prey to their insulting 
 neighbours. 

 2. Princes and states that are ambitious of enlarging their
 territories will always have some pretence or other to quarrel with 
 those whose countries they have a mind to. "It is a nation that has 
 been terrible, and therefore we must be revenged on it; it is now a 
 nation scattered and peeled, meted out and trodden down, and therefore 
 it will be an easy prey for us." Perhaps it was not brought so low as 
 they represented it. God's people are trampled on as a nation scattered 
 and peeled; but whoever think to swallow them up may find them still as 
 terrible as they have been from their beginning; they are cast down, 
 but not deserted, not destroyed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The alarm sounded to the nations about, by which they are summoned 
 to take notice of what God is about to do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+18:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 The Ethiopians and Assyrians have their counsels and designs, which
 they have laid deep, and promise themselves much from, and, in 
 prosecution of them, send their ambassadors and messengers from place 
 to place; but let us now enquire what the great God says to all this. 

 1. <I>He lifts up an ensign upon the mountains, and blows a 
 trumpet,</I> by which he proclaims war against the enemies of his 
 church, and calls in all her friends and well-wishers into her service,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+18:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 He gives notice that he is about to do some great work, as <I>Lord of
 hosts.</I> 

 2. All the world is bidden to take notice of it; all the dwellers on 
 earth must see the ensign and hear the trumpet, must observe the 
 motions of the divine providence and attend the directions of the 
 divine will. Let all enlist under God's banner, and be on his side, and 
 hearken to the trumpet of his word, which gives not an uncertain 
 sound.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The assurance God gives to his prophet, by him to be given to his 
 people, that, though he might seem for a time to sit by as an 
 unconcerned spectator, yet he would certainly and seasonably appear for 
 the comfort of his people and the confusion of his and their enemies 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+18:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>So the Lord said unto me.</I> Men will have their saying, but God 
 also will have his; and, as we may be sure his word shall stand, so he 
 often whispers it in the ears of his servants the prophets. When he 
 says, <I>I will take my rest,</I> it is not as if he were weary of 
 governing the world, of as if he either needed or desired to retire 
 from it and repose himself; but it intimates that the great God has a 
 perfect, undisturbed, enjoyment of himself, in the midst of all the 
 agitations and changes of this world (the Lord sits even upon the 
 floods unshaken; the Eternal Mind is always easy), and, though he may 
 sometimes seem to his people as if he took not wonted notice of what is 
 done in this lower world (they are tempted to think he is <I>as one 
 asleep,</I> or <I>as one astonished,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:23,Jer+14:9">Ps. xliv. 23; Jer. xiv. 9</A>),

 yet even then he knows very well what men are doing and what he himself
 will do.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He will take care of his people, and be a shelter to them. He will 
 regard his <I>dwelling-place;</I> his eye and his heart are, and shall 
 be, upon it for good continually. Zion is his rest for ever, where he 
 will dwell; and he will <I>look after it</I> (so some read it); he will 
 lift up the light of his countenance upon it, will consider over it 
 what is to be done, and will be sure to do all for the best. He will 
 adapt the comforts and refreshments he provides for his people to the 
 exigencies of their case; and they will <I>therefore</I> be acceptable, 
 because seasonable. 

 (1.) Like a clear heat after rain (so the margin), which is very
 reviving and pleasant, and makes the herbs to flourish.

 (2.) Like a dew and <I>a cloud in the heat of harvest,</I> which are
 very welcome, the dew to the ground and the cloud to the labourers. 
 Note, There is that in God which is a shelter and refreshment to his 
 people in all weathers and arms them against the inconveniences of 
 every change. Is the weather cool? There is that in his favour which 
 will warm them. Is it hot? There is that in his favour which will cool 
 them. Great men have their winter-house and their summer-house 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:15">Amos iii. 15</A>);

 but those that are at home with God have both in him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He will reckon with his and their enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+18:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 When the Assyrian army promises itself a plentiful harvest in the
 taking of Jerusalem and the plundering of that rich city, when the bud 
 of that project is perfect, before the harvest is gathered in, while 
 the sour grape of their enmity to Hezekiah and his people is ripening 
 in the flower and the design is just ready to be put in execution, God 
 shall destroy that army as easily as the husbandman cuts off the sprigs 
 of the vine with pruning hooks, or because the grape is sour and good 
 for nothing, and will not be cured, <I>takes away and cuts down the 
 branches.</I> This seems to point at the overthrow of the Assyrian army 
 by a destroying angel, when the dead bodies of the soldiers were 
 scattered like the branches and sprigs of a wild vine, which the 
 husbandman has cut to pieces. <I>And they shall be left to the fowls of 
 the mountains, and the beasts of the earth,</I> to prey upon, both 
 winter and summer; for as God's people are protected all seasons of the 
 year, both in cold and heat

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+18:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 so their enemies are at all seasons exposed; birds and beasts of prey
 shall both summer and winter upon them, till they are quite ruined.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The tribute of praise which should be brought to God from all this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+18:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>In that time,</I> when this shall be accomplished, <I>shall the 
 present be brought unto the Lord of hosts.</I> 

 1. Some understand this of the conversion of the Ethiopians to the
 faith of Christ in the latter days, of which we have the specimen and 
 beginning in Philip's baptizing the Ethiopian eunuch,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:27">Acts viii. 27</A>,

 &c. Those that were <I>a people scattered and peeled, meted out, and
 trodden down</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+18:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 shall be a present to the Lord: and, though they seem useless and 
 worthless, they shall be an acceptable present to him who judges of men 
 by the sincerity of their faith and love, not by the pomp and 
 prosperity of their outward condition. <I>Therefore</I> the gospel was 
 ministered to the Gentiles that <I>the offering up of the Gentiles 
 might be acceptable,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:16">Rom. xv. 16</A>.
 
 It is prophesied
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:31">Ps. lxviii. 31</A>)

 that <I>Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.</I>

 2. Others understand it of the spoil of Sennacherib's army, out of 
 which, as usual, presents were brought to <I>the Lord of hosts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+31:50">Num. xxxi. 50</A>.
 
 It was the present of a people scattered and peeled.

 (1.) It was won from the Assyrians, who were now themselves reduced to 
 such a condition as they scornfully described Judah to be in,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+18:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Those that unjustly trample upon others shall themselves be justly
 trampled upon. 

 (2.) It was offered by the people of God, who were, in disdain, called 
 <I>a people scattered and peeled.</I> God will put honour upon his 
 people, though men put contempt upon them. <I>Lastly,</I> Observe, The
 present that is brought to the Lord of hosts must be brought <I>to the 
 place of the name of the Lord of hosts;</I> what is offered to God must 
 be offered in the way that he has appointed; we must be sure to attend 
 him, and expect him to meet us, where he records his name.</P>
