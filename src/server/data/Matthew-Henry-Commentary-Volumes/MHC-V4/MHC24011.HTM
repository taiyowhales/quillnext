 In this chapter,

 I. God by the prophet puts the people in mind of the covenant he had
 made with their fathers, and how much he had insisted upon it, as the
 condition of the covenant, that they should be obedient to him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 II. He charges it upon them that they, in succession to their fathers,
 and in confederacy among themselves, had obstinately refused to obey 
 him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:8-10">ver. 8-10</A>.

 III. He threatens to punish them with utter ruin for their
 disobedience, especially for their idolatry 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:11,13">ver. 11, 13</A>),

 and tells them that their idols should not save them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:12">ver. 12</A>),

 that their prophets should not pray for them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:14">ver. 14</A>);

 he also justifies his proceedings herein, they having brought all this
 mischief upon themselves by their own folly and wilfulness, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:15-17">ver. 15-17</A>.

 IV. Here is an account of a conspiracy formed against Jeremiah by his 
 fellow-citizens, the men of Anathoth; God's discovery of it to him 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:18,19">ver. 18, 19</A>),

 his prayer against them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:20">ver. 20</A>),

 and a prediction of God's judgments upon them for it, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:21-23">ver. 21-23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The word that came to Jeremiah from the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of
 Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
 &nbsp; 3  And say thou unto them, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel;
 Cursed <I>be</I> the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant,
 &nbsp; 4  Which I commanded your fathers in the day <I>that</I> I brought
 them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace,
 saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I
 command you: so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God:
 &nbsp; 5  That I may perform the oath which I have sworn unto your
 fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as <I>it
 is</I> this day. Then answered I, and said, So be it, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 6  Then the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the
 cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye
 the words of this covenant, and do them.
 &nbsp; 7  For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day <I>that</I>
 I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, <I>even</I> unto this day,
 rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.
 &nbsp; 8  Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every
 one in the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will
 bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded
 <I>them</I> to do; but they did <I>them</I> not.
 &nbsp; 9  And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the
 men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 10  They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers,
 which refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to
 serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have
 broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet here, as prosecutor in God's name, draws up an indictment 
 against the Jews for wilful disobedience to the commands of their 
 rightful Sovereign. For the more solemn management of this charge,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He produces the commission he had to draw up the charge against 
 them. He did not take pleasure in accusing the children of his people, 
 but God commanded him to <I>speak it to the men of Judah,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 In the original it is plural: <I>Speak you this.</I> For what he said 
 to Jeremiah was the same that he gave in charge to all his servants the 
 prophets. They none of them said any other than what Moses, in the law, 
 had said; to that therefore they must refer themselves, and direct the 
 people: "<I>Hear the words of this covenant;</I> turn to your Bibles, 
 be judged by them." Jeremiah must now proclaim this in the cities <I>of 
 Judah and the streets of Jerusalem,</I> that all may hear, for all are 
 concerned. All the words of reproof and conviction which the prophets 
 spoke were grounded upon the <I>words of the covenant,</I> and agreed 
 with that; and therefore "<I>hear these words,</I> and understand by 
 them upon what terms you stood with God at first; and then, by 
 comparing yourselves with the covenant, you will soon be aware upon 
 what terms you now stand with him."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He opens the charter upon which their state was founded and by 
 which they held their privileges. They had forgotten the tenour of it, 
 and lived as if they thought that the grant was absolute and that they 
 might do what they pleased and yet have what God had promised, or as if 
 they thought that the keeping up of the ceremonial observances was all 
 that God required of them. He therefore shows them, with all possible 
 plainness, that the thing God insisted upon was <I>obedience,</I> which 
 was <I>better than sacrifice.</I> He said, <I>Obey my voice,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>
 
 and again 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 "Own God for your Master; give up yourselves to him as his subjects and 
 servants; attend to all the declarations of his mind and will, and make 
 conscience of complying with them. <I>Do my commandments,</I> not only
 in some things, but <I>according to all which I command you;</I> make 
 conscience of moral duties especially, and rest not in those that are 
 merely ritual; hear the words of the covenant, and do them." 

 1. This was the original contract between God and them, when he first
 formed them into a people. It was what he <I>commanded their 
 fathers</I> when he first <I>brought them forth out of the land of
 Egypt,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:4,7"><I>v.</I> 4 and <I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 He never intended to take them under his guidance and protection upon 
 any other terms. This was what he required from them in gratitude for 
 the great things he did for them when he brought them <I>from the iron 
 furnace.</I> He redeemed them out of the service of the Egyptians, 
 which was perfect slavery, that he might take them into his own 
 service, which is perfect freedom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:74,75">Luke i. 74, 75</A>.

 2. This was not only laid before them then, but it was with the 
 greatest importunity imaginable pressed upon them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 God not only commanded it, but <I>earnestly protested it to their 
 fathers,</I> when he brought them into covenant with himself. Moses 
 inculcated it again and again, by precept upon precept and line upon 
 line. 

 3. This was made the condition of the relation between and God, which
 was so much their honour and privilege: "<I>So shall you be my people 
 and I will be your God;</I> I will own you for mine, and you may call 
 upon me as yours;" this intimates that, if they refused to obey, they 
 could no longer claim the benefit of the relation. 

 4. It was upon these terms that the land of Canaan was given them for a
 possession: <I>Obey my voice, that I may perform the oath sworn to your 
 fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 God was ready to fulfil the promise, but then they must fulfil the 
 condition; if not, the promise is void, and it is just with God to turn 
 them out of possession. Being brought in upon their good behaviour, 
 they had no wrong done them if they were turned out upon their ill 
 behaviour. Obedience was the rent reserved by the lease, with a power
 to re-enter for non-payment. 

 5. This obedience was not only made a condition of the blessing, but 
 was required under the penalty of a curse. This is mentioned first here

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 that they might, if possible, be awakened by the terrors of the Lord: 
 <I>Cursed be the man,</I> though it were but a single person, <I>that 
 obeys not the words of this covenant,</I> much more when it is the body 
 of the nation that rebels. There are curses of the covenant as well as 
 blessings: and Moses set before them not only <I>life and good,</I> but 
 <I>death and evil</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:15">Deut. xxx. 15</A>),

 so that they had fair warning given them of the fatal consequences of
 disobedience.

 6. Lest this covenant should be forgotten, and, because out of mind, 
 should be thought out of date, God had from time to time called to them 
 to remember it, and by his servants the prophets had made a continual 
 claim of this rent, so that they could not plead, in excuse of their 
 non-payment, that it had never been demanded; <I>from the day when he 
 brought them out of Egypt to this day</I> (and that was nearly 1000 
 years) he had been, in one way or other, <I>at sundry times and in 
 divers manners,</I> protesting to them the necessity of obedience. God 
 keeps an account how long we have enjoyed the means of grace and how 
 powerful those means have been, how often we have been not only spoken 
 to, but protested to, concerning our duty. 

 7. This covenant was consented to

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Then answered I, and said, So be it, O Lord!</I> These are the words 
 of the prophet, expressing either, 

 (1.) His own consent to the covenant for himself, and his desire to 
 have the benefit of it. God promised Canaan to the obedient: "Lord," 
 says he, "I take thee at thy word, I will be obedient; let me have my 
 inheritance in the land of promise, of which Canaan is a type." Or, 
 
 (2.) His good will, and good wish, that his people might have the 
 benefit of it. "<I>Amen;</I> Lord, let them still be kept in
 possession of this good land, and not turned out of it; make good the 
 promise to them." Or, 

 (3.) His people's consent to the covenant: "<I>Then answered I,</I> in 
 the name of the people, <I>So be it.</I>" Taking it in this sense, it 
 refers to the declared consent which the people gave to the covenant, 
 not only to the precepts of it when they said, <I>All that the Lord 
 shall say unto us we will do and will be obedient,</I> but to the 
 penalties when they said <I>Amen</I> to all the curses upon Mount Ebal.
 The more solemnly we have engaged ourselves to God the more reason we 
 have to hope that the engagement will be perpetual; and yet here it did 
 not prove so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He charges them with breach of covenant, such a breach as amounted 
 to a forfeiture of their charter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 God had said again and again, by his law and by his prophets, "<I>Obey 
 my voice,</I> do as you are bidden, and all shall be well;" <I>yet they 
 obeyed not;</I> and, because they were resolved not to submit their 
 souls to God's commandments, they would not so much as incline their 
 ears to them, but got as far as they could out of call: <I>They walked 
 every one in the imagination of their evil heart,</I> followed their 
 own inventions; every man did as his fancy and humour led him, right or 
 wrong, lawful or unlawful, both in their devotions and in their 
 conversations; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:24"><I>ch.</I> vii. 24</A>.

 What then could they expect, but to fall under the curse of the
 covenant, since they would not comply with the commands and conditions 
 of it? <I>Therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this 
 covenant,</I> that is, all the threatenings contained in it, because 
 <I>they did not what they were commanded.</I> Note, The words of the 
 covenant shall not fall to the ground. If we do not by our obedience 
 qualify ourselves for the blessings of it, we shall by our disobedience 
 bring ourselves under the curses of it. That which aggravated their 
 defection from God, and rebellion against him, was that it was general, 
 and as it were <I>by consent,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 Jeremiah himself saw that many lived in open disobedience to God, but 
 the Lord told him that the matter was worse than he thought of: <I>A 
 conspiracy is found among them,</I> by him whose eye is upon the hidden 
 works of darkness. There is a combination against God and religion, a 
 dangerous design formed to overthrow God's government and bring in the 
 pretenders, the counterfeit deities. This intimates that they were 
 wilful and deliberate in wickedness (they rebelled against God, not 
 through incogitancy, but presumptuously, and with a high hand),--that 
 they were subtle and ingenious in wickedness, and carried on their plot 
 against religion with a great deal of art and contrivance,--that they 
 were linked together in the design, and, as is usual among 
 conspirators, engaged to stand by one another in it and to live and die 
 together; they were resolved to go through with it. A cursed 
 conspiracy! O that there were not the like in our day! Observe, 

 1. What the conspiracy was. They designed to overthrow divine
 revelation, and set that aside, and persuade people not to hear, not to 
 heed, the words of God. They did all they could to derogate from the 
 authority of the scriptures and to lessen the value of them; they 
 designed to draw people <I>after other gods to serve them,</I> to 
 consult them as their oracles and make court to them as their 
 benefactors. Human reason shall be their god, a light within their god, 
 an infallible judge their god, saints and angels their gods, the god of 
 this or the other nation shall be theirs; thus, under several 
 disguises, they are in the same confederacy <I>against the Lord and 
 against his anointed.</I> 

 2. Who were in conspiracy. One would have expected find some foreigners 
 ring-leaders in it; but no,

 (1.) <I>The inhabitants of Jerusalem</I> are in conspiracy with <I>the 
 men of Judah;</I> city and country agree in this, however they may 
 differ in other things. 

 (2.) Those of this generation seem to be in conspiracy with those of 
 the foregoing generation, to carry on the war from age to age against 
 religion: <I>They are turned back to the iniquities of their 
 forefathers,</I> and have risen up in their stead, <I>a seed of 
 evil-doers,</I> and <I>increase of sinful men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:14">Num. xxxii. 14</A>.

 In Josiah's time there had been a reformation, but after this death the
 people returned to the idolatries which then they had renounced.

 (3.) Judah and Israel, the kingdom of the ten tribes and that of the 
 two, that were often at daggers--drawing one with another, were yet 
 <I>in a conspiracy to break the covenant God had made with their 
 fathers,</I> even with the heads of all the twelve tribes. The house of 
 Israel began the revolt, but the house of Judah soon came into the 
 conspiracy. Now what else could be expected but that god should take 
 severe methods, both for the chastising of the conspirators and the 
 crushing of this conspiracy; for none ever hardened his heart thus 
 against God and prospered? He that rolls this stone will find it return 
 upon him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  Therefore thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Behold, I will bring evil
 upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though
 they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.
 &nbsp; 12  Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem
 go, and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense: but they
 shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.
 &nbsp; 13  For <I>according to</I> the number of thy cities were thy gods, O
 Judah; and <I>according to</I> the number of the streets of Jerusalem
 have ye set up altars to <I>that</I> shameful thing, <I>even</I> altars to
 burn incense unto Baal.
 &nbsp; 14  Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a
 cry or prayer for them: for I will not hear <I>them</I> in the time
 that they cry unto me for their trouble.
 &nbsp; 15  What hath my beloved to do in mine house, <I>seeing</I> she hath
 wrought lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from
 thee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.
 &nbsp; 16  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, <I>and</I> of
 goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled
 fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.
 &nbsp; 17  For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced
 evil against thee, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the
 house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to
 provoke me to anger in offering incense unto Baal.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This paragraph, which contains so much of God's wrath, might very well 
 be expected to follow upon that which goes next before, which contained 
 so much of his people's sin. When God found so much evil among them we 
 cannot think it strange if it follows, <I>Therefore I will bring evil 
 upon them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 the evil of punishment for the evil of sin; and there is no remedy, no 
 relief: the decree has gone forth and the sentence will be 
 executed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They cannot help themselves, but will be found too weak to contest 
 with God's judgments: it is <I>evil which they shall not be able to 
 escape,</I> or to <I>go forth out of,</I> by any evasion whatsoever. 
 Note, Those that will not submit to God's government shall not be able 
 to escape his wrath. There is no fleeing from his justice, no avoiding 
 his cognizance. Evil pursues sinners and entangles them in snares out 
 of which they cannot extricate themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Their God will not help them; his providence shall no way favour 
 them: <I>Though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken to them.</I> 
 In their affliction they will seek the God whom before they slighted, 
 and cry to him whom before they would not vouchsafe to speak to. But 
 how can they expect to speed? For he has plainly told us that he that 
 <I>turns away his ears from hearing the law,</I> as they did, for they 
 <I>inclined not their ear</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 even his prayer shall be an abomination to him, as the word of the Lord 
 was now to them a reproach.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Their idols shall not help them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 They shall <I>go, and cry to the gods to whom they</I> now <I>offer 
 incense,</I> and put them in mind of the costly services wherewith they 
 had honoured them, expecting they should now have relief from them, but 
 in vain. They shall be sent to the <I>gods whom they served</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:14,De+32:37,38">Judg. x. 14; Deut. xxxii. 37, 38</A>),

 and what the better? <I>They shall not save them at all,</I> shall do
 nothing towards their salvation, nor give them any prospect of it; they 
 shall not afford them the least comfort, nor relief, nor mitigation of 
 their trouble. It is God only that is a friend at need, <I>a 
 present</I> powerful <I>help in time of trouble.</I> The idols cannot 
 help themselves; how then should they help their worshippers? Those
 that make idols of the world and the flesh will in vain have recourse 
 to them in a day of distress. If the idols could have done any real 
 kindness to their worshippers, they would have done it for this people, 
 who had renounced the true God to embrace them, had multiplied them 
 <I>according to the number of their cities</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 nay, in Jerusalem, <I>according to the number of their streets.</I> 
 Suspecting both their sufficiency and their readiness to help them, 
 they must have many, lest a few would not serve; they must have them 
 dispersed in every corner, lest they should be out of the way when they 
 had occasion for them. In <I>Jerusalem,</I> the city which God had 
 chosen to put his name there, publicly in the streets of Jerusalem, in 
 every street, they had <I>altars to that shameful thing,</I> that 
 <I>shame,</I> even to Baal, which they ought to have been ashamed of, 
 with which they did reproach the Lord and bring confusion upon 
 themselves. But now in their distress their many gods, and many altars, 
 should stand them in stead. Note, Those that will not be ashamed of
 their commission of sin as a wicked thing will be ashamed of their 
 expectations from sin as a fruitless thing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Jeremiah's prayers shall not help them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 What God had said to him before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:16"><I>ch.</I> vii. 16</A>)

 he here says again, <I>Pray not thou for this people.</I> This is not
 designed for a command to the prophet, so much as for a threatening to 
 the people, that they should have no benefit by the prayers of their 
 friends for them. God would give no encouragement to the prophets to 
 pray for them, would not stir up the spirit of prayer, but cast a damp 
 upon it, would put it into their hearts to pray, not for the body of 
 the people, but for the remnant among them, to pray for their eternal 
 salvation, not for their deliverance from the temporal judgments that 
 were coming upon them; and what other prayers were put up for them 
 should not be heard. Those are in a sad case indeed that are cut off 
 from the benefit of prayer. "<I>I will not hear them when they cry,</I> 
 and therefore to not thou pray for them." Note, Those that have so far 
 thrown themselves out of God's favour that he will not hear their 
 prayers cannot expect benefit by the prayers of others for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The profession they make of religion shall stand them in no stead, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 They were originally God's <I>beloved,</I> his spouse, he was married 
 to them by the covenant of peculiarity; even the unbelieving Jews are 
 said to be <I>beloved for the fathers' sake,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:28">Rom. xi. 28</A>.

 As such they had a place <I>in God's house;</I> they were admitted to
 worship in the courts of his temple; they partook of God's altar; they 
 ate of the flesh of their peace-offerings here called the <I>holy 
 flesh,</I> which God had the honour of and they had the comfort of.
 This they gloried in, and trusted to. What harm could come to those who 
 were God's beloved, who were under the protection of his house? Even 
 when they <I>did evil</I> yet <I>they rejoiced</I> and gloried in this, 
 made a mighty noise of this. And <I>when their evil was</I> (so the 
 margin reads it), when trouble came upon them, <I>they rejoiced in 
 this,</I> and made this their confidence; but their confidence would 
 deceive them, for God has rejected it, they themselves having forfeited 
 the privileges they so much boasted of. They have <I>wrought lewdness 
 with many,</I> have been guilty of spiritual whoredom, have worshipped 
 many idols; and therefore,

 1. God's temple will <I>yield them no protection;</I> it is fit that
 the adulteress, especially when she has so often repeated her whoredoms 
 and has grown so impudent in them and irreclaimable, should be <I>put 
 away,</I> and turned out of doors: "<I>What has my beloved to do in my 
 house?</I> She is a scandal to it, and therefore it shall no longer be 
 a shelter to her." 

 2. God's altar will yield them no satisfaction, nor can they expect any 
 comfort from that: "<I>The holy flesh has passed from thee,</I> that 
 is, an end will soon be put to thy sacrifices, when the temple shall be 
 laid in ruins; and where then will the holy flesh be, that thou art so 
 proud of?" A holy heart will be a comfort to us when the holy flesh has 
 passed from us; an inward principle of grace will make up the want of 
 the outward means of grace. But woe unto us if the departure of the
 holy flesh be accompanied with the departure of the Holy Spirit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. God's former favours to them shall stand them in no stead, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 Their remembrance of them shall be no comfort to them under their 
 troubles, and God's remembrance of them shall be no argument for their 
 relief. 

 1. It is true God had done great things for them; that people had been
 favourites above any people under the sun; they had been the darlings 
 of heaven. God had <I>called Israel's name a green olive-tree,</I> and 
 had made them so, for he miscalls nothing; he had <I>planted</I> them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 had formed them into a people, with all the advantages they could have 
 to make them a fruitful and flourishing people, so good was their law 
 and so good was their land. One would think no other than that a people 
 so planted, so watered, so cultivated, should be, as the olive-tree is, 
 ever green, in respect both of piety and prosperity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+52:8">Ps. lii. 8</A>.

 God called them <I>fair and of goodly fruit,</I> both good for food and
 pleasant to the eye, both amiable and serviceable to God and man, for 
 which the greenness and fatness of the olive both are honoured,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:9">Judg. ix. 9</A>.

 2. It is as true that they have done evil things against God. He had 
 planted them a green olive, a good olive, but they had degenerated into 
 a <I>wild olive,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:17">Rom. xi. 17</A>.

 Both <I>the house of Israel.</I> and the <I>house of Judah</I> had
 <I>done evil,</I> had <I>provoked God to anger in burning incense unto 
 Baal,</I> setting up other mediators between them and the supreme God 
 besides the promised Messiah; nay, setting up other gods in competition 
 with the true and living God, for they had <I>gods many,</I> as well as 
 <I>lords many.</I>

 3. When they have conducted themselves so ill they can expect no other
 than that, notwithstanding what good he has done to them and designed 
 for them, he should now bring upon them the evil he has <I>pronounced 
 against them.</I> He that planted this green olive-tree, and expected 
 fruit from it, finding it barren and grown wild, <I>has kindled fire 
 upon it,</I> to burn it as it stands; for, being without fruit, it is 
 <I>twice dead, plucked up by the roots</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:12">Jude 12</A>),

 it is <I>cut down and cast into the fire,</I> the fittest place for
 trees that cumber the ground, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:10">Matt. iii. 10</A>.

 The <I>branches of it,</I> the <I>high and lofty boughs</I> (so the
 word signifies), are <I>broken</I> are <I>broken down,</I> both princes 
 and priests cut off. And thus it proves that the evil done against God, 
 to <I>provoke him to anger,</I> is really done <I>against 
 themselves;</I> they <I>wrong their own souls;</I> God is out of their 
 reach, but they ruin themselves. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:19"><I>ch.</I> vii. 19</A>.

 Note, Every sin against God is a sin against ourselves, and so it will
 be found sooner or later.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath given me knowledge <I>of it,</I> and I know
 <I>it:</I> then thou showedst me their doings.
 &nbsp; 19  But I <I>was</I> like a lamb <I>or</I> an ox <I>that</I> is brought to the
 slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against
 me, <I>saying,</I> Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet Jeremiah has much in his writings concerning himself, much 
 more than Isaiah had, the times he lived in being very troublesome. 
 Here we have (as it should seem) the beginning of his sorrows, which 
 arose from the people of his own city, Anathoth, a priest's city, and 
 yet a malignant one. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Their plot against him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 They <I>devised devices against him,</I> laid their heads together to 
 contrive how they might be in the most plausible and effectual manner 
 the death of him. Malice is ingenious in its devices, as well as 
 industrious in its prosecutions. They said concerning Jeremiah, <I>Let
 us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof</I>--a proverbial 
 expression, meaning, "Let us utterly destroy him root and branch. Let 
 us destroy both the father and the family" (as, when Naboth was put to 
 death for treason, his sons were put to death with him), or rather 
 "both the prophet and the prophecy; let us kill the one and defeat the 
 other. <I>Let us cut him off from the land of the living,</I> as a 
 false prophet, and load him with ignominy and disgrace, <I>that his 
 name may be no more remembered</I> with respect. Let us sink his 
 reputation, and so spoil the credit of his predictions." This was their 
 plot; and 

 1. It was a cruel one; but so cruel have the persecutors of God's
 prophets been. They <I>hunt for</I> no less than <I>the precious
 life,</I> and very precious the lives are that they hunt for. But,

 (2.) It was a baffled one. They thought to put an end to his days, but 
 he survived most of his enemies; they thought to blast his memory, but 
 it lives to this day, and will be blessed while time lasts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The information which God gave him of this conspiracy against him. 
 He knew nothing of it himself, so artfully had they concealed it; he 
 came to Anathoth, meaning no harm to them and therefore fearing no harm 
 from them, <I>like a lamb or an ox,</I> that thinks he is driven as 
 usual to the field, <I>when he is brought to the slaughter;</I> so 
 little did poor Jeremiah dream of the design his citizens that hated 
 him had upon him. None of his friends could, and none of his enemies 
 would, give him any notice of his danger, that he might shift for his 
 own safety, as Paul's sister's son gave him intelligence of the Jews
 that were lying in wait for him. There is but a step between Jeremiah 
 and death; but then <I>the Lord gave him knowledge of it,</I> by dream 
 or vision, or impression upon his spirit, that he might save himself, 
 as the king of Israel did upon the notice Elisha gave him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+6:10">2 Kings vi. 10</A>.
 
 Thus he came to <I>know it.</I> God <I>showed him their doings;</I> and
 such were their devices that the discovering of them was the defeating 
 of them. If God had not let him know his own danger, it would have been 
 improved by unreasonable men against the reputation of his predictions, 
 that he who foretold the ruin of his country could not foresee his own 
 peril and avoid it. See what care God takes of his prophets: He 
 <I>suffers no man to do them wrong;</I> all the rage of their enemies 
 cannot prevail to take them off till they have finished their 
 testimony. God knows all the secret designs of his and his people's 
 enemies, and can, when he pleases, make them know. <I>A bird of the air 
 shall carry the voice.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His appeal to God hereupon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 His eye is to God as <I>the Lord of hosts, that judges righteously.</I> 
 It is a matter of comfort to us, when men deal unjustly with us, that 
 we have a God to go to who does and will plead the cause of injured 
 innocency and appear against the injurious. God's justice, which is a 
 terror to the wicked, is a comfort to the godly. His eye is towards him 
 as the God that <I>tries the reins and the heart,</I> that perfectly 
 sees what is in man, what are his thoughts and intents. He knew the 
 integrity that was in Jeremiah's heart, and that he was not the man 
 they represented him to be. He knew the wickedness that was in their 
 hearts, though ever so cunningly concealed and disguised. Now, 

 1. Jeremiah prays judgment against them: "<I>Let me see thy vengeance
 on them,</I> that is, do justice between me and them in such a way as 
 thou pleasest." Some think there was something of human frailty in this 
 prayer; at least Christ has taught us another lesson, both by precept 
 and by pattern, which is to pray for our persecutors. Others think it 
 comes from a pure zeal for the glory of God and a pious and prophetic 
 indignation against men that were by profession priests, the Lord's 
 ministers, and yet were so desperately wicked as to fly out against one 
 that did them no harm, merely for the service he did to God. This 
 petition was a prediction that he should see God's vengeance on them.

 2. He refers his cause entirely to the judgment of God: "<I>Unto thee 
 have I revealed my cause;</I> to thee I have committed it, not desiring 
 nor expecting to interest any other in it." Note, It is our comfort, 
 when we are wronged, that we have a God to commit our cause to, and our 
 duty to commit it to him, with a resolution to acquiesce in his 
 definitive sentence, to subscribe, and not prescribe, to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Judgment given against his persecutors, <I>the men of Anathoth.</I> 
 It was to no purpose for him to appeal to the courts at Jerusalem, he 
 could not have justice done him there: the priests there would stand by 
 the priests at Anathoth, and rather second them than discountenance 
 them; but God will <I>therefore</I> take cognizance of the cause 
 himself, and we are sure that <I>his judgment is according to 
 truth.</I> Here is, 

 1. Their crime recited, on which the sentence is grounded,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 They sought the prophet's life, for they forbad him to prophesy upon 
 pain of death; they were resolved either to silence him or to slay him. 
 The provocation he gave them was his prophesying <I>in the name of the 
 Lord</I> without license from those that were the governors of the city 
 which he was a member of, and not prophesying such smooth things as 
 they always bespoke. Their forbidding him to prophesy was in effect 
 seeking his life, for it was seeking to defeat the end and business of 
 his life and to rob him of the comfort of it. It is as bad to God's
 faithful ministers to have their mouth stopped as to have their breath 
 stopped. But especially when it was resolved that if he did prophesy, 
 as certainly he would notwithstanding their inhibition, he should 
 <I>die by their hand;</I> they would be accusers, judges, executioners, 
 and all. It used to be said that <I>a prophet could not perish but at 
 Jerusalem,</I> for there the great council sat; but so bitter were the 
 men of Anathoth against Jeremiah that they would undertake to be the 
 death of him themselves. A prophet then shall find not only no honour, 
 but no favour, in his own country. 

 2. The sentence passed upon them for this crime,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>.

 God says, <I>I will punish them;</I> let me alone to deal with them.
 <I>I will visit</I> this <I>upon them;</I> so the word is. God will 
 enquire into it and reckon for it. Two of God's four sore judgments 
 shall serve to ruin their town:--<I>The sword</I> shall devour their 
 <I>young men,</I> though they were young priests, not men of war (their 
 character shall not be their protection), and <I>famine</I> shall 
 destroy the children, <I>sons and daughters,</I> that tarry at home, 
 which is a more grievous death than that by the sword, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:9">Lam. iv. 9</A>.

 The destruction shall be final

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>There shall be no remnant of them left,</I> none to be the seed of 
 another generation. They sought Jeremiah's life, and therefore they 
 shall die; they would destroy him <I>root and branch,</I> that <I>his 
 name</I> might be <I>no more remembered,</I> and therefore <I>there 
 shall be no remnant of them;</I> and herein the Lord is righteous. Thus 
 <I>evil is brought upon them, even the year of their visitation,</I> 
 and that is evil enough, a recompence according to their deserts. Then 
 shall Jeremiah <I>see his desire upon his enemies.</I> Note, Their 
 condition is sad who have the prayers of good ministers and good people 
 against them.</P>
