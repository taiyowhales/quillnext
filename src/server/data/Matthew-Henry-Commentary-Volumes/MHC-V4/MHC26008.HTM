 God, having given the prophet a clear foresight of the people's 
 miseries that were hastening on, here gives him a clear insight into 
 the people's wickedness, by which God was provoked to bring these 
 miseries upon them, that he might justify God in all his judgments, 
 might the more particularly reprove the sins of the people, and with 
 the more satisfaction foretel their ruin. Here God, in vision, brings 
 him to Jerusalem, to show him the sins that were committed there, 
 though God had begun to contend with them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>),

 and there he sees,

 I. The image of jealousy set up at the gate of the altar,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:5,6">ver. 5, 6</A>.

 II. The elders of Israel worshipping all manner of images in a secret
 chamber, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:7-12">ver. 7-12</A>.
 
 III. The women weeping for Tammuz, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:13,14">ver. 13, 14</A>.

 IV. The men worshipping the sun,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:15,16">ver. 15, 16</A>.

 And then appeals to him whether such a provoking people should have any 
 pity shown them,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth <I>month,</I>
 in the fifth <I>day</I> of the month, <I>as</I> I sat in mine house, and
 the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>
 fell there upon me.
 &nbsp; 2  Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire:
 from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from
 his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the
 colour of amber.
 &nbsp; 3  And he put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock
 of mine head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and
 the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to
 the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where
 <I>was</I> the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to
 jealousy.
 &nbsp; 4  And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel <I>was</I> there,
 according to the vision that I saw in the plain.
 &nbsp; 5  Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the
 way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the
 north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image
 of jealousy in the entry.
 &nbsp; 6  He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they
 do? <I>even</I> the great abominations that the house of Israel
 committeth here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but
 turn thee yet again, <I>and</I> thou shalt see greater abominations.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Ezekiel was now in Babylon; but the messages of wrath he had delivered 
 in the foregoing chapters related to Jerusalem, for in the peace or 
 trouble thereof the captives looked upon themselves to have peace or 
 trouble, and therefore here he has a vision of what was done at 
 Jerusalem, and this vision is continued to the close of the 11th 
 chapter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is the date of this vision. The first vision he had was in 
 <I>the fifth year of the captivity, in the fourth month</I> and <I>the 
 fifth day of the month,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:1,2"><I>ch.</I> i. 1, 2</A>.

 This was just fourteen months after. Perhaps it was after he had lain
 390 days on his left side, to bear the iniquity of Israel, and before 
 he began the forty days on his right side, to bear the iniquity of 
 Judah; for now he was sitting in the house, not lying. Note, God keeps 
 a particular account of the messages he sends to us, because he will 
 shortly call us to account about them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The opportunity is taken notice of, as well as the time. 

 1. The prophet was himself <I>sitting in his house,</I> in a sedate
 composed frame, deep perhaps in contemplation. Note, The more we 
 retreat from the world, and retire into our own hearts, the better 
 frame we are in for communion with God: those that sit down to consider 
 what they have learned shall be taught more. Or, he <I>sat in his 
 house,</I> ready to preach to the company that resorted to him, but 
 waiting for instructions what to say. God will communicate more
 knowledge to those who are communicative of what they do know. 

 2. <I>The elders of Judah,</I> that were now in captivity with him,
 <I>sat before him.</I> It is probable that it was on the sabbath day, 
 and that it was usual for them to attend on the prophet every sabbath 
 day, both to hear the word from him and to join with him and prayer and 
 praise: and how could they spend the sabbath better, now that they had 
 neither temple nor synagogue, neither priest nor altar? It was a great 
 mercy that they had opportunity to spend it so well, as the good people 
 in Elisha's time,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+4:23">2 Kings iv. 23</A>.

 But some think it was on some extraordinary occasion that they attended
 him, to enquire of the Lord, and <I>sat down</I> at his feet to <I>hear 
 his word.</I> Observe here, 

 (1.) When the <I>law had perished from the priests</I> at Jerusalem, 
 whose <I>lips should keep knowledge</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:26"><I>ch.</I> vii. 26</A>),

 those in Babylon had a prophet to consult. God is not tied to places
 or persons. 

 (2.) Now that the elders of Judah were in captivity they paid more 
 respect to God's prophets, and his word in their mouth, than they did 
 when they lived in peace in their own land. When God brings men into 
 the <I>cords of affliction,</I> then he <I>opens their ears to 
 discipline,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:8,10,Ps+141:6">Job xxxvi. 8, 10; Ps. cxli. 6</A>.

 Those that despised vision in the <I>valley of vision</I> prized it now
 that the word of the Lord precious and there was <I>no open vision.</I>

 (3.) When our teachers are driven into corners, and are forced to 
 preach in private houses, we must diligently attend them there. A 
 minister's house should be a church for all his neighbours. Paul 
 preached in his own hired house at Rome, and God owned him there, and 
 <I>no man forbad him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The divine influence and impression that the prophet was now 
 under: <I>The hand of the Lord fell there upon me.</I> God's hand took 
 hold of him, and arrested him, as it were, to employ him in this 
 vision, but at the same time supported him to bear it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The vision that the prophet saw, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 He <I>beheld a likeness,</I> of a man we may suppose, for that was the 
 likeness he saw before, but it was all <I>brightness</I> above the 
 girdle and all <I>fire</I> below, fire and flame. This agrees with the 
 description we had before of the apparition he saw,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:27"><I>ch.</I> i. 27</A>.

 It is probably that it was the same person, the man Christ Jesus. It is
 probable that the elders that <I>sat with him</I> (as the men that
 journeyed with Paul) saw a light and were afraid, and this happy sight
 they gained by attending the prophet in a private meeting, but they had
 no distinct view of him that spoke to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:9">Acts xxii. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The prophet's remove, in vision, to Jerusalem. The apparition he saw 
 <I>put forth the form of a hand,</I> which <I>took him by a lock of his 
 head,</I> and the Spirit was that hand which was put forth, for the 
 Spirit of God is called <I>the finger of God.</I> Or, The spirit within 
 him <I>lifted him up,</I> so that he was borne up and carried on by an 
 internal principle, not an external violence. A faithful ready servant 
 of God will be drawn by a hair, by the least intimation of the divine 
 will, to his duty; for he has that within him which inclines him to a 
 compliance with it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:8">Ps. xxvii. 8</A>.

 He was miraculously <I>lifted up between heaven and earth,</I> as if he
 were to fly away upon eagles' wings. This, it is probable (so Grotius
 thinks), the elders that sat with him saw; they were witnesses of 
 <I>the hand taking him by the lock</I> of hair, and <I>lifting him 
 up,</I> and then perhaps laying him down again in a trance of ecstasy, 
 while he had the following visions, <I>whether in the body or out of 
 the body,</I> we may suppose, he <I>could not tell,</I> any more than 
 Paul in a like case, much less can we. Note, Those are best prepared 
 for communion with God and the communications of divine light that by 
 divine grace are raised up above the earth and the things of it, to be 
 out of their attractive force. But, being lifted up towards heaven, he 
 was carried in vision to Jerusalem, and to God's sanctuary there; for 
 those that would go to heaven must take that in their way. The Spirit 
 represented to his mind the city and temple as plainly as if he had 
 been there in person. O that by faith we could thus enter into the 
 Jerusalem, the holy city, above, and see the things that are 
 invisible!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The discoveries that were made to him there.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. There he saw the glory of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Behold, the glory of the god of Israel was there,</I> the same 
 appearance of the living creatures, and the wheels, and the throne, 
 that he had seen,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:1-28"><I>ch.</I> i.</A>

 Note, God's servants, wherever they are and whithersoever they go, 
 ought to carry about with them a believing regard to the glory of God 
 and to set that always before them; and those that have seen God's 
 power and glory in the sanctuary should desire to see them again, so as 
 they have seen them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:2">Ps. lxiii. 2</A>.

 Ezekiel has this repeated vision of the glory of God both to give
 credit to and to put honour upon the following discoveries. But it 
 seems to have a further intention here; it was to aggravate this sin of 
 Israel, in changing their own God, the God of Israel (who is a God of 
 so much glory as here he appears to be), for dunghill gods, scandalous 
 gods, false gods, and indeed no gods. Note, The more glorious we see
 God to be the more odious we shall see sin to be, especially idolatry, 
 which turns his truth in to a lie, his glory into shame. It was also to 
 aggravate their approaching misery, when this glory of the Lord should 
 remove from them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:23"><I>ch.</I> xi. 23</A>)

 and leave the house and city desolate.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. There he saw the reproach of Israel--and that was <I>the image of
 jealousy,</I> set <I>northward, at the gate of the altar,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:3,5"><I>v.</I> 3, 5</A>.
 
 What image this was is uncertain, probably an image of Baal, or of the 
 grove, which Manasseh made and set in the temple 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:7,2Ch+33:3">2 Kings xxi. 7, 2 Chron. xxxiii. 3</A>),

 which Josiah removed, but his successors, it seems, replace there, as
 probably they did the <I>chariots of the sun</I> which he found <I>at 
 the entering in of the house of the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:11">2 Kings xxiii. 11</A>),
 
 and this is here said to be <I>in the entry.</I> But the prophet,
 instead of telling us what image it was, which might gratify our 
 curiosity, tells us that it was <I>the image of jealousy,</I> to 
 convince our consciences that, whatever image it was, it was in the 
 highest degree offensive to God and <I>provoked him to jealousy.</I> he 
 resented it as a husband would resent the whoredoms of his wife, and 
 would certainly revenge it; for <I>God is jealous, and the Lord 
 revenges,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+1:2">Nah. i. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The very setting up of this image <I>in the house of the Lord</I> 
 was enough to <I>provoke him to jealousy;</I> for it is in the matters 
 of his worship that we are particularly told, <I>I the Lord thy God am 
 a jealous God.</I> Those that placed this image at <I>the door of the 
 inner gate,</I> where the people assembled, called <I>the gate of the 
 altar</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 thereby plainly intended, 

 [1.] To affront God, to provoke him to his face, by advancing an idol 
 to be a rival with him for the adoration of his people, in contempt of 
 his law and in defiance of his justice. 

 [2.] To debauch the people, and pick them up as they were entering into
 the courts of the Lord's house to bring their offerings to him, and to 
 tempt them to offer them to this image; like the adulteress Solomon 
 describes, that <I>sits at the door of her house, to call passengers 
 who go right on their ways, Whoso is simple, let him turn in 
 hither,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+9:14-16">Prov. ix. 14-16</A>.

 With good reason therefore is this called <I>the image of 
 jealousy.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) We may well imagine what a surprise and what a grief it was to 
 Ezekiel to see this image in the house of God, when he was in hopes 
 that the judgments they were under had, by this time, wrought some 
 reformation among them; but there is more wickedness in the world, in 
 the church, than good men think there is. And now, 

 [1.] God appeals to him whether this was not bad enough, and a
 sufficient ground for God to go upon in casting off this people and 
 abandoning them to ruin. Could he, or any one else, expect any other 
 than <I>that God should go far from his sanctuary,</I> when there were 
 such abominations committed there, in that very place; nay, was he not 
 perfectly driven thence? They did these things designedly, and on
 purpose that he should leave his sanctuary, and so shall their doom be; 
 they have hereby, in effect, like the Gadarenes, desired him <I>to 
 depart out of their coasts,</I> and therefore he will depart; he will 
 no more dignify and protect his sanctuary, as he has done, but will 
 give it up to reproach and ruin. But,

 [2.] Though this is bad enough, and serves abundantly to justify God in
 all that he brings upon them, yet the matter will appear to be much 
 worse: <I>But turn thyself yet again,</I> and thou wilt be amazed to 
 <I>see greater abominations than these.</I> Where there is one 
 abomination it will be found that there are many more. Sins do not go 
 alone.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I
 looked, behold a hole in the wall.
 &nbsp; 8  Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and
 when I had digged in the wall, behold a door.
 &nbsp; 9  And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked
 abominations that they do here.
 &nbsp; 10  So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping
 things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of
 Israel, portrayed upon the wall round about.
 &nbsp; 11  And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of
 the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the
 son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a
 thick cloud of incense went up.
 &nbsp; 12  Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the
 ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the
 chambers of his imagery? for they say, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> seeth us not; the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath forsaken the earth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a further discovery of the abominations that were 
 committed at Jerusalem, and within the confines of the temple, too. Now 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How this discovery is made. God, in vision, brought Ezekiel to the 
 <I>door of the court,</I> the outer court, along the sides of which the 
 priests' lodgings were. God could have introduced him at first into 
 <I>the chambers of imagery,</I> but he brings him to them by degrees, 
 partly to employ his own industry in searching out these mysteries of 
 iniquity, and partly to make him sensible with what care and caution 
 those idolaters concealed their idolatries. Before the priests' 
 apartments they had run up a wall, to make them the more private, that 
 they might not lie open to the observation of those who passed by--a 
 shrewd sign that they did something which they had reason to be ashamed 
 of. <I>He that doth evil hates the light.</I> They were not willing 
 that those who saw them in God's house should see them in their own, 
 lest they should see them contradict themselves and undo in private 
 what they did in public. But, <I>behold, a hole in the wall,</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 a spy-hole, by which you might see that which would give cause to 
 suspect them. When hypocrites screen themselves behind the wall of an 
 external profession, and with it think to conceal their wickedness from 
 the eye of the world and carry on their designs the more successfully, 
 it is hard for them to manage it with so much art by that there is some 
 hole or other left in the wall, something that betrays them, to those 
 who look diligently, not to be what they pretend to be. The ass's ears
 in the fable appeared from under the lion's skin. This <I>hole in the 
 wall</I> Ezekiel made wider, and <I>behold a door,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 This door he goes in by into <I>the treasury,</I> or some of the 
 apartments of the priests, and sees <I>the wicked abominations that 
 they do there,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Note, Those that would discover the mystery of iniquity in others, or 
 in themselves, must accomplish a diligent search; for Satan has his 
 wiles, and depths, and devices, which we should not be ignorant of, and 
 <I>the heart is deceitful above all things;</I> in the examining of it 
 therefore we are concerned to be very strict.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What the discovery is. It is a very melancholy one. 

 1. He sees a chamber set round with idolatrous pictures

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>All the idols of the house of Israel,</I> which they had borrowed 
 from the neighbouring nations, were <I>portrayed upon the wall round 
 about,</I> even the vilest of them, <I>the forms of creeping 
 things,</I> which they worshipped, and <I>beasts,</I> even 
 <I>abominable ones,</I> which are poisonous and venomous; at least they 
 were abominable when they were worshipped. This was a sort of 
 pantheon, a collection of all the idols together which they paid their 
 devotions to. Though the second commandment, in the letter of it, 
 forbids only graven images, yet painted ones are as bad and as 
 dangerous. 
 
 2. He sees this chamber filled with idolatrous worshippers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 There were <I>seventy men of the elders of Israel</I> offering incense 
 to these painted idols. Here was a great number of idolaters
 strengthening one another's hands in this wickedness; though it was in 
 a private chamber, and the meeting industriously concealed, yet here 
 were seventy men engaged in it. I doubt these elders were many more 
 than those in Babylon that sat before the prophet in his house, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 
 They were <I>seventy men,</I> the number of the great Sanhedrim, or 
 chief council of the nation, and, we have reason to fear, the same men; 
 for they were <I>the ancients of the house of Israel,</I> not only in 
 age, but in office, who were bound, by the duty of their place, to 
 restrain and punish idolatry and to destroy and abolish all 
 superstitious images wherever they found them; yet these were those 
 that did themselves worship them in private, so undermining that 
 religion which in public they professed to own and promote only because 
 by it they held their preferments. They had <I>every man his censer in
 his hand;</I> so fond were they of the idolatrous service that they 
 would all be their own priests, and very prodigal they were of their 
 perfumes in honour of these images, for <I>a thick cloud of incense 
 went up,</I> that filled the room. O that the zeal of these idolaters 
 might shame the worshippers of the true God out of their indifference 
 to his service! The prophet took particular notice of one whom he knew, 
 who <I>stood in the midst of</I> these idolaters, as chief among them, 
 being perhaps president of the great council at this time or most 
 forward in this wickedness. No wonder the people were corrupt when the 
 elders were so. The sins of leaders are leading sins.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What the remark is that made upon it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 "<I>Son of man, hast thou seen this?</I> Couldst thou have imagined 
 that there was such wickedness committed?" It is here observed 
 concerning it, 

 1. That it was done <I>in the dark;</I> for sinful works are <I>works
 of darkness.</I> They concealed it, lest they should lose their places, 
 or at least their credit. There is a great deal of secret wickedness in 
 the world, which the day will declare, <I>the day of the revelation of 
 the righteous judgment of God.</I> 

 2. That this one idolatrous chapel was but a specimen of many the like. 
 Here they met together, to worship their images in concert, but, it 
 should seem, they had <I>every man the chamber of his imagery</I> 
 besides, a room in his own house for this purpose, in which every man 
 gratified his own fancy with such pictures as he liked best. Idolaters 
 had their household gods, and their family worship of them in private, 
 which is a shame to those who call themselves Christians and yet have 
 no church in their house, no worship of God in their family. Had they 
 <I>chambers of imagery,</I> and shall not we have chambers of devotion? 

 3. That atheism was at the bottom of their idolatry. They worship
 images <I>in the dark,</I> the images of the gods of other nations, and 
 <I>they say,</I> "Jehovah, the God of Israel, whom we should serve, 
 <I>seeth us not.</I> Jehovah <I>hath forsaken the earth,</I> and we may 
 worship what God we will; he regards us not."

 (1.) They think themselves out of God's sight: <I>They say, The Lord 
 seeth us not.</I> They imagined, because the matter was carried on so 
 closely that men could not discover it, nor did any of their neighbours 
 suspect them to be idolaters, that therefore it was hidden from the eye 
 of God; as if there were any <I>darkness, or shadow of death, where the 
 workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</I> Note, A practical 
 disbelief of God's omniscience is at the bottom of our treacherous 
 departures from him; but the church argues justly, as to this very sin 
 of idolatry 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:20,21">Ps. xliv. 20, 21</A>),

 <I>If we have forgotten the name of our God, and stretched forth our
 hand to a strange god, will not God search this out?</I> No doubt he 
 will.

 (2.) They think themselves out of God's care: "<I>The Lord has forsaken 
 the earth,</I> and looks not after the affairs of it; and then we may 
 as well worship any other god as him." Or, "He has forsaken our land, 
 and left it to be a prey to its enemies; and therefore it is time for 
 us to look out for some other god, to whom to commit the protection of 
 it. Our one God cannot, or will not, deliver us; and therefore let us 
 have many." This was a blasphemous reflection upon God, as if he had 
 forsaken them first, else they would not have forsaken him. Note, Those 
 are ripe indeed for ruin who have arrived at such a pitch of impudence 
 as to lay the blame of their sins upon God himself.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, <I>and</I> thou shalt
 see greater abominations that they do.
 &nbsp; 14  Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s
 house which <I>was</I> toward the north; and, behold, there sat women
 weeping for Tammuz.
 &nbsp; 15  Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen <I>this,</I> O son of man?
 turn thee yet again, <I>and</I> thou shalt see greater abominations
 than these.
 &nbsp; 16  And he brought me into the inner court of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s house,
 and, behold, at the door of the temple of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, between the
 porch and the altar, <I>were</I> about five and twenty men, with their
 backs toward the temple of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and their faces toward the
 east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east.
 &nbsp; 17  Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen <I>this,</I> O son of man?
 Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the
 abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the
 land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger:
 and, lo, they put the branch to their nose.
 &nbsp; 18  Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not
 spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears
 with a loud voice, <I>yet</I> will I not hear them.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. More and greater abominations discovered to the prophet. He thought 
 that what he had seen was bad enough and yet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Turn thyself again, and thou shalt see yet greater abominations,</I> 
 and greater still, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>,
 
 as before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 There are those who live in retirement who do no think what wickedness 
 there is in this world; and the more we converse with it, and the 
 further we go abroad into it, the more corrupt we see it. When we have 
 seen that which is bad we may have our wonder at it made to cease by 
 the discovery of that which, upon some account or other, is a great 
 deal worse. We shall find it so in examining our own hearts and 
 searching into them; there is a world of iniquity in them, a great 
 abundance and variety of abominations, and, when we have found out much 
 amiss, still we shall find more; for <I>the heart is desperately 
 wicked, who can know it</I> perfectly? Now the abominations here 
 discovered were, 
 
 1. <I>Women weeping for Tammuz,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 An abominable thing indeed, that any should choose rather to serve an 
 idol in tears than to serve the true God <I>with joyfulness and 
 gladness of heart!</I> Yet such absurdities as these are those guilty 
 of who <I>follow after lying vanities</I> and <I>forsake their own 
 mercies.</I> Some think it was for Adonis, an idol among the Greeks, 
 other for Osiris, an idol of the Egyptians, that they shed these tears.
 The image, they say, was made to weep, and then the worshippers wept 
 with it. They bewailed the death of this Tammuz, and anon rejoiced in 
 its returning to life again. These mourning women <I>sat at the door of 
 the gate of the Lord's house,</I> and there shed their idolatrous 
 tears, as it were in defiance of God and the sacred rites of his 
 worship, and some think, with their idolatry, prostrating themselves 
 also to corporeal whoredom; for these two commonly went together, and 
 those that dishonoured the divine nature by the one were justly 
 <I>given up to vile affections</I> and a reprobate sense to dishonour 
 the human nature, which nowhere ever sunk so far below itself as in 
 these idolatrous rites. 
 
 2. <I>Men worshipping the sun,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 And this was so much the greater an abomination that it was practised 
 <I>in the inner court of the Lord's house at the door of the temple of 
 the lord, between the porch and the altar.</I> There, where the most 
 sacred rites of their holy religion used to be performed, was this 
 abominable wickedness committed. Justly might God in jealousy say to 
 those who thus affronted him at his own door, as the king to Haman, 
 <I>Will he force the queen also before me in the house?</I> Here 
 <I>were about twenty-five men</I> giving that honour to the sun which 
 is due to God only. Some think they were the king and his princes; it 
 should rather seem that they were priests, for this was the court of 
 the priests, and the proper place to find them in. Those that were 
 entrusted with the true religion, had it committed to their care and 
 were charged with the custody of it, they were the men that betrayed 
 it. 

 (1.) They turned <I>their backs towards the temple of the Lord,</I> 
 resolvedly forgetting it and designedly slighting it and putting 
 contempt upon it. Note, When men turn their backs upon God's
 institutions, and despise them, it is no marvel if they wander 
 endlessly after their own inventions. Impiety is the beginning of 
 idolatry and all iniquity. 

 (2.) They turned <I>their faces towards the east, and worshipped the 
 sun,</I> the rising sun. This was an ancient instance of idolatry; it 
 is mentioned in Job's time

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:26">Job xxxi. 26</A>),

 and had been generally practised among the nations, some worshipping
 the sun under one name, others under another. These priests, finding it 
 had antiquity and general consent and usage on its side (the two pleas 
 which the papists use at this day in defence of their superstitious 
 rites, and particularly this of worshipping towards the east), 
 practised it in the court of the temple, thinking it an omission that 
 it was not inserted in their ritual. See the folly of idolaters in 
 worshipping that as a god, and calling it <I>Baal--a lord,</I> which 
 God made to be a servant to the universe (for such the sun is, and so 
 his name <I>Shemesh</I> signified,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:19">Deut. iv. 19</A>),

 and in adoring the borrowed light and despising the <I>Father of
 lights.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The inference drawn from these discoveries 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 "<I>Hast thou seen this, O son of man!</I> and couldst thou have 
 thought ever to see such things done in the temple of the Lord?" Now, 

 1. He appeals to the prophet himself concerning the heinousness of the
 crime. Can he think it <I>is a light thing to the house of Judah,</I> 
 who know and profess better things, and are dignified with so many 
 privileges above other nations? Is it an excusable thing in those that 
 have God's oracles and ordinances <I>that they commit the abominations 
 which they commit here?</I> Do not those deserve to suffer that thus 
 sin? Should not such abominations as these <I>make desolate?</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:27">Dan. ix. 27</A>.

 2. He aggravates it from the fraud and oppression that were to be found
 in all parts of the nations: <I>They have filled the land with 
 violence.</I> It is not strange if those that wrong God thus make no 
 conscience of wronging one another, and with all that is sacred trample 
 likewise upon all that is just. And their wickedness in their 
 conversations made even the worship they paid to their own God an 
 abomination

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:11">Isa. i. 11</A>,

 &c.): "<I>They fill the land with violence,</I> and then they return to
 the temple <I>to provoke me to anger</I> there; for even their 
 sacrifices, instead of making an atonement, do but add to their guilt. 
 They <I>return to provoke me</I> (they repeat the provocation, do it, 
 and do it again), <I>and, lo, they put the branch to their nose</I>" 
 --a proverbial expression denoting perhaps their scoffing at God and 
 having him in derision; they snuffed at his service, as men do when 
 they <I>put a branch to their nose.</I> Or it was some custom used by 
 idolaters in honour of the idols they served. We read of garlands used 
 in their idolatrous worships 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:13">Acts xiv. 13</A>),

 out of which every zealot took a branch which they smelled to as a
 nosegay. Dr. Lightfoot (<I>Hor. Heb. in John</I> 15.6) gives another 
 sense of this place: <I>They put the branch to their wrath,</I> or 
 <I>to his wrath,</I> as the Masorites read it; that is, they are still 
 bringing more fuel (such as the withered branches of the vine) to the 
 fire of divine wrath, which they have already kindled, as if that wrath 
 did not burn hot enough already. Or putting the branch to the nose may 
 signify the giving of a very great affront and provocation either to 
 God or man; they are an abusive generation of men.

 3. He passes sentence upon them that they shall be utterly cut off:
 <I>Therefore,</I> because they are thus furiously bent upon sin, <I>I 
 will also deal in fury</I> with them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 <I>They filled the land with their violence,</I> and God will fill it 
 with the violence of their enemies; and he will not lend a favourable 
 ear to the suggestions either, 

 (1.) Of his own pity: <I>My eye shall not spare, neither will I have 
 pity;</I> repentance shall be hidden from his eyes; or, 

 (2.) Of their prayers: <I>Though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, 
 yet will I not hear them;</I> for still their sins cry more loudly for 
 vengeance than their prayers cry for mercy. God will now be as deaf to
 their prayers as their own idols were, on whom they cried aloud, but in 
 vain,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:26">1 Kings xviii. 26</A>.

 Time was when God was ready to hear even <I>before they cried</I> and
 to <I>answer while they were yet speaking;</I> but now <I>they shall 
 seek me early and not find me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:28">Prov. i. 28</A>.

 It is not the loud voice, but the upright heart, that God will 
 regard.</P>
