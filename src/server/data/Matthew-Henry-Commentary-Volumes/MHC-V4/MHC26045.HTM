 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter is further represented to the prophet, in vision, 

 I. The division of the holy land, so much for the temple, and the
 priests that attended the service of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>),

 so much for the Levites

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:5">ver. 5</A>),

 so much for the city

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:6">ver. 6</A>),

 so much for the prince, and the residue to the people,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:7,8">ver. 7, 8</A>.

 II. The ordinances of justice that were given both to prince and
 people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:9-12">ver. 9-12</A>.

 III. The oblations they were to offer, and the prince's part in those 
 oblations, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:13-17">ver. 13-17</A>.

 Particularly in the beginning of the year 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:18-20">ver. 18-20</A>)

 and in the passover, and the feast of tabernacles,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:21-25">ver. 21-25</A>.

 And all this seems to point at the new church-state that should be set 
 up under the gospel, which, both for extent and for purity, should far 
 exceed that of the Old Testament.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for
 inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, a holy
 portion of the land: the length <I>shall be</I> the length of five and
 twenty thousand <I>reeds,</I> and the breadth <I>shall be</I> ten thousand.
 This <I>shall be</I> holy in all the borders thereof round about.
 &nbsp; 2  Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred <I>in
 length,</I> with five hundred <I>in breadth,</I> square round about; and
 fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof.
 &nbsp; 3  And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and
 twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall
 be the sanctuary <I>and</I> the most holy <I>place.</I>
 &nbsp; 4  The holy <I>portion</I> of the land shall be for the priests the
 ministers of the sanctuary, which shall come near to minister
 unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and it shall be a place for their houses, and an
 holy place for the sanctuary.
 &nbsp; 5  And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten
 thousand of breadth, shall also the Levites, the ministers of the
 house, have for themselves, for a possession for twenty chambers.
 &nbsp; 6  And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand
 broad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against the
 oblation of the holy <I>portion:</I> it shall be for the whole house
 of Israel.
 &nbsp; 7  And a <I>portion shall be</I> for the prince on the one side and
 on the other side of the oblation of the holy <I>portion,</I> and of
 the possession of the city, before the oblation of the holy
 <I>portion,</I> and before the possession of the city, from the west
 side westward, and from the east side eastward: and the length
 <I>shall be</I> over against one of the portions, from the west border
 unto the east border.
 &nbsp; 8  In the land shall be his possession in Israel: and my princes
 shall no more oppress my people; and <I>the rest of</I> the land shall
 they give to the house of Israel according to their tribes.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Directions are here given for the dividing of the land after their 
 return to it; and, God having warranted them to do it, would be an act 
 of faith, and not of folly, thus to divide it before they had it. And 
 it would be welcome news to the captives to hear that they should not 
 only return to their own land, but that, whereas they were now but few 
 in number, they should <I>increase and multiply,</I> so as to 
 <I>replenish</I> it. But this never had its accomplishment in the 
 Jewish state after the return out of captivity, but was to be fulfilled 
 in the model of the Christian church, which was perfectly new (as this 
 division of the land was quite different from that in Joshua's time)
 and much enlarged by the accession of the Gentiles to it; and it will 
 be perfected in the heavenly kingdom, of which the land of Canaan had 
 always been a type. Now, 

 1. Here is the portion of land assigned to <I>the sanctuary,</I> in the
 midst of which the temple was to be built, with all its courts and 
 purlieus; the rest round about it was for the priests. This is called

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)

 <I>an oblation to the Lord;</I> for what is given in works of piety, 
 for the maintenance and support of the worship of God and the 
 advancement of religion, God accepts as given to him, if it be done 
 with a single eye. It is a <I>holy portion of the land,</I> which is to 
 be set out first, as the <I>first-fruits</I> that sanctify the lump. 
 The appropriating of lands for the support of religion and the ministry 
 is an act of piety that bids as fair for perpetuity, and the benefit of 
 posterity, as any. This <I>holy portion of the land</I> was to be 
 measured, and the borders of it fixed, that the sanctuary itself might 
 not have more than its share and in time engross the whole land. So far 
 the lands of the church shall extend and no further; as in our own 
 kingdom donations to the church were of old limited by the <I>statute 
 of mortmain.</I> The lands here allotted to the sanctuary were 25,000 
 <I>reeds</I> (so our translation makes it, though some make them only 
 <I>cubits</I>) in length, and 10,000 in breadth-about eighty miles one 
 way and thirty miles another way (say some); twenty-five miles one way 
 and ten miles the other way, so others. The priests and Levites that 
 were to come near to minister were to have their dwellings in this 
 <I>portion of the land</I> that was round about the sanctuary, that 
 they might be near their work; whereas by the distribution of land in 
 Joshua's time the cities of the priests and Levites were dispersed all 
 the nation over. This intimates that gospel ministers should reside
 upon their charge; where their service lies there must they live. 

 2. Next to the lands of the sanctuary the city-lands are assigned, in
 which the holy city was to be built, and with the issues and profits of 
 which the citizens were to be maintained

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>It shall be for the whole house of Israel,</I> not appropriated, as 
 before, to one tribe or two, but some of all the tribes shall dwell in 
 the city, as we find they did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+11:1,2">Neh. xi. 1, 2</A>.

 The portion for the city was fully as long, but only half as broad, as 
 that for the sanctuary; for the city was enriched by trade and 
 therefore had the less need of lands. 

 3. The next allotment after the church-lands and the city-lands is of
 the crown-lands,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 Here is no admeasurement of these, but they are said to lie <I>on the 
 one side and on the other side</I> of the church-lands and city-lands, 
 to intimate that the prince with his wealth and power was to be a 
 protection to both. Some make the prince's share equal to the church's 
 and city's share both together; others make it to be a thirteenth part 
 of the rest of the land, the other twelve parts being for the twelve 
 tribes. The prince that attends continually to the administration of 
 public affairs must have wherewithal to support his dignity, and have 
 abundance, that he may not be in temptation to oppress the people, 
 which yet with many does not prevent that; but the grace of God shall 
 prevent it, for it is promised here, <I>My princes shall no more 
 oppress my people;</I> for God will make the <I>officers peace</I> and 
 the <I>exactors righteousness.</I> Notwithstanding this, we find that 
 after the return of the Jews to their own land the princes were 
 complained of for their exactions. But Nehemiah was one that did not do 
 as the <I>former governors,</I> and yet kept a handsome court, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:15,18">Neh. v. 15, 18</A>.

 But so much is said of the prince in this mystical holy state, to
 intimate that in the gospel-church magistrates should be as <I>nursing 
 fathers</I> to it and Christian princes its patrons and protectors; and 
 the holy religion they profess, as far as they are subject to the power 
 of it, will restrain them from oppressing God's people, because they 
 are more his people than theirs.

 4. The rest of the lands were to be distributed to the people 
 <I>according to their tribes,</I> who had reason to think themselves 
 well settled, when they had both the <I>testimony of Israel</I> and the 
 <I>throne of judgment</I> so near them.</P>

 Israel: remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and
 justice, take away your exactions from my people, saith the Lord
 G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 10  Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just
 bath.
 &nbsp; 11  The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the
 bath may contain the tenth part of a homer, and the ephah the
 tenth part of a homer: the measure thereof shall be after the
 homer.
 &nbsp; 12  And the shekel <I>shall be</I> twenty gerahs: twenty shekels,
 five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here some general rules of justice laid down both for prince 
 and people, the rules of distributive and commutative justice; for 
 godliness without honesty is but a form of godliness, will neither 
 please God nor avail to the benefit of any people. Be it therefore 
 enacted, by the authority of the church's King and God, 

 1. That <I>princes do not oppress their subjects,</I> but duly and
 faithfully administer justice among them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel!</I> that you have been 
 oppressive to the people and have enriched yourselves by spoil and 
 violence, that you have so long fleeced the flock instead of feeding 
 them, and henceforward do so no more." Note, Even princes and great men 
 that have long done amiss must at length think it time, high time, to 
 reform and amend; for no prescription will justify a wrong. Instead of 
 saying that they have been long accustomed to oppress, and therefore 
 may persist in it, for the custom will bear them out, they should say 
 that they have been long accustomed to it and therefore, as here, 
 <I>Let the time pass suffice,</I> and let them now remove <I>violence 
 and spoil;</I> let them drop wrongful demands, cancel wrongful usages, 
 and turn out those from employments under them that do violence. Let
 them <I>take away their exactions,</I> ease their subjects of those 
 taxes which they find lie heavily upon them, and let them <I>execute 
 judgment and justice</I> according to the law, as the duty of their 
 place requires. Note, All princes, but especially the princes of 
 Israel, are concerned to do justice; for of their people God says, They 
 are my people, and they in a special manner <I>rule for God.</I> 

 2. That one neighbour do not cheat another in commerce

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>You shall have just balances,</I> in which to weigh both money and 
 goods, a <I>just ephah</I> for dry measure of corn and flour, a <I>just 
 bath</I> for the measure of liquids, wine, and oil; and the 
 <I>ephah</I> and <I>bath</I> shall be <I>one measure,</I> the tenth 
 part of a <I>chomer,</I> or <I>cor,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 So that the ephah and bath contained (as the learned Dr. Cumberland
 has computed) seven wine gallons and four pints, and something more. An 
 omer was but the tenth part of an ephah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:36">Exod. xvi. 36</A>)

 and the one hundredth part of a <I>chomer,</I> or <I>homer,</I> and
 contained about six pints. The <I>shekel</I> is here settled

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 it is twenty <I>jerahs,</I> just half a <I>Roman</I> ounce, in our 
 money 2<I>s.</I> 4 1/4<I>d.</I> and almost the eighth part of a 
 farthing, as the aforesaid learned man exactly computes it. By the 
 shekels the <I>maneh,</I> or pound, was reckoned, which, when it was 
 set for a mere weight (says bishop Cumberland), without respect to 
 coinage, contained just 100 shekels, as appears by comparing 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:17">1 Kings x. 17</A>,

 where it is said three <I>manehs,</I> or <I>pounds, of gold, went to
 one shield,</I> with the parallel place, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+9:16">2 Chron. ix. 16</A>,

 where it is said 300 <I>shekels of gold went to one shield.</I> But
 when the <I>maneh</I> is set for a sum of money or coin it contains but 
 sixty shekels, as appears here, where twenty shekels, twenty-five 
 shekels, and fifteen shekels, which in all make sixty, shall be the 
 <I>maneh.</I> But it is thus reckoned because they had one piece of 
 money that weighed twenty shekels, another twenty-five, another 
 fifteen, all of which made up one pound, as a learned writer here 
 observes. Note, It concerns God's Israel to be very honest and just in 
 all their dealings, very punctual and exact in rendering to all their 
 due, and very cautious to do wrong to none, because otherwise they 
 spoil the acceptableness of their profession with God and the 
 reputation of it before men.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  This <I>is</I> the oblation that ye shall offer; the sixth part
 of an ephah of a homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth
 part of an ephah of a homer of barley:
 &nbsp; 14  Concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil, <I>ye shall
 offer</I> the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, <I>which is</I> an
 homer of ten baths; for ten baths <I>are</I> a homer:
 &nbsp; 15  And one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of
 the fat pastures of Israel; for a meat offering, and for a burnt
 offering, and for peace offerings, to make reconciliation for
 them, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 16  All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the
 prince in Israel.
 &nbsp; 17  And it shall be the prince's part <I>to give</I> burnt offerings,
 and meat offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in
 the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the
 house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the meat
 offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to
 make reconciliation for the house of Israel.
 &nbsp; 18  Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; In the first <I>month,</I> in the first
 <I>day</I> of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock without
 blemish, and cleanse the sanctuary:
 &nbsp; 19  And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering,
 and put <I>it</I> upon the posts of the house, and upon the four
 corners of the settle of the altar, and upon the posts of the
 gate of the inner court.
 &nbsp; 20  And so thou shalt do the seventh <I>day</I> of the month for
 every one that erreth, and for <I>him that is</I> simple: so shall ye
 reconcile the house.
 &nbsp; 21  In the first <I>month,</I> in the fourteenth day of the month, ye
 shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread
 shall be eaten.
 &nbsp; 22  And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and
 for all the people of the land a bullock <I>for</I> a sin offering.
 &nbsp; 23  And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt
 offering to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, seven bullocks and seven rams without
 blemish daily the seven days; and a kid of the goats daily <I>for</I>
 a sin offering.
 &nbsp; 24  And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a
 bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and a hin of oil for an ephah.
 &nbsp; 25  In the seventh <I>month,</I> in the fifteenth day of the month,
 shall he do the like in the feast of the seven days, according to
 the sin offering, according to the burnt offering, and according
 to the meat offering, and according to the oil.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Having laid down the rules of the righteousness toward men, which is 
 really a branch off true religion, he comes next to give some 
 directions for their religion towards God, which is a branch of 
 universal righteousness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It is required that they offer an oblation to the Lord out of what 
 they have 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>All the people of the land</I> must give an oblation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 As God's tenants, they must pay a quitrent to their great landlord. 
 They had offered an oblation out of their real estates 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 a <I>holy portion of their land;</I> now they are directed to offer an 
 oblation out of their personal estates, their goods and chattels, as an 
 acknowledgement of their receivings from him, their dependence on him, 
 and their obligations to him. Note, Whatever our substance is we must 
 honour God with it, by giving him his dues out of it. Not that God has 
 need of or may be benefited by any thing that we can give him, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:9">Ps. l. 9</A>.

 No; it is but an <I>oblation;</I> we only <I>offer it</I> to him; the
 benefit of it returns back to ourselves, to his poor, who, as our 
 neighbours, are ourselves, or to his ministers who serve continually 
 for our good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The proportion of this oblation is here determined, which was not 
 done by the law of Moses. No mention is made of the title, but only of 
 this oblation. And the <I>quantum</I> of this is thus settled:--

 1. Out of their corn they were to offer a sixtieth part; out of every
 <I>homer of wheat and barley,</I> which contained ten ephahs, they were 
 to offer the sixth part of one ephah, which was a sixtieth part of the 
 whole,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 2. Out of their oil (and probably their wine too) they were to offer a 
 hundredth part, for this oblation; out of every cor, or homer, which 
 contained ten baths they were to offer the tenth part of one bath, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 This was given to the altar; for in every meat-offering there was 
 <I>flour mingled with oil.</I> 

 3. Out of their flocks they were to give <I>one lamb</I> out of 200;
 that was the smallest proportion of all,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 But it must be <I>out of the fat pastures of Israel.</I> They must not 
 offer to God that which was taken up from the common, but the fattest 
 and best they had, for <I>burnt-offerings</I> and 
 <I>peace-offerings:</I> the former were offered for the giving of glory 
 to God, the latter for the fetching in of mercy, grace, and peace, from 
 God, and in our spiritual sacrifices these are our two great errands at 
 the throne of grace; but, in order to the acceptance of both, these 
 sacrifices were to <I>make reconciliation</I> for them. Christ is our
 sacrifice of atonement, by whom reconciliation is made, and to him we 
 must have an eye in our sacrifices of acknowledgment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. This oblation must be given <I>for the prince in Israel,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Some read it <I>to</I> the prince, and understand it of Christ, who is 
 indeed the prince in Israel, to whom we must offer our oblations, and 
 into whose hands we must put them, to be presented to the Father. Or,
 They shall give it <I>with</I> the prince; every private person shall 
 bring his oblation, to be offered with that of the prince; for it 
 follows 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>).

 It <I>shall be the prince's part to provide</I> all the offerings, 
 <I>to make reconciliation for the house of Israel.</I> The people were 
 to bring their oblations to him according to the foregoing rules, and 
 he was to bring them to the sanctuary, and to make up what fell short 
 out of his own. Note, It is the duty of rulers to take care of 
 religion, and to see that the duties of it be regularly and carefully 
 performed by those under their charge, and that nothing be wanting that 
 is requisite thereto: the magistrate is the keeper of both tables; and 
 it is a happy thing when those that are above others in power and 
 dignity go before them in the service of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Some particular solemnities are here appointed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here is one in the beginning of the year, which seems to be
 altogether new, and not instituted by the law of Moses; it is the 
 annual solemnity of cleansing the sanctuary. 

 (1.) <I>On the first day of the first month</I> (upon new-year's day)
 they were to offer a sacrifice for the <I>cleansing of the 
 sanctuary</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 that is, to make atonement for the iniquity of the holy things the year 
 past, that they might bring none of the guilt of them into the services 
 of the new year, and to implore grace for the preventing of that 
 iniquity, and for the better performance of the service of the 
 sanctuary the ensuing year. And, in token of this, the blood of this 
 <I>sin-offering</I> was to be put upon the <I>posts of the gate of the 
 inner court</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 to signify that by it atonement was intended to be made for the sins of 
 all the servants that attended that house, priests, Levites, and 
 people, even the sins that were found in all their services. Note, Even 
 sanctuaries on earth need cleansing, frequent cleansing; that above 
 needs none. Those what worship God together should often join in 
 renewing their repentance for their manifold defects, and applying the 
 blood of Christ for the pardon of them, and in renewing their covenants 
 to be more careful for the future; and it is very seasonable to begin 
 the year with this work, as Hezekiah did when it had been long 
 neglected, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:17">2 Chron. xxix. 17</A>.

 They were here appointed to <I>cleanse the sanctuary</I> upon the first
 day of the month, because on the fourteenth day of the month they were 
 to eat the <I>passover,</I> an ordinance which, of all Old-Testament 
 institutions, had most in it of Christ and gospel grace, and therefore 
 it was very fit that they should begin to prepare for it a fortnight 
 before by cleansing the sanctuary.

 (2.) This sacrifice was to be repeated <I>on the seventh day of the
 first month,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 And then it was intended to make atonement <I>for every one that errs,
 and for him that is simple.</I> Note, He that sins <I>errs and is 
 simple;</I> he mistakes, he goes out of the way, and shows himself to 
 be foolish and unwise. But here it is spoken of those sins which are 
 committed through ignorance, mistake, or inadvertency, whether by any 
 of the priests, or of the Levites, or of the people. Sacrifices were
 appointed to atone for such sins as men were surprised into, or did 
 before they were aware, which they would not have done if they had 
 known and remembered aright, which they were overtaken in, and for 
 which, afterwards, they condemn themselves. But for presumptuous sins,
 committed with a high hand, there was no sacrifice appointed, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+15:30">Num. xv. 30</A>.

 By these repeated sacrifices you shall <I>reconcile the house,</I> that
 is, God will be reconciled to it, and continue the tokens of his 
 presence in it, and will <I>let it alone this year also.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The passover was to be religiously observed at the time appointed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Christ is <I>our passover,</I> that is <I>sacrificed for us.</I> We 
 celebrate the memorial of that sacrifice and feast upon it, triumphing 
 in our deliverance out of the Egyptian slavery of sin and our 
 preservation from the sword of the destroying angel, the sword of 
 divine justice, in the Lord's supper, which is our passover-feast, as 
 the whole Christian life is, and must be, the feast of unleavened 
 bread. It is here appointed that the prince shall prepare a 
 <I>sin-offering,</I> to be offered <I>for himself and the people,</I> a 
 bullock on the <I>first</I> day 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>)

 and a <I>kid of the goats</I> every other day 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 to teach us, in all our attendance upon God for communion with him, to 
 have an eye to the great sin-offering, by which <I>transgression</I> 
 was <I>finished</I> and an <I>everlasting righteousness brought in.</I> 
 On every day of the feast there was to be a <I>burnt-offering,</I> 
 purely for the honour of God, of no less than seven bullocks and seven 
 rams, with their meat-offering, which were wholly consumed upon the 
 altar, and yet <I>no waste,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The feast of tabernacles; that is spoken of next 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 and there is no mention of the feast of pentecost, which came between 
 that of the passover and that of tabernacles. Orders are here given 
 (above what were given by the law of Moses) for the same sacrifices to 
 be offered during the seven days of the passover. See the deficiency of 
 the legal sacrifices for sin; they were therefore often repeated, not 
 only every year, but every feast, every day of the feast, because 
 <I>they could not make the comers thereunto perfect,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:1,3">Heb. x. 1, 3</A>.
 
 See the necessity of our frequently repeating the same religious
 exercises. Though the sacrifice of atonement is offered <I>once for
 all,</I> yet the sacrifices of acknowledgement, that of a broken heart, 
 that of a thankful heart, those spiritual sacrifices which are 
 acceptable to God through Christ Jesus, must be every day offered. We 
 should, as here, fall into a method of holy duties, and keep to it.</P>
