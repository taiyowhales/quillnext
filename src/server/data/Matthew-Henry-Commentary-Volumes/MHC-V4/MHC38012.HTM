 The apostle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:25,26">Gal. iv. 25, 26</A>)

 distinguishes between "Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with
 her children"--the remaining carcase of the Jewish church that
 rejected Christ, and "Jerusalem that is from above, that is free, and
 is the mother of us all"--the Christian church, the spiritual
 Jerusalem, which God has chosen to put his name there; in the foregoing
 chapter we read the doom of the former, and left that carcase to be a
 prey to the eagles that should be gathered to it. Now, in this chapter,
 we have the blessings of the latter, many precious promises made to the
 gospel-Jerusalem by him who

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:1">ver. 1</A>)

 declares his power to make them good. It is promised,

 I. That the attempts of the church's enemies against her shall be to
 their own ruin, and they shall find that it is at their peril if they 
 do her any hurt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:2-4,6">ver. 2-4, 6</A>.

 II. That the endeavours of the church's friends and patrons for her
 good shall be pious, regular, and successful, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:5">ver. 5</A>.

 III. That God will protect and strengthen the meanest and weakest that 
 belong to his church, and work salvation for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:7,8">ver. 7, 8</A>.

 IV. That as a preparative for all this mercy, and a pledge of it, he 
 will pour upon them a spirit of prayer and repentance, the effect of 
 which shall be universal and very particular, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:9-14">ver. 9-14</A>.

 These promises were of use then to the pious Jews that lived in the 
 troublous times under Antiochus, and other persecutors and oppressors;
 and they are still to be improved in every age for the directing of our 
 prayers and the encouraging of our hopes with reference to the 
 gospel-church.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 The burden of the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> for Israel, saith the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the
 foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within
 him.
 &nbsp; 2 Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the
 people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against
 Judah <I>and</I> against Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 3 And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for
 all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in
 pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together
 against it.
 &nbsp; 4 In that day, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, I will smite every horse with
 astonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open mine
 eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the
 people with blindness.
 &nbsp; 5 And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The
 inhabitants of Jerusalem <I>shall be</I> my strength in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of
 hosts their God.
 &nbsp; 6 In that day will I make the governors of Judah like a hearth
 of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and
 they shall devour all the people round about, on the right hand
 and on the left: and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her
 own place, <I>even</I> in Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 7 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the
 glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of
 Jerusalem do not magnify <I>themselves</I> against Judah.
 &nbsp; 8 In that day shall the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> defend the inhabitants of
 Jerusalem; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be
 as David; and the house of David <I>shall be</I> as God, as the angel
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> before them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The title of this charter of promises made to God's Israel; it is 
 the <I>burden of the word of the Lord,</I> a divine prediction; it is 
 of weight in the delivery of it; it is to be pressed upon people, and 
 will be very pressing in the accomplishment of it; it is a 
 <I>burden,</I> a heavy burden, to all the church's enemies, like that 
 <I>talent of lead,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+5:7,8"><I>ch.</I> v. 7, 8</A>.

 But it is <I>for Israel;</I> it is for their comfort and benefit. As
 even the <I>fiery law</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:2">Deut. xxxiii. 2</A>),

 so the fiery prophecies and fiery providences that come from God's
 right hand, come for them; the word that speaks terror to their enemies 
 speaks peace to them, as the pillar of cloud and fire, which turned a 
 bright side towards the Israelites, to direct and encourage them, but a 
 black side towards the Egyptians, to terrify and dispirit them. Happy 
 are those that have even the burdens of God's word for them, as well as 
 the blessings of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The title of him that grants this charter, which is prefixed to it 
 to show that he has both authority to make these promises and ability 
 to make them good, for he is the Creator of the world and our Creator, 
 and therefore has an incontestable irresistible dominion. 

 1. He <I>stretches out the heavens;</I> not only he did so at the
 first, when he said, <I>Let there be a firmament,</I> and he <I>made 
 the firmament,</I> but he does so still; he keeps them stretched out 
 <I>like a curtain,</I> keeps them from running in, and will do so till 
 the end come, when <I>the heavens shall be rolled together as a 
 scroll.</I> No bounds can be set to his power who stretches out the 
 heavens, nor can any thing be too hard for him. 

 2. He <I>lays the foundation of the earth,</I> and keeps it firm and 
 fixed on its own basis, or rather on its own axis, though it is 
 <I>founded on the seas</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:1">Ps. xxiv. 1, 2</A>),

 nay, though it is <I>hung upon nothing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+26:7">Job xxvi. 7</A>.

 The founder of this earth is no doubt the ruler of it, and judges in
 it, and those deceive themselves who say, <I>The Lord has forsaken the 
 earth,</I> for, if he had, it would have sunk, since it is he that not 
 only did lay its foundations at first, but does still lay them, still 
 uphold them.

 3. He <I>forms the spirit of man within him.</I> He <I>made us these
 souls,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:16">Jer. xxxviii. 16</A>.

 He not only breathed into the first man, but still breathes into every
 man the breath of life; the body is derived from the <I>fathers of our
 flesh,</I> but the soul is infused by the <I>Father of spirits,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:9">Heb. xii. 9</A>.

 He <I>fashions men's hearts;</I> they are <I>in his hand,</I> and he
 turns them <I>as the rivers of water,</I> and casts them into what 
 mould he pleases, so as to serve his own purposes with them; and he can 
 therefore save his church by inspiriting his friends and dispiriting 
 his enemies, and will eternally save all his chosen by forming their 
 spirits anew.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The promises themselves that are here made them, by which the 
 church shall be secured, and in which all its friends may enjoy a holy 
 security.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is promised that, whatever attacks the enemies of the church may 
 make upon her purity or peace, they will certainly issue in their own 
 confusion. The enemies of God and of his kingdom bear a great deal of 
 malice and ill-will to Jerusalem, and form designs for its destruction; 
 but it will prove, at last, that they are but preparing ruin for 
 themselves; Jerusalem is in safety, and those are in all the danger who 
 fight against it. This is here illustrated by three comparisons:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>Jerusalem</I> shall be <I>a cup of trembling</I> to all that 
 lay siege to it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 They promise themselves that it shall be to them a cup of wine, which 
 they shall easily and with pleasure drink off, and they thirst for its 
 spoils, nay, they thirst for its blood, as for such a cup; but it shall 
 prove a <I>cup of slumber,</I> nay, a <I>cup of poison,</I> to them, 
 which, when they take it into their hands, and think it is all their 
 own, they shall not be able to drink off: the fumes of it shall give 
 them enough. When <I>the kings were assembled</I> against her, and saw 
 how <I>God was known in her palaces for a refuge,</I> they <I>trembled 
 and hasted away; fear took hold upon them,</I> as we find, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:3-6">Ps. xlviii. 3-6</A>.
 
 Thus Alexander the Great was struck with amazement when he met Jaddus
 the high priest, and was deterred thereby from offering any violence to 
 Jerusalem. When Sennacherib laid siege <I>against Judah</I> and 
 <I>Jerusalem</I> he found them such a cup of stupifying wine as laid 
 all his mighty men asleep, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:5,6">Ps. lxxvi. 5, 6</A>.

 Some read it, <I>I will make Jerusalem a post of contrition</I> or
 <I>breaking.</I> Those that make any attempts upon Jerusalem do but run 
 their heads against a post, which they cannot move, but are sure to 
 hurt themselves. The <I>blast of the terrible ones</I> is <I>as a storm 
 against the wall</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:4">Isa. xxv. 4</A>),

 broken by it, but not shaking it. God's church is a cup of consolation
 to all her friends

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:11">Isa. lxvi. 11</A>),

 but a cup of trembling to all that would either debauch her by errors
 and corruptions or destroy her by wars and persecutions. See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:22,23">Isa. li. 22, 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) <I>Jerusalem</I> shall be <I>a burdensome stone</I> to all that
 attempt to remove it or carry it away, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 All <I>the people of the earth</I> are here supposed to be <I>gathered 
 together against it,</I> some one time and some another; there has been 
 a succession of enemies, from age to age, making war upon the church. 
 But though they were all at once in a confederacy against it, and had 
 formed a resolution to <I>cut off the name of Israel, that it should be 
 no more in remembrance</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:4">Ps. lxxxiii. 4</A>),

 they will find it a task too hard for them. Those that are for keeping
 up and advancing the kingdom of sin in the world look upon Jerusalem, 
 even the church of God, as the great obstacle to their designs, and 
 they must have it out of the way; but they will find it heavier than 
 they think it is; so that,

 [1.] They cannot remove it. God will have a church in the world, in
 spite of them; it is <I>built upon a rock,</I> and is as <I>Mount Zion,
 that abides for ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+125:1">Ps. cxxv. 1</A>.

 This <I>stone, cut out of the mountain without hands,</I> will not only
 keep its ground, but fill the earth,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:35">Dan. ii. 35</A>.
 
 Nay,

 [2.] It will <I>break in pieces all that burden themselves</I> with it,
 as that stone <I>smote the image,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:45">Dan. ii. 45</A>.

 All that think themselves a match for it shall be <I>cut in pieces</I>
 by it. Some think it is an allusion to a sport which Jerome, upon this 
 place, says was in use among the Jews, as among us: young men tried 
 their strength, and strove for mastery, by heaving up great stones, 
 which, if they proved too heavy for them, fell upon them, and bruised 
 them. Those that make a jest of religion, and banter sacred things, 
 will find them a burdensome stone, that it is ill-jesting with 
 edged-tools, and though they make light of it (saying, <I>Am not I in 
 sport?</I>) they bring upon themselves an insupportable sinking load of 
 guilt. Our Saviour seems to allude to these words when he speaks of 
 himself as a burdensome stone to those that will not have him for their 
 foundation-stone, which shall <I>fall upon them and grind them to 
 powder,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:44">Matt. xxi. 44</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The governors of Judah shall be among their enemies like <I>a 
 hearth of fire among the wood, and a torch of fire in a sheaf,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Not that their own passions shall make them incendiaries and firebrands 
 to all about them; no; Zion's King is <I>meek and lowly,</I> and all 
 subordinate governors must be like him; but God's justice will make 
 them avengers of his cause, and theirs, upon their enemies. Those that 
 contend with them will find it is like an opposition given by briers 
 and thorns to a consuming fire, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:4">Isa. xxvii. 4</A>.

 It will go through them, and burn them together. It is God's wrath, and
 not theirs, that is the fire which devours the adversaries. God's fire 
 is said to be <I>in Zion,</I> and <I>his furnace in Jerusalem.</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+31:9">Isa. xxxi. 9</A>.

 The enemies thought to be as water to this fire, to extinguish it and
 put it quite out; but God will make them as wood, nay, as a sheaf of 
 corn (which is more combustible), to this fire, not only to be consumed 
 by it, but to be made thereby to burn the more strongly. When God would 
 make Abimelech and the men of Shechem one another's destroyers fire is 
 said to <I>come out from the one to devour the other,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:20">Judg. ix. 20</A>.

 So here, Fire shall come out from the <I>governors of Judah</I> to
 <I>devour all the people round about,</I> as from the mouth of God's 
 witnesses to consume those who offer to hurt them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:5">Rev. xi. 5</A>.

 The persecutors of the primitive church found this fulfilled in it, 
 witness Lactantius's history of God's judgments upon the primitive 
 persecutors, and the confession of Julian the apostate at last. <I>Thou 
 hast overcome me, O thou Galilean!</I> The church's motto may be, 
 <I>Nemo me impune lacesset--He that assails me does it at his peril. If 
 you are weary of your life, persecute the Christians,</I> was once a 
 proverb.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It is promised that God will infatuate the counsels and enfeeble the 
 courage of the church's enemies 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>In that day,</I> when the people of the earth are gathered together 
 against Jerusalem, <I>I will smite every horse with astonishment, and 
 his rider with madness;</I>" and again, "<I>I will smite every horse of 
 the people with blindness,</I> so that they shall be no way serviceable 
 to them; blinding the horses will be as bad as houghing them." The 
 horses and their horsemen shall both forget the military exercise to 
 which they were trained, and, instead of keeping ranks and observing 
 the rules of their discipline, they shall both grow mad, and ruin 
 themselves. The church's infantry shall be too hard for the enemy's 
 cavalry; and those who were upbraided with trusting in horses shall be 
 baffled by those who were forbidden to multiply horses.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. It is promised that Jerusalem shall be re-peopled and replenished 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, even in 
 Jerusalem.</I> The natives of Jerusalem shall not incorporate in a 
 colony in some other country, and build a city there, and call that 
 <I>Jerusalem,</I> and see the promises fulfilled in that, as those in 
 New England called their towns by the names of towns in Old England.
 No; they shall have a new Jerusalem upon the same foundation, the same 
 spot of ground, with the old one. They had so after their return out of 
 captivity, but this was to have its full accomplishment in the 
 gospel-church, which is a Jerusalem inhabited <I>in its own place;</I> 
 for, the gospel being to be preached to all the world, it may call 
 every place its own.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. It is promised that the inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be enabled to 
 defend themselves, and yet shall be taken under the divine protection, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 See here in what method God preserves his church, and those that are 
 his, from the gates of hell to and through the gates of heaven.

 (1.) He does himself secure them: <I>In that day shall the Lord defend 
 the inhabitants of Jerusalem,</I> not only Jerusalem itself from being 
 taken and destroyed, but every inhabitant of it from being any way 
 damaged. God will not only be a <I>wall of fire</I> about the city, to 
 fortify that, but he will encompass particular persons with his favour 
 <I>as with a shield,</I> so that no dart of the besiegers shall touch 
 them. 

 (2.) He does it by giving them strength and courage to help themselves. 
 What God works in his people by his grace contributes more to their 
 preservation and defence than what he works for them by his providence. 
 <I>The God of Israel gives strength and power to his people,</I> that 
 they may do their part, and then he will not be wanting to do his. It
 is the glory of God to strengthen the weak, that most need his help, 
 that see and own their need of it, and will be the most thankful for 
 it.

 [1.] In that day the feeblest of the inhabitants of Jerusalem <I>shall 
 be as David,</I> shall be men of war, as bold and brave, as skilful and 
 strong, as David himself, shall attempt and accomplish great things, as 
 David did, and become as serviceable to Jerusalem in guarding it as 
 David himself was in founding it, and as formidable as he was to the 
 enemies of it. See what divine grace does; it makes children not only 
 men, but champions, makes weak saints to be not only good soldiers, but 
 great soldiers, like David. And see how God often does his own work as 
 easily and effectually, and more to his own glory, by weak and obscure 
 instruments than by the most illustrious.

 [2.] <I>The house of David shall be as God,</I> that is, <I>as the 
 angel of the Lord, before them.</I> Zerubbabel was now the top-branch 
 of the house of David; he shall be endued with wisdom and grace for the 
 service to which he is called, and shall go before the people as an 
 angel, as that angel (so some think) which went before the people of 
 Israel through the wilderness, which was God himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:20">Exod. xxiii. 20</A>.

 God will increase the gifts and abilities both of the people and
 princes, in proportion to the respective services for which they are 
 designed. It was said of David that he was <I>as an angel of God, to
 discern good and bad,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:17">2 Sam. xiv. 17</A>.

 Such shall the house of David now be. The inhabitants of Jerusalem
 shall be as strong and fit for action as nature made David, and their 
 magistrates as wise and fit for counsel as grace made him. But this was 
 to have its full accomplishment in Christ; now the house of David 
 looked little and mean, and its glory was eclipsed, but in Christ the 
 house of David shone more brightly than ever, and its countenance was 
 as that of an angel; in him it became more blessed, and more a 
 blessing, than ever it had been.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. It is promised that there shall be a very good understanding between 
 the city and the country, and that the balance shall be kept even 
 between them; there shall be no mutual envies or jealousies between 
 them; they shall not keep up any separate interests, but shall heartily 
 unite in their counsels, and act in concert for the common good; and 
 this happy agreement between the city and the country, the head and the 
 body, is very necessary to the health, welfare, and safety of any 
 nation. 

 (1.) <I>The governors of Judah,</I> the magistrates and gentry of the 
 country, shall think honourably of the citizens, <I>the inhabitants of 
 Jerusalem,</I> the merchants and tradesmen; they shall not run them 
 down, and contrive how to keep them under, but they <I>shall say in 
 their hearts,</I> not in compliment but in sincerity, <I>The 
 inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength,</I> the strength of my 
 country, of my family, <I>in the Lord of hosts their God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 They will therefore, upon all occasions, pay respect and deference to 
 Jerusalem, as the mother-city, the ruling-city, and the city that is to 
 be first served, because they look upon it to be the bulwark of the 
 nation and its strongest fortification in times of public danger and 
 distress, which therefore they would all come in to the assistance of 
 and come under the protection of, and this not so much because it was a 
 rich city, and money is the sinews of war, nor because it was a 
 populous city and could bring the greatest numbers into the field, nor 
 because its inhabitants were generally the most ingenious active men, 
 the best soldiers and the best commanders (<I>of Zion it shall be said, 
 This and that</I> brave <I>man were born there</I>), but because it was 
 a <I>holy city,</I> where God's house and household, the temple and the 
 priests, were, where his worship was kept up and his feasts were 
 observed, and because it should now be more than ever a praying city, 
 for <I>upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem</I> God will <I>pour a spirit 
 of supplication</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);

 therefore the governors of Judah shall say, <I>These are my 
 strength;</I> they are so upon the account of their relation to, their 
 interest in, and their communion with, <I>the Lord of hosts, their 
 God.</I> Because <I>the Lord of hosts</I> is in a particular manner 
 <I>their God</I> (for <I>in Salem is his tabernacle and his 
 dwelling-place in Zion</I>), therefore <I>they shall be my 
 strength.</I> Note, It is well with a kingdom when its great men know 
 how to value its good men, when its governors look upon religion and 
 religious people to be their strength, and consider it their interest 
 to support them, and learn to call godly praying people, and skilful 
 faithful ministers, <I>the chariots and horsemen of Israel,</I> as 
 Joash called Elisha, and not the troublers of the land, as Ahab called 
 Elijah. 

 (2.) The court and the city shall not despise, nor look with contempt 
 upon, the inhabitants of the country; no, not the meanest of them, much 
 less upon the governors of Judah; for God will put signal honour upon 
 Judah, and so save them from the contempt of their brethren. As 
 Jerusalem was dignified by special ordinances, so Judah shall be 
 dignified with special providences. God says

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 <I>I will open my eyes upon the house of Judah,</I> upon the poor 
 country people. Proud men scornfully overlook them, but the great God
 will graciously look upon them and look after them. Nay, 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 <I>the Lord shall save the tents of Judah first.</I> Those that dwell 
 in tents lie most exposed; but God will remarkably protect and deliver 
 them before those that dwell in Jerusalem. He will appear glorious in 
 what he does for the <I>inhabitants of his villages in Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:11">Judg. v. 11</A>.

 Thus, in the mystical body, God <I>gives more abundant honour to that
 part which lacked, that there may be no schism in the body</I> (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:22-25">1 Cor. xii. 22-25</A>),

 which is the reason here given why <I>the glory of the house of
 David,</I> which has great power, and <I>the glory of the inhabitants
 of Jerusalem,</I> who have great wealth, and both which live in great
 pomp and pleasure, <I>may not magnify themselves against Judah</I> and
 the <I>tents of Judah,</I> the dwellers in which work hard, and fare
 hard, and perhaps are not so well bred. Note, Courtiers and citizens
 ought not to despise country people, nor look with disdain upon those
 whom God <I>opens his eyes upon</I> and who are <I>first saved,</I>
 while it is so hard for the rich and great to <I>enter the kingdom of
 God.</I> If God by his grace has magnified the dwellers in the tents of
 Judah, having chosen the weak and foolish things of the world and
 chosen to employ them, we affront him if we vilify them, or magnify
 ourselves against them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:5,6">Jam. ii. 5, 6</A>.

 This promise has a further reference to the gospel-church, in which no 
 difference shall be made between high and low, rich and poor, bond and 
 free, circumcision and uncircumcision, but all shall be alike welcome 
 to Christ, and partake of his benefits, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:11">Col. iii. 11</A>.

 Jerusalem shall not then be thought, as it had been, more holy than
 other parts of the land of Israel.</P>

 destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 10 And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the
 inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of
 supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have

 the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;

 apart; the family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart;

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The <I>day</I> here spoken of is the day of Jerusalem's defence and 
 deliverance, that glorious day when God will appear for the salvation 
 of his people, which, if it do refer to the successes which the Jews 
 had against their enemies in the time of the Maccabees, yet certainly 
 looks further, to the <I>gospel-day,</I> to Christ's victories over the 
 powers of darkness and the great salvation he has wrought for his 
 chosen. Now we have here an account of two remarkable works designed 
 <I>in that day.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A glorious work of God to be wrought for his people: "<I>I will seek 
 to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 
 Nations come against Jerusalem, many and mighty nations; but they shall 
 all be destroyed, their power shall be broken, and their attempts 
 baffled; the mischief they intend shall return upon their own head." 
 God will seek to destroy them, not as if he were at a loss for ways and 
 means to bring it about (Infinite Wisdom was never nonplussed), but his 
 seeking to do it intimates that he is very earnest and intent upon it 
 (he is jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and has the <I>day of 
 vengeance</I> in his heart) and that he overrules means and 
 instruments, and all the motions and operations of second causes, in 
 order to it. He is <I>framing evil</I> against them; when he seems to 
 be setting them up he is seeking to destroy them. In Christ's first 
 coming, he <I>sought to destroy him that had the power of death,</I> 
 and did destroy him, bruised the serpent's head, and broke all the 
 <I>powers of darkness</I> that fought against God's kingdom among men 
 and against the faithful friends and subjects of that kingdom; he 
 <I>spoiled</I> them, and <I>made a show of them openly.</I> In his 
 second coming, he will complete their destruction, when he shall <I>put 
 down all</I> opposing <I>rule, principality, and power,</I> and 
 <I>death</I> itself shall be <I>swallowed up in</I> that <I>victory. 
 The last enemy shall be destroyed</I> of all that <I>fought against 
 Jerusalem.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A gracious work of God to be wrought in his people, in order to the 
 work that is to be wrought for them. When he seeks to destroy their 
 enemies he will <I>pour upon them the Spirit of grace and 
 supplication.</I> Note, When God intends great mercy for his people the 
 first thing he does is to set them a praying; thus he seeks to destroy 
 their enemies by stirring them up to seek to him that he would do it 
 for them; because, though he has proposed it and promised it, and it is 
 for his own glory to do it, yet he will <I>for this be enquired of by 
 the house of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:37">Ezek. xxxvi. 37</A>.

 <I>Ask, and it shall be given.</I> This honour will he have to himself,
 and this honour will he put upon prayer and upon praying people. And it 
 is a happy presage to the distressed church of deliverance approaching, 
 and is, as it were, the dawning of its day, when his people are stirred 
 up to cry mightily to him for it. But this promise has reference to, 
 and is performed in, the graces of the Spirit given to all believers, 
 as that 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:3">Isa. xliv. 3</A>,

 <I>I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed,</I> which was fulfilled when
 <I>Jesus was glorified,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:39">John vii. 39</A>.

 It is a promise of the Spirit, and with him of all <I>spiritual
 blessings in heavenly things by Christ.</I> Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. On whom these blessings are poured out. 

 (1.) <I>On the house of David,</I> on the great men; for they are no
 more, and no better, than the grace of God makes them. It was promised

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>)

 that <I>the house of David</I> should be <I>as the angel of the 
 Lord.</I> Now, in order to that, the Spirit of grace is poured upon 
 them; for the more the saints have of the Spirit of grace the more like 
 they are to the holy angels. When God was about to appear for the land, 
 he poured his Spirit of grace upon the house of David, the leading men 
 of the land. It bodes well to a people when princes and great men go 
 before the rest in that which is good, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+20:5">2 Chron. xx. 5</A>.

 The house of David is all summed up in Jesus Christ, <I>the Son of
 David;</I> and upon him, as the head, the Spirit of grace is poured 
 out, from him to be diffused to all his members; <I>from his fulness we 
 receive, and grace for grace.

 (2.) On the inhabitants of Jerusalem,</I> the common people; for the 
 operations of the Spirit are the same upon the mean and weak Christians 
 that they are upon the strong and more grown. The inhabitants of 
 Jerusalem cannot influence public affairs by their powers and policies, 
 as the great men of the house of David may, yet they may do good 
 service by their prayers, and therefore upon them the Spirit shall be 
 poured out. The church is Jerusalem, the heavenly Jerusalem; all true 
 believers, that have their conversation in the heaven, are inhabitants 
 of this Jerusalem, and to them this promise belongs. God will <I>pour 
 his Spirit upon them.</I> This is the earnest which all that <I>believe 
 in Christ shall receive;</I> thus they are sanctified; thus they are 
 sealed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What these blessings are: <I>I will pour upon them the Spirit.</I> 
 That includes all good things, as it qualifies us for the favour of 
 God, and all his other gifts. He will pour out the Spirit, 

 (1.) As a <I>Spirit of grace,</I> to sanctify us and to make us 
 gracious. 

 (2.) As a <I>Spirit of supplications,</I> inclining us to, instructing 
 and assisting us in, the duty of prayer. Note, Wherever the Spirit is 
 given as a Spirit of grace, he is given as a Spirit of sanctification.
 Wherever he is a Spirit of adoption, he <I>teaches to cry, Abba, 
 Father.</I> As soon as ever Paul was converted, <I>Behold, he 
 prays,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:11">Acts ix. 11</A>.

 You may as soon find a living man without breath as a living saint
 without prayer. There is a more plentiful effusion of the Spirit of 
 prayer now under the gospel than was under the law; and the further the 
 work of sanctification is carried in us the better is the work of 
 supplication carried on by us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What the effect of them will be: <I>I will pour upon them the Spirit 
 of grace.</I> One would think that it should follow, "And they shall 
 look on him whom they have believed, and shall rejoice" (and it is true 
 that that is one of the fruits of the pouring out of the Spirit, whence 
 we read of <I>the joy of the Holy ghost</I>), but it follows, <I>They 
 shall mourn;</I> for there is a holy mourning, that is the effect of 
 the pouring out of the Spirit, a mourning for sin, which is of use to 
 quicken faith in Christ and qualify for joy in God. It is here made the 
 matter of a promise that they shall mourn, for there is a mourning that 
 will end in rejoicing and has a blessing entailed upon it. This 
 mourning is a fruit of the Spirit of grace, an evidence of a work of 
 grace in the soul, and a companion of the Spirit of supplication, as it 
 expresses lively affections working in prayer; hence prayers and tears 
 are often put together, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+20:5">2 Kings xx. 5</A>.

 Jacob, that wrestler with God, <I>wept and made supplication.</I> But
 here it is a mourning for sin that is the effect of the pouring out of 
 the Spirit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) It is a mourning grounded upon a sight of Christ: <I>They shall 
 look on me whom they have pierced, and shall mourn for him.</I> Here, 
 
 [1.] It is foretold that Christ should be pierced, and this scripture 
 is quoted as that which was fulfilled when Christ's side was pierced 
 upon the cross; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:37">John xix. 37</A>.

 [2.] He is spoken of as one whom we have pierced; it is spoken
 primarily of the Jews, who persecuted him to death (and we find that 
 <I>those who pierced him</I> are distinguished from the other 
 <I>kindreds of the earth</I> that shall <I>wail because of him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:7">Rev. i. 7</A>);

 yet it is true of us all as sinners, we have pierced Christ, inasmuch 
 as our sins were the cause of his death, for he was <I>wounded for our 
 transgressions,</I> and they are the <I>grief of his soul;</I> he is 
 <I>broken with the whorish heart</I> of sinners, who <I>therefore</I> 
 are said to <I>crucify him afresh</I> and put him to open shame. 

 [3.] Those that truly repent of sin look upon Christ as one whom they 
 have pierced, who was pierced for their sins and is pierced by them; 
 and this engages them to <I>look unto him,</I> as those that are deeply 
 concerned for him.

 [4.] This is the effect of their looking to Christ; it makes them 
 mourn. This was particularly fulfilled in those to whom Peter preached 
 Christ crucified; when they heard it those who had had a hand in 
 piercing him were <I>pricked to the heart,</I> and cried out, <I>What 
 shall we do?</I> It is fulfilled in all those who sorrow for sin after 
 a godly sort; they look to Christ, and <I>mourn for him,</I> not so 
 much for his sufferings as for their own sins that procured them. Note, 
 The genuine sorrows of a penitent soul flow from the believing sight of 
 a pierced Saviour. Looking by faith upon the cross of Christ will set
 us a mourning for sin after a godly sort.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It is a great mourning. 

 [1.] it is like the mourning of a parent for the death of a beloved 
 child. They shall mourn for sin <I>as one mourns for an only son,</I> 
 in whose grave the hopes of his family are buried, and shall be 
 inwardly <I>in bitterness as one that is in bitterness for his 
 first-born,</I> as the Egyptians were when there was a cry throughout 
 all their land for the death of their first-born. The sorrow of 
 children for the death of their parents is sometimes counterfeited, is 
 often small, and soon wears off and is forgotten; but the sorrow of 
 parents for a child, for a son, for an only son, for a first-born, is 
 natural, sincere, unforced, and unaffected, it is secret and lasting; 
 such are the sorrows of a true penitent, flowing purely from love to 
 Christ above any other.

 [2.] It is like the mourning of a people for the death of a wise and 
 good prince. It shall be <I>like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the 
 valley of Megiddon,</I> where good king Josiah was slain, for whom 
 there was a general lamentation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 and perhaps the greater because they were told that it was their sin 
 that provoked God to deprive them of so great a blessing; therefore 
 they cried out, <I>The crown has fallen from our head. Woe unto us, for 
 we have sinned!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:16">Lam. v. 16</A>.

 Christ is our King; our sins were his death, and, for that reason,
 ought to be our grief.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) It is a general universal mourning 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>The land shall mourn.</I> The land itself put on mourning at the 
 death of Christ, for there was then <I>darkness over all the land,</I> 
 and the earth trembled; but this is a promise that, in consideration of 
 the death of Christ, multitudes shall be effectually brought to sorrow 
 for sin and turn to God; it shall be such a universal gracious mourning 
 as was when <I>all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:2">1 Sam. vii. 2</A>.

 Some think this is yet to have its complete accomplishment in the 
 general conversion of the Jewish nation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) It is also a private particular mourning. There shall be not only
 a mourning of <I>the land,</I> by its representatives in a general
 assembly (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:5">Judg. ii. 5</A>,

 when the place was called <I>Bochim--A place of weepers</I>), but it
 shall spread itself into all corners of the land: <I>Every family 
 apart</I> shall mourn

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 <I>all the families that remain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 All have contributed to the guilt, and therefore all shall share in the 
 grief. Note, The exercises of devotion should be performed by private 
 families among themselves, besides their joining in public assemblies 
 for religious worship. National fasts must be observed, not only in
 our synagogues, but in our houses. In the mourning here foretold the 
 wives mourn apart by themselves, in their own apartment, as Esther and 
 her maids. And some think it intimates their denying themselves the use 
 even of lawful delights in a time of general humiliation 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:5">1 Cor. vii. 5</A>.
 
 Four several families are here specified as examples to others in this
 mourning:--

 [1.] Two of them are royal families: the <I>house of David,</I> in
 Solomon, and the <I>house of Nathan,</I> another son of David, brother
 to Solomon, from whom Zerubbabel descended, as appears by Christ's
 genealogy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:27-31">Luke iii. 27-31</A>.

 The house of David, particularly that of Nathan, which is now the chief
 branch of that house, shall go before in this good work. The greatest 
 princes must not think themselves exempted from the law of repentance, 
 but rather obliged most solemnly to express it, for the exciting of 
 others, as Hezekiah humbled himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:26">2 Chron. xxxii. 26</A>),
 
 the princes and the king 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:6">2 Chron. xii. 6</A>),

 and the king of Nineveh, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+3:6">Jonah iii. 6</A>.

 [2.] Two of them are sacred families

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 <I>the family of the house of Levi,</I> which was God's tribe, and in
 it particularly the family of Shimei, which was a branch of the tribe 
 of Levi 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+6:17">1 Chron. vi. 17</A>),

 and probably some of the descendants of that family were now of note
 for preachers to the people or ministers to the altar. As the princes 
 must mourn for the sins of the magistracy, so must the priests for the 
 <I>iniquity of the holy things.</I> In times of general tribulation and 
 humiliation the Lord's ministers are concerned to <I>weep between the 
 porch and the altar</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:17">Joel ii. 17</A>),
 
 and not only there, but in their houses apart; for in what families
 should godliness, both in the form and in the power of it, be found, if 
 not in ministers' families?</P>
