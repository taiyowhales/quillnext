 Cyrus was nominated, in the foregoing chapter, to be God's shepherd; 
 more is said to him and more of him in this chapter, not only because 
 he was to be instrumental in the release of the Jews out of their 
 captivity, but because he was to be therein a type of the great 
 Redeemer, and that release was to be typical of the great redemption 
 from sin and death; for that was the salvation of which all the 
 prophets witnessed. We have here, 

 I. The great things which God would do for Cyrus, that he might be put
 into a capacity to release God's people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. The proof God would hereby give of his eternal power and godhead,
 and his universal, incontestable, sovereignty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:5-7">ver. 5-7</A>.

 III. A prayer for the hastening of this deliverance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:8">ver. 8</A>.

 IV. A check to the unbelieving Jews, who quarrelled with God for the
 lengthening out of their captivity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:9,10">ver. 9, 10</A>.

 V. Encouragement given to the believing Jews, who trusted in God and 
 continued instant in prayer, assuring them that God would in due time 
 accomplish this work by the hand of Cyrus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:11-15">ver. 11-15</A>.

 VI. A challenge given to the worshippers of idols and their doom read,
 and satisfaction given to the worshippers of the true God and their 
 comfort secured, with an eye to the Mediator, who is made of God to us 
 both righteousness and sanctification, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:16-25">ver. 16-25</A>.

 And here, as in many other parts of this prophecy, there is much of 
 Christ and of gospel grace.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right
 hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will
 loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved
 gates; and the gates shall not be shut;
 &nbsp; 2  I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight:
 I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the
 bars of iron:
 &nbsp; 3  And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden
 riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 which call <I>thee</I> by thy name, <I>am</I> the God of Israel.
 &nbsp; 4  For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I have
 even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou
 hast not known me.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Cyrus was a Mede, descended (as some say) from Astyages king of Media. 
 The pagan writers are not agreed in their accounts of his origin. Some 
 tell us that in his infancy he was an outcast, left exposed, and was 
 saved from perishing by a herdsman's wife. However, it is agreed that, 
 being a man of an active genius, he soon made himself very 
 considerable, especially when Cr&oelig;sus king of Lydia made a descent upon 
 his country, which he not only repulsed, but revenged, prosecuting the 
 advantages he had gained against Cr&oelig;sus with such vigour that in a 
 little time he took Sardis and made himself master of the rich kingdom 
 of Lydia and the many provinces that then belonged to it. This made him 
 very great (for Cr&oelig;sus was rich to a proverb) and enabled him to 
 pursue his victories in many countries; but it was nearly ten years 
 afterwards that, in conjunction with his uncle Darius and with the 
 forces of Persia, he made this famous attack upon Babylon, which is 
 here foretold, and which we have the history of Dan.

 5. Babylon had now grown exorbitantly rich and strong. It was
 forty-five miles in compass (some say more): the walls were thirty-two 
 feet thick and 100 cubits high. Some say, They were so thick that six 
 chariots might drive abreast upon them; others say, They were fifty 
 cubits thick and 200 high. Cyrus seems to have had a great ambition to 
 make himself master of this place, and to have projected it long; and 
 at last he performed it. Now here, 210 years before it came to pass, we 
 are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What great things God would do for him, that he might put it into 
 his power to release his people. In order to this he shall be a mighty 
 conqueror and a wealthy monarch and nations shall become tributaries to 
 him and help him both with men and money. Now that which God here 
 promised to do for Cyrus he could have done for Zerubbabel, or some of 
 the Jews themselves; but the wealth and power of this world God has 
 seldom seen fit to entrust his own people with much of, so many are the 
 snares and temptations that attend them; but if here has been occasion, 
 for the god of the church, to make use of them, God has been pleased 
 rather to put them into the hands of others, to be employed for them, 
 than to venture them in their own hands. Cyrus is here called God's 
 <I>anointed,</I> because he was both designed and qualified for this 
 great service by the counsel of God, and was to be herein a type of the 
 Messiah. God engages to hold his right hand, not only to strengthen and 
 sustain him, but to direct his motions and intentions, as Elisha put 
 his hands upon the king's hands when he was to shoot his arrow against 
 Syria, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:16">2 Kings xiii. 16</A>.
 
 Being under such direction,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He shall extend his conquests very far and shall make nothing of the 
 opposition that will be given him. Babylon is too strong a place for a 
 young hero to begin with; and therefore, that he may be able to deal 
 with that, great additions shall be made to his strength by other 
 conquests. 

 (1.) Populous kingdoms shall yield to him. God will <I>subdue nations 
 before him;</I> when he is in the full career of his successes he shall 
 make nothing of a nation's being born to him at once: yet it is not he 
 that subdues them; it is God that subdues them for him; the battle is 
 his, and therefore his is the victory. 

 (2.) Potent kings shall fall before him: <I>I will loose the loins of 
 kings,</I> either the girdle of their loins (divesting them of their 
 power and dignity) or the strength of their loins, and then it was 
 literally fulfilled in Belshazzar, for, when he was terrified by the 
 handwriting on the wall, <I>the joints of his loins were loosed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:6">Dan. v. 6</A>.

 (3.) Great cities shall surrender themselves into his hands, without 
 giving him or themselves any trouble. God will incline the keepers of 
 the city to <I>open before him the two-leaved gates,</I> not 
 treacherously nor timorously, but from a full conviction that it is to 
 no purpose to contend with him; and therefore the gates shall not be 
 shut to keep him out as an enemy, but thrown open to admit him as a 
 friend. 

 (4.) The longest and most dangerous marches shall be made easy and 
 ready to him: <I>I will go before thee,</I> to clear the way, and to 
 conduct thee in it, and then the <I>crooked places,</I> shall be made 
 <I>straight;</I> or, as some read it, the hilly places shall be 
 levelled and made even. Those will find a ready road that have God
 going before them. 

 (5.) No opposition shall stand before him. He that gives him his
 commission <I>will break in pieces the gates of brass</I> that are shut 
 against him, <I>and cut asunder the bars of iron</I> wherewith they are 
 fastened. This was fulfilled in the letter, if that be true which 
 Herodotus reports, that the city of Babylon had 100 gates all of brass, 
 with posts and hooks of the same metal.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He shall replenish his coffers very much 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>I will give thee the treasures of darkness,</I> treasures of gold 
 and silver, that have been long kept close under lock and key and had 
 not seen the light of many years, or had been buried under ground by 
 the inhabitants, in their fright, upon the taking of the city. The 
 riches of many nations had been brought to Babylon, and Cyrus seized 
 all together. <I>The hidden riches of secret places,</I> which belonged 
 either to the crown or to private persons, shall all be a prey to 
 Cyrus. Thus God, designing him to do a piece of service to his church, 
 paid him richly for it beforehand; and Cyrus very honestly owned God's 
 goodness to him, and, in consideration of that, released the captives. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:2">Ezra i. 2</A>,

 <I>God has given me all the kingdoms of the earth</I> and thereby has
 obliged <I>me to build him a house at Jerusalem.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We are here told what God designed in doing all this for Cyrus. 
 What Cyrus aimed at in undertaking his wars we may easily guess; but 
 what God aimed at in giving him such wonderful success in his wars we 
 are here told.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It was that the God of Israel might be glorified: "<I>That thou 
 mayest know</I> by all this <I>that I the Lord am the God of 
 Israel;</I> for I have <I>called thee by thy name</I> long before thou 
 wast born." When Cyrus should have this prophecy of Isaiah shown to 
 him, and should there find his own name and his own achievements 
 particularly described so long before, he should thereby be brought to 
 acknowledge that the God of Israel was the Lord, Jehovah, the only 
 living and true God, and that he continued to own his Israel though now 
 in captivity. It is well when thus men's prosperity brings them to the 
 knowledge of God, for too often it makes them forget him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It was that the Israel of God might be released, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Cyrus knew not God as the God of Israel. Having been trained up in the 
 worship of idols, the true God was to him an unknown God. But, though 
 he knew not God, God not only knew him when he came into being, but 
 foreknew him, and bespoke him for his shepherd. He called him by his 
 name, <I>Cyrus,</I> nay, which was yet great honour, he surnamed him 
 and called him his <I>anointed.</I> And why did God do all this for 
 Cyrus? Not for his own sake, be it known to him; whether he was a man
 of virtue or no is questioned. Xenophon indeed, when he would describe 
 the heroic virtues of an excellent prince, made use of Cyrus's name, 
 and many of the particulars of his story, in his Cyrop&aelig;dia; but 
 other historians represent him as haughty, cruel, and bloodthirsty. The 
 reason why God preferred him was <I>for Jacob his servant's sake.</I> 
 Note, 

 (1.) In all the revolutions of states and kingdoms, the sudden falls of 
 the great and strong, and the surprising advancements of the weak and 
 obscure, God is designing the good of his church. 

 (2.) It is therefore the wisdom of those to whom God has given wealth 
 and power to use them for his glory, by showing kindness to his people. 
 Cyrus is preferred that Israel may be released. He shall have a 
 kingdom, only that God's people may have their liberty; for their 
 kingdom is not of this world, it is yet to come. In all this Cyrus was 
 a type of Christ, who was made victorious over principalities and 
 powers, and entrusted with unsearchable riches, for the use and benefit 
 of God's servants, his elect. <I>When he ascended on high he led 
 captivity captive,</I> took those captives that had taken others 
 captives, and <I>opened the prison to those that were bound.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God here asserts his sole and sovereign dominion, as that which he 
 designed to prove and manifest to the world in all the great things he 
 did for Cyrus and by him. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How this doctrine is here laid down concerning the sovereignty of 
 the great Jehovah, in two things:--

 1. That he is God alone, and there is no God besides him. This is here
 inculcated as a fundamental truth, which, if it were firmly believed, 
 would abolish idolatry out of the world. With what an awful, 
 commanding, air of majesty and authority, bidding defiance, as it were, 
 to all pretenders, does the great God here proclaim it to the world: 
 <I>I am the Lord, I the Lord, Jehovah,</I> and <I>there is none else, 
 there is no God besides me,</I> no other self-existent, 
 self-sufficient, being, none infinite and eternal. And again

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 <I>There is none besides me;</I> all that are set up in competition 
 with me are counterfeits; they are all vanity and a lie, for <I>I am 
 the Lord, and there is none else.</I> This is here said to Cyrus, not 
 only to cure him of the sin of his ancestors, which was the worshipping 
 of idols, but to prevent his falling into the sin of some of his 
 predecessors in victory and universal monarchy, which was the setting 
 up of themselves for gods and being idolized, to which some attribute 
 much of the origin of idolatry. Let Cyrus, when he becomes thus rich 
 and great, remember that still he is but a man, and there is no God but 
 one.
 
 2. That he is Lord of all, and there is nothing done without him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>I form the light,</I> which is grateful and pleasing, and
 <I>I create darkness,</I> which is grievous and unpleasing. <I>I make 
 peace</I> (put here for all good) and <I>I create evil,</I> not the 
 evil of sin (God is not the author of that), but the evil of 
 punishment. <I>I the Lord</I> order, and direct, and <I>do all these 
 things.</I> Observe, 

 (1.) The very different events that befal the children of men. Light 
 and darkness are opposite to each other, and yet, in the course of 
 providence, they are sometimes intermixed, like the morning and evening 
 twilights, <I>neither day nor night,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:6">Zech. xiv. 6</A>.

 There is a mixture of joys and sorrows in the same cup, allays to each
 other. Sometimes they are counterchanged, as noonday light and
 midnight darkness. In the revolution of every day each takes its turn, 
 and there are short transitions from the one to the other, witness 
 Job's case.

 (2.) The self-same cause of both, and that is he that is the first 
 Cause of all: <I>I the Lord,</I> the fountain of all being, am the 
 fountain of all power. He who formed the natural light 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:3">Gen. i. 3</A>)
 
 still forms the providential light. He who at first made peace among
 the jarring seeds and principles of nature makes peace in the affairs 
 of men. He who allowed the natural darkness, which was a mere 
 privation, creates the providential darkness; for concerning troubles 
 and afflictions he gives positive orders. Note, The wise God has the 
 ordering and disposing of all our comforts, and all our crosses, in 
 this world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How this doctrine is here proved and published. 

 1. It is proved by that which God did for Cyrus: "<I>There is no God
 besides me,</I> for

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 <I>I girded thee, though thou hast not known me.</I> It was not thy own 
 idol, which thou didst know and worship, that girded thee for this 
 expedition, that gave thee authority and ability for it. No, it was I 
 that girded thee, I whom thou didst not know, nor seek to." By 
 <I>this</I> it appears that the God of Israel is the only true God, 
 that he manages and makes what use he pleases even of those that are 
 strangers to him and pay their homage to other gods. 

 2. It is published to all the world by the word of God, by his 
 providence, and by the testimony of the suffering Jews in Babylon, that 
 all may know from the east and from the west, sunrise and sun-set, that 
 the Lord is God and there is none else. The wonderful deliverance of 
 the Israel of God proclaimed to all the world that <I>there is none 
 like unto the God of Jeshurun, that rides on the heavens for their 
 help.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. How this doctrine is here improved and applied.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. For the comfort of those that earnestly longed, and yet quietly 
 waited, for the redemption of Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Drop down, you heavens, from above.</I> Some take this as the 
 saints' prayer for the deliverance. I rather take it as God's precept 
 concerning it; for he is said to <I>command deliverances,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:4">Ps. xliv. 4</A>.
 
 Now the precept is directed to heaven and earth, and all the hosts of
 both, as royal precepts commonly run--<I>To all officers, civil and 
 military.</I> All the creatures shall be made in their places to 
 contribute to the carrying on of this great work, when God will have it 
 done. If men will not be aiding and assisting, God will produce it 
 without them, as he does the dews of heaven and the grass of the earth, 
 which <I>tarry not for man, nor wait for the sons of men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:7">Mic. v. 7</A>.
 
 Observe,

 (1.) The method of this great deliverance that is to be wrought for 
 Israel. <I>Righteousness</I> must first be wrought in them; they must
 be brought to repent of their sins, to renounce their idolatries, to 
 return to God, and reform their lives, and then the salvation shall be 
 wrought for them, and not till then. We must not expect salvation 
 without righteousness, for they spring up together and together the 
 Lord hath created them; what he has joined together, let not us 
 therefore put asunder. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+85:9-11">Ps. lxxxv. 9-11</A>.

 Christ died to save us from our sins, not in our sins, and is made
 redemption to us by being made to us righteousness and sanctification.

 (2.) The means of this great deliverance. Rather than it shall fail, 
 when the set time for it shall come, the <I>heavens shall drop down 
 righteousness, and the earth shall open to bring forth salvation,</I> 
 and both concur to the reformation, and so to the restoration, of God's 
 Israel. It is from heaven, from above the skies, that righteousness 
 drops down, for every grace and good gift is from above; nay, since the 
 more plentiful effusion of the Spirit it is now <I>poured</I> down, 
 and, if our hearts be open to receive it, the product will be the 
 fruits of righteousness and the great salvation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. For reproof to those of the church's enemies that opposed this 
 salvation, or those of her friends that despaired of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Woe unto him that strives with his Maker!</I> God is the Maker of 
 all things, and therefore our Maker, which is a reason why we should 
 always submit to him and never contend with him. 

 (1.) Let not the proud oppressors, in the elevation of their spirits, 
 oppose God's designs concerning the deliverance of his people, nor 
 think to detain them any longer when the time shall come for their 
 release. Woe to the insulting Babylonians that set God at defiance, as 
 Pharaoh did, and will not let his people go! 

 (2.) Let not the poor oppressed, in the dejection of their spirits, 
 murmur and quarrel with God for the prolonging of their captivity, as 
 if he dealt unjustly or unkindly with them, or think to force their way 
 out before God's time shall come. Note, Those will find themselves in a 
 woeful condition that strive with their Maker; for none ever hardened 
 his heart against God and prospered. Sinful man is indeed a quarrelsome 
 creature; but <I>let the potsherds strive with the potsherds of the 
 earth.</I> Men are but earthen pots, nay, they are broken potsherds, 
 and are made so very much by their mutual contentions. They are dashed 
 in pieces one against another; and, if they are disposed to strive, let 
 them strive with one another, let them meddle with their match; but let 
 them not dare to contend with him that is infinitely above them, which 
 is as senseless and absurd as,

 [1.] For the clay to find fault with the potter: <I>Shall the clay say 
 to him that forms it, "What makest thou?</I> Why dost thou make me of 
 this shape and not that?" Nay, it is as if the clay should be in such a 
 heat and passion with the potter as to tell him that <I>he has no 
 hands,</I> or that he works as awkwardly as if he had none. "Shall the 
 clay pretend to be wiser than the potter and therefore to advise him, 
 or mightier than the potter and therefore to control him?" He that gave 
 us being, that gave us this being, may design concerning us, and 
 dispose of us, as he pleases; and it is impudent presumption for us to 
 prescribe to him. Shall we impeach God's wisdom, or question his power, 
 who are ourselves so curiously, so wonderfully, made? Shall we say, 
 <I>He has no hands,</I> whose hands made us and in whose hands we are?
 The doctrine of God's sovereignty has enough in it to silence all our 
 discontents and objections against the methods of his providence and 
 grace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:20,21">Rom. ix. 20, 21</A>.

 [2.] It is as unnatural as for the child to find fault with the parents, 
 to say to the father, <I>What begettest thou?</I> or to the mother, 
 "<I>What hast thou brought forth?</I> Why was I not begotten and born 
 an angel, exempt from the infirmities of human nature and the 
 calamities of human life?" Must not those who are children of men 
 expect to share in the common lot and to fare as others fare? If God is 
 our Father, where is the honour we owe to him by submitting to his 
 will?</P>

 hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I
 commanded.
 &nbsp; 13  I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all
 his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my
 captives, not for price nor reward, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts.
 &nbsp; 14  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, The labour of Egypt, and merchandise of
 Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto
 thee, and they shall be thine: they shall come after thee; in
 chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down unto thee,
 they shall make supplication unto thee, <I>saying,</I> Surely God <I>is</I>
 in thee; and <I>there is</I> none else, <I>there is</I> no God.
 &nbsp; 15  Verily thou <I>art</I> a God that hidest thyself, O God of
 Israel, the Saviour.
 &nbsp; 16  They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them:
 they shall go to confusion together <I>that are</I> makers of idols.
 &nbsp; 17  <I>But</I> Israel shall be saved in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> with an everlasting
 salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without
 end.
 &nbsp; 18  For thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> that created the heavens; God
 himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established
 it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I
 <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and <I>there is</I> none else.
 &nbsp; 19  I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I
 said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The people of God in captivity, who reconciled themselves to the will 
 of God in their affliction and were content to wait his time for their 
 deliverance, are here assured that they should not wait in vain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They are invited to enquire concerning the issue of their troubles, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 <I>The Holy One of Israel, and his Maker,</I> though he does not allow 
 them to strive with him, yet encourages them, 

 1. To consult his word: "<I>Ask of me things to come;</I> have recourse
 to the prophets and their prophecies, and see what they say concerning 
 these things. Ask the watchmen, What of the night? Ask them, How
 long?" Things to come, as far as they are revealed, belong to us and to 
 our children, and we must not be strangers to them. 

 2. To seek unto him by prayer: "<I>Concerning my sons and concerning 
 the work of my hands,</I> which as becomes them submit to the will of 
 their Father, the will of their potter, <I>command you me,</I> not by 
 way of prescription, but by way of petition. Be earnest in your 
 requests, and confident in your expectations, as far as both are guided 
 by and grounded upon the promise." We may not strive with our Maker by 
 passionate complaints, but we may wrestle with him by faithful and 
 fervent prayer. <I>My sons, and the work of my hands, commend to me</I> 
 (so some read it), bring them to me and leave them with me. See the 
 power of prayer, and its prevalency with God: <I>Thou shalt cry, and he 
 shall say, Here I am; what would you that I should do unto you?</I> 
 Some read it with an interrogation, as carrying on the reproof

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>):

 <I>Do you question me concerning things to come?</I> and am I bound to 
 give you an account? <I>And concerning my children, even concerning the 
 work of my hands, will you command me,</I> or prescribe to me? Dare you 
 do so? <I>Shall any teach God knowledge,</I> or give law to him? Those
 that complain of God do in effect assume an authority over him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They are encouraged to depend upon the power of God when they are 
 brought very low and are utterly incapable of helping themselves, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Their <I>help stands in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and 
 earth,</I> which he mentions here, not only for his own glory, but for 
 their comfort. The heavens and earth shall contribute, if he please, to 
 the deliverance of the church

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 for he created both, and therefore has both at command. 

 1. He <I>made the earth, and created man upon it,</I> for it was
 intended to be a habitation for man, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:16">Ps. cxv. 16</A>.

 He has therefore not only authority, but wisdom and power sufficient to
 govern man here on this earth and to make what use he pleases of him.

 2. His <I>hands have stretched out the heavens, and all their hosts he 
 commanded</I> into being at first, and therefore still governs all 
 their motions and influences. It is good news to God's Israel that 
 their God is the creator and governor of the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They are particularly told what God would do for them, that they 
 might know what to depend upon; and this shall lead them to expect a 
 more glorious Redeemer and redemption, of whom, and of which, Cyrus and 
 their deliverance by him were types and figures.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Liberty shall be proclaimed to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Cyrus is the man that shall proclaim it; and, in order hereunto, God 
 will put power into his hands: <I>I have raised him up in 
 righteousness,</I> that is, in pursuance and performance of my promises 
 and to plead my people's just but injured cause. He will give him 
 success in all his enterprises, particularly that against Babylon: <I>I 
 will direct all his ways;</I> and then it follows that he will prosper 
 him, for those must needs speed well that are under a divine direction. 
 God will make plain the way of those whom he designs to employ for him. 
 Two things Cyrus must do for God:--

 (1.) Jerusalem is God's city, but it is now in ruins, and he must 
 rebuild it, that is, he must give orders for the rebuilding of it, and 
 give wherewithal to do it. 

 (2.) Israel is God's people, but they are now captives, and he must 
 release them freely and generously, not demanding any ransom, nor 
 compounding with them for price or reward. And Christ is anointed to
 do that for poor captive souls which Cyrus was to do for the captive 
 Jews, to proclaim the <I>opening of the prison to those that were 
 bound</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:1"><I>ch.</I> lxi. 1</A>),

 enlargement from a worse bondage than that in Babylon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Provision shall be made for them. They went out poor, and unable to 
 bear the expenses of their return and re-establishment; and therefore 
 it is promised that the labour of Egypt and other nations should 
 <I>come over to them and be theirs,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Cyrus, having conquered those countries, out of their spoils provided 
 for the returning Jews; and he ordered his subjects to furnish them 
 with necessaries 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:4">Ezra i. 4</A>),

 so that they did not go out empty from Babylon any more than from
 Egypt. Those that are redeemed by Christ shall be not only provided 
 for, but enriched. Those whose spirits God stirs up to go to the 
 heavenly Zion may depend upon him to bear their charges. The world is
 theirs as far as is good for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Proselytes shall be brought over to them: <I>Men of stature shall 
 come after thee in chains; they shall fall down to thee, saying, Surely 
 God is in thee.</I> This was in part fulfilled when many of the people 
 of the land became Jews 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+8:17">Esther viii. 17</A>),

 <I>and said, We will go with you,</I> humbly begging leave to do so,
 <I>for we have heard that God is with you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:23">Zech. viii. 23</A>.

 The restoration would be a means of the conviction of many and the
 conversion of some. Perhaps many of the Chaldeans who were now 
 themselves conquered by Cyrus, when they saw the Jews going back in 
 triumph, came and begged pardon for the affronts and abuses they had 
 given them, owned that God was among them and that he was God alone, 
 and therefore desired to join themselves to them. But this promise was 
 to have its full accomplishment in the gospel church,--when the 
 Gentiles shall become obedient by word and deed to the faith of Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:18">Rom. xv. 18</A>),
 
 as willing captives to the church

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:3">Ps. cx. 3</A>),

 glad to wear her chains,--when an infidel, beholding the public worship
 of Christians, shall own himself convinced that <I>God is with them of 
 a truth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:24,25">1 Cor. xiv. 24, 25</A>)

 and shall assay to join himself to them,--and when those that had been
 <I>of the synagogue of Satan shall come and worship before the church's 
 feet,</I> and be made to <I>know that God has loved her</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:9">Rev. iii. 9</A>),

 and the <I>kings of the earth and the nations shall bring their glory
 into the gospel Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:24">Rev. xxi. 24</A>.

 Note, It is good to be with those, though it be in chains, that have
 God with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. They are taught to trust God further than they can see him. The 
 prophet puts this word into their mouths, and goes before them in 
 saying it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):
 
 <I>Verily, thou art a God that hidest thyself.</I>
 
 1. God hid himself when he brought them into the trouble, <I>hid 
 himself and was wroth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:17"><I>ch.</I> lvii. 17</A>.

 Note, Though God be his people's God and Saviour, yet sometimes, when
 they provoke him, he hides himself from them in displeasure, suspends 
 his favours, and lays them under his frowns: but let them <I>wait upon 
 the Lord that hides his face,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:17"><I>ch.</I> viii. 17</A>.

 2. He hid himself when he was bringing them out of the trouble. Note,
 When God is acting as Israel's God and Saviour commonly <I>his way is 
 in the sea,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+77:19">Ps. lxxvii. 19</A>.

 The salvation of the church is carried on in a mysterious way, by the
 Spirit of the Lord of hosts working on men's spirits

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:6">Zech. iv. 6</A>),

 by weak and unlikely instruments, small and accidental occurrences, and
 not wrought till the last extremity; but this is our comfort, though 
 God hide himself, we are sure he is <I>the God of Israel,</I> the 
 <I>Saviour.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+35:14">Job xxxv. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. They are instructed to triumph over idolaters and all the 
 worshippers of other gods 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>Those who are makers of idols,</I> not only who frame them, but who 
 make gods of them by praying to them, <I>shall be ashamed and 
 confounded,</I> when they shall be convinced of their mistakes and 
 shall be forced to acknowledged that the God of Israel is the only true 
 God, and when they shall be disappointed in their expectations from 
 their idols, under whose protection they had put themselves. They shall 
 go to confusion when they shall find that they can neither excuse the 
 sin nor escape the punishment of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+97:7">Ps. xcvii. 7</A>.

 It is not here and there one more timorous than the rest that shall
 thus shrink, and give up the cause, but <I>all of them;</I> nay, though 
 they appear in a body, though hand join in hand, and they do all they 
 can to keep one another in countenance, yet <I>they shall go to 
 confusion together.</I> Bind them in bundles, to burn them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. They are assured that those who trust in God shall never be made 
 ashamed of their confidence in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Now that God was about to deliver them out of Babylon he directed them
 by his prophet, 

 1. To look up to him as the author of their salvation: <I>Israel shall 
 be saved in the Lord.</I> Not only their salvation shall be wrought out 
 by his power, but it shall be treasured up for them in his grace and 
 promise, and so secured to them. They shall be saved in him; for his 
 name shall be their strong tower, into which they shall run, and in 
 which they shall be safe. 

 2. To look beyond this temporal deliverance to that which is spiritual 
 and has reference to another world, to think of that salvation by the 
 Messiah which is an everlasting salvation, the salvation of the soul, a 
 rescue from everlasting misery and a restoration to everlasting bliss. 
 "Give diligence to make that sure, for it may be made sure, so sure 
 that <I>you shall not be ashamed nor confounded world with out end.</I> 
 You shall not only be delivered from the <I>everlasting shame and 
 contempt</I> which will be the portion of idolaters 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+12:2">Dan. xii. 2</A>),

 but you shall have everlasting honour and glory."

 [1.] There is a world without end; and it will be well or ill with us
 according as it will be with us in that world.

 [2.] Those who are saved with the everlasting salvation shall never be 
 ashamed of what they did or suffered in the hopes of it; for it will so 
 far outdo their expectations as to be a more abundant reimbursement. 
 The returning captives owned that to them did <I>belong confusion of 
 face</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:7,8">Dan. ix. 7, 8</A>);

 yet God tells them that they shall not be confounded, but shall have
 assurance for ever. Those who are confounded as penitents for their
 own sin shall not be confounded as believers in God's promise and 
 power.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. They are engaged for ever to cleave to God, and never to desert 
 him, never to distrust him. What had been often inculcated before is 
 here again repeated, for the encouragement of his people to continue 
 faithful to him, and to hope that he would be so to them: <I>I am the 
 Lord, and there is none else.</I> That the Lord we serve and trust in 
 is God alone appears by the two great lights, that of nature and that 
 of revelation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It appears by the light of nature; for he made the world, and 
 therefore may justly demand its homage 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "<I>Thus saith the Lord, that created the heavens and formed the earth, 
 I am the Lord,</I> the sovereign Lord of all, <I>and there is none 
 else.</I>" The gods of the heathen did not do this, nay, they did not 
 pretend to do it. He here mentions the creation of the heavens, but 
 enlarges more upon that of the earth, because that is the part of the 
 creation which we have the nearest view of and are most conversant 
 with. It is here observed, 

 (1.) That he formed it. It is not a rude and indigested chaos, but cast 
 into the most proper shape and size by Infinite Wisdom. 

 (2.) That he fixed it. When he had made it he established it, 
 <I>founded it on the seas,</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:2">Ps. xxiv. 2</A>),
 
 <I>hung it on nothing</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+26:7">Job xxvi. 7</A>)

 as at first he made it of nothing, and yet made it substantial an hung
 it fast, <I>ponderibus librata suis--poised by its own weight.</I>

 (3.) That he fitted it for use, and for the service of man, to whom he 
 designed to give it. <I>He created it not in vain,</I> merely to be a 
 proof of his power; but <I>he formed it to be inhabited</I> by the 
 children of men, and for that end he drew the waters off from it, with 
 which it was at first covered, and made the <I>dry land appear,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:6,7">Ps. civ. 6, 7</A>.

 Be it observed here, to the honour of God's wisdom, that he made
 nothing in vain, but intended every thing for some end and fitted it to 
 answer the intention. If any man prove to have been made in vain, it is 
 his own fault. It should also be observed, to the honour of God's 
 goodness and his favour to man, that he reckoned that not made in vain 
 which serves for his use and benefit, to be a habitation and 
 maintenance for him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It appears by the light of revelation. As the works of God 
 abundantly prove that he is God alone, so does his word, and the 
 discovery he has made of himself and of his mind and will by it. His 
 oracles far exceed those of the Pagan deities, as well as his 
 operations, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 The preference is here placed in three things:--All that God has said 
 is plain, satisfactory, and just. 

 (1.) In the manner of the delivery of it it is plain and open: <I>I 
 have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth.</I> The Pagan 
 deities delivered their oracles out of dens and caverns, with a low and 
 hollow voice, and in ambiguous expressions; those that had familiar 
 spirits whispered and muttered

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:19"><I>ch.</I> viii. 19</A>);

 but God delivered his law from the top of Mount Sinai before all the
 thousands of Israel, in distinct, audible, and intelligible sounds. 
 Wisdom <I>cries in the chief places of concourse,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:20,21,8:1-3">Prov. i. 20, 21; viii. 1-3</A>.

 The vision is written, and made plain, so that he who runs may read it;
 if he be obscure to any, they may thank themselves. Christ pleaded in 
 his own defence what God says here, <I>In secret have I said 
 nothing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:20">John xviii. 20</A>.

 (2.) In the use and benefit of it it was highly satisfactory: <I>I said 
 not unto the seed of Jacob,</I> who consulted these oracles and 
 governed themselves by them, <I>Seek you me in vain,</I> as the false 
 gods did to their worshippers, who sought <I>for the living to the 
 dead,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:19"><I>ch.</I> viii. 19</A>.
 
 This includes all the gracious answers that God gave both to those who
 consulted him (his word is to them a faithful guide) and to those that 
 prayed to him. The seed of Jacob are a praying people; it is the 
 <I>generation of those that seek him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:6">Ps. xxiv. 6</A>.

 And, as he has in his word invited them to seek him, so he never denied
 their believing prayers nor disappointed their believing expectations. 
 He said not to them, to any of them, <I>Seek you me in vain;</I> for, 
 if he did not think fit to give them the particular thing they prayed 
 for, yet he gave them such a sufficiency of grace and such comfort and 
 satisfaction of soul as were equivalent. What we say of winter is true 
 of prayer, It never rots in the skies. God not only gives a gracious 
 answer to those that diligently seek him, but will be their bountiful 
 rewarder.

 (3.) In the matter of it it was incontestably just, and there was no 
 iniquity in it: <I>I the Lord speak righteousness, I declare things 
 that are right,</I> and consonant to the eternal rules and reasons of 
 good and evil. The heathen deities dictated those things to their 
 worshippers which were the reproach of human nature and tended to the 
 extirpation of virtue; but God speaks righteousness, dictates that 
 which is right in itself and tends to make men righteous; and therefore 
 he is God, and there is none else.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 What here is said is intended, as before,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. For the conviction of idolators, to show them their folly in 
 worshipping gods that cannot help them, and neglecting a God that can. 
 Let all <I>that have escaped of the nations,</I> not only the people of 
 the Jews, but those of other nations that were by Cyrus released out of 
 captivity in Babylon, let them come, and hear what is to be said 
 against the worshipping of idols, that they may be cured of it as well 
 as the Jews, that Babylon, which had of old been the womb of idolatry, 
 might now become the grave of it. Let the refugees assemble themselves 
 and come together; God has something to say to them for their own good, 
 and it is this, that idolatry is a foolish sottish thing, upon two 
 accounts:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is setting up a refuge of lies for themselves: <I>They set up the 
 wood of their graven image;</I> for that is the <I>substratum.</I> 
 Though they overlay it with gold, deck it with ornaments, and make a 
 god of it, yet still it is but wood. They <I>pray to a god that cannot 
 save;</I> for he cannot hear, he cannot help, he can do nothing. How do 
 those disparage themselves who give honour to that as a god which 
 cannot, as a god, give good to them! How do those deceive themselves 
 who pray for relief to that which is in no capacity at all to relieve 
 them! Certainly those have no knowledge, or are brutish in their 
 knowledge, who take so much pains, and do so much penance, in seeking 
 the favour of a god that has no power.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It is setting up a rival with God, the only living and true God 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 "Summon them all; tell them that the great cause shall again be tried, 
 though once adjudged, between God and Baal. <I>Bring them near, and let 
 them take counsel together</I> what to say in defence of themselves and 
 their idols. It shall, as before, be put upon this issue: let them show 
 when any of their gods did with any certainty foretel future events, as 
 the God of Israel has done, and it shall be acknowledged that they have 
 some colour for their pretensions. But None of them ever did; their 
 prophets were lying prophets; but <I>I the Lord have told it from that 
 time,</I> long before it came to pass; therefore you must own <I>thee 
 is no other God besides me.</I>" 

 (1.) None besides is fit to rule. He is <I>a just God,</I> and rules in 
 justice, and will execute justice for those that are oppressed. 

 (2.) None besides is able to help. As he is a just God, so he is <I>the 
 Saviour,</I> who can save without the assistance of any, but without 
 whom none can save. Those therefore have no sense of truth and 
 falsehood, good and evil, no, nor of their own interest, that set up 
 any in competition with him.</P>

 II. For the comfort and encouragement of all God's faithful 
 worshippers, whoever they are, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Those that worship idols pray to gods that cannot save; but the God of 
 Israel says it to all the ends of the earth, to his people, though they 
 are scattered into the utmost corners of the world and seem to be lost 
 and forgotten in their dispersion, "Let them but <I>look to me</I> by 
 faith and prayer, look above instruments and second causes, look off 
 from all pretenders, and look up to me, and they shall <I>be 
 saved.</I>" It seems to refer further to the conversion of the Gentiles 
 that live in the ends of the earth, the most distant nations, when the 
 standard of the gospel is set up. <I>To it shall the Gentiles seek.</I> 
 When Christ is lifted up from the earth, as the brazen serpent upon the 
 pole, he shall draw the eyes of all men to him. They shall all be 
 invited to look unto him, as the stung Israelites did to the brazen 
 serpent; and so strong is the eye of faith that by divine grace it will 
 reach the Saviour and fetch in salvation by him even from the ends of 
 the earth; for <I>he is God, and the is none else.</I> Two things are 
 here promised, for the abundant satisfaction of all that by faith look 
 to the Saviour:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That the glory of the God they serve shall be greatly advanced; and 
 this will be good news to all the Lord's people, that, how much soever 
 they and their names are depressed, God will be exalted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 This is confirmed by an oath, that we might have strong consolation: 
 <I>I have sworn by myself</I> (and God can swear by no greater, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:13">Heb. vi. 13</A>);

 <I>the word has gone out of my mouth,</I> and shall neither be recalled
 nor return empty; it has gone forth <I>in righteousness,</I> for it is 
 the most reasonable equitable thing in the world that he who made all 
 should be Lord of all, that, since all beings are derived from him, 
 they should all be devoted to him. He has said it, and it shall be made 
 good, <I>I will be exalted,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:10">Ps. xlvi. 10</A>.

 He has assured us,

 (1.) That he will be universally submitted to, that the kingdoms of the 
 world shall become his kingdom. They shall do him homage--<I>Unto me 
 every knee shall bow;</I> and they shall bind themselves by an oath of 
 allegiance to him--<I>Unto me every tongue shall swear.</I> This is 
 applied to the dominion of our Lord Jesus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:10,11">Rom. xiv. 10, 11</A>.

 <I>We shall all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ</I> and give
 account to him, for it is written, <I>As I live, saith the Lord, every 
 knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to God;</I> and it 
 seems to be referred to, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:9,10">Ps. ii. 9, 10</A>.

 If the heart be brought into obedience to Christ, and made willing in
 the day of his power, the knee will bow to him in humble adorations and 
 addresses, and in cheerful obedience to his commands, submission to his 
 disposals, and compliance with his will in both; and the tongue will 
 swear to him, will lay a bond upon the soul to engage it for ever to 
 him; for he that bears an honest mind never startles at assurances.

 (2.) That he will be universally sought unto, and application shall be 
 made to him from all parts of the world: <I>Unto him shall men of 
 distant countries come,</I> to implore his favour. <I>Unto thee shall 
 all flesh come</I> with their request, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:2">Ps. lxv. 2</A>.

 And, when Christ was <I>lifted up from the earth, he drew all men to
 him.</I>

 (3.) That it will be to no purpose to make opposition to him. <I>All 
 that are incensed against him,</I> that rage at his bonds and 
 cords--the nations that are angry because he has taken to himself his 
 great power and has reigned, that have been incensed at the strictness 
 of his laws, the success of his gospel, and the spiritual nature of his 
 kingdom--they <I>shall be ashamed;</I> some shall be brought to a 
 penitential shame for it, others to a remediless ruin. One way or 
 other, sooner or later, all that are uneasy at Christ's government and 
 victories will be made ashamed of their folly and obstinacy. Blessed be 
 God for the assurance here given us that, whatever becomes of us and 
 our interests, <I>the Lord will reign for ever!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That the welfare of the souls they are concerned for shall be 
 effectually secured: <I>Surely shall one say,</I> and another shall 
 learn by his example to say the same, so that all the seed of Israel, 
 according to the Spirit, shall say, and stand to it, 

 (1.) That God has a sufficiency for them and that in Christ there is 
 enough to supply all their needs: <I>In the Lord is all righteousness 
 and strength</I> (so the margin reads it); he is himself righteous and 
 strong. He can do every thing, and yet will do nothing but what is 
 unquestionably just and equitable. He has also wherewithal to supply 
 the needs of those that seek to him and depend upon him, upon the 
 equity of his providence and the treasures of his grace; nay, we may 
 say, not only "<I>He</I> has it," but, "In him <I>we</I> have it," 
 because he has said that he will be to us a God. In the Lord the 
 captive Jews had righteousness (that is, grace both to sanctify their 
 afflictions to them and to qualify them for deliverance) and strength 
 for their support and escape. In the Lord Jesus we have righteousness 
 to recommend us to the good-will of God towards us, and strength to 
 begin and carry on the good work of God in us. He is the fountain of 
 both, and on him we must depend for both, must <I>go forth in his 
 strength, and make mention of his righteousness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:16">Ps. lxxi. 16</A>.

 (2.) That they shall have an abundant bliss and satisfaction in this.

 [1.] The people of the Jews shall in the Lord be justified before men 
 and openly glory in their God. The oppressors reproached them, loaded 
 them with calumny, and boasted even of a right to oppress them, as 
 abandoned by their God; but, when God shall work out their deliverance, 
 that shall be their justification from these hard censures, and 
 therefore they shall glory in it.

 [2.] All true Christians, that depend upon Christ for strength and 
 righteousness, in him shall be justified and shall glory in that.
 Observe, <I>First,</I> All believers are the seed of Israel, an upright 
 praying seed. <I>Secondly,</I> The great privilege they enjoy by Jesus 
 Christ is that in him, and for his sake, they are justified before God, 
 Christ being made of God to them righteousness. All that are justified 
 will own it is in Christ that they are justified, nor could they be 
 justified by any other; and those who are justified shall be glorified.
 And therefore, <I>Thirdly,</I> The great duty believers owe to Christ 
 is to glory in him, and to make their boast of him. <I>Therefore</I> he 
 is made all in all to us, that <I>whose glories may glory in the 
 Lord;</I> and let us comply with this intention.</P>
