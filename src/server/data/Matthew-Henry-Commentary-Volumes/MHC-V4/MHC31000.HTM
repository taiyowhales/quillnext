 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HIS</FONT> is the shortest of all the books of the Old 
 Testament, the least of those tribes, and yet is not to be passed by, 
 or thought meanly of, for this penny has C&aelig;sar's image and 
 superscription upon it; it is stamped with a divine authority. There 
 may appear much of God in a short sermon, in a little book; and much 
 good may be done by it, <I>multum in parvo--much in a little.</I> Mr. 
 Norris says, "If angels were to write books, we should have few 
 folios." That may be very precious which is not voluminous. This book 
 is entitled, <I>The Vision of Obadiah.</I> Who this Obadiah was does 
 not appear from any other scripture. Some of the ancients imagined him 
 to be the same with that Obadiah that was steward to Ahab's household

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:3">1 Kings xviii. 3</A>);

 and, if so, he that hid and fed the prophets had indeed a prophet's
 reward, when he was himself made a prophet. But that is a conjecture
 which has no ground. This Obadiah, it is probable, was of a later date,
 some think contemporary with Hosea, Joel, and Amos; others think he
 lived about the time of the destruction of Jerusalem, when the children
 of Edom so barbarously triumphed in that destruction. However, what he
 wrote was what he saw; it is his <I>vision.</I> Probably there was much
 more which he was divinely inspired to speak, but this is all he was
 inspired to write; and all he writes is concerning Edom. It is a
 foolish fancy of some of the Jews that because he prophesies only
 concerning Edom he was himself an Edomite by birth, but a proselyte to
 the Jewish religion. Other prophets prophesied against Edom, and some
 of them seem to have borrowed from him in their predictions against
 Edom, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:7,Eze+25:12">Jer. xlix. 7, &c.; Ezek. xxv. 12</A>,

 &c. Out of the mouth of these two or three witnesses every word will be
 established.</P>
