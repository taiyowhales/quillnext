 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the first alphabet of this lamentation, twenty-two 
 stanzas, in which the miseries of Jerusalem are bitterly bewailed and 
 her present deplorable condition is aggravated by comparing it with her 
 former prosperous state; all along, sin is acknowledged and complained 
 of as the procuring cause of all these miseries; and God is appealed to 
 for justice against their enemies and applied to for compassion towards 
 them. The chapter is all of a piece, and the several remonstrances are 
 interwoven; but here is, 

 I. A complaint made to God of their calamities, and his compassionate 
 consideration desired, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+1:1-11">ver. 1-11</A>.

 II. The same complaint made to their friends, and their compassionate
 consideration desired,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+1:12-17">ver. 12-17</A>.

 III. An appeal to God and his righteousness concerning it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+1:18-22">ver. 18-22</A>),

 in which he is justified in their affliction and is humbly solicited to
 justify himself in their deliverance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  How doth the city sit solitary, <I>that was</I> full of people!
 <I>how</I> is she become as a widow! she <I>that was</I> great among the
 nations, <I>and</I> princess among the provinces, <I>how</I> is she become
 tributary!
 &nbsp; 2  She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears <I>are</I> on her
 cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort <I>her:</I> all
 her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become
 her enemies.
 &nbsp; 3  Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and
 because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she
 findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the
 straits.
 &nbsp; 4  The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn
 feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins
 are afflicted, and she <I>is</I> in bitterness.
 &nbsp; 5  Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions:
 her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.
 &nbsp; 6  And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her
 princes are become like harts <I>that</I> find no pasture, and they
 are gone without strength before the pursuer.
 &nbsp; 7  Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her
 miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old,
 when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did
 help her: the adversaries saw her, <I>and</I> did mock at her
 sabbaths.
 &nbsp; 8  Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed:
 all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her
 nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.
 &nbsp; 9  Her filthiness <I>is</I> in her skirts; she remembereth not her
 last end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no
 comforter. O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, behold my affliction: for the enemy hath
 magnified <I>himself.</I>
 &nbsp; 10  The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant
 things: for she hath seen <I>that</I> the heathen entered into her
 sanctuary, whom thou didst command <I>that</I> they should not enter
 into thy congregation.
 &nbsp; 11  All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their
 pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and
 consider; for I am become vile.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Those that have any disposition to <I>weep with those that weep,</I> 
 one would think, should scarcely be able to refrain from tears at the 
 reading of these verses, so very pathetic are the lamentations 
 here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The miseries of Jerusalem are here complained of as very pressing 
 and by many circumstances very much aggravated. Let us take a view of 
 these miseries.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. As to their civil state. 

 (1.) A city that was populous is now depopulated,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 It is spoken of by way of wonder--Who would have thought that ever it 
 should come to this! Or by way of enquiry--What is it that has brought 
 it to this? Or by way of lamentation--Alas! alas! (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:10,16,19">Rev. xviii. 10, 16, 19</A>)

 <I>how doth the city sit solitary that was full of people!</I> She was 
 full of her own people that replenished her, and full of the people of 
 other nations that resorted to her, with whom she had both profitable 
 commerce and pleasant converse; but now her own people are carried into 
 captivity, and strangers make no court to her: she <I>sits 
 solitary.</I> The <I>chief places of the city</I> are not now, as they 
 used to be, <I>place of concourse,</I> where <I>wisdom cried</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:20,21">Prov. i. 20, 21</A>);

 and justly are they left unfrequented, because wisdom's cry there was 
 not heard. Note, Those that are ever so much increased God can soon 
 diminish. <I>How has she become as a widow!</I> Her king that was, or 
 should have been, as a husband to her, is cut off, and gone; her God 
 has departed from her, and has given her a bill of divorce; she is 
 emptied of her children, is solitary and sorrowful as a widow. Let no 
 family, no state, not Jerusalem, no, nor Babylon herself, be secure, 
 and say, <I>I sit as a queen,</I> and shall never <I>sit as a 
 widow,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:8,Re+18:7">Isa. xlvii. 8; Rev. xviii. 7</A>.

 (2.) A city that had dominion is now in subjection. She had been 
 <I>great among the nations,</I> greatly loved by some and greatly 
 feared by others, and greatly observed and obeyed by both; some made 
 her presents, and others paid her taxes; so that she was really 
 <I>princess among the provinces,</I> and every sheaf bowed to hers; 
 even the princes of the people entreated her favour. But now the tables 
 are turned; she has not only lost her friends and <I>sits solitary,</I> 
 but has lost her freedom too and sits <I>tributary;</I> she paid 
 tribute to Egypt first and then to Babylon. Note, Sin brings a people
 not only into solitude, but into slavery.

 (3.) A city that used to be full of mirth has now become melancholy and
 upon all accounts full of grief. Jerusalem had been a joyous city, 
 whither the tribes went up on purpose to rejoice before the Lord; she 
 was <I>the joy of the whole earth,</I> but now <I>she weeps sorely,</I> 
 her laughter if turned into mourning, her solemn feasts are all gone; 
 she weeps <I>in the night,</I> as true mourners do who weep in secret, 
 in silence and solitude; <I>in the night,</I> when others compose 
 themselves to rest, her thoughts are most intent upon her troubles, and 
 grief then plays the tyrant. What the prophet's head was for her, when 
 she regarded it not, now her head is--<I>as waters, and</I> her <I>eyes 
 fountains of tears,</I> so that she <I>weeps day and night</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:1">Jer. ix. 1</A>);

 <I>her tears are</I> continually <I>on her cheeks.</I> Though nothing
 dries away sooner than a tear, yet fresh griefs extort fresh tears, so 
 that her cheeks are never free from them. Note, There is nothing more 
 commonly seen <I>under the sun</I> than <I>the tears of the 
 oppressed,</I> with whom <I>the clouds return after the rain,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+4:1">Eccl. iv. 1</A>.

 (4.) Those that were separated from the heathen now <I>dwell among the
 heathen;</I> those that were a peculiar people are now a mingled people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Judah has gone into captivity,</I> out of her own land into the land 
 of her enemies, and there she abides, and is likely to abide, among 
 those that are aliens to God and the covenants of promise, with whom 
 <I>she finds no rest,</I> no satisfaction of mind, nor any settlement 
 of abode, but is continually hurried from place to place at the will of 
 the victorious imperious tyrants. And again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>Her children have gone into captivity before the enemy;</I> those 
 that were to have been the seed of the next generation are carried off; 
 so that the land that is now desolate is likely to be still desolate 
 and lost for want of heirs." Those that dwell among their own people, 
 and that a free people, and in their own land, would be more thankful 
 for the mercies they thereby enjoy if they would but consider the 
 miseries of those that are forced into strange countries.

 (5.) Those that used in their wars to conquer are now conquered and
 triumphed over: <I>All her persecutors overlook her between the 
 straits</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 they gained all possible advantages against her, sot hat her people 
 unavoidably <I>fell into the hand of the enemy,</I> for there was no 
 way to escape 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 they were hemmed in on every side, and, which way soever they attempted 
 to flee, they found themselves embarrassed. When they made the best of 
 their way they could make nothing of it, but were overtaken and 
 overcome; so that every where <I>her adversaries are the chief and her 
 enemies prosper</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>);

 which way soever their sword turns they get the better. Such straits do 
 men bring themselves into by sin. If we allow that which is our
 greatest adversary and enemy to have dominion over us, and to be chief 
 in us, justly will our other enemies be suffered to have dominion over 
 us. 

 (6.) Those that had been not only a distinguished by a dignified
 people, on whom God had put honour, and to whom all their neighbours 
 had paid respect, are now brought into contempt

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>All that honoured her</I> before <I>despise her;</I> those that 
 courted an alliance with her now value it not; those that caressed her 
 when she was in pomp and prosperity slight her now that she is in 
 distress, <I>because they have seen her nakedness.</I> By the 
 prevalency of the enemies against her they perceive her weakness, and 
 that she is not so strong a people as they thought she had been; and by 
 the prevalency of God's judgments against her they perceive her 
 wickedness, which now comes to light and is every where talked of. Now 
 it appears how they have vilified themselves by their sins: <I>The 
 enemies magnify themselves</I> against them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 they trample upon them, and insult over them, and in their eyes they 
 have <I>become vile,</I> the tail of the nations, though once they were 
 the head. Note, <I>Sin is the reproach of any people.</I>

 (7.) Those that lived in a fruitful land were ready to perish, and many
 of them did perish, for want of necessary food

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>All her people sigh</I> in despondency and despair; they are ready 
 to faint away; their spirits fail, and therefore they sigh, <I>for they 
 seek bread</I> and seek it in vain. They were brought at last to that
 extremity that there was <I>no bread for the people of the land</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:6">Jer. lii. 6</A>),
 
 and in their captivity they had much ado to get break,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:6"><I>ch.</I> v. 6</A>.

 <I>They have given their pleasant things,</I> their jewels and
 pictures, and all the furniture of their closets and cabinets, which 
 they used to please themselves with looking upon, they have sold these 
 to buy bread for themselves and their families, have parted with them 
 <I>for meat to relieve the soul,</I> or (as the margin is) <I>to make 
 the soul come again,</I> when they were ready to faint away. They 
 desired no other cordial than meat. <I>All that a man has will he give 
 for life,</I> and for break, which is the staff of life. Let those that 
 abound in pleasant things not be proud of them, nor fond of them; for 
 the time may come when they may be glad to let them go for necessary 
 things. And let those that have competent food to relieve their soul be 
 content with it, and thankful for it, though they have not pleasant 
 things.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. We have here an account of their miseries in their ecclesiastical 
 state, the ruin of their sacred interest, which was much more to be 
 lamented than that of their secular concerns. 

 (1.) Their religious feasts were no more observed, no more frequented

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>The ways of Zion do mourn;</I> they look melancholy, overgrown with 
 grass and weeds. It used to be a pleasant diversion to see people 
 continually passing and repassing in the highway that led to the 
 temple, but now you may stand there long enough, and see nobody stir; 
 for <I>none come to the solemn feasts;</I> a full end is put to them by 
 the destruction of that which was the <I>city of our solemnities,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:20">Isa. xxxiii. 20</A>.
 
 <I>The solemn feasts</I> had been neglected and profaned
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:11,12">Isa. i. 11, 12</A>),

 and therefore justly is an end now put to them. But, when thus <I>the
 ways of Zion</I> are made to <I>mourn,</I> all the sons of Zion cannot 
 but mourn with them. It is very grievous to good men to see religious 
 assemblies broken up and scattered, and those restrained from them that 
 would gladly attend them. And, as <I>the ways of Zion mourned,</I> so 
 <I>the gates of Zion,</I> in which the faithful worshippers used to 
 meet, <I>are desolate;</I> for there is none to meet in them. Time was 
 when <I>the Lord loved the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of 
 Jacob,</I> but now he has forsaken them, and is provoked to withdraw 
 from them, and therefore it cannot but fare with them as it did with 
 the temple when Christ quitted it. <I>Behold, you house is left unto 
 you desolate,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:38">Matt. xxiii. 38</A>.

 (2.) Their religious persons were quite disabled from performing their
 wonted services, were quite dispirited: <I>Her priests sigh</I> for the 
 desolations of the temple; their songs are turned into sighs; they 
 sigh, for they have nothing to do, and therefore there is nothing to be 
 had; they sigh, as the people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 <I>for want of bread,</I> because the offerings of the Lord, which were 
 their livelihood, failed. It is time to sigh when the priests, the
 Lord's ministers, sigh. <I>Her virgins</I> also, that used, with their 
 music and dancing, to grace the solemnities of their feasts, <I>are 
 afflicted</I> and <I>in heaviness.</I> Notice is taken of their service 
 in the day of Zion's prosperity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:25">Ps. lxviii. 25</A>,

 <I>Among them were the damsels playing with timbrels</I>), and 
 therefore notice is taken of the failing of it now. <I>Her virgins are
 afflicted,</I> and therefore <I>she is in bitterness;</I> that is, all 
 the inhabitants of Zion are so, whose character it is that they are 
 <I>sorrowful for the solemn assembly,</I> and that to them <I>the 
 reproach of it is a burden,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:18">Zeph. iii. 18</A>.

 (3.) Their religious places were profaned
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>The heathen entered into her sanctuary,</I> into the temple itself, 
 into which no Israelite was permitted to enter, though ever so 
 reverently and devoutly, but the priests only. <I>The stranger that 
 comes nigh,</I> even to worship there, <I>shall be put to death.</I> 
 Thither the heathen now crows rudely in, not to worship, but to 
 plunder. God had commanded that <I>the heathen should not</I> so much 
 as <I>enter into the congregation,</I> nor be incorporated with the 
 people of the Jews 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:3">Deut. xxiii. 3</A>);

 yet now they <I>enter into the sanctuary</I> without control. Note,
 Nothing is more grievous to those who have a true concern for the glory 
 of God, nor is more lamented, than the violation of God's laws, and the 
 contempt they see put upon sacred things. What <I>the enemy did 
 wickedly in the sanctuary</I> was complained of,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:3,4">Ps. lxxiv. 3, 4</A>.

 (4.) Their religious utensils, and all the rich things with which the
 temple was adorned and beautified, and which were made use of in the 
 worship of God, were made a prey to the enemy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>The adversary has spread out his hand upon all her pleasant 
 things,</I> has grasped them all, seized them all, for himself. What 
 these pleasant things are we may learn from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:11">Isa. lxiv. 11</A>,

 where, to the complaint of the burning of the temple, it is added, 
 <I>All our pleasant things are laid waste;</I> the ark and the altar, 
 and all the other tokens of God's presence with them, these were their 
 pleasant things above any other things, and these were now broken to 
 pieces and carried away. Thus from <I>the daughter of Zion all her 
 beauty has departed,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 <I>The beauty of holiness</I> was the <I>beauty of the daughter of 
 Zion;</I> when the temple, that holy and beautiful house, was 
 destroyed, her beauty was gone; that was the breaking of <I>the staff 
 of beauty,</I> the taking away of the pledges and seals of the 
 covenant, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:10">Zech. xi. 10</A>.
 
 (5.) Their religious days were made a jest of
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>The adversaries saw her, and did mock at her sabbaths.</I> They 
 laughed at them for observing one day in seven as a day of rest from 
 worldly business. Juvenal, a heathen poet, ridicules the Jews in his 
 time for losing a seventh part of their time:--</P>

 <CENTER>
 <TABLE BORDER=0>
 <TR><TD>--------cui septima qu&aelig;que fuit lux
 <BR>Ignava et vit&aelig; partem non attigit ullam----
 <BR>They keep their sabbaths to their cost,
 <BR>For thus one day in sev'n is lost;
 </TD></TR>
 </TABLE>
 </CENTER>

 <P> 

 whereas sabbaths, if they be sanctified as they ought to be, will turn
 to a better account than all the days of the week besides. And whereas 
 the Jews professed that they did it in obedience to their God, and to 
 his honour, their adversaries asked them, "What do you get by it now? 
 What profit have you in keeping the ordinances of your God, who now 
 deserts you in your distress?" Note, it is a very great trouble to all 
 that love God to hear his ordinances mocked at, and particularly his 
 sabbaths. Zion calls them <I>her sabbaths,</I> for the sabbath was made 
 for men; they are his institutions, but they are her privileges; and 
 the contempt put upon sabbaths all the sons of Zion take to themselves 
 and lay to heart accordingly; nor will they look upon sabbaths, or any 
 other divine ordinances, as less honourable, nor value them less, for 
 their being mocked at. 

 (6.) That which greatly aggravated all these grievances was that her
 state at present was just the reverse of what it had been formerly,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Now, <I>in the days of affliction and misery,</I> when every thing was 
 black and dismal, <I>she remembers all her pleasant things that she had 
 in the days of old,</I> and now knows how to value them better than 
 formerly, when she had the full enjoyment of them. God often makes us
 know the worth of mercies by the want of them; and adversity is borne 
 with the greatest difficulty by those that have fallen into it from the 
 height of prosperity. This cut David to the heart, when he was banished 
 from God's ordinances, that he could remember when he <I>went with the 
 multitude to the house of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:4">Ps. xlii. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The sins of Jerusalem are here complained of as the procuring 
 provoking cause of all these calamities. Whoever are the instruments, 
 God is the author of all these troubles; it is <I>the Lord</I> that 
 <I>has afflicted her</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 and he has done it as a righteous Judge, for <I>she has sinned.</I> 

 1. Her sins are for number numberless. Are her troubles many? Her sins
 are many more. it is <I>for the multitude of her transgressions</I> 
 that <I>the Lord has afflicted her.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:14">Jer. xxx. 14</A>.

 When the transgressions of a people are multiplied we cannot say, as
 Job does in his own case, that <I>wounds are multiplied without 
 cause,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:17">Job ix. 17</A>.

 2. They are for nature exceedingly heinous

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Jerusalem has grievously sinned,</I> has <I>sinned sin</I> (so the 
 word is), sinned wilfully, deliberately, has sinned that sin which of 
 all others is the abominable things that the Lord hates, the sin of 
 idolatry. The sins of Jerusalem, that makes such a profession and 
 enjoys such privileges, are of all others the most grievous sins. She 
 has <I>sinned grievously</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),
 
 and therefore 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 she <I>came down wonderfully.</I> note, Grievous sins bring wondrous 
 ruin; there are some workers of iniquity to whom there is a strange 
 punishment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:3">Job xxxi. 3</A>.

 They are such sins as may plainly be read in the punishment.

 (1.) They have been very oppressive and therefore are justly oppressed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Judah has gone into captivity,</I> and it is <I>because of 
 affliction and great servitude,</I> because the rich among them 
 afflicted the poor and made them serve with rigour, and particularly 
 (as the Chaldee paraphrases it) because they had oppressed their Hebrew
 servants, which is charged upon them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:11">Jer. xxxiv. 11</A>.

 Oppression was one of their crying sins

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:6,7">Jer. vi. 6, 7</A>)

 and it is a sin that cries aloud.

 (2.) They have made themselves vile, and therefore are justly vilified.
 They all <I>despise her</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 for <I>her filthiness is in her skirts;</I> it appears upon her 
 garments that she has rolled them in the mire of sin. None could stain
 our glory if we did not stain it ourselves. 

 (3.) They have been very secure and therefore are justly surprised with
 this ruin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>She remembers not her last end;</I> she did not take the warning 
 that was given her to <I>consider her latter end,</I> to consider what 
 would be the end of such wicked courses as she took, and therefore she 
 <I>came down wonderfully,</I> in an astonishing manner, that she might 
 be made to feel what she would not fear; therefore God shall <I>make 
 their plagues wonderful.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Jerusalem's friends are here complained of as false and 
 faint-hearted, and very unkind: They <I>have all dealt treacherously 
 with her</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 so that, in effect, <I>they have become here enemies.</I> Her deceivers 
 have created her as much vexation as her destroyers. The staff that 
 breaks under us may do us as great a mischief as the <I>staff that 
 beats us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:6,7">Ezek. xxix. 6, 7</A>.

 <I>Her princes,</I> that should have protected her, have not courage
 enough to make head against the enemy for their own preservation; they 
 <I>are like harts,</I> that, upon the first alarm, betake themselves to 
 flight and make no resistance; nay, they <I>are like harts</I> that are 
 famished for want of <I>pasture,</I> and therefore <I>are gone without 
 strength before the pursuer,</I> and, having no strength for flight, 
 are soon run down and made a prey of. Her neighbours are unneighbourly,
 for,

 1. There is none <I>to help her</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 either they could not or they would not; nay, 

 2. <I>She has not comforter,</I> none to sympathize with her, or 
 suggest any thing to alleviate her griefs, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:7,9"><I>v.</I> 7, 9</A>.

 Like Job's friends, they saw it was to no purpose, her <I>grief was so 
 great;</I> and <I>miserable comforters were they all</I> in such a 
 case.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Jerusalem's God is here complained to concerning all these things, 
 and all is referred to his compassionate consideration 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>O Lord! behold my affliction,</I> and take cognizance of it;" and 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 "<I>See, O Lord! and consider,</I> take order about it." Note, The only 
 way to make ourselves easy under our burdens is to cast them upon God 
 first, and leave it to him to do with us as seemeth him good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  <I>Is it</I> nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see
 if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto
 me, wherewith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath afflicted <I>me</I> in the day of his
 fierce anger.
 &nbsp; 13  From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it
 prevaileth against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he
 hath turned me back: he hath made me desolate <I>and</I> faint all the
 day.
 &nbsp; 14  The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are
 wreathed, <I>and</I> come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to
 fall, the Lord hath delivered me into <I>their</I> hands, <I>from whom</I>
 I am not able to rise up.
 &nbsp; 15  The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty <I>men</I> in the
 midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my
 young men: the Lord hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of
 Judah, <I>as</I> in a winepress.
 &nbsp; 16  For these <I>things</I> I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down
 with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is
 far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy
 prevailed.
 &nbsp; 17  Zion spreadeth forth her hands, <I>and there is</I> none to
 comfort her: the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath commanded concerning Jacob, <I>that</I> his
 adversaries <I>should be</I> round about him: Jerusalem is as a
 menstruous woman among them.
 &nbsp; 18  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> is righteous; for I have rebelled against his
 commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow:
 my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.
 &nbsp; 19  I called for my lovers, <I>but</I> they deceived me: my priests
 and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought
 their meat to relieve their souls.
 &nbsp; 20  Behold, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; for I <I>am</I> in distress: my bowels are
 troubled; mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievously
 rebelled: abroad the sword bereaveth, at home <I>there is</I> as
 death.
 &nbsp; 21  They have heard that I sigh: <I>there is</I> none to comfort me:
 all mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that
 thou hast done <I>it:</I> thou wilt bring the day <I>that</I> thou hast
 called, and they shall be like unto me.
 &nbsp; 22  Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them,
 as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs
 <I>are</I> many, and my heart <I>is</I> faint.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The complaints here are, for substance, the same with those in the 
 foregoing part of the chapter; but in these verses the prophet, in the 
 name of the lamenting church, does more particularly acknowledge the 
 hand of god in these calamities, and the righteousness of his hand.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The church in distress here magnifies her affliction, and yet no 
 more than there was cause for; her groaning was not heavier than her 
 strokes. She appeals to all spectators: <I>See if there be any sorrow 
 like unto my sorrow,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 This might perhaps be truly said of Jerusalem's griefs; but we are apt 
 to apply it too sensibly to ourselves when we are in trouble and more 
 than there is cause for. Because we feel most from our own burden, and
 cannot be persuaded to reconcile ourselves to it, we are ready to cry 
 out, Surely never was <I>sorrow like unto our sorrow;</I> whereas, if 
 our troubles were to be thrown into a common stock with those of 
 others, and then an equal dividend made, share and share alike, rather 
 than stand to that we should each of us say, "Pray, give me my own 
 again."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. She here looks beyond the instruments to the author of her 
 troubles, and owns them all to be directed, determined, and disposed of 
 by him: "It is <I>the Lord</I> that <I>has afflicted me,</I> and he has 
 <I>afflicted me</I> because he is angry with me; the greatness of his 
 displeasure may be measured by the greatness of my distress; it is 
 <I>in the day of his fierce anger,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Afflictions cannot but be very much our griefs when we see them arising 
 from God's wrath; so the church does here.

 1. She is as one in a fever, and the fever is of God's sending: "<I>He 
 has sent fire into my bones</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 a preternatural heat, which <I>prevails against them,</I> so that they 
 are <I>burnt like a hearth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:3">Ps. cii. 3</A>),

 pained and wasted, and dried away." 

 2. She is as one in a net, which the more he struggles to get out of
 the more he is entangled in, and this net is of God's spreading. "The 
 enemies could not have succeeded in their stratagems had not God 
 <I>spread a net for my feet.</I>" 

 3. She is as one in a wilderness, whose way is embarrassed, solitary,
 and tiresome: "<I>He has turned me back,</I> that I cannot go on, 
 <I>has made me desolate,</I> that I have nothing to support me with, 
 but am <I>faint all the day.</I>" 

 4. She is as one in a yoke, not yoked for service, but for penance,
 tied neck and heels together

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand.</I> Observe, We 
 never are entangled in any yoke but what is framed out of our own 
 transgressions. The sinner is <I>holden with the cords of his own
 sins,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:22">Prov. v. 22</A>.

 The yoke of Christ's commands is an <I>easy yoke</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:30">Matt. xi. 30</A>),

 but that of our own transgressions is a heavy one. God is said to bind
 this yoke when he charges guilt upon us, and brings us into those 
 inward and outward troubles which our sins have deserved; when 
 conscience, as his deputy, binds us over to his judgment, then <I>the 
 yoke is bound</I> and <I>wreathed by the hand</I> of his justice, and 
 nothing but the hand of his pardoning mercy will unbind it. 

 5. She is as one in the dirt, and he it is that has <I>trodden under
 foot all her mighty men,</I> that has disabled them to stand, and 
 overthrown them by one judgment after another, and so left them to be 
 trampled upon by their proud conquerors,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Nay, she is as one in a wine-press, not only trodden down, but trodden 
 to pieces, crushed as grapes in the wine-press of God's wrath, and her 
 blood pressed out as wine, and it is God that has thus <I>trodden the 
 virgin, the daughter of Judah.</I> 

 6. She is in the hand of her enemies, and it is the Lord that has
 delivered her <I>into their hands</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>He has made my strength to fall,</I> so that <I>I am not able to</I> 
 make head against them; nay, not only not able to rise up against them, 
 but <I>not able to rise up</I> from them, and then <I>he has delivered 
 me into their hands;</I> nay 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 <I>he has called an assembly against me, to crush my young men,</I> and 
 such an assembly as it is in vain to think of opposing; and again 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 <I>The Lord has commanded concerning Jacob that his adversaries should
 be round about him.</I> He that has many a time <I>commanded 
 deliverances for Jacob</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:4">Ps. xliv. 4</A>)

 now commands an invasion against Jacob, because Jacob has disobeyed the
 commands of his law.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. She justly demands a share in the pity and compassion of those 
 that were the spectators of her misery 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 "<I>Is it nothing to you, all you that pass by?</I> Can you look upon 
 me without concern? What! are your hearts as adamants and your eyes as
 marbles, that you cannot bestow upon me one compassionate thought, or 
 look, or tear? Are not you also in the body? Is it nothing to you that 
 your neighbor's house is on fire?" There are those to whom Zion's 
 sorrows and ruins are nothing; they are not <I>grieved for the 
 affliction of Joseph.</I> How pathetically does she beg their 
 compassion! 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "<I>Hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow:</I> hear my 
 complaints, and see what cause I have for them." This is a request like 
 that of Job

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:21"><I>ch.</I> xix. 21</A>),

 <I>Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O you my friends!</I> It helps
 to make a burden sit lighter if our friends sympathize with us, and 
 mingle their tears with ours, for this is an evidence that, though we 
 are in affliction, we are not in contempt, which is commonly as much 
 dreaded in an affliction as any thing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. She justifies her own grief, though it was very extreme, for these 
 calamities 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 "<I>For these things I weep,</I> I weep in the night 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 when none sees; <I>my eye, my eye, runs down with water.</I>" Note, 
 This world is a vale of tears to the people of God. Zion's sons are
 often Zion's mourners. <I>Zion spreads forth her hands</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),
 
 which is here an expression rather of despair than of desire; she 
 flings out her hands as giving up all for gone. Let us see how she 
 accounts for this passionate grief. 

 1. Her God has withdrawn from her; and Micah, that had but gods of 
 gold, when they were stolen from him cried out, <I>What have I more? 
 And what is it that you say unto me? What aileth thee?</I> The church
 here grieves excessively; for, says she, <I>the comforter that should 
 relieve my soul is far from me.</I> God is the comforter; he used to be 
 so to her; he only can administer effectual comforts; it is his word 
 that speaks them; it is his Spirit that speaks them to us. His are
 strong consolations, able to <I>relieve the soul,</I> to <I>bring it 
 back</I> when it is gone, and we cannot of ourselves <I>fetch it 
 again;</I> but now he has departed in displeasure, he is <I>far from 
 me,</I> and beholds me <I>afar off.</I> Note, It is no marvel that the 
 souls of the saints faint away, when God, who is the only Comforter 
 that can relieve them, keeps at a distance. 

 2. Her children are removed from her, and are in no capacity to help
 her: it is for them that she weeps, as Rachel for hers, <I>because they 
 were not,</I> and therefore she <I>refuses to be comforted. Her 
 children were desolate, because the enemy prevailed</I> against them; 
 there is <I>none of all her sons to take her by the hand</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:18">Isa. li. 18</A>);

 they cannot help themselves, and how should they help her? Both the
 damsels and the youths, that were her joy and hope, <I>have gone into 
 captivity,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 It is said of the Chaldeans that they had <I>no compassion upon young 
 men nor maidens,</I> not on the fair sex, not on the blooming age, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:17">2 Chron. xxxvi. 17</A>.

 3. Her friends failed her; some would not and others could not give her
 any relief. She <I>spread forth her hands,</I> as begging relief, but
 <I>there is none to comfort her</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 none that can do it, none that cares to do it; she <I>called</I> for 
 her <I>lovers,</I> and, to engage them to help her, <I>called</I> them 
 her <I>lovers,</I> but they <I>deceived</I> her 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 they proved like the brooks in summer to the thirsty traveller, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:15">Job vi. 15</A>.

 Note, Those creatures that we set our hearts upon and raise our
 expectations from we are commonly deceived and disappointed in. Her 
 idols were her lovers. Egypt and Assyria were her confidants. But they
 deceived her. Those that made court to her in her prosperity were shy
 of her, and strange to her, in her adversity. Happy are those that
 have made God their friend and keep themselves in his love, for he will 
 not deceive them!

 4. Those whose office it was to guide her were disabled from doing her
 any service. The <I>priests</I> and the <I>elders,</I> that should have 
 appeared at the head of affairs, died for hunger

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);

 they <I>gave up the ghost,</I> or were ready to expire, <I>while they 
 sought their meat;</I> they went a begging for bread to keep them 
 alive. <I>The famine</I> is <I>sore</I> indeed <I>in the land</I> when 
 there is no bread to the wise, when priests and elders are starved. The 
 priests and elders should have been her comforters; but how should they 
 comfort others when they themselves were comfortless? "<I>They have 
 heard that I sigh,</I> which should have summoned them to my 
 assistance; but <I>there is none to comfort me. Lover and friend hast 
 thou put far from me.</I>" 

 5. Her enemies were too hard for her, and they insulted over her; they
 have <I>prevailed,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 <I>Abroad the sword bereaves</I> and slays all that comes in its way, 
 and <I>at home</I> all provisions are cut off by the besiegers, so that 
 <I>there is as death,</I> that is, famine, which is as bad as the 
 pestilence, or worse--<I>the sword without and terror within,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:25">Deut. xxxii. 25</A>.

 And as the enemies, that were the instruments of the calamity, were
 very barbarous, so were those that were the standers by, the Edomites 
 and Ammonites, that bore ill will to Israel: They have <I>heard of my 
 trouble, and are glad that thou hast done it</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>);

 they rejoice in the trouble itself; they rejoice that it is God's 
 doing; it pleases them to find that God and his Israel have fallen out, 
 and they act accordingly with a great deal of strangeness towards them.
 <I>Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them,</I> that they are 
 afraid of touching and are shy of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Upon all these accounts it cannot be wondered at, nor can she be 
 blamed, that <I>her sighs are many,</I> in grieving for what is, and 
 that <I>her heart is faint</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>)

 in fear of what is yet further likely to be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. She justifies God in all that is brought upon her, acknowledging 
 that her sins had deserved these severe chastenings. The yoke that lies 
 so heavily, and binds so hard, is <I>the yoke of her 
 transgressions,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 The fetters we are held in are of our own making, and it is with our 
 own rod that we are beaten. When the church had spoken here as if she 
 thought the Lord severe she does well to correct herself, at least to 
 explain herself, but acknowledging 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 <I>The Lord is righteous.</I> He does us no wrong in dealing thus with 
 us, nor can we charge him with any injustice in it; how unrighteous 
 soever men are, we are sure that the <I>Lord is righteous,</I> and 
 manifests his justice, though they contradict all the laws of theirs. 
 Note, Whatever our troubles are, which God is pleased to inflict upon 
 us, we must own that therein he <I>is righteous;</I> we understand 
 neither him nor ourselves if we do not own it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:6">2 Chron. xii. 6</A>.

 She owns the equity of God's actions, but owning the iniquity of her
 own: <I>I have rebelled against his commandments</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>);

 and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 <I>I have grievously rebelled.</I> We cannot speak ill enough of sin, 
 and we must always speak worst of our own sin, must call it 
 <I>rebellion, grievous rebellion;</I> and very grievous sins is to all 
 true penitents. It is this that lies more heavily upon her than the 
 afflictions she was under: "<I>My bowels are troubled;</I> they work 
 within me as the troubled sea; <I>my heart is turned within me,</I> is 
 restless, is turned upside down; <I>for I have grievously 
 rebelled.</I>" Note, Sorrow for our sin must be great sorrow and must 
 affect the soul.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. She appeals both to the mercy and to the justice of God in her 
 present case. 

 1. She appeals to the mercy of God concerning her own sorrows, which 
 had made her the proper object of his compassion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 "<I>Behold, O Lord! for I am in distress;</I> take cognizance of my 
 case, and take such order for my relief as thou pleasest." Note, It is 
 matter of comfort to us that the troubles which oppress our spirits are 
 open before God's eye. 

 2. She appeals to the justice of God concerning the injuries that her
 enemies did her

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>):

 "<I>Thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called,</I> the day that is 
 fixed in the counsels of God and published in the prophecies, when my 
 enemies, that now prosecute me, <I>shall be made like unto me,</I> when 
 the cup of trembling, now put into my hands, shall be put into theirs." 
 It may be read as a prayer, "Let the day appointed come," and so it 
 goes on, "<I>Let their wickedness come before thee,</I> let it come to 
 be remembered, let it come to be reckoned for; take vengeance on them 
 for all the wrongs they have done to me 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+109:14,15">Ps. cix. 14, 15</A>);

 hasten the time when thou wilt <I>do to them</I> for their
 transgressions <I>as thou hast done to me</I> for mine." This prayer 
 amounts to a protestation against all thoughts of a coalition with 
 them, and to a prediction of their ruin, subscribing to that which God 
 had in his word spoken of it. Note, Our prayers may and must agree
 with God's word; and what day God has here called we are to call for, 
 and no other. And though we are bound in charity to forgive our 
 enemies, and to pray for them, yet we may in faith pray for the 
 accomplishment of that which God has spoken against his and his 
 church's enemies, that will not repent to give him glory.</P>
