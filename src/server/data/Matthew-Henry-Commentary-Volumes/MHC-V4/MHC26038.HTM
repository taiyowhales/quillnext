 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter, and that which follows it, are concerning Gog and Magog, 
 a powerful enemy to the people of Israel, that should make a formidable 
 descent upon them, and put them into a consternation, but their army 
 should be routed and their design defeated; and this prophecy, it is 
 most probable, had its accomplishment some time after the return of the 
 people of Israel out of their captivity, whether in the struggles they 
 had with the kings of Syria, especially Antiochus Epiphanes, or perhaps 
 in some other way not recorded, we cannot tell. If the sacred history 
 of the Old Testament had reached as far as the prophecy, we should have 
 been better able to understand these chapters, but, for want of that 
 key, we are locked out of the meaning of them. God had by the prophet 
 assured his people of happy times after their return to their own land; 
 but lest they should mistake the promises which related to the kingdom 
 of the Messiah and the spiritual privileges of that the kingdom of the 
 Messiah and the spiritual privileges of that kingdom, as if from them 
 they might promise themselves an uninterrupted temporal prosperity, he 
 here tells them, as Christ told his disciples to prevent the like 
 mistake, that in the world they shall have tribulation, but they may be 
 of good cheer, for they shall be victorious at last. This prophecy here 
 of Gog and Magog is without doubt alluded to in that prophecy which 
 relates to the latter days, and which seems to be yet unfulfilled 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:8">Rev. xx. 8</A>),

 that Gog and Magog shall be gathered to battle against the camp of the
 saints, as the Old-Testament prophecies of the destruction of Babylon 
 are alluded to,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:1-24">Rev. xviii.</A>

 But, in both, the Old-Testament prophecies had their accomplishment in
 the Jewish church as the New-Testament prophecies shall have when the
 time comes in the Christian church. In this chapter we have intermixed,

 I. The attempt that Gog and Magog should make upon the land of Israel,
 the vast army they should bring into the field, and their vast
 preparations

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:4-7">ver. 4-7</A>),

 their project and design in it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:8-13">ver. 8-13</A>),

 God's hand in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:4">ver. 4</A>.

 II. The great terror that this should strike upon the land of Israel,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:15,16,18-20">ver. 15, 16, 18-20</A>.

 III. The divine restraint that these enemies should be under, and the 
 divine protection that Israel should be under, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:2-4,14">ver. 2-4 and ver. 14</A>.

 IV. The defeat that should be given to those enemies by the immediate
 hand of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:21-23">ver. 21-23</A>),

 which we shall hear more of in the next chapter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the
 chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him,
 &nbsp; 3  And say, Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Behold, I <I>am</I> against
 thee, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:
 &nbsp; 4  And I will turn thee back, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I
 will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and horsemen,
 all of them clothed with all sorts <I>of armour, even</I> a great
 company <I>with</I> bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords:
 &nbsp; 5  Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them; all of them with
 shield and helmet:
 &nbsp; 6  Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah of the north
 quarters, and all his bands: <I>and</I> many people with thee.
 &nbsp; 7  Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy
 company that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto
 them.
 &nbsp; 8  After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years
 thou shalt come into the land <I>that is</I> brought back from the
 sword, <I>and is</I> gathered out of many people, against the
 mountains of Israel, which have been always waste: but it is
 brought forth out of the nations, and they shall dwell safely all
 of them.
 &nbsp; 9  Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a
 cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy bands, and many people
 with thee.
 &nbsp; 10  Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; It shall also come to pass, <I>that</I>
 at the same time shall things come into thy mind, and thou shalt
 think an evil thought:
 &nbsp; 11  And thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled
 villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely,
 all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor
 gates,
 &nbsp; 12  To take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thine hand upon
 the desolate places <I>that are now</I> inhabited, and upon the people
 <I>that are</I> gathered out of the nations, which have gotten cattle
 and goods, that dwell in the midst of the land.
 &nbsp; 13  Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all
 the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to
 take a spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey? to
 carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to
 take a great spoil?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The critical expositors have enough to do here to enquire out Gog and 
 Magog. We cannot pretend either to add to their observations or to 
 determine their controversies. Gog seems to be the king and Magog the 
 kingdom; so that Gog and Magog are like Pharaoh and the Egyptians. Some 
 think they find them afar off, in Scythia, Tartary, and Russia. Others 
 think they find them nearer the land of Israel, in Syria, and Asia the 
 Less. Ezekiel is appointed to prophesy against Gog, and to tell him 
 that <I>God is against him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 Note, God does not only see those that are now the enemies of his 
 church and set himself against them, but he foresees those that will be 
 so and lets them know by his word that he is against them too, and yet 
 is pleased to make use of them to serve his own purposes, for the glory 
 of his own name; surely <I>their wrath</I> shall <I>praise him,</I> and 
 the <I>remainder thereof he will restrain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:10">Ps. lxxvi. 10</A>.

 Let us observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The confusion which God designed to put this enemy to. It is 
 remarkable that this is put first in the prophecy; before it is 
 foretold that God will <I>bring him forth</I> against Israel it is 
 foretold that God will <I>put hooks into his jaws</I> and <I>turn him 
 back</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 that they might have assurance of their deliverance before they had the 
 prospect given them of their danger. Thus tender is God of the comfort 
 of his people, thus careful that they may not be frightened; even 
 before the trouble begins he tells them it will end well.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The undertaking which he designed to engage him in, in order to 
 this defeat and disappointment. 

 1. The nations that shall be confederate in this enterprise against
 Israel are many, and great, and mighty

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>),

 <I>Persia, Ethiopia,</I> &c. Antiochus had an army made up of all the
 nations here named, and many others. These people had been at variance 
 with one another, and yet in combination against Israel. How are those 
 increased that trouble God's people! 

 2. They are well furnished with arms and ammunition, and bring a good 
 train of artillery into the field--<I>horses and horsemen</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)

 bravely equipped <I>with all sorts of armour, bucklers and shields</I> 
 for defence, <I>and all handling swords</I> for offence. Orders are 
 given to make all imaginable preparation for this expedition 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):
 
 "<I>Be thou prepared, and do thou prepare.</I> See what warlike 
 preparations thou hast already in store, and, lest that should not 
 suffice, make further preparation, <I>thou and all thy company,</I>" 
 Let Gog himself be a guard to the rest of the confederates. As 
 commander-in-chief, let him engage to take care of them and their 
 safety; let him pass his word for their security, and take them under 
 his particular protection. The leaders of an army, instead of exposing 
 their soldiers needlessly and presumptuously, and throwing away their 
 lives upon desperate undertakings, should study to be a guard to them, 
 and, whenever they send them forth in danger, should contrive to 
 support and cover them. This call to prepare seems to be
 ironical--<I>Do thy worst,</I> but I will <I>turn thee back;</I> like 
 that 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:9">Isa. viii. 9</A>.

 <I>Gird yourselves, and you shall be broken in pieces.</I>

 3. Their design is against <I>the mountains of Israel</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 against <I>the land that is brought back from the sword.</I> It is not 
 long since it was harassed with the sword of war, and it has been 
 always wasted, more or less, with one judgment or other; it is but 
 newly <I>gathered out of many people,</I> and <I>brought forth out of 
 the nations;</I> it has enjoyed comparatively but a short 
 breathing-time, has scarcely recovered any strength since it was 
 brought down by war and captivity; and therefore its neighbours need 
 not fear its being too great, nay, and therefore it is very barbarous 
 to pick a quarrel with it so soon. It is a people that <I>dwell safely, 
 all of them, in unwalled villages,</I> very secure, and <I>having 
 neither bars nor gates,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 It is a certain sign that they intend no mischief to their neighbours, 
 for they fear no mischief from them. It cannot be thought that those 
 will offend others who do not take care to defend themselves; and this 
 aggravates the sin of these invaders. It is base and barbarous to 
 <I>devise evil against thy neighbour while he dwells securely by 
 thee,</I> and has no distrust of thee, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:29">Prov. iii. 29</A>.

 But see here how <I>the clouds return after the rain</I> in this world, 
 and what little reason we have ever to be secure till we come to 
 heaven. It is not long since Israel was brought back from the sword of 
 one enemy, and behold the sword of another is drawn against it. Former 
 troubles will not excuse us from further troubles; but when we think we 
 have <I>put off the harness,</I> at least for some time, by a fresh and 
 sudden alarm we may be called to <I>gird it on again;</I> and therefore 
 we must never boast nor be off our guard. 

 4. That which the enemy has in view, in forming this project, is to 
 enrich himself and to make himself master, not of the country, but of 
 the wealth of it, to spoil and plunder it, and make a prey of it: <I>At 
 the same</I> time that God intends to bring this matter about <I>things 
 shall come into the mind</I> of this enemy, and <I>he shall think an 
 evil thought,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Note, All the mischief men do, and particularly the mischief they do to 
 the church of God, arises from evil thoughts that come into their mind, 
 ambitious thoughts, covetous thoughts, spiteful thoughts against those 
 that are good, for the sake of their goodness. It came into Antiochus's 
 mind what a singular people these religious Jews were, and how their 
 worship witnessed against and condemned the idolatries of their 
 neighbours, and therefore, in enmity to their religion, he would plague 
 them. It came into his mind what a wealthy people they were, that they 
 had <I>gotten cattle and goods in the midst of the land</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),
 
 and withal how weak they were, how unable to make any resistance, how 
 easy it would be to carry off what they had, and how much glory this 
 rapine would add to his victorious sword; these things coming into his 
 mind, and one evil thought drawing on another, he came at last to this 
 resolve 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>):

 "<I>I will go up to the land of unwalled villages;</I> yea, that I 
 will; it will cost me nothing to make them all my own. I will go and 
 disturb <I>those that are at rest,</I> without giving them any notice, 
 not to crush their growing greatness, or chastise their insolence, or 
 make reprisals upon them for any wrong they have done us (they had none 
 of these pretences to make war upon them), but purely <I>to take a 
 spoil and to take a prey</I>" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 in open defiance to all the laws of justice and equity, as much as the 
 highwayman's killing the traveller that he may take his money. These 
 were the thoughts that came into the mind of this wicked prince, and 
 God knew them; nay, he knew them before they came into his mind, for he 
 <I>understands our thoughts afar off,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:2">Ps. cxxxix. 2</A>.

 5. According to the project thus formed he pours in all his forces
 upon the land of Israel, and finds those that are ready to come in to 
 his assistance with the same prospects

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>Thou shalt ascent and come like a storm,</I> with all the force, 
 and fury, and fierceness imaginable, and <I>thou shalt be like a cloud 
 to cover the land,</I> to darken it, and to threaten it, <I>thou 
 and</I> not only <I>all thy bands,</I> all the force thou canst bring 
 into the field, but <I>many people with thee</I>" (such as are spoken 
 of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 "<I>Sheba and Dedan,</I> the Arabians and the Edomites, <I>and the 
 merchants of Tarshish,</I> of Tyre and Sidon and other maritime cities, 
 they and their <I>young lions</I> that are greedy of spoil and live 
 upon it, <I>shall say, Hast thou come to take the spoil</I> of this 
 land?" Yes he has; and therefore they wish him success. Or perhaps they 
 envy him, or grudge it to him. "Hast thou come for riches who art 
 thyself so rich already?" Or, knowing that God was on Israel's side, 
 they thus ridicule his attempts, foreseeing that they would be baffled 
 and that he would be disappointed of the prey he promised himself. Or, 
 if he come to <I>take the prey,</I> they will come and join with him, 
 and add to his forces. When Lysias, who was general of Antiochus's
 army, came against the Jews, the neighbouring nations joined with him 

 (<U>1 Mac. iii. 41</U>),

 to share in the guilt, in hopes to share in the prey. <I>When thou
 sawest a thief then thou consentedst with him.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith
 the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth
 safely, shalt thou not know <I>it?</I>
 &nbsp; 15  And thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts,
 thou, and many people with thee, all of them riding upon horses,
 a great company, and a mighty army:
 &nbsp; 16  And thou shalt come up against my people of Israel, as a
 cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I
 will bring thee against my land, that the heathen may know me,
 when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.
 &nbsp; 17  Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; <I>Art</I> thou he of whom I have spoken
 in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, which
 prophesied in those days <I>many</I> years that I would bring thee
 against them?
 &nbsp; 18  And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall
 come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, <I>that</I> my
 fury shall come up in my face.
 &nbsp; 19  For in my jealousy <I>and</I> in the fire of my wrath have I
 spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the
 land of Israel;
 &nbsp; 20  So that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven,
 and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep
 upon the earth, and all the men that <I>are</I> upon the face of the
 earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be
 thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall
 shall fall to the ground.
 &nbsp; 21  And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my
 mountains, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>: every man's sword shall be against
 his brother.
 &nbsp; 22  And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood;
 and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many
 people that <I>are</I> with him, an overflowing rain, and great
 hailstones, fire, and brimstone.
 &nbsp; 23  Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will
 be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I
 <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This latter part of the chapter is a repetition of the former; the 
 dream is doubled, for the thing is certain and to be very carefully 
 regarded.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It is here again foretold that this spiteful enemy should make a 
 formidable descent upon the land of Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 "<I>Thou shalt come out of the north parts</I> (Syria lay on the north 
 of Canaan) with <I>a mighty army,</I> shalt come like <I>a cloud,</I> 
 and <I>cover the land of my people Israel,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 These words 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 <I>When my people Israel dwell safely, shalt thou not know it?</I> may 
 be taken two ways:--

 1. As intimating his inducements to this attempt. "Thou shalt have
 intelligence brought thee how securely, and therefore how carelessly, 
 the people of Israel dwell, which shall give rise to thy project 
 against them; for when thou knowest not only what a rich, but what an 
 easy prey they are likely to be, thou wilt soon determine to fall upon 
 them" Note, God's providence is to be acknowledged in the occasion, the 
 small occasion perhaps, that is given, and that not designedly neither, 
 to those first thoughts from which great enterprises take their 
 original. God, to bring about his own purposes, lets men know that 
 which yet he knows they will make a bad use of, as here. Or,

 2. As intimating his disappointment in this attempt, which here, as 
 before, the prophecy begins with: "<I>When my people Israel dwell 
 safely,</I> not in their own apprehension only, but in reality, 
 forasmuch as they dwell safely under the divine protection, shalt not 
 thou be made to know it by the fruitlessness of thy endeavours to 
 destroy them?" Thou shalt soon find that there is <I>no enchantment 
 against Jacob,</I> that <I>no weapon formed against them shall 
 prosper;</I> thou shalt know to thy cost, shalt know to thy shame, that 
 though they have no walls, nor bars, nor gates, they have God himself, 
 a <I>wall of fire, round about them,</I> and that he who <I>touches 
 them touches the apple of his eye;</I> whosoever meddles with them 
 meddles to his own hurt. And it is for the demonstrating of this to all 
 the world that God will bring this mighty enemy against his people.
 Those that <I>gathered themselves against Israel</I> said, <I>Let us 
 take the spoil and take they prey,</I> but they <I>knew not the 
 thoughts of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+4:11,12">Mic. iv. 11, 12</A>.

 <I>I will bring thee against my land.</I> This is strange news, that
 God will not only permit his enemies to come against his own children, 
 but will himself bring them; but, if we understand what he aims at, we 
 shall be well reconciled even to this: it is "<I>that the heathen may 
 know me</I> to be the only living and true God <I>when I shall be 
 sanctified in thee,</I> O Gog! that is, in thy defeat and destruction
 <I>before their eyes,</I> that all the nations may see, and say, 
 <I>There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, that rides on the 
 heavens for the help of his people.</I>" Note, God brings his people 
 into danger and distress that he may have the honour of bringing about 
 their deliverance, and suffers the enemies of his church to prevail 
 awhile, though they profane his name by their sin, that he may have the 
 honour of prevailing at last and sanctifying his own name in their 
 ruin. Now it is said, This shall be <I>in the latter days,</I> namely, 
 in the latter days of the Old-Testament church; so the mischief that 
 Antiochus did to Israel was; but in the latter days of the 
 New-Testament church another like enemy should arise, that should in 
 like manner be defeated. Note, Effectual securities are treasured up in 
 the word of God against the troubles and dangers the church may be 
 brought into a great while hence, even in the latter days.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Reference is herein had to the predictions of the former prophets 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>Art thou he of whom I have spoken in old time,</I> of whom Moses 
 spoke in his prophecy of the latter days 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:43">Deut. xxxii. 43</A>,

 <I>He will render vengeance to his adversaries),</I> and David,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:15">Ps. ix. 15</A>

 (<I>The heathen are sunk down into the pit that they made</I>) and
 often elsewhere in the Psalms? This is the leviathan of whom Isaiah 
 spoke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:1">Isa. xxvii. 1</A>),
 
 that congress of the nations of which Joel spoke, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:1">Joel iii. 1</A>.

 Many of the prophets had perhaps spoken particularly of this event,
 though it be not written, as they all had spoken and written too that 
 which is applicable to it. Note, There is an amiable admirable harmony 
 and agreement between the Lord's prophets, though they lived in several 
 ages, for they were all guided by one and the same Spirit.</P>

 III. It is here foretold that this furious formidable enemy should be 
 utterly cut off in this attempt upon Israel, and that it should issue 
 in his own ruin. This is supposed by many to have its accomplishment in 
 the many defeats given by the Maccabees to the forces of Antiochus and 
 the remarkable judgments of God executed upon his own person, for he 
 died of sore diseases. But these things are here foretold, as usual, in 
 figurative expressions, which we are not to look for the literal 
 accomplishment of, and yet they might be fulfilled nearer the letter 
 than we know of. 

 1. God will be highly displeased with this bold invader: <I>When he
 comes up</I> in pride and anger <I>against the land of Israel,</I> and 
 thinks to carry all before him with a high hand, then <I>God's fury 
 shall come up in his face,</I> which is an allusion to the manner of 
 men, whose colour rises in their faces when some high affront is 
 offered them and they are resolved to show their resentment of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 God will speak against them in his <I>jealousy</I> for his people and 
 in <I>the fire of his wrath</I> against his and their enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.
 
 See how God's permitting sin, his laying occasions of sin before men, 
 and his making use of it to serve his own purposes, consist with his 
 hatred of sin and his displeasure against it. God <I>brings this enemy 
 against his land,</I> letting him know what an easy prey it might be 
 and determining thereby to glorify himself; and yet, <I>when he comes 
 against the land,</I> God's <I>fury comes up,</I> and <I>he speaks to 
 him in the fire of his wrath.</I> If any ask, Why does he thus find 
 fault? for who has resisted his will? It is easy to answer, <I>Nay, 
 but, O man! who art thou that repliest against God?</I> 

 2. His forces shall be put into the greatest confusion and 
 consternation imaginable

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>There shall be a great shaking of</I> them <I>in the land of 
 Israel,</I> a universal concussion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 such as shall affect the <I>fishes</I> and <I>fowls,</I> the 
 <I>beasts</I> and <I>creeping things,</I> and much more <I>the men that 
 are upon the face of the earth,</I> who sooner receive impressions of 
 fear. There shall be such an earthquake as shall <I>throw down</I> the 
 <I>mountains,</I> those natural heights, and the <I>steep places,</I> 
 towers and <I>walls,</I> those artificial heights; they shall all 
 <I>fall to the ground.</I> Some understand this of the fright which the 
 land of Israel should be put into by the fury of the enemy. But it is 
 rather to be understood of the fright which the enemy should be put 
 into by the wrath of God; all those things which they both raise 
 themselves and stay themselves upon shall be shaken down, and their 
 hearts shall fail them. 

 3. He shall be routed and utterly ruined; both earth and heaven shall
 be armed against him

 (1.) The earth shall muster up its forces to destroy him. If the people 
 of Israel have not strength and courage to resist him, God will <I>call 
 for a sword against him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 And he has swords always at command, that are <I>bathed in heaven,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:5">Isa. xxxv. 5</A>.

 Throughout all the mountains of Israel, where he hoped to meet with 
 spoil to enrich him, he shall meet with swords to destroy him, and, 
 rather than fail, <I>every man's sword shall be against his 
 brother,</I> as in <I>the day of Midian,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:9">Ps. lxxxiii. 9</A>.

 The great men of Syria shall undermine and overthrow one another, shall
 accuse one another, shall fight duels with one another. Note, God can, 
 and often does, make the destroyers of his people to be their own 
 destroyers and the destroyers of one another. However, he will himself
 be their destroyer, will take the work into his own hand, that it may 
 be done thoroughly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>I will plead against him with pestilence and blood.</I> Note, Whom 
 God acts against he pleads against; he shows them the ground of his 
 controversy with them, that their mouths may be stopped, and he may be 
 clear when he judges. 

 (2.) The artillery of heaven shall also be drawn out against them: <I>I 
 will rain upon him an overflowing rain,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 He comes like a storm upon Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 But God will come like a storm upon him, will rain upon him <I>great 
 hailstones</I> as upon the Canaanites 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:11">Josh. x. 11</A>),

 fire and brimstone as upon Sodom, and a <I>horrible tempest,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+11:6">Ps. xi. 6</A>.

 Thus the Gog and Magog in the New Testament shall be devoured with
 <I>fire from heaven,</I> and cast into the <I>lake of brimstone,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:9,10">Rev. xx. 9, 10</A>.
 
 That will be the everlasting portion of all the impenitent implacable 
 enemies of God's church and people. 

 4. God, in all this, will be glorified. The end he aimed at

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)
 
 shall be accomplished 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):
 
 <I>Thus will I magnify myself and sanctify myself.</I> Note, In the 
 destruction of sinners God makes it to appear that he is a great and 
 holy God, and he will do so to eternity. And, if men do not magnify and 
 sanctify him as they ought, he will magnify himself, and sanctify 
 himself; and this we should desire and pray for daily, <I>Father, 
 glorify thy own name.</I></P>
