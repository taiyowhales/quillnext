 In this chapter, after the preamble of the prophecy, we have,

 I. A reproof of the people of the Jews for their dilatoriness and 
 slothfulness in building the temple, which had provoked God to contend 
 with them by the judgment of famine and scarcity, with an exhortation 
 to them to resume that good work and to prosecute it in good earnest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:1-11">ver. 1-11</A>.

 II. The good success of this sermon, appearing in the people's return
 and close application to that work, wherein the prophet, in God's name, 
 animated and encouraged them, assuring them that God was with them,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in
 the first day of the month, came the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> by Haggai
 the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of
 Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest,
 saying,
 &nbsp; 2 Thus speaketh the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, saying, This people say, The
 time is not come, the time that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s house should be built.
 &nbsp; 3 Then came the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> by Haggai the prophet, saying,
 &nbsp; 4 <I>Is it</I> time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houses,
 and this house <I>lie</I> waste?
 &nbsp; 5 Now therefore thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts; Consider your
 ways.
 &nbsp; 6 Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have
 not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe
 you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth
 wages <I>to put it</I> into a bag with holes.
 &nbsp; 7 Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts; Consider your ways.
 &nbsp; 8 Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house;
 and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 9 Ye looked for much, and, lo, <I>it came</I> to little; and when ye
 brought <I>it</I> home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of
 hosts. Because of mine house that <I>is</I> waste, and ye run every
 man unto his own house.
 &nbsp; 10 Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the
 earth is stayed <I>from</I> her fruit.
 &nbsp; 11 And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the
 mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the
 oil, and upon <I>that</I> which the ground bringeth forth, and upon
 men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It was the complaint of the Jews in Babylon that they <I>saw not their 
 signs,</I> and there was <I>no more prophet</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:9">Ps. lxxiv. 9</A>),

 which was a just judgment upon them for mocking and misusing the
 prophets. We read of no prophets they had in their return, as they had 
 in their coming out of Egypt,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:13">Hos. xii. 13</A>.

 God stirred them up immediately by his Spirit to exert themselves in
 that escape

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:5">Ezra i. 5</A>);

 for, though God makes use of prophets, he needs them not, he can do his
 work without them. But the lamp of Old-Testament prophecy shall yet
 make some bright and glorious efforts before it expire; and Haggai is 
 the first that appears under the character of a special messenger from 
 heaven, when the <I>word of the Lord</I> had been long <I>precious</I> 
 (as when prophecy began,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:1">1 Sam. iii. 1</A>)

 and <I>there had been no open vision.</I> In the reign of Darius
 Hystaspes, the third of the Persian kings, in the second year of his 
 reign, this prophet was sent; and the word of the Lord came to him, and 
 came by him to the leading men among the Jews, who are here named,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 
 The chief governor, 

 1. In the state; that was <I>Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel,</I> of 
 the house of David, who was commander-in-chief of the Jews, in their 
 return out of captivity. 

 2. In the church; and that was <I>Joshua the son of Josedech,</I> who
 was now <I>high priest.</I> They were great men and good men, and yet 
 were to be stirred up to their duty when they grew remiss. What the 
 people also were faulty in they must be told of, that they might use 
 their power and interest for the mending of it. The prophets, who were 
 extraordinary messengers, did not go about to set aside the ordinary 
 institutions of magistracy and ministry, but endeavoured to render both 
 more effectual for the ends to which they were appointed, for both 
 ought to be supported. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What the sin of the Jews was at this time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 As soon as they came up out of captivity they set up an altar for 
 sacrifice, and within a year after laid the foundations of a temple, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:10">Ezra iii. 10</A>.

 They then seemed very forward in it, and it was likely enough that the
 work would be done suddenly; but, being served with a prohibition some 
 time after from the Persian court, and charged not to go on with it, 
 they not only yielded to the force, when they were actually under it, 
 which might be excused, but afterwards, when the violence of the 
 opposition had abated, they continued very indifferent to it, had no 
 spirit nor courage to set about it again, but seemed glad that they had 
 a pretence to let it stand still. Though those who are employed for God 
 may be driven off from their work by a storm, yet they must return to 
 it as soon as the storm is over. These Jews did not do so, but 
 continued loitering until they were afresh reminded of their duty. And 
 that which they suggested one to another was, <I>The time has not come, 
 the time that the Lord's house should be built;</I> that is,

 1. "Our time has not come for the doing of it, because we have not yet
 recovered, after our captivity; our losses are not repaired, nor have 
 we yet got before-hand in the world. It is too great an undertaking
 for new beginners in the world, as we are; let us first get our own 
 houses up, before we talk of building churches, and in the mean time 
 let a bare altar serve us, as it did our father Abraham." They did not 
 say that they would not build a temple at all, but, "Not yet; it is all 
 in good time." Note, Many a good work is put by by being put off, as 
 Felix put off the prosecution of his convictions to a more convenient 
 season. They do not say that they will never repent, and reform, and
 be religious, but, "Not yet." And so the great business we were sent 
 into the world to do is not done, under pretence that it is all in good 
 time to go about it. 

 2. "God's time has not come for the doing of it; for (say they) the
 restraint laid upon us by authority in a legal way is not broken off, 
 and therefore we ought not to proceed, though there be a present 
 connivance of authority." Note, There is an aptness in us to 
 misinterpret providential discouragements in our duty, as if they 
 amounted to a discharge from our duty, when they are only intended for 
 the trial and exercise of our courage and faith. It is bad to neglect 
 our duty, but it is worse to vouch Providence for the patronising of 
 our neglects.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What the judgments of God were by which they were punished for this 
 neglect, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:6,9-11"><I>v.</I> 6, 9-11</A>.

 They neglected the building of God's house, and put that off, that they 
 might have time and money for their secular affairs. They desired to be 
 excused from such an expensive piece of work under this pretence, that 
 they must provide for their families; their children must have meat and 
 portions too, and, until they have got before-hand in the world, they 
 cannot think of rebuilding the temple. Now, that the punishment might 
 answer to the sin, God by his providence kept them still behind-hand, 
 and that poverty which they thought to prevent by not building the 
 temple God brought upon them for not building it. They were sensible of 
 the smart of the judgment, and every one complained of the unseasonable 
 weather, the great losses they sustained in their corn and cattle, and 
 the decay of trade; but they were not sensible of the cause of the 
 judgment, and the ground of God's controversy with them. They did not, 
 or would not, see and own that it was for their putting off the 
 building of the temple that they lay under these manifest tokens of 
 God's displeasure; and therefore God here gives them notice that this 
 is that for which he contended with them. Note, We need the help of 
 God's prophets and ministers to expound to us, not only the judgments 
 of God's mouth, but the judgments of his hands, that we may understand 
 his mind and meaning in his rod as well as in his word, to discover to 
 us not only wherein we have offended God, but wherein God shows himself 
 offended at us. Let us observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How God contended with them. He did not send them into captivity 
 again, nor bring a foreign enemy upon them, as they deserved, but took 
 the correcting of them into his own hands; for his mercies are great. 
 
 (1.) He that <I>gives seed to the sower</I> denied his blessing upon
 the <I>seed sown,</I> and then it never prospered; they had nothing, or
 next to nothing, from it. <I>They sowed much</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 kept a great deal of ground in tillage, which, they might expect, would 
 turn to a better advantage than usual, because their land had long 
 <I>lain fallow</I> and had <I>enjoyed its sabbaths.</I> Having sown 
 much, they looked for much from it, enough to spend and enough to spare 
 too; but they were disappointed: <I>They bring in little,</I> very 
 little 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 when they have made the utmost of it, <I>it comes to little</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);
 
 it did not yield as they expected. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:10">Isa. v. 10</A>,

 <I>The seed of a homer shall yield an ephah,</I> a bushel's sowing
 shall yield a peck. Note, Our expectations from the creature are often
 most frustrated when they are most raised; and then, when we look for
 much, it comes to little, that our expectation may be from God only, in
 whom it will be outdone. We are here told how they came to be
 disappointed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>The heaven over you is stayed from dew;</I> he that has the key of 
 the clouds in his hands shut them up, and withheld the rain when the 
 ground called for it, the former or the latter rain, and then of course 
 <I>the earth is stayed from her fruit;</I> for, if the heaven be as 
 brass, the earth is as iron. The corn perhaps came up very well, and 
 promised a very plentiful crop, but, for want of the dews at 
 earing-time, it never filled, but was parched with the heat of the sun 
 and withered away. The restored captives, who had long been kept bare 
 in Babylon, thought they should never want when they had got their own 
 land in possession again and had that at command. But what the better 
 are they for it, unless they had the clouds at command too? God will
 make us sensible of our necessary and constant dependence upon him, 
 throughout all the links in the chain of second causes, from first to 
 last; so that we can at no time say, "Now we have no further occasion 
 for God and his providence." See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:21">Hos. ii. 21</A>.

 But God not only withheld the cooling rains, but he appointed the
 scorching heats

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>I called for a drought upon the land,</I> ordered the weather to be
 extremely hot, and then the fruits of the earth were burnt up. See how
 every creature is that to us which God makes it to be, either 
 comfortable or afflictive, serving us or incommoding us. Nothing among 
 the inferior creatures is so necessary and beneficial to the world as 
 the heat of the sun; it is that which puts life into the plants and 
 <I>renews the face of the earth at</I> spring. And yet, if that go into 
 an extreme, it undoes all again. Our Creator is our best friend; but, 
 if we make him our enemy, we make the best friends we have among the 
 creatures our enemies too. This drought God called for, and it came at 
 the call; as the winds and the waves, so the rays of the sun, obey him.
 It was universal, and the ill effects of it were general; it was a 
 drought <I>upon the mountains,</I> which, lying high, were first 
 affected with it. The mountains were their pasture-grounds, and used to 
 be <I>covered over with flocks,</I> but now there was no grass for 
 them. It was <I>upon the corn, the new wine, and the oil;</I> all 
 failed through the extremity of the hot weather, even <I>all that the 
 ground brought forth;</I> it all withered. Nay, it had a bad influence 
 upon men; the hot weather enfeebled some, and made them weary and 
 faint, and spent their spirits; it inflamed others, and put them into 
 fevers. It should seem, it brought diseases upon cattle too. In short, 
 it spoiled <I>all the labour of their hands,</I> which they hoped to 
 eat of and maintain their families by. Note, Meat for the belly is meat 
 that perishes, and, if we labour for that only, we are in danger of 
 losing our labour; but we are sure <I>our labour shall not be in vain 
 in the Lord</I> if we labour for <I>the meat which endures to eternal 
 life.</I> For the <I>hand of the diligent,</I> in the business of 
 religion, will infallibly <I>make rich,</I> whereas, in the business of 
 this life, the most solicitous and the most industrious often lose the 
 labour of their hands. <I>The race is not to the swift, nor the battle 
 to the strong.</I> 

 (2.) He that gives <I>bread to the eater</I> denied his blessing upon 
 the bread they ate, and then that did not nourish them. The cause of 
 the withering and failing of the corn in the field was visible--it was 
 for want of rain; but, besides that, there was a secret blast and curse 
 attending that which they brought home.

 [1.] When they had it in the barn they were not sure of it: <I>I did 
 blow upon it, saith the Lord of hosts</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 and that withered it, as buds are sometimes blasted in the spring by a
 nipping frost, which we see the effects of, but know not the way of. 
 <I>I did blow it away;</I> so the margin reads it. When men have heaped 
 wealth together God can scatter it with the breath of his mouth as 
 easily as we can blow away a feather. Note, We can never be sure of any 
 thing in this world; it is exposed, not only when it is in the field, 
 but when it is housed; for there <I>moth and rust corrupt,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:19">Matt. vi. 19</A>.

 And, if we would have the comfort and continuance of our temporal
 enjoyments, we must make God our friend; for, if he bless them to us, 
 they are blessings indeed, but if he blow upon them we can expect no 
 good from them: they <I>make themselves wings and fly away.</I>

 [2.] When they had it upon the board it was not that to them that they 
 expected: "<I>You eat, but you have not enough,</I> either because the 
 meat is washy, and not satisfying, or because the stomach is greedy, 
 and not satisfied. You eat, but you have no good digestion, and so are 
 not nourished by it, nor does it answer the end, or you have not enough 
 because you are not content, nor think it enough. <I>You drink,</I> but 
 are not cooled and refreshed by it; <I>you are not filled with 
 drink;</I> you are stinted, and have not enough to quench your thirst.
 The <I>new wine is cut off from your mouth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:5">Joel i. 5</A>),

 nay, and you <I>drink your water</I> too by <I>measure and with
 astonishment;</I> you have no comfort of it, because you have no plenty 
 of it, but are still in fear of falling short."

 [3.] That which they had upon their backs did them no good there: 
 "<I>You clothe yourselves, but there is none warm;</I> your clothes 
 soon wear out, and wax old, and grow thin, because God blows upon 
 them," contrary to what Israel's did in the wilderness when God blessed 
 them. It is God that <I>makes our garments warm upon</I> us, when he 
 <I>quiets the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:17">Job xxxvii. 17</A>.

 [4.] That which they had in their bags, which was not laid out, but 
 laid up, they were not sure of: "<I>He that earns wages</I> by hard 
 labour, and has it paid him in ready current money, <I>puts it into a 
 bag with holes;</I> it drops through, and wastes away insensibly. Every 
 thing is so scarce and dear that they spend their money as fast as they 
 get it." Those that lay up their treasure on earth put it into a bag 
 with holes; they lose it as they go along, and those that come after 
 them pick it up. But, if we lay up our treasure in heaven, we provide 
 for ourselves <I>bags that wax not old,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:33">Luke xii. 33</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Observe wherefore God thus contended with them, and stopped the 
 current of the favours promised them at their return 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:24">Joel ii. 24</A>);

 they provoked him to do it: <I>It is because of my house that is
 waste.</I> This is the quarrel God has with them. The foundation of the
 temple is laid, but the building does not go on. "Every man <I>runs to
 his own house,</I> to finish that, and to make that convenient and
 fine, and no care is taken about the Lord's house; and therefore it is
 that God crosses you thus in all your affairs, to testify his
 displeasure against you for that neglect, and to bring you to a sense
 of your sin and folly." Note, As those who seek first the kingdom of
 God and the righteousness thereof shall not only find them, but are
 most likely to have other things added to them, so those who neglect
 and postpone those things will not only lose them, but will justly have
 other things taken away from them. And if God cross us in our temporal
 affairs, and we meet with trouble and disappointment, we shall find
 this is the cause of it, the work we have to do for God and our own
 souls is left undone, and we <I>seek our own things more than the
 things of Jesus Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:21">Phil. ii. 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The reproof which the prophet gives them for their neglect of the 
 temple-work 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>Is it time for you, O you! to dwell in your ceiled houses,</I> to
 have them beautified and adorned, and your families settled in them?" 
 They were not content with walls and roofs for necessity, but they must 
 have for gaiety and fancy. "It is high time," says one, "that my house 
 were wainscoted." "It is high time," says another, "that mine were 
 painted." And God's house, all this time, <I>lies waste,</I> and 
 nothing is done at it. "What!" says the prophet, "is it time that you 
 should have your humour pleased, and not time you should have your God 
 pleased?" How much was their disposition the reverse of David's, who 
 could not be easy in his <I>house of cedar</I> while the <I>ark of 
 God</I> was <I>in curtains</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:2">2 Sam. vii. 2</A>),

 and of Solomon's, who built the temple of God before he built a palace
 for himself. Note, Those are very much strangers to their own interest 
 who prefer the conveniences and ornaments of the temporal life before 
 the absolute necessities of the spiritual life, who are full of care to 
 enrich their own houses, while God's temple in their hearts lies waste, 
 and nothing is done for it or in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The good counsel which the prophet gives to those who thus despised 
 God, and whom God was therefore justly displeased with. 

 1. He would have them reflect: <I>Now therefore consider your ways,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>

 and again

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 "Be sensible of the hand of God gone out against you, and enquire into
 the reason; think what you have done that has provoked God thus to 
 break in upon your comforts; and think what you will do to testify your 
 repentance, that God may return in mercy to you." Note, It is the great 
 concern of every one of us to consider our ways, to <I>set our hearts 
 to our ways</I> (so the word is), to <I>think on our ways</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:59">Ps. cxix. 59</A>),

 to <I>search</I> and <I>try</I> them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:40">Lam. iii. 40</A>),

 to <I>ponder the path of our feet</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:26">Prov. iv. 26</A>),

 to apply our minds with all seriousness to the great and necessary duty
 of self-examination, and communing with our own hearts concerning our 
 spiritual state, our sins that are past, and our duty for the future; 
 for sin is what we must answer for, duty is what we must do; about 
 these therefore we must be inquisitive, rather than about events, which 
 we must leave to God. Many are quick-sighted to pry into other people's 
 ways who are very careless of their own; whereas our concern is to 
 <I>prove every one his own work,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:4">Gal. vi. 4</A>.

 2. He would have them reform

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>Go up to the mountain,</I> to Lebanon, <I>and bring wood,</I> and
 other materials that are wanting, <I>and build the house</I> with all 
 speed; put it off no longer, but set to it in good earnest." Note, Our 
 considering our ways must issue in the amending of whatever we find 
 amiss in them. If any duty has been long neglected, that is not a 
 reason why it should still be so, but why now at length it should be 
 revived; better late than never. For their encouragement to apply in 
 good earnest to this work, he assures them, 

 (1.) That they should be accepted of him in it: <I>Build the house, and 
 I will take pleasure in it;</I> and that was encouragement enough for 
 them to apply to it with alacrity and resolution, and to go through 
 with it, whatever it cost them. Note, Whatever God will take pleasure 
 in, when it is done, we ought to take pleasure in the doing of, and to 
 reckon that inducement enough to set about it, and go on with it in 
 good earnest; for what greater satisfaction can we have in our own 
 bosoms than in contributing any thing towards that which God will take 
 pleasure in? It ought to be the top of our ambition to be <I>accepted 
 of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:9">2 Cor. v. 9</A>.

 Though they had foolishly neglected the house of God, yet, if at length
 they will resume the care of it, God will not remember against them 
 their former neglects, but will take pleasure in the work of their 
 hands. Those who have long deferred their return to God, if at length 
 they return with all their heart, must not despair of his favour.

 (2.) That he would be honoured by them in it: <I>I will be glorified,
 saith the Lord.</I> He will be served and worshipped in the temple when 
 it is built, and sanctified in those that come nigh to him. It is
 worth while to bestow all possible care, and pains, and cost, upon that 
 by which God may be glorified.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12 Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of

 obeyed the voice of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> their God, and the words of Haggai
 the prophet, as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> their God had sent him, and the people

 &nbsp; 14 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of

 <I>As an ear-ring of gold</I> (says Solomon), and <I>an ornament of 
 fine gold, so</I> amiable, so acceptable, in the sight of God and man, 
 <I>is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:12">Prov. xxv. 12</A>.

 The prophet here was a wise but faithful reprover, in God's name, and
 he met with an obedient ear. The foregoing sermon met with the desired 
 success among the people, and their obedience met with due 
 encouragement from God. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How the people returned to God in a way of duty. All those to whom 
 that sermon was preached received the word in the love of it, and were 
 wrought upon by it. Zerubbabel, the chief governor, did not think 
 himself above the check and command of God's word. He was a man that 
 had been eminently useful in his day, and serviceable to the interest 
 of the church, yet did not plead his former merits in answer to this 
 reproof for his present remissness, but submitted to it. Joshua's 
 business, as high priest, was to teach, and yet he was willing himself 
 to be taught, and willingly received admonition and instruction. <I>The 
 remnant of the people</I> (and the whole body of them was but a 
 remnant, a very few of the many thousands of Israel) also were very 
 pliable; they all <I>obeyed the voice of the Lord their God,</I> and 
 bowed their neck to the yoke of his commands, and it is here recorded 
 to their honour that they did so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Their father said, <I>Sons, go work to-day in my vineyard,</I> in my
 temple; and they not only said, <I>We go, sir,</I> but they went 
 immediately. 

 1. They looked upon the prophet to be the Lord's messenger, and the
 word he delivered to be the Lord's message to them; and there-fore 
 received it <I>not as the word of man, but as the word of</I> Almighty 
 God; they obeyed his words, <I>as the Lord their God had sent him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Note, In attending to God's ministers we must have an eye to him that
 sent them, and receive them for his sake, while they act according to 
 their commission.

 2. They <I>did fear before the Lord.</I> Prophecy was a new thing with
 them; they had had no special messenger from heaven for a great while, 
 and therefore now that they had one, and but one, they paid an 
 extraordinary regard to him; whereas their fathers, who had many 
 prophets, mocked and misused them. It is sometimes so; when good 
 preaching is most scarce it does most good, whereas the manna that is 
 rained in plenty is loathed as <I>light bread.</I> And, because they so 
 readily received this prophet, God, within a month or two after, raised 
 them up another,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:1">Zech. i. 1</A>.

 They <I>feared before the Lord;</I> they had a great regard to the
 divine authority and a great dread of the divine wrath, and were of 
 those that <I>trembled at God's word.</I> The judgments of God which 
 they had been under, though very severe, had not prevailed to make them 
 fear before the Lord, until the word of God was sent to expound his 
 providences, and then they feared. Note, A holy fear of God will have
 a great influence upon our obedience to him. <I>Serve the Lord with
 fear;</I> if we fear him not, we shall not serve him.

 3. <I>The Lord stirred up</I> their spirits,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 (1.) He excited them to their duty, and put it into their hearts to go
 about it. Note, Then the word of God has its success when God by his 
 grace stirs up our spirits to comply with it; and without that grace we 
 should remain stupid and utterly averse to every thing that is good. It 
 is in the day of a divine power that we are made willing. 

 (2.) He encouraged them in their duty, and with those encouragements 
 enlarged their hearts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:32">Ps. cxix. 32</A>.

 When they heard the word they feared; but, lest they should sink under 
 the weight of that fear, God stirred them up, and made them cheerful 
 and bold to encounter the difficulties they might meet with. Note, When 
 God has work to do, he will either find or make men fit to do it, and 
 stir them up to it. 

 4. They applied to their work with all possible vigour: <I>They came
 and did work in the house of the Lord of hosts their God.</I> Every 
 one, according as his capacity or ability was, lent a hand, some way or 
 other, to further that good work; and this they did with an eye to God 
 as the <I>Lord of hosts,</I> and as their God, the God of Israel. The 
 consideration of God's sovereign dominion in the world by his 
 providence, and his covenant-relation to his people by his grace, 
 should stir up our spirits to act for him, and for the advancement of 
 the interest of his kingdom among men, to the utmost of our power. 

 5. They did this speedily; it was but on the first day of the sixth
 month that Haggai preached them this sermon, and by the twenty-fourth 
 of the same month, little more than three weeks after, they were all 
 busy working in the house of the Lord their God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 To show that they were ashamed of their delays hitherto, now that they
 were convinced and called they were resolved to delay no longer, but to 
 strike while the iron was hot, and to set about the work while they 
 were under convictions. Note, Those that have lost time have need to 
 redeem time; and the longer we have loitered in that which is good the 
 more haste we should make when we are convinced of our folly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How God met them in a way of mercy. The same prophet that brought 
 them the reproof brought them a very comforting encouraging word 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Then spoke Haggai, the Lord's messenger, in the Lord's message,</I>
 in his name, and as from him, <I>saying, I am with you, saith the 
 Lord.</I> That is all he has to say, and that is enough; as that word 
 of Christ to his disciples is 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:20">Matt. xxviii. 20</A>),

 "<I>Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world. I am with
 you,</I> that is, I will forgive your neglects hitherto, and they shall 
 not be remembered against you; I will remove the judgments you have 
 been under for those neglects, and will appear for you, as I have in 
 them appeared against you. <I>I am with you</I> to protect you against 
 your enemies that bear ill-will to your work, and to prosper you, and 
 to give you success in it--with you to strengthen your hands, and bless 
 the work of them, without which blessing those labour in vain that 
 build." Note, Those that work for God have God with them; and, if he be 
 for us, who can be against us? If he be with us, what difficulty can 
 stand before us?</P>
