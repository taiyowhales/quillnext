 In this chapter we have,

 I. The common circumstances of the prophecy now to be delivered, the
 time when it was delivered

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:1">ver. 1</A>),

 the place where

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:2">ver. 2</A>),

 and the person by whom,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:3">ver. 3</A>.

 II. The uncommon introduction to it by a vision of the glory of God, 

 1. In his attendance and retinue in the upper world, where his throne
 is surrounded with angels, here called "living creatures," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:4-14">ver. 4-14</A>.
 
 2. In his providences concerning the lower world, represented by the
 wheels and their motions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:15-25">ver. 15-25</A>.

 3. In the face of Jesus Christ sitting upon the throne,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:26-28">ver. 26-28</A>.

 And the more we are acquainted, and the more intimately we converse, 
 with the glory of God in these three branches of it, the more 
 commanding influence will divine revelation have upon us and the more 
 ready shall we be to submit to it, which is the thing aimed at in 
 prefacing the prophecies of this book with these visions. When such a 
 God of glory speaks, it concerns us to hear with attention and 
 reverence; it is at our peril if we do not.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth
 <I>month,</I> in the fifth <I>day</I> of the month, as I <I>was</I> among the
 captives by the river of Chebar, <I>that</I> the heavens were opened,
 and I saw visions of God.
 &nbsp; 2  In the fifth <I>day</I> of the month, which <I>was</I> the fifth year
 of king Jehoiachin's captivity,
 &nbsp; 3  The word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest,
 the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river
 Chebar; and the hand of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was there upon him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The circumstances of the vision which Ezekiel saw, and in which he 
 received his commission and instructions, are here very particularly 
 set down, that the narrative may appear to be authentic and not 
 romantic. It may be of use to keep an account when and where God has 
 been pleased to manifest himself to our souls in a peculiar manner, 
 that the <I>return of the day,</I> and our return to <I>the place of 
 the altar</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:4">Gen. xiii. 4</A>),

 may revive the pleasing grateful remembrance of God's favour to us.
 "Remember, O my soul! and never forget what communications of divine 
 love thou didst receive at such a time, at such a place; tell others 
 what God did for thee."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The time when Ezekiel had this vision is here recorded. It was <I>in 
 the thirtieth year,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Some make it the thirtieth year of the prophet's age; being a priest, 
 he was at that age to enter upon the full execution of the priestly 
 office, but being debarred from that by the iniquity and calamity of 
 the times, now that they had neither temple nor altar, God at that age 
 called him to the dignity of a prophet. Others make it to be the 
 thirtieth year from the beginning of the reign of Nabopolassar, the 
 father of Nebuchadnezzar, from which the Chaldeans began a new 
 computation of time, as they had done from Nabonassar 123 years before. 
 Nabopolassar reigned nineteen years, and this was the eleventh of his 
 son, which makes the thirty. And it was proper enough for Ezekiel, when 
 he was in Babylon, to use the computation they there used, as we in 
 foreign countries date by the new style; and he afterwards uses the 
 melancholy computation of his own country, observing 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)

 that it was the fifth year of Jehoiachin's captivity. But the Chaldee 
 paraphrase fixes upon another era, and says that this was the thirtieth 
 year after <I>Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law in the house 
 of the sanctuary, at midnight, after the setting of the moon, in the 
 days of Josiah the king.</I> And it is true that this was just thirty 
 years from that time; and that was an event so remarkable (as it put 
 the Jewish state upon a new trial) that it was proper enough to date 
 form it; and perhaps therefore the prophet speaks indefinitely of 
 thirty years, as having an eye both to that event and to the Chaldean 
 computation, which were coincident. It was in the <I>fourth month,</I> 
 answering to our June, and in the <I>fifth day of the month,</I> that 
 Ezekiel had this vision,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 It is probably that it was on the sabbath day, because we read

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:16"><I>ch.</I> iii. 16</A>)

 that <I>at the end of seven days,</I> which we may well suppose to be
 the next sabbath, the word of the Lord came to him again. Thus <I>John 
 was in the Spirit on the Lord's day,</I> when he <I>saw the visions of 
 the Almighty,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:10">Rev. i. 10</A>.

 God would hereby put an honour upon his sabbaths, when <I>the enemies 
 mocked at them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+1:7">Lam. i. 7</A>.

 And he would thus encourage his people to keep up their attendance on
 the ministry of his prophets every sabbath day, by the extraordinary 
 manifestations of himself on some sabbath days.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The melancholy circumstances he was in when God honoured him, and 
 thereby favoured his people, with this vision. He was <I>in the land of
 the Chaldeans, among the captives, by the river of Chebar, and it was 
 in the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The people of God were now, some of them, <I>captives in the land of 
 the Chaldeans.</I> The body of the Jewish nation yet remained in their 
 own land, but these were the first-fruits of the captivity, and they 
 were some of the best; for in Jeremiah's vision these were the <I>good 
 figs,</I> whom God had <I>sent into the land of the Chaldeans for their 
 good</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+24:5">Jer. xxiv. 5</A>);

 and, that it might be for their good, God raised up a prophet among
 them, to <I>teach them out of the law,</I> then when he chastened them,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+94:12">Ps. xciv. 12</A>.

 Note, It is a great mercy to have the word of God brought to us, and a
 great duty to attend to it diligently, when we are in affliction. The 
 word of instruction and the rod of correction may be of great service 
 to us, in concert and concurrence with each other, the word to explain 
 the rod and the rod to enforce the word: both together give wisdom. It 
 is happy for a man, when he is sick and in pain, to have a messenger 
 with him, an interpreter, <I>one among a thousand,</I> if he have but 
 his <I>ear open to discipline,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:23">Job xxiii. 23</A>.

 One of the quarrels God had with the Jews, when he sent them into
 captivity, was for <I>mocking his messengers</I> and <I>misusing his
 prophets;</I> and yet, when they were suffering for this sin, he 
 favoured them with this forfeited mercy. It were ill with us if God did 
 not sometimes graciously thrust upon us those means of grace and 
 salvation which we have foolishly thrust from us. In their captivity 
 they were destitute of ordinary helps for their souls, and therefore 
 God raised them up these extraordinary ones; for God's children, if 
 they be hindered in their education one way, shall have it made up 
 another way. But observe, <I>It was in the fifth year of the 
 captivity</I> that Ezekiel was raised up amongst them, and not before.
 So long God left them without any prophet, till they began to <I>lament 
 after the Lord</I> and to complain that they <I>saw not their signs</I> 
 and there was none to <I>tell them how long</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:9">Ps. lxxiv. 9</A>),

 and then they would know how to value a prophet, and God's discoveries
 of himself to them by him would be the more acceptable and comfortable.
 The Jews that remained in their own land had Jeremiah with them, those 
 that had gone into captivity had Ezekiel with them; for wherever the 
 children of God are scattered abroad he will find out tutors for 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The prophet was himself among the captives, those of them that were 
 posted by <I>the river Chebar;</I> for it was <I>by the rivers of 
 Babylon</I> that they <I>sat down,</I> and on the willow-trees by the 
 river's side that they <I>hanged their harps,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:1,2">Ps. cxxxvii. 1, 2</A>.

 The planters in America keep along by the sides of the rivers, and 
 perhaps those captives were employed by their masters in improving some 
 parts of the country by the rivers' sides that were uncultivated, the 
 natives being generally employed in war; or they employed them in 
 manufactures, and therefore chose to fix them by the sides of rivers, 
 that the good they made might the more easily be conveyed by 
 water-carriage. Interpreters agree not what river this of Chebar was,
 but <I>among the captives</I> by that river Ezekiel was, and himself a 
 captive. Observe here, 

 (1.) The best men, and those that are dearest to God, often share, not 
 only in the common calamities of this life, but in the public and 
 national judgments that are inflicted for sin; those feel the smart who 
 contributed nothing to the guilt, by which it appears that the 
 difference between good and bad arises not from the events that befal 
 them, but from the temper and disposition of their spirits under them. 
 And since not only righteous men, but prophets, share with the worst in 
 present punishments, we may infer thence, with the greatest assurance, 
 that there are rewards reserved for them in the future state. 

 (2.) Words of conviction, counsel, and comfort, come best to those who 
 are in affliction from their fellow sufferers. The captives will be 
 best instructed by one who is a captive among them and experimentally 
 knows their sorrows. 

 (3.) The spirit of prophecy was not confined to the land of Israel, but 
 some of the brightest of divine revelations were revealed <I>in the 
 land of the Chaldeans,</I> which was a happy presage of the carrying of 
 the church, with that divine revelation upon which it is built, into 
 the Gentile world; and, as now, so afterwards, when the gospel kingdom 
 was to be set up, the dispersion of the Jews contributed to the 
 spreading of the knowledge of God. 

 (4.) Wherever we are we may keep up our communion with God. <I>Undique 
 ad c&oelig;los tantundem est vi&aelig;--From the remotest corners of the
 earth we may find a way open heavenward.</I> 

 (5.) When God's ministers are bound <I>the word of the Lord is not
 bound,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:9">2 Tim. ii. 9</A>.

 When St. Paul was a prisoner the gospel had a free course. When St.
 John was banished into the Isle of Patmos Christ visited him there.
 Nay, God's suffering servants have generally been treated as 
 favourites, and their consolations have much more abounded when 
 affliction has abounded,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:5">2 Cor. i. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The discovery which God was pleased to make of himself to the 
 prophet when he was in these circumstances, to be by him communicated 
 to his people. He here tells us what he saw, what he heard, and what he 
 felt. 

 1. He <I>saw visions of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 No man can <I>see God and live;</I> but many have seen visions of God,
 such displays of the divine glory as have both instructed and affected 
 them; and commonly, when God first revealed himself to any prophet, he 
 did it by an extraordinary vision, as to Isaiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:1-13"><I>ch.</I> vi.</A>),

 to Jeremiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:1-19"><I>ch.</I> i.</A>),

 to Abraham

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:2">Acts vii. 2</A>),

 to settle a correspondence and a satisfactory way of intercourse, so
 that there needed not afterwards a vision upon every revelation. Ezekiel
 was employed in turning the hearts of the people to the Lord their God,
 and therefore he must himself see the visions of God. Note, It concerns
 those to be well acquainted with God themselves, and much affected with 
 what they know of him, whose business it is to bring others to the 
 knowledge and love of him. That he might see the <I>visions of God the 
 heavens were opened;</I> the darkness and distance which hindered his 
 visions were conquered, and he was let into the light of the glories of 
 the upper world, as near and clear as if heaven had been opened to him. 

 2. He heard the voice of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>The word of the Lord came expressly</I> to him, and what he saw was 
 designed to prepare him for what he was to hear. The expression is 
 emphatic. <I>Essendo fuit verbum Dei</I>--<I>The word of the Lord was a 
 really it was to him.</I> There was no mistake in it; it came to him in 
 the fulness of its light and power, in the evidence and demonstration 
 of the Spirit; it came close to him, nay, it came into him, took 
 possession of him and dwelt in him richly. It <I>came expressly,</I> or 
 accurately, to him; he did himself clearly understand what he said and 
 was abundantly satisfied f the truth of it. <I>The essential Word</I> 
 (so we may take it), <I>the Word who is, who is what he is, came to 
 Ezekiel,</I> to send him on his errand.

 3. He felt the power of God opening his eyes to see the visions,
 opening his ear to hear the voice, and opening his heart to receive 
 both: <I>The hand of the Lord was there upon him.</I> Note, <I>The hand 
 of the Lord</I> goes along with <I>the word f the Lord,</I> and so it 
 becomes effectual; those only understand and <I>believe the report to 
 whom the arm of the Lord is revealed. The hand of God was upon him,</I> 
 as upon Moses, to cover him, that he should not be overcome by the 
 dazzling light and lustre of the visions he saw, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+33:22">Exod. xxxiii. 22</A>.

 It <I>was upon him</I> (as upon St. John,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:17">Rev. i. 17</A>),

 to revive and support him, that he might bear up, and not faint, under 
 these discoveries, that he might neither be lifted up nor cast down 
 with the abundance of the revelations. God's <I>grace is sufficient for 
 him,</I> and, in token of that, his <I>hand is upon him.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north,
 a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness
 <I>was</I> about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of
 amber, out of the midst of the fire.
 &nbsp; 5  Also out of the midst thereof <I>came</I> the likeness of four
 living creatures. And this <I>was</I> their appearance; they had the
 likeness of a man.
 &nbsp; 6  And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.
 &nbsp; 7  And their feet <I>were</I> straight feet; and the sole of their
 feet <I>was</I> like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like
 the colour of burnished brass.
 &nbsp; 8  And <I>they had</I> the hands of a man under their wings on their
 four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.
 &nbsp; 9  Their wings <I>were</I> joined one to another; they turned not
 when they went; they went every one straight forward.
 &nbsp; 10  As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face
 of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they
 four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had
 the face of an eagle.
 &nbsp; 11  Thus <I>were</I> their faces: and their wings <I>were</I> stretched
 upward; two <I>wings</I> of every one <I>were</I> joined one to another,
 and two covered their bodies.
 &nbsp; 12  And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit
 was to go, they went; <I>and</I> they turned not when they went.
 &nbsp; 13  As for the likeness of the living creatures, their
 appearance <I>was</I> like burning coals of fire, <I>and</I> like the
 appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living
 creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went
 forth lightning.
 &nbsp; 14  And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance
 of a flash of lightning.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The visions of God which Ezekiel here saw were very glorious, and had 
 more particulars than those which other prophets saw. It is the scope 
 and intention of these vision, 

 1. To possess the prophet's mind with very great, and high, and 
 honourable thoughts of that God by whom he was commissioned and for 
 whom he was employed. It is <I>the likeness of the glory of the 
 Lord</I> that he sees 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 and hence he may infer that it is his honour to serve him, for he is 
 one whom angels serve. He may serve him with safety, for he has power 
 sufficient to bear him out in his work. It is at his peril to draw
 back from his service, for he has power to pursue him, as he did Jonah. 
 So great a God as this must be served <I>with reverence and godly 
 fear;</I> and with assurance may Ezekiel foretel what this God will do, 
 for he is able to make his words good.

 2. To strike a terror upon the sinners who remained in Zion, and those 
 who had already come to Babylon, who were secure, and bade defiance to 
 the threatenings of Jerusalem's ruin, as we have found in Jeremiah's 
 prophecy, and shall find in this, many did. "Let those who said, <I>We 
 shall have peace though we go on,</I> know that <I>our God is a 
 consuming fire,</I> whom they cannot stand before." That this vision 
 had a reference to the destruction of Jerusalem seems plain from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:3"><I>ch.</I> xliii. 3</A>,

 where he says that it was <I>the vision which he saw when he came to
 destroy the city,</I> that is, to prophesy the destruction of it.

 3. To speak comfort to those that feared God, and trembled at his word,
 and humbled themselves under his mighty hand. "Let them know that, 
 though they are captives in Babylon, yet they have God nigh unto them; 
 though they have not <I>the place of the sanctuary</I> to be their 
 glorious high throne, they have the God of the sanctuary." Dr.
 Lightfoot observes, "Now that the church is to be planted for a long 
 time in another country, the Lord shows a glory in the midst of them, 
 as he had done at their first constituting into a church in the 
 wilderness; and out of <I>a cloud and fire,</I> as he had done there, 
 he showed himself; and from between <I>living creatures,</I> as from 
 between the cherubim, he gives his oracles." This put an honour upon 
 them, by which they might value themselves when the Chaldeans insulted 
 over them, and this might encourage their hopes of deliverance in due 
 time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, to answer these ends, we have in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:4-14">these verses</A>

 the first part of the vision, which represents God as attended and
 served by an innumerable company of angels, who are all his messengers, 
 his ministers, <I>doing his commandments</I> and <I>hearkening to the 
 voice of his word.</I> This denotes his grandeur, as it magnifies an 
 earthly prince to have a splendid retinue and numerous armies at his 
 command, which engages his allies to trust him and his enemies to fear 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The introduction to this vision of the angels is very magnificent 
 and awakening, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 The prophet, observing the heavens to open, <I>looked,</I> looked up 
 (as it was time), to see what discoveries God would make to him. Note, 
 When the heavens are opened it concerns us to have our eyes open. To 
 clear the way, <I>behold, a whirlwind came out of the north,</I> which 
 would drive away the interposing mists of this lower region. Fair 
 weather <I>comes out of the north,</I> and thence <I>the wind</I> comes 
 that <I>drives away rain.</I> God can by a whirlwind clear the sky and 
 air, and produce that serenity of mind which is necessary to our 
 communion with Heaven. Yet this whirlwind was attended with <I>a great 
 cloud.</I> When we think that the clouds which arise from this earth 
 are dispelled and we can see beyond them, yet still there is a cloud 
 which heavenly things are wrapped in, a cloud from above, so that <I>we 
 cannot order our speech</I> concerning them <I>by reason of 
 darkness.</I> Christ here descended, as he ascended, <I>in a cloud.</I> 
 Some by this <I>whirlwind and cloud</I> understand the Chaldean army 
 coming <I>out of the north</I> against the land of Judah, bearing down 
 all before them as a tempest; and so it agrees with that which was 
 signified by one of the first of Jeremiah's visions 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:14">Jer. i. 14</A>,

 <I>Out of the north an evil shall break forth</I>); but I take it here
 as an introduction rather to the vision than to the sermons. This 
 whirlwind came to Ezekiel (as that to Elijah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:11">1 Kings xix. 11</A>),

 to <I>prepare the way of the Lord,</I> and to demand attention.
 <I>He</I> that has eyes, <I>that has ears,</I> let him see, <I>let him 
 hear.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The vision itself. <I>A great cloud</I> was the vehicle of this 
 vision, in which it was conveyed to the prophet; for God's pavilion in 
 which he rests, his chariot in which he rides, is <I>darkness and thick 
 clouds,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:11,104:3">Ps. xviii. 11; civ. 3</A>.

 Thus he <I>holds back the face of his throne,</I> lest its dazzling
 light and lustre should overpower us, by <I>spreading a cloud upon 
 it.</I> Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The cloud is accompanied with <I>a fire,</I> as upon Mount Sinai, 
 where God resided in a <I>thick cloud;</I> but <I>the sight of his 
 glory was like a devouring fire</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+24:16,17">Exod. xxiv. 16, 17</A>),

 and his first appearance to Moses was <I>in a flame of fire in the
 bush;</I> for <I>our God is a consuming fire.</I> This was <I>a fire 
 enfolding itself,</I> a globe, or orb, or wheel of fire. God being his 
 own cause, his own rule, and his own end, if he be as <I>a fire,</I> he 
 is as <I>a fire enfolding itself,</I> or (as some read it) <I>kindled 
 by itself.</I> The fire of God's glory shines forth, but it quickly 
 enfolds itself; for he lets us know but part of his ways; the fire of 
 God's wrath breaks forth, but it also quickly enfolds itself, for the 
 divine patience suffers not all his wrath to be stirred up. If it were 
 not a fire thus enfolding itself, <I>O Lord! who shall stand?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The fire is surrounded with a glory: <I>A brightness was about 
 it,</I> in which it enfolded itself, yet it made some discovery of 
 itself. Though we cannot see into the fire, cannot by searching find 
 out God to perfection, yet we see the brightness that is round about 
 it, the reflection of this fire from the thick cloud. Moses might see 
 God's back parts, but not his face. We have some light concerning the 
 nature of God, from the brightness which encompasses it, though we have 
 not an insight into it, by reason of the cloud spread upon it. Nothing 
 is more easy than to determine that God is, nothing more difficult than 
 to describe what he is. When God displays his wrath as fire, yet there 
 is a brightness about it; for his holiness and justice appear very 
 illustrious in the punishment of sin and sinners: even about the 
 devouring fire there is a brightness, which glorified saints will for 
 ever admire.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Out of this fire there shines <I>the colour of amber.</I> We are not 
 told who or what it was that had this colour of amber, and therefore I 
 take it to be the whole frame of the following vision, which came into 
 Ezekiel's view <I>out of the midst of the fire and brightness;</I> and 
 the first thing he took notice of before he viewed the particulars was 
 that it was <I>of the colour of amber,</I> or <I>the eye of amber;</I> 
 that is, it looked as amber does to the eye, of a bright flaming fiery 
 colour, the colour of <I>a burning coal;</I> so some think it should be 
 read. The <I>living creatures</I> which he saw coming <I>out of the 
 midst of the fire</I> were <I>seraphim</I>--<I>burners;</I> for <I>he
 maketh his angels spirits, his ministers a flaming fire.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That which comes out of the fire, of a fiery amber colour, when it
 comes to be distinctly viewed, is <I>the likeness of four living 
 creatures;</I> not the <I>living creatures</I> themselves (angels are 
 spirits, and cannot be seen), but <I>the likeness</I> of them, such a 
 hieroglyphic, or representation, as God saw fit to make use of for the 
 leading of the prophet, and us with him, into some acquaintance with 
 the world of angels (a matter purely of divine revelation), so far as 
 is requisite to possess us with an awful sense of the greatness of that 
 God who has angels for his attendants, and the goodness of that God who 
 has appointed them to be attendants on his people. <I>The likeness of 
 these living creatures came out of the midst of the fire;</I> for 
 angels derive their being and power from God; they are in themselves, 
 and to us, what he is pleased to make them; their glory is a ray of 
 his. The prophet himself explains this vision 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:20"><I>ch.</I> x. 20</A>):

 <I>I knew that the living creatures were the cherubim,</I> which is one
 of the names by which the angels are known in scripture. To Daniel was 
 made known their number, <I>ten thousand times ten thousand,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:10">Dan. vii. 10</A>.

 But, though they are many, yet they are one, and that is made known to
 Ezekiel here; they are one in nature and operation, as an army, 
 consisting of thousands, is yet called a body of men. We have here an 
 account of,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Their nature. They are living creatures; they are the creatures of 
 God, the work of his hands; their being is derived; they have not life 
 in and of themselves, but receive it from him who is <I>the fountain of 
 life.</I> As much as the living creatures of this lower world excel the 
 vegetables that are the ornaments of earth, so much do the angels, the 
 living creatures of the upper world, excel the sun, moon, and stars, 
 the ornaments of the heavens. The sun (say some) is a flame of <I>fire 
 enfolding itself,</I> but it is not a living creature, as angels, those 
 flames of fire, are. Angels are living creatures, living beings, 
 emphatically so. Men on earth are dying creatures, dying daily (<I>in 
 the midst of life we are in death</I>), but angels in heaven are living 
 creatures; they live indeed, live to good purpose; and, when saints 
 come to be <I>equal unto the angels,</I> they shall not <I>die any 
 more,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:36">Luke xx. 36</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Their number. They are four; so they appear here, though they are 
 innumerable; not as if these were four particular angels set up above 
 the rest, as some have fondly imagined, Michael and Gabriel, Raphael
 and Uriel, but for the sake of the four faces they put on, and to 
 intimate their being sent forth towards <I>the four winds of 
 heaven,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:31">Matt. xxiv. 31</A>.

 Zechariah saw them as four chariots going forth east, west, north, and
 south,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:1">Zech. vi. 1</A>.

 God has messengers to send every way; for his kingdom is universal, and
 reaches to all parts of the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Their qualifications, by which they are fitted for the service of 
 their Maker and Master. These are set forth figuratively and by 
 similitude, as is proper in visions, which are parables to the eye. 
 Their description here is such, and so expressed, that I think it is 
 not possible by it to form an exact idea of them in our fancies, or 
 with the pencil, for that would be a temptation to worship them; but 
 the several instances of their fitness for the work they are employed 
 in are intended in the several parts of this description. Note, It is 
 the greatest honour of God's creatures to be in a capacity of answering 
 the end of their creation; and the more ready we are to every good work 
 the nearer we approach to the dignity of angels. These living creatures 
 are described here, 

 [1.] By their general appearance: <I>They had the likeness of a 
 man;</I> they appeared, for the main, in a human shape, <I>First,</I> 
 To signify that these living creatures are reasonable creatures, 
 intelligent beings, who have the <I>spirit of a man</I> which is the 
 <I>candle of the Lord. Secondly,</I> To put an honour upon the nature 
 of man, who is made lower, yet but <I>a little lower, than the 
 angels,</I> in the very next rank of beings below them. When the 
 invisible intelligences of the upper world would make themselves 
 visible, it is in <I>the likeness of man. Thirdly,</I> To intimate that 
 their <I>delights are with the sons of men,</I> as their Master's are

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:31">Prov. viii. 31</A>),

 that they do service to men, and men may have spiritual communion with 
 them by faith, hope, and holy love. <I>Fourthly,</I> The angels of God 
 appear in <I>the likeness of man</I> because in <I>the fulness of 
 time</I> the Son of God was not only to appear in that likeness, but to 
 assume that nature; they therefore show this love to it. 

 [2.] By their faces: <I>Every one had four faces,</I> looking four 
 several ways. In St. John's vision, which has a near affinity with 
 this, each of the four living creatures has one of these faces here 
 mentioned

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:7">Rev. iv. 7</A>);
 
 here each of them has all four, to intimate that they have all the same 
 qualifications for service; though, perhaps, among the angels of 
 heaven, as among the angels of the churches, some excel in one gift and 
 others in another, but all for the common service. Let us contemplate
 their faces till we be in some measure changed into the same image, 
 that we may do the will of God as the angels do it in heaven. They 
 <I>all four had the face of a man</I> (for in that likeness they 
 appeared, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 but, besides that, they had <I>the face of a lion, an ox,</I> and <I>an 
 eagle,</I> each masterly in its kind, <I>the lion</I> among <I>wild</I> 
 beasts, <I>the ox</I> among <I>tame</I> ones, and <I>the eagle</I> 
 among fowls, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Does God make use of them for the executing of judgments upon his 
 enemies? They are fierce and strong as the lion and the eagle in 
 tearing their prey. Does he make use of them for the good of his
 people? They are as <I>oxen strong for labour</I> and inclined to 
 serve. And in both they have <I>the understanding of a man.</I> The 
 scattered perfections of the living creatures on earth meet in the 
 angels of heaven. They have <I>the likeness of man;</I> but, because 
 there are some things in which man is excelled even by the inferior 
 creatures, they are therefore compared to some of them. They have 
 <I>the understanding of a man,</I> and such as far exceeds it; they 
 also resemble man in tenderness and humanity. But, <I>First, A lion</I> 
 excels man in strength and boldness, and is much more formidable; 
 therefore the angels, who in this resemble them, put on the <I>face of 
 a lion. Secondly, An ox</I> excels man in diligence, and patience, and 
 painstaking, and an unwearied discharge of the work he has to do; 
 therefore the angels, who are constantly employed in the service of God 
 and the church, put on <I>the face of an ox. Thirdly, An eagle</I> 
 excels man in quickness and piercingness of sight, and in soaring high; 
 and therefore the angels, who seek things above, and see far into 
 divine mysteries, put on <I>the face of a flying eagle.</I> 

 [3.] By their wings: <I>Every one had four wings,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 In the vision Isaiah had of them they appeared with six, now with four; 
 for they appeared above the throne, and had occasion for two to cover 
 their faces with. The angels are fitted with wings to fly swiftly on
 God's errands; whatever business God sends them upon they lose no time. 
 Faith and hope are the soul's wings, upon which it soars upward; pious 
 and devout affections are its wings on which it is carried forward with 
 vigour and alacrity. The prophet observes here, concerning their wings, 
 <I>First,</I> That they were <I>joined one to another,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>

 and again 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 They did not make use of their wings for fighting, as some birds do; 
 there is no contest among the angels. God makes <I>peace,</I> perfect
 peace, <I>in his high places.</I> But their wings were joined, in token 
 of their perfect unity and unanimity and the universal agreement there 
 is among them. <I>Secondly,</I> That <I>they were stretched upward,</I> 
 extended, and ready for use, not folded up, or flagging. Let an angel 
 receive the least intimation of the divine will, and he has nothing to 
 seek, but is upon the wings immediately; while our poor dull souls are 
 like the ostrich, that with much difficulty lifts up herself on high. 
 <I>Thirdly,</I> That two of their wings were made use of in covering 
 their bodies, the spiritual bodies they assumed. The clothes that cover 
 us are our hindrance in work; angels need no other covering than their 
 own wings, which are their furtherance. They cover their bodies from 
 us, so forbidding us needless enquiries concerning them. Ask not after 
 them, for they are wonderful, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:18">Judg. xiii. 18</A>.

 They cover them before God, so directing us, when we approach to God,
 to see to it that we be so clothed with Christ's righteousness <I>that 
 the shame of our nakedness may not appear.</I>

 [4.] By their feet, including their legs and thighs: They were 
 <I>straight feet</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 they stood straight, and firm, and steady; no burden of service could 
 make their legs to bend under them. The spouse makes this part of the
 description of her beloved, that <I>his legs</I> were <I>as pillars of 
 marble set upon sockets of fine gold</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:15">Cant. v. 15</A>);

 such are the angels' legs. <I>The sole of their feet was like</I> that
 <I>of a calf's foot,</I> which divides the hoof and is therefore clean: 
 <I>as it were the sole of a round foot</I> (as the Chaldee words it); 
 they were ready for motion any way. <I>Their feet were winged</I> (so 
 the LXX.); they went so swiftly that it was as if they flew. And their 
 very feet <I>sparkled like the colour of burnished brass;</I> not only 
 the faces, but the very feet, of those are beautiful whom God sends on 
 his errands

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:7">Isa. lii. 7</A>);

 every step the angels take is glorious. In the vision John had of
 Christ it is said, <I>His feet were like unto fine brass, as if they 
 burned in a furnace,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:15">Rev. i. 15</A>.

 [5.] By their hands 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>They had the hands of a man under their wings on their four 
 sides,</I> an arm and a hand under every wing. They had not only wings 
 for motion, but hands for action. Many are quick who are not active; 
 they hurry about a great deal, but do nothing to purpose, bring nothing 
 to pass; they have wings, but no hands: whereas God's servants, the 
 angels, not only go when he sends them and come when he calls them, but 
 do what he bids them. They are <I>the hands of a man,</I> which are 
 wonderfully made and fitted for service, which are guided by reason and 
 understanding; for what angles do they do intelligently and with 
 judgment. They have calves' feet; this denotes the swiftness of their 
 motion (the cedars of Lebanon are said to <I>skip like a calf,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+29:6">Ps. xxix. 6</A>);

 but they have a man's hand, which denotes the niceness and exactness of
 their performances, as the heavens are said to be the work of God's 
 fingers. Their hands were <I>under their wings,</I> which concealed
 them, as they did the rest of their bodies. Note, The agency of angels 
 is a secret thing and their work is carried on in an invisible way. In 
 working for God, though we must not, with <I>the sluggard, hide our 
 hand in our bosom,</I> yet we must, with the humble, <I>not let our 
 left hand know what our right hand doeth.</I> We may observe that where 
 these wings were their hands were <I>under their wings;</I> wherever 
 their wings carried them they carried hands along with them, to be 
 still doing something suitable something that the duty of the place 
 requires.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) Their motions. The living creatures are moving. Angels are active 
 beings; it is not their happiness to sit still and do nothing, but to 
 be always well employed; and we must reckon ourselves then best when we 
 are doing good, doing it as the angels do it, or whom it is here 
 observed, 

 [1.] That whatever service they went about <I>they went every one 
 straight forward</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:9,12"><I>v.</I> 9, 12</A>),

 which intimates, <I>First,</I> That they sincerely aimed at the glory 
 of God, and had a single eye to that, in all they did. Their going 
 <I>straight forward</I> supposes that they looked straight forward, and 
 never had any sinister intentions in what they did. And, if thus <I>our 
 eye be single,</I> our <I>whole body will be full of light.</I> The 
 singleness of the eye is the sincerity of the heart. <I>Secondly,</I> 
 That they were intent upon the service they were employed in, and did 
 it with a close application of mind. They went forward with their work; 
 for what their hand found to do they did <I>with all their might</I> 
 and did not loiter in it. <I>Thirdly,</I> That they were unanimous in
 it: <I>They went straight forward,</I> every one about his own work; 
 they did not thwart or jostle one another, did not stand in one 
 another's light, in one another's way. <I>Fourthly,</I> That they
 perfectly understood their business, and were thoroughly apprised of 
 it, so that they needed not to stand still, to pause of hesitate, but 
 pursue their work with readiness, as those that knew what they had to 
 do and how to do it. <I>Fifthly,</I> They were steady and constant in
 their work. They did not fluctuate, did not tire, did not vary, but 
 were of a piece with themselves. They moved in a direct line, and so 
 went the nearest way to work in all they did and lost no time. When we 
 go straight we go forward; when we serve God with one heart we rid 
 ground, we rid work.
 
 [2.] <I>They turned not when they went,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:9,12"><I>v.</I> 9, 12</A>.

 <I>First,</I> They made no blunders or mistakes, which would give them 
 occasion to turn back to rectify them; their work needed no correction, 
 and therefore needed not to be gone over again. <I>Secondly,</I> They
 minded no diversions; as they turned not back, so they turned not 
 aside, to trifle with any thing that was foreign to their business.
 
 [3.] <I>They went whither the Spirit was to go</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 either, <I>First, Whither</I> their own <I>spirit was</I> disposed 
 <I>to go;</I> thither <I>they went,</I> having no bodies, as we have, 
 to clog or hinder them. It is our infelicity and daily burden that, 
 when <I>the spirit if willing,</I> yet <I>the flesh is weak</I> and 
 cannot keep pace with it, so that <I>the good which we would do we do 
 it not;</I> but angels and glorified saints labour under no such 
 impotency; whatever they incline or intend to do they do it, and never 
 come short of it. Or, rather, <I>Secondly,</I> Whithersoever <I>the 
 Spirit</I> of God would have them <I>go,</I> thither <I>they went.</I> 
 Though they had so much wisdom of their own, yet in all their motions 
 and actions they subjected themselves to the guidance and government of 
 the divine will. Whithersoever the divine Providence <I>was to go they 
 went,</I> to serve its purposes and to execute its orders. The Spirit 
 of God (says Mr. Greenhill) is the great agent that sets angels to 
 work, and it is their honour that they are led, they are easily <I>led, 
 by the Spirit.</I> See how tractable and obsequious these noble 
 creatures are. Whithersoever <I>the Spirit</I> is <I>to go</I> they go
 immediately, with all possible alacrity. Note, Those that <I>walk after 
 the Spirit</I> do the will of God as the angels do it. 

 [4.] They <I>ran and returned like a flash of lightning,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 This intimates, <I>First,</I> That they made haste; they were quick in 
 their motions, as quick as lightning. Whatever business they went about 
 they despatched it immediately, in a moment, in the twinkling of an 
 eye. Happy they that have no bodies to retard their motion in holy
 exercises. And happy shall we be when we come to have spiritual bodies 
 for spiritual work. Satan <I>falls like lightning</I> into his own 
 ruin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:18">Luke x. 18</A>.

 Angels fly <I>like lightning</I> in their Master's work. The angel
 Gabriel flew swiftly. <I>Secondly,</I> That they made haste back: They 
 <I>ran and returned;</I> ran to do their work and execute their orders, 
 and then returned to give an account of what they had done and receive 
 new instructions, that they might be always doing. They <I>ran</I>
 into the lower world, to do what was to be done there; but, when they 
 had done it, they <I>returned like flash of lightning</I> to the upper 
 world again, to the beatific vision of their God, which they could not 
 with any patience be longer from than their service did require. Thus 
 we should be in the affairs of this world as out of our element. Though 
 we run into them, we must not repose in them, but our souls must 
 quickly return like lightning to God their rest and centre.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. We have an account of the light by which the prophet saw these 
 living creatures, or the looking-glass in which he saw them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 (1.) He saw them by their own light, for <I>their appearance was like 
 burning coals of fire;</I> they are <I>seraphim-burners,</I> denoting 
 the ardour of their love to God, their fervent zeal in his service, 
 their splendour and brightness, and their terror against God's enemies. 
 When God employs them to fight his battles they are as <I>coals of 
 fire</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:12">Ps. xviii. 12</A>)

 to <I>devour the adversaries,</I> as lightnings shot out to discomfit
 them.

 (2.) He saw them by the light of some <I>lamps,</I> which <I>went up 
 and down among</I> them, the shining whereof <I>was</I> very 
 <I>bright.</I> Satan's works are works of darkness; he is <I>the ruler 
 of the darkness of this world.</I> But the angels of light are in the 
 light, and, though they conceal their working, they show their work, 
 for it will bear the light. But we see them and their works only by 
 candle-light, but the dim light <I>of lamps</I> that go <I>up and down 
 among</I> them; when <I>the day breaks, and the shadows flee away,</I> 
 we shall see them clearly. Some make the <I>appearance</I> of these 
 <I>burning coals,</I> and of the <I>lightning</I> that issues <I>out of 
 the fire,</I> to signify the wrath of God, and his judgments, that were 
 now to be executed upon Judah and Jerusalem for their sins, in which 
 angels were to be employed; and accordingly we find afterwards <I>coals 
 of fire scattered upon the city</I> to consume it, which were 
 <I>fetched from between the cherubim,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:2"><I>ch.</I> x. 2</A>.

 But by <I>the appearance of the lamps</I> then we may understand the
 light of comfort which shone forth to the people of God in the darkness 
 of this present trouble. If the ministry of the angels is as a 
 consuming fire to God's enemies, it is as a rejoicing light to his own 
 children. To the one this <I>fire</I> is <I>bright,</I> it is very 
 reviving and refreshing; to the other, <I>out of the fire</I> comes 
 fresh <I>lightning</I> to destroy them. Note, Good angels are our 
 friends, or enemies, according as God is.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon
 the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.
 &nbsp; 16  The appearance of the wheels and their work <I>was</I> like unto
 the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their
 appearance and their work <I>was</I> as it were a wheel in the middle
 of a wheel.
 &nbsp; 17  When they went, they went upon their four sides: <I>and</I> they
 turned not when they went.
 &nbsp; 18  As for their rings, they were so high that they were
 dreadful; and their rings <I>were</I> full of eyes round about them
 four.
 &nbsp; 19  And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them:
 and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the
 wheels were lifted up.
 &nbsp; 20  Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither <I>was
 their</I> spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against
 them: for the spirit of the living creature <I>was</I> in the wheels.
 &nbsp; 21  When those went, <I>these</I> went; and when those stood, <I>these</I>
 stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels
 were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living
 creatures <I>was</I> in the wheels.
 &nbsp; 22  And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the
 living creature <I>was</I> as the colour of the terrible crystal,
 stretched forth over their heads above.
 &nbsp; 23  And under the firmament <I>were</I> their wings straight, the one
 toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side,
 and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.
 &nbsp; 24  And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like
 the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the
 voice of speech, as the noise of a host: when they stood, they
 let down their wings.
 &nbsp; 25  And there was a voice from the firmament that <I>was</I> over
 their heads, when they stood, <I>and</I> had let down their wings.

 The prophet is very exact in making and recording his observations 
 concerning this vision. And here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The notice he took of the <I>wheels,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:15-21"><I>v.</I> 15-21</A>.

 The glory of God appears not only in the splendour of his retinue in 
 the upper world, but in the steadiness of his government here in this 
 lower world. Having seen how God does according to his will in the
 armies of heaven, let us now see how he does according to it among the 
 inhabitants of the earth; for there, <I>on the earth,</I> the prophet 
 saw the <I>wheels,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 <I>As he beheld the living creatures,</I> and was contemplating the 
 glory of that vision and receiving instruction from it, this other 
 vision presented itself to his view. Note, Those who make a good use
 of the discoveries God has favoured them with may expect further 
 discoveries; for <I>to him that hath shall be given.</I> We are 
 sometimes tempted to think there is nothing glorious but what is in the 
 upper world, whereas, could we with an eye of faith discern the beauty 
 of Providence and the wisdom, power, and goodness, which shine in the 
 administration of that kingdom, we should see, and say, <I>Verily he is 
 a God that judgeth in the earth</I> and acts like himself. There are 
 many things in this vision which give us some light concerning the 
 divine Providence.

 1. The dispensations of Providence are compared to <I>wheels,</I> 
 either the wheels of a chariot, in which the conqueror rides in 
 triumph, or rather the wheels of a clock or watch, which all contribute 
 to the regular motion of the machine. We read of <I>the course</I> or 
 <I>wheel of nature</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:6">James iii. 6</A>),

 which is here set before us as under the direction of the God of
 nature. <I>Wheels,</I> though they move not of themselves, as <I>the
 living creatures</I> do, are yet made movable and are almost 
 continually kept in action. Providence, represented by these 
 <I>wheels,</I> produces changes; sometimes one spoke of the wheel is 
 uppermost and sometimes another; but the motion of the wheel on its own 
 axletree, like that of the orbs above, is very regular and steady. The 
 motion of the wheels is circular; by the revolutions of Providence 
 things are brought to the same posture and pass which they were in 
 formerly; for <I>the thing that is is that which has been, and there is 
 no new thing under the sun,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:9,10">Eccl. i. 9, 10</A>.

 2. The wheel is said to be <I>by the living creatures,</I> who attended
 it to direct its motion; for the angels are employed as the ministers 
 of God's providence, and have a greater hand in directing the motions 
 of second causes to serve the divine purpose than we think they have. 
 Such a close connexion is there between <I>the living creatures</I> and 
 the <I>wheels</I> that they moved and rested together. Were angels 
 busily employed? Men were busily employed as instruments in their hand, 
 whether of mercy or judgment, though they themselves were not aware of 
 it. Or, Are men active to compass their designs? Angels at the same
 time are acting to control and overrule them. This is much insisted on 
 here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>When the living creatures went,</I> to bring about any business, 
 <I>the wheels went by them;</I> when God has work to do by the ministry 
 of angels second causes are all found, or made, ready to concur in it; 
 and 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>)

 <I>when those stood these stood;</I> when the angels had done their 
 work the second causes had done theirs. If <I>the living creatures were 
 lifted up from the earth,</I> were elevated to any service above the 
 common course of nature and out of the ordinary road (as suppose in the 
 working of miracles, the dividing of the water, the standing still of 
 the sun), <I>the wheels,</I> contrary to their own natural tendency, 
 which is towards the earth, move in concert with them, and <I>are 
 lifted up over against them;</I> this is thrice mentioned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:19-21"><I>v.</I> 19-21</A>.
 
 Note, All inferior creatures are, and move, and act, as the Creator, by 
 the ministration of angels, directs and influences them. Visible 
 effects are managed and governed by invisible causes. The reason given 
 of this is because <I>the spirit of the living creatures was in the 
 wheels;</I> the same wisdom, power, and holiness of God, the same will 
 and counsel of his, that guides and governs the angels and all their 
 performances, does, by them, order and dispose of all the motions of 
 the creatures in this lower world and the events and issues of them.
 God is the soul of the world, and animates the whole, both that above 
 and that beneath, so that they move in perfect harmony, as the upper 
 and lower parts of the natural body do, so that <I>whithersoever the 
 Spirit is to go</I> (whatever God wills and purposes to be done and 
 brought to pass) <I>thither their spirit is to go;</I> that is, the 
 angels, knowingly and designedly, set themselves to bring it about. And 
 <I>their spirit is in the wheels,</I> which are therefore <I>lifted up 
 over against them;</I> that is, both the powers of nature and the wills 
 of men are all made to serve the intention, which they infallibly and 
 irresistibly effect, though perhaps <I>they mean not so, neither doth 
 their heart think so,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:7,Mic+4:11,12">Isa. x. 7; Mic. iv. 11, 12</A>.

 Thus, though the will of God's precept be not <I>done on earth as it is
 done in heaven,</I> yet the will of his purpose and counsel is, and 
 shall be.

 3. The wheel is said to have four <I>faces,</I> looking four several
 ways 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 denoting that the providence of God exerts itself in all parts of the 
 world, east, west, north, and south, and extends itself to the remotest 
 corners of it. Look which way you will upon the wheel of Providence,
 and it has a face towards you, a beautiful one, which you may admire 
 the features and complexion of; it looks upon you as ready to speak to 
 you, if you be but ready to hear the voice of it; like a well-drawn 
 picture, it has an eye upon all that have an eye upon it. The wheel
 had so four <I>faces</I> that it had in it four <I>wheels,</I> which 
 <I>went upon their four sides,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 At first Ezekiel saw it as <I>one wheel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 one sphere; but afterwards he saw it was four, but <I>they</I> four 
 <I>had one likeness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);

 not only they were like one another, but they were as if they had been 
 one. This intimates, 

 (1.) That one event of providence is like another; what happens to us 
 is <I>that which is common to men</I> and what we are not to think 
 strange. 

 (2.) That various events have a tendency to the same issue and concur 
 to answer the same intention.

 4. <I>Their appearance and their work</I> are said to be <I>like the 
 colour of a beryl</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 <I>the colour of Tarshish</I> (so the word is), that is, of the sea; 
 the beryl is of that colour, sea-green; <I>blue Neptune</I> we call it. 
 The nature of things in this world is like that of the sea, which is in 
 a continual flux and yet there is a constant coherence and succession 
 of its parts. There is a chain of events which is always drawing one
 way or other. The sea ebbs and flows, so does Providence in its
 disposals, but always in the stated appointed times and measures. The 
 sea looks blue, as the air does, because of the shortness and 
 feebleness of our sight, which can see but a little way of either; to 
 that colour therefore are <I>the appearance and work</I> of Providence 
 fitly compared, because we cannot find out that which God does <I>from 
 the beginning to the end,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:11">Eccl. iii. 11</A>.

 We see but <I>parts of his ways</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+26:14">Job xxvi. 14</A>),

 and all beyond looks blue, which gives us to understand no more
 concerning it but that in truth we know it not; it is <I>far above out 
 of our sight.</I>

 5. <I>Their appearance and their work</I> are likewise said to be
 <I>as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.</I> Observe here again, 
 Their <I>appearance</I> to the prophet is designed to set forth what 
 <I>their work</I> really is. Men's appearance and their work often
 differ, but the appearance of God's providence and its work agree; if 
 they seem to differ, it is through our ignorance and mistake. Now both
 <I>were as a wheel in a wheel,</I> a less wheel moved by a greater. We 
 pretend not to give a mathematical description of it. The meaning is 
 that the disposals of Providence seem to us intricate, perplexed, and 
 unaccountable, and yet that they will appear in the issue to have been 
 all wisely ordered for the best; so that though <I>what God does we 
 know not now,</I> yet <I>we shall know hereafter,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:7">John xiii. 7</A>.

 6. The motion of these wheels, like that of the living creatures, was 
 steady, regular, and constant: <I>They returned not when they went</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 because they never went amiss, nor otherwise than they should do. God, 
 in his providence, takes his work before him, and he will have it 
 forward; and it is going on even when it seems to us to be going 
 backward. <I>They went</I> as the Spirit directed them, and therefore 
 <I>returned not.</I> We should not have occasion to return back as we 
 have, and to undo that by repentance which we have done amiss, and to 
 do it over again, if we were but <I>led by the Spirit</I> and followed 
 his direction. <I>The Spirit of life</I> (so some read it) <I>was in 
 the wheels,</I> which carried them on with ease and evenness, and then 
 <I>they returned not when they went.</I>

 7. The <I>rings,</I> or rims, <I>of the wheels were so high that they
 were dreadful,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 They were of a vast circumference, so that when they were reared, and 
 put in motion, the prophet was even afraid to look upon them. Note, The 
 vast compass of God's thought, and the vast reach of his design, are 
 really astonishing; when we go about to describe the circle of 
 Providence we are struck with amazement and are even swallowed up. O 
 the height and depth of God's councils! The consideration of them 
 should strike an awe upon us.

 8. They were <I>full of eyes round about.</I> This circumstance of the 
 vision is most surprising of all, and yet most significant, plainly 
 denoting that the motions of Providence are all directed by infinite 
 wisdom. The issues of things are not determined by a blind fortune, but 
 by those <I>eyes of the Lord</I> which <I>run to and fro through the 
 earth,</I> and <I>are in every place, beholding the evil and the 
 good.</I> Note, It is a great satisfaction to us, and ought to be so, 
 that, though we cannot account for the springs and tendencies of 
 events, yet they are all under the cognizance and direction of an 
 all-wise all-seeing God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The notice he took of <I>the firmament</I> above <I>over the heads 
 of the living creatures.</I> When he saw <I>the living creatures</I> 
 moving, and <I>the wheels by</I> them, he looked up, as it is proper 
 for us to do when we observe the various motions of providence in this 
 lower world; looking up, he saw <I>the firmament stretched forth over 
 the heads of the living creatures,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 What is done on earth is done under the heaven (as the scripture often 
 speaks), under its inspection and influence. Observe,

 1. What he saw: <I>The firmament was as the colour of the terrible 
 crystal,</I> truly glorious, but terribly so; the vastness and 
 brightness of it put the prophet into an amazement and struck him with 
 an awful reverence. <I>The terrible ice,</I> or <I>frost</I> (so it may 
 be read), the colour of snow congealed, or as mountains of ice in the 
 northern seas, which are very frightful. Daring sinners ask, <I>Can God 
 judge through the dark cloud?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:13">Job xxii. 13</A>.

 But that which we take to be a dark cloud is to him transparent as
 crystal, through which, <I>from the place of his habitation, he looks 
 upon all the inhabitants of the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+33:14">Ps. xxxiii. 14</A>.

 <I>Under the firmament</I> he saw <I>the wings of the living
 creatures</I> erect,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 When they pleased they used them either for flight or for covering.
 God is on high, <I>above the firmament;</I> the angels are <I>under the 
 firmament,</I> which denotes their subjection to God's dominion and 
 their readiness to fly on his errands <I>in the open firmament of 
 heaven,</I> and to serve him unanimously.

 2. What he heard. 

 (1.) He heard the <I>noise of the angels' wings,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Bees and other insects make a great noise with the vibration of their 
 wings; here the angels do so, to awaken the attention of the prophet to 
 that which God was about to say to him from <I>the firmament,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 Angels, by the providences they are employed in, sound God's alarms to 
 the children of men and stir them up to <I>hear his voice;</I> for that 
 is it that <I>cries in the city</I> and is heard and understood by 
 <I>the men of wisdom. The noise of their wings</I> was loud and 
 terrible, <I>as the noise of great waters</I> (like the rout or roaring 
 of the sea), and <I>as the noise of a host,</I> the noise of war; but 
 it was articulate and intelligible, and did not <I>give an uncertain 
 sound;</I> for it was <I>the voice of speech;</I> nay, it was <I>as the 
 voice of the Almighty,</I> for <I>God,</I> by his providences, 
 <I>speaks once, yea, twice,</I> if we could by <I>perceive it,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:14">Job xxxiii. 14</A>.
 
 The <I>Lord's voice cries,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:9">Mic. vi. 9</A>.

 (2.) He heard a <I>voice from the firmament,</I> from him that sits 
 upon the throne there,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 When the angels moved they <I>made a noise with their wings;</I> but, 
 when with that they had roused a careless world, they stood still, and 
 <I>let down their wings,</I> that there might be a profound silence, 
 and so God's voice might be the better heard. The voice of Providence 
 is designed to open men's ears to the voice of the word, to do the 
 office of the crier, who with a loud voice charges silence while the 
 judge passes sentence. <I>He that has ears to hear, let him hear.</I>
 Note, Noises on earth should awaken our attention to the <I>voice from 
 the firmament;</I> for <I>how shall we escape if we turn away from him 
 that speaks from heaven!</I></P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 All the other parts of this vision were but a preface and introduction 
 to this. God in them had made himself known as Lord of angels and 
 supreme director of all the affairs of this lower world, whence it is 
 easy to infer that whatever God by his prophets either promises or 
 threatens to do he is able to effect it. Angels are his servants; men 
 are his tools. But now that a divine revelation is to be given to a 
 prophet, and by him to the church, we must look higher than the living 
 creatures or the wheels, and must expect that from the eternal Word, of 
 whom we have an account in these verses. Ezekiel, hearing a voice from
 the firmament, looked up, as John did, to <I>see the voice that spoke 
 with him,</I> and he <I>saw one like unto the Son of man,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:12,13">Rev. i. 12, 13</A>.

 The second person sometimes tried the <I>fashion of a man</I> 
 occasionally before he clothed himself with it for good and all; and 
 the Spirit of prophecy is called the <I>Spirit of Christ</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:11">1 Pet. i. 11</A>)

 and the <I>testimony of Jesus,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:10">Rev. xix. 10</A>.

 1. This glory of Christ that the prophet saw <I>was above the
 firmament</I> that was <I>over the heads</I> of the living creatures, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Note, The heads of angels themselves are under the feet of the Lord 
 Jesus; for the firmament that is over their heads is under his feet. 
 <I>Angels, principalities, and powers are made subject to him,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:22">1 Pet. iii. 22</A>.

 This dignity and dominion of the Redeemer before his incarnation
 magnify his condescension in his incarnation, when he was <I>made a 
 little lower than the angels,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:9">Heb. ii. 9</A>.

 2. The first thing he observed was a <I>throne;</I> for divine
 revelation comes backed and supported with a royal authority. We must 
 have an eye of faith to God and Christ as upon a throne. The first 
 thing that John discovered in his visions was <I>a throne set in 
 heaven</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:2">Rev. iv. 2</A>),

 which commands reverence and subjection. It is a throne of glory, a 
 throne of grace, a throne of triumph, a throne of government, a throne 
 of judgment. <I>The Lord has prepared his throne in the heavens,</I> 
 has prepared it for his Son, whom he has set <I>King on his holy hill 
 of Zion.</I>

 3. On the throne he saw <I>the appearance of a man.</I> This is good
 new to the children of men, that the throne above the firmament is 
 filled with one that is not ashamed to appear, even there, in the 
 likeness of man. Daniel, in vision, saw the kingdom and dominion given 
 to one <I>like the Son of man,</I> who <I>therefore</I> has 
 <I>authority given him to execute judgment because he is the Son of 
 man</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:27">John v. 27</A>),
 
 so appearing in these visions.

 4. He saw him as a prince and judge upon this throne. Though he
 appeared <I>in fashion as a man,</I> yet he appeared in more than human 
 glory, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 (1.) Is God a <I>shining light?</I> So is he: when the prophet saw him 
 he saw <I>as the colour of amber,</I> that is, a <I>brightness round 
 about;</I> for God dwells in light, and <I>covers himself with light as 
 with a garment.</I> How low did the Redeemer stoop for us when, to 
 bring about our salvation, he suffered his glory to be eclipsed by the 
 veil of his humanity! 

 (2.) Is God a <I>consuming fire?</I> So is he: from his loins, both 
 upward and downward, there was the <I>appearance of fire.</I> The fire 
 above the loins was <I>round about within the amber;</I> it was inward 
 and involved. That below the loins was more outward and open, and yet 
 that also had <I>brightness round about.</I> Some make the former to 
 signify Christ's divine nature, the glory and virtue of which are 
 hidden within the <I>colour of amber;</I> it is what no man has seen 
 nor can see. The latter they suppose to be his human nature, the glory 
 of which there were those who saw; the glory as of <I>the only begotten 
 of the Father, full of grace and truth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:14">John i. 14</A>.

 He had <I>rays coming out of his hand, and yet there was the hiding of
 his power,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:4">Hab. iii. 4</A>.

 The fire in which the Son of man appeared here might be intended to
 signify the judgments that were ready to be executed upon Judah and 
 Jerusalem, coming form that <I>fiery indignation</I> of the Almighty 
 which <I>devours the adversaries.</I> Nothing is more dreadful to the 
 most daring sinners than <I>the wrath of him that sits upon the throne, 
 and of the Lamb,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:16">Rev. vi. 16</A>.

 The day is coming when <I>the Lord Jesus shall be revealed in flaming 
 fire,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+1:7,8">2 Thess. i. 7, 8</A>.

 It concerns us therefore <I>to kiss the Son lest he be angry.</I>

 5. The throne is surrounded with a rainbow, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 It is so in St. John's vision,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:3">Rev. iv. 3</A>.

 The brightness about it was of divers colours, <I>as the bow that is in 
 the cloud in the day of rain,</I> which, as it is a display of majesty, 
 and looks very great, so it is a pledge of mercy, and looks very kind; 
 for it is a confirmation of that gracious promise God has made that he 
 will not drown the world again, and he has said, <I>I will look upon 
 the bow and remember the covenant,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:16">Gen. ix. 16</A>.

 This intimates that he who <I>sits upon the throne</I> is the
 <I>Mediator of the covenant,</I> that his dominion is for our 
 protection, not our destruction, that he interposes between us and the 
 judgments our sins have deserved, and that <I>all the promises of God 
 are in him yea and amen.</I> Now that the fire of God's wrath was 
 breaking out against Jerusalem bounds should be set to it, and he would 
 not make an utter destruction of it, for he would <I>look upon the bow 
 and remember the covenant,</I> as he promised in such a case,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:42">Lev. xxvi. 42</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> We have the conclusion of this vision. Observe, 

 1. What notion the prophet himself had of it: <I>This was the 
 appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord.</I> Here, as all 
 along, he is careful to guard against all gross corporeal thoughts of 
 God, which might derogate from the transcendent purity of his nature. 
 he does not say, <I>This was the Lord</I> (for he is invisible), but, 
 <I>This was the glory of the Lord,</I> in which he was pleased to 
 manifest himself a glorious being; yet it is not <I>the glory of the 
 Lord,</I> but <I>the likeness of that glory,</I> some faint resemblance 
 of it; nor is it any adequate likeness of that glory, but only <I>the 
 appearance of that likeness,</I> a shadow of it, and not the very 
 <I>image of the thing,</I>

 2. What impressions it made upon him: <I>When I saw it, I fell upon my 
 face.</I> 

 (1.) He was overpowered by it; the dazzling lustre of it conquered him 
 and threw him upon his face; for <I>who is able to stand before this 
 holy Lord God?</I> Or, rather, 

 (2.) He prostrated himself in a humble sense of his own unworthiness of 
 the honour now done him, and of the infinite distance which he now, 
 more than ever, perceived to be between him and God; he fell upon his 
 face in token of that holy awe and reverence of God with which his mind 
 was possessed and filled. Note, The more God is pleased to make known
 of himself to us the more low we should be before him. He <I>fell upon 
 his face</I> to adore the majesty of God, to implore his mercy and to 
 deprecate the wrath he saw ready to break out against the children of 
 his people.

 3. What instructions he had from it. All he saw was only to prepare him
 for that which he was to hear; for <I>faith comes by hearing.</I> He 
 therefore <I>heard a voice of one that spoke;</I> for we are taught by 
 words, not merely by hieroglyphics. When <I>he fell on his face,</I>
 ready to received the word, then he <I>heard the voice of one that 
 spoke;</I> for God delights to teach the humble.</P>
