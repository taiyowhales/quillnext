 The prophet seems here to launch out yet further into the prophecy of 
 the Messiah and his kingdom under the type of Cyrus; and, having the 
 great work of man's salvation by him yet more in view, he almost 
 forgets the occasion that led him into it and drops the return out of 
 Babylon; for indeed the prospect of this would be a greater comfort and 
 support to the believing pious Jews, in their captivity, than the hope 
 of that. And (as Mr. Gataker well observes) in this and similar 
 prophecies of Christ, that are couched in types, as of David and 
 Solomon, some passages agree to the type and not to the truth, other to 
 the truth and not to the type, and many to the type in one sense and 
 the truth in another. Here is, 

 I. A prophecy of the Messiah's coming with meekness, and yet with
 power, to do the Redeemer's work, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. His commission opened, which he received from the Father, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:5-9">ver. 5-9</A>.
 
 III. The joy and rejoicing with which the glad tidings of this should
 be received, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:10-12">ver. 10-12</A>.

 IV. The wonderful success of the gospel, for the overthrow of the
 devil's kingdom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:13-17">ver. 13-17</A>.

 V. The rejection and ruin of the Jews for their unbelief, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:18-25">ver. 18-25</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, <I>in whom</I> my
 soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring
 forth judgment to the Gentiles.
 &nbsp; 2  He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be
 heard in the street.
 &nbsp; 3  A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall
 he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.
 &nbsp; 4  He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set
 judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are sure that these verses are to be understood of Christ, for the
 evangelist tells us expressly that in him this prophecy was fulfilled, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:17-21">Matt. xii. 17-21</A>.

 <I>Behold</I> with an eye of faith, behold and observe, behold and
 admire, <I>my servant, whom I uphold.</I> Let the Old-Testament saints 
 behold and remember him. Now what must we behold and consider 
 concerning him?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The Father's concern for him and relation to him, the confidence he
 put and the complacency he took in him. This put an honour upon him, 
 and made him remarkable, above any other circumstance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 1. God owns him as one employed for him: He is <I>my servant.</I> 
 Though he was a Son, yet, as a Mediator, he <I>took upon him the form 
 of a servant,</I> learned obedience to the will of God and practised 
 it, and laid out himself to advance the interests of God's kingdom, and 
 so he was God's servant. 

 2. As one chosen by him: He is <I>my elect.</I> He did not thrust
 himself into the service, but was called of God, and pitched upon as 
 the fittest person for it. Infinite Wisdom made the choice and then 
 avowed it. 

 3. As one he put a confidence in: He is <I>my servant on whom I
 lean;</I> so some read it. The Father put a confidence in him that he 
 would go through with his undertaking, and, in that confidence, brought 
 many sons to glory. It was a great trust which the Father reposed in 
 the Son, but he knew him to be <I>par negotio--equal to it,</I> both 
 able and faithful. 

 4. As one he took care of: He is <I>my servant whom I uphold;</I> so we 
 read it. The Father bore him up, and bore him out, in his upholding 
 him; he stood by him and strengthened him. 

 5. As one whom he took an entire complacency in: <I>My elect, in whom
 my soul delights.</I> His delight was in him from eternity, when he was 
 <I>by him as one brought up with him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:30">Prov. viii. 30</A>.

 He had a particular satisfaction in his undertaking: he declared
 himself <I>well pleased in him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:17,17:5">Matt. iii. 17; xvii. 5</A>),

 and <I>therefore</I> loved him, because he laid down his life for the
 sheep. Let our souls delight in Christ, rely on him, and rejoice in 
 him; and thus let us be united to him, and then, for his sake, the 
 Father will be well pleased with us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The qualification of him for his office: <I>I have put my Spirit 
 upon him,</I> to enable him to go through his undertaking, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:1"><I>ch.</I> lxi. 1</A>.
 
 The Spirit did not only come, but rest, upon him
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:2"><I>ch.</I> xi. 2</A>),

 not by measure, as on others of God's servants, but without measure.
 Those whom God employs as his servants; as he will uphold them and be 
 well pleased with them, so he will put his Spirit upon them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The work to which he is appointed; it is to <I>bring forth 
 judgment to the Gentiles,</I> that is, in infinite wisdom, holiness, 
 and equity, to set up a religion in the world under the bonds of which 
 the Gentiles should come and the blessings of which they should enjoy. 
 The judgments of the Lord, which had been hidden from the Gentiles 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:20">Ps. cxlvii. 20</A>),

 he came to bring forth to the Gentiles, for he was <I>to be a light to
 lighten them.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The mildness and tenderness with which he should pursue this 
 undertaking, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 He shall carry it on, 

 1. In silence, and without noise: <I>He shall not strive nor cry.</I> 
 It shall not be proclaimed, <I>Lo, here, is Christ</I> or <I>Lo, he is 
 there;</I> as when great princes ride in progress or make a public 
 entry. He shall have no trumpet sounded before him, nor any noisy 
 retinue to follow him. The opposition he meets with he shall not strive 
 against, but patiently <I>endure the contradiction of sinners against 
 himself.</I> His kingdom is spiritual, and therefore its weapons are 
 not carnal, nor is its appearance pompous; it comes not with 
 observation. 

 2. Gently, and without rigour. Those that are wicked he will be
 patient with; when he has begun to crush them, so that they are as 
 bruised reeds, he will give them space to repent and not immediately 
 break them; though they are very offensive, as smoking flax

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:5"><I>ch.</I> lxv. 5</A>),

 yet he will bear with them, as he did with Jerusalem. Those that are
 weak he will be tender of; those that have but a little life, a little 
 heat, that are weak as a reed, oppressed with doubts and fears, <I>as a 
 bruised reed,</I> that are as <I>smoking flax,</I> as the wick of a 
 candle newly lighted, which is ready to go out again, he will not 
 despise them, will not plead against them with his great power, nor lay 
 upon them more work or more suffering than they can bear, which would 
 break and quench them, but will graciously consider their frame. More 
 is implied than is expressed. <I>He will not break the bruised
 reed,</I> but will strengthen it, that it may become a cedar in the 
 courts of our God. <I>He will not quench the smoking flax,</I> but
 blow it up into a flame. Note, Jesus Christ is very tender toward those 
 that have true grace, though they are but weak in it, and accepts the 
 willingness of the spirit, pardoning and passing by the weakness of the 
 flesh.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The courage and constancy with which he should persevere in this 
 undertaking, so as to carry his point at last 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>He shall not fail nor be discouraged.</I> Though he meets with hard 
 service and much opposition, and foresees how ungrateful the world will 
 be, yet he goes on with his part of the work, till he is able to say, 
 <I>Is is finished;</I> and he enables his apostles and ministers to go 
 on with theirs too, and not to fail nor be discouraged, till they also 
 have finished their testimony. And thus he accomplishes what he
 undertook.

 1. <I>He brings forth judgment unto truth.</I> By a long course of 
 miracles, and his resurrection at last, he shall fully evince the truth 
 of his doctrine and the divine origin and authority of that holy 
 religion which he came to establish. 

 2. He <I>sets judgment in the earth.</I> He erects his government in 
 the world, a church for himself among men, reforms the world, and by 
 the power of his gospel and grace fixes such principles in the minds of 
 men as tend to make them wise and just. 

 3. <I>The isles</I> of the Gentiles <I>wait for his law,</I> wait for
 his gospel, that is, bid it welcome as if it had been a thing they had 
 long waited for. They shall become his disciples, shall sit at his 
 feet, and be ready to receive the law from his mouth. <I>What wilt thou 
 have us to do?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  Thus saith God the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, he that created the heavens, and
 stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that
 which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people
 upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:
 &nbsp; 6  I the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> have called thee in righteousness, and will hold
 thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of
 the people, for a light of the Gentiles;
 &nbsp; 7  To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the
 prison, <I>and</I> them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.
 &nbsp; 8  I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: that <I>is</I> my name: and my glory will I not
 give to another, neither my praise to graven images.
 &nbsp; 9  Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do
 I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.
 &nbsp; 10  Sing unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> a new song, <I>and</I> his praise from the end
 of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is
 therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.
 &nbsp; 11  Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up <I>their
 voice,</I> the villages <I>that</I> Kedar doth inhabit: let the
 inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the
 mountains.
 &nbsp; 12  Let them give glory unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and declare his praise in
 the islands.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is 

 I. The covenant God made with and the commission he gave to the 
 Messiah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:5-7"><I>v.</I> 5-7</A>,

 which are an exposition of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>,

 <I>Behold my servant, whom I uphold.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The royal titles by which the great God here makes himself known, 
 and distinguishes himself from all pretenders, speak very much his 
 glory 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Thus saith God the Lord.</I> And who are thou, Lord? Why, he is the
 fountain of all being and therefore the fountain of all power. He is 
 the fountain of being, 

 1. In the upper world; for <I>he created the heavens and stretched them 
 out</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:22"><I>ch.</I> xl. 22</A>),

 and keeps the vast expanse still upon the stretch.

 2. In the lower world: for <I>he spread forth the earth,</I> and made
 it a capacious habitation, <I>and that which comes out of it</I> is 
 produced by his power. 

 3. In the world of mankind: <I>He gives breath to the people upon
 it,</I> not only air to breathe in, but the breath of life itself and 
 organs to breathe with; nay, he gives <I>spirit,</I> the powers and 
 faculties of a rational soul, to those that walk therein. Now this is 
 prefixed to God's covenant with the Messiah, and the commission given 
 him, not only to show that he has authority to make such a covenant and 
 give such a commission, and had power sufficient to bear him out, but 
 that the design of the work of redemption was to maintain the honour of 
 the Creator, and to restore man to the allegiance he owes to God as his 
 Maker.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The assurances which he gives to the Messiah of his presence with 
 him in all he did pursuant to his undertaking speak much encouragement 
 to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 (1.) God owns that the Messiah did not take the honour of being 
 Mediator to himself, but was called of God, that he was no intruder, no 
 usurper, but was fairly brought to it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:4">Heb. v. 4</A>):

 <I>I have called thee in righteousness.</I> God not only did him no
 wrong in calling him to this hard service, he having voluntarily 
 offered himself to it, but did himself right in providing for his own 
 honour and performing the word which he had spoken.

 (2.) He promises to stand by him and strengthen him in it, to hold his 
 hand, not only to his work, but in it, to hold his hand, that it might 
 not shake, that it might not fail, and so to keep him. When an angel 
 was sent from heaven to strengthen him in his agonies, and the Father 
 himself was with him, then this promise was fulfilled. Note, Those whom 
 God calls he will own and help, and will hold their hands.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The great intentions of this commission speak abundance of comfort 
 to the children of men. He was given <I>for a covenant of the 
 people,</I> for a mediator, or guarantee, of the covenant of grace, 
 which is all summed up in him. God, in giving us Christ, has with him 
 freely given us all the blessings of the new covenant. Two glorious 
 blessings Christ, in his gospel, brings with him to the Gentile 
 world--light and liberty. 

 (1.) He is given <I>for a light to the Gentiles,</I> not only to reveal 
 to them what they were concerned to know, and which otherwise they 
 could not have known, but to open the blind eyes, that they might know 
 it. By his Spirit in the word he presents the object; by his Spirit in 
 the heart he prepared the organ. When the gospel came light came, a
 great light, to those that sat in darkness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:16,Joh+3:19">Matt. iv. 16; John iii. 19</A>.

 And St. Paul was sent to the Gentiles <I>to open their eyes,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:18">Acts xxvi. 18</A>.
 
 Christ is the light of the world.

 (2.) He is sent to proclaim liberty to the captives, as Cyrus did, 
 <I>to bring out the prisoners;</I> not only to open the prison-doors, 
 and give them leave to go out, which was all that Cyrus could do, but 
 to bring them out, to induce and enable them to make use of their 
 liberty, which none did but those whose spirits God stirred up. This 
 Christ does by his grace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The ratification and confirmation of this grant. That we may be 
 assured of the validity of it consider, 

 1. The authority of him that makes the promise

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>I am the Lord, Jehovah, that is my name,</I> and that was the name 
 by which he made himself known when he began to perform the promise 
 made to the patriarchs; whereas, before, he manifested himself by the 
 name of God Almighty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:3">Exod. vi. 3</A>.

 If he is the Lord that gives being and birth to all things, he will
 give being and birth to this promise. If his name be <I>Jehovah,</I>
 which speaks him God alone, we may be sure his name is <I>jealous,</I> 
 and he <I>will not give his glory to another,</I> whoever it is that 
 stands in competition with him, especially not to <I>graven images.</I> 
 He will send the Messiah to open men's eyes, that so he may turn them 
 from the service of dumb idols to serve the living God, because, though 
 he has long winked at the times of ignorance, he will now maintain his 
 prerogative, and will not give his glory to graven images. He will 
 perform his word because he will not lose the honour of being true to 
 it, nor be ever charged with falsehood by the worshippers of false 
 gods. He will deliver his people from under the power of idolaters 
 because it looks as if he had given his praise to graven images when he 
 gives up his own worshippers to be worshippers of images.

 2. The accomplishment of the promises he had formerly made concerning 
 his church, which are proofs of the truth of his word and the kindness 
 he bears to his people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>Behold, the former things have come to pass;</I> hitherto the Lord 
 has helped his church, has supported her under former burdens, relieved 
 her in former straits; and this in performance of the promises made to 
 the fathers. <I>There has not failed one word,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:56">1 Kings viii. 56</A>.
 
 <I>And</I> now <I>new things do I declare.</I> Now I will make new
 promises, which shall as certainly be fulfilled in their season as old 
 ones were; now I will bestow new favours, such as have not been 
 conferred formerly. Old-Testament blessings you have had abundantly;
 now I declare New-Testament blessings, not a fruitful country and 
 dominion over your neighbours, but <I>spiritual blessings in heavenly 
 things. Before they spring forth</I> in the preaching of the gospel 
 <I>I tell you of them,</I> under the type and figure of the former 
 things." Note, The receipt of former mercies may encourage us to hope 
 for further mercies; for God is constant in his care for his people, 
 and his compassions are still new.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The song of joy and praise which should be sung hereupon to the 
 glory of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>Sing unto the Lord a new song,</I> a New-Testament song. The giving 
 of Christ for <I>a light to the Gentiles</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 was a new thing, and very surprising.

 The apostle speaks of it as a mystery which, in other ages, was not 
 made known, as it is now revealed, <I>that the Gentiles should be 
 fellow-heirs,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:5,6">Eph. iii. 5, 6</A>.

 Now, this being the new thing which God declares, the newness of the 
 song which is to be sung on this occasion is this, that whereas, 
 before, the songs of the Lord were very much confined to the temple at 
 Jerusalem (David's psalms were in the language of the Jews only, and 
 sung by them in their own country only; for, when they were in a 
 strange land, they hung their harps on the willow-trees and could not 
 sing the Lord's song, as we find, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:2-4">Ps. cxxxvii. 2-4</A>),

 now the songs of holy joy and praise shall be sung all the world over.
 The Gentile nations shall share equally with the Jews in New-Testament 
 blessings, and therefore shall join in New-Testament praises and acts 
 of worship. There shall be churches set up in Gentile nations and they
 shall sing a new song. The conversion of the Gentiles is often foretold 
 under this notion, as appears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:9-11">Rom. xv. 9-11</A>.

 It is here promised that the praises of God's grace shall be sung with
 joy and thankfulness,

 1. By those that live in <I>the end of the earth,</I> in countries that 
 lie most remote from Jerusalem. <I>From the uttermost parts of the 
 earth have we heard songs,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:16"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 16</A>.

 This was fulfilled when Christianity was planted in our land. 

 2. By mariners and merchants, and those that <I>go down to the sea,</I> 
 that do business in great waters, and suck the riches of the sea, and 
 so make themselves masters of the fulness thereof and all that is 
 therein, with which they shall praise God, and justly, for it is his, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:1,95:5">Ps. xxiv. 1; xcv. 5</A>.

 The Jews traded little at sea; if therefore God's praises be sung by
 those that go down to the sea, it must be by Gentiles. Sea-faring men
 are called upon to praise God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:23">Ps. cvii. 23</A>.

 3. By <I>the islands and the inhabitants thereof,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>,
 
 and again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Let them <I>declare his praise in the islands,</I> the isles of the 
 Gentiles, probably referring to the islands of Greece. 

 4. <I>By the wilderness and the cities thereof, and the villages of
 Kedar.</I> These lay east from Jerusalem, as the islands lay west, so 
 that the gospel songs should be sung from the rising of the sun to the 
 going down of the same. The whole Gentile world had been like an 
 island, cut off from communication with God's church, and like a 
 wilderness, uncultivated and bringing forth no fruit to God; but now 
 the islands and the wilderness shall praise God. 

 5. By <I>the inhabitants of the rock,</I> and those that dwell <I>on
 the tops of the mountains,</I> not only the Gentiles, but the poorest 
 and meanest and most despicable, those that dwell in cottages, as well 
 as those that inhabit cities and villages. The rude and most
 barbarous, as the mountaineers commonly are, shall be civilized by the 
 gospel. Or by the inhabitants of the rock may be meant the inhabitants 
 of that part of Arabia which is called <I>Petr&aelig;a--the rocky.</I> 
 Perhaps the neighbouring countries shared in the joy of the Israelites 
 when they returned out of Babylon and some of them came and joined with 
 them in their praises; but we find not that it was to any such degree 
 as might fully answer this illustrious prophecy, and must conclude that 
 it reaches further, and was fulfilled in that which many other 
 prophecies of the joy of the nations are said in the New-Testament to 
 be fulfilled in, the conversion of the Gentiles to the faith of Christ. 
 When they are brought into the church they are brought to give glory to 
 the Lord; then they are to him for a name and a praise, and they make 
 it their business to praise him. He is glorified in them and by 
 them.</P>

 jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall
 prevail against his enemies.

 It comes all to one whether we make these verses (as some do) the song
 itself that is to be sung by the Gentile world or a prophecy of what 
 God will do to make way for the singing of that song, that evangelical 
 new song.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He will appear in his power and glory more than ever. So he did in 
 the preaching of his gospel, in the divine power and energy which went 
 along with it, and in the wonderful success it had in the <I>pulling 
 down of Satan's stronghold,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 <I>He had long held his peace, and been still, and refrained himself, 
 while he winked at the times of the ignorance of the Gentile world</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:30">Acts xvii. 30</A>),
 
 and <I>suffered all nations to walk in their own ways</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:16">Acts xiv. 16</A>);

 but now <I>he shall go forth as a mighty man, as a man of war,</I> to
 attack the devil's kingdom and give it a fatal blow. The going forth of 
 the gospel is thus represented, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:2">Rev. vi. 2</A>.

 Christ, in it, went forth conquering and to conquer. The ministry of
 the apostles is called their <I>warfare;</I> and they were the soldiers 
 of Jesus Christ. <I>He shall stir up jealousy,</I> shall appear more 
 jealous than ever for the glory of his own name and against idolatry.

 1. <I>He shall cry,</I> in the preaching of his word, <I>cry like a 
 travailing woman;</I> for the ministers of Christ preached as men in 
 earnest, and that travailed in birth again till they saw Christ formed 
 in the souls of the people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:19">Gal. iv. 19</A>.

 <I>He shall cry, yea, roar,</I> in the gospel woes, which are more
 terrible than the roaring of a lion, and which must be preached along 
 with gospel blessings to awaken a sleeping world.

 2. He shall conquer by the power of his Spirit: <I>He shall prevail 
 against his enemies,</I> shall prevail to make them friends, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:21">Col. i. 21</A>.
 
 Those that contradict and blaspheme his gospel, he shall prevail to put
 them to silence and shame. He will destroy and devour at once all the 
 oppositions of the powers of darkness. Satan shall fall as lightning 
 from heaven, and he that had the power of death shall be destroyed. As 
 a type and figure of this, to make way for the redemption of the Jews 
 out of Babylon, God will humble the pride, and break the power, of 
 their oppressors, and <I>will at once destroy and devour</I> the 
 Babylonian monarchy. In accomplishing this destruction of Babylon by 
 the Persian army under the command of Cyrus, <I>he will make waste 
 mountains and hills,</I> level the country, and <I>dry up all their 
 herbs.</I> The army, as usual, shall either carry off the forage or 
 destroy it, and by laying bridges of boats over rivers shall turn them 
 into islands, and so drain the fens and low grounds, to make way for 
 the march of their army, that the pools shall be dried up. Thus, when
 the gospel shall be preached, it shall have a free course, and that 
 which hinders the progress of it shall be taken out of the way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He will manifest his favour and grace towards those whose spirits 
 he had stirred up to follow him, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:5">Ezra i. 5</A>.

 Those who ask the way to Zion he will show the way, and lead in it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Those who by nature were blind, and those who, being under convictions 
 of sin and wrath are quite at a loss and know not what to do with 
 themselves, God will <I>lead by a way that they knew not,</I> will show 
 them the way to life and happiness by Jesus Christ, who is the way, and 
 will conduct and carry them on in that way, which before they were 
 strangers to. Thus, in the conversion of Paul, he was struck blind 
 first, and then God revealed his Son in him, and made the scales to 
 fall from his eyes. They are weak in knowledge, and the truths of God
 at first seem unintelligible; but God will <I>make darkness light 
 before them,</I> and knowledge shall be easy to them. They are weak in 
 duty, the commands of God seem impracticable, and insuperable 
 difficulties are in the way of their obedience; but God will make 
 <I>crooked things straight;</I> their way shall be plain, and the yoke 
 easy. Those whom God brings into the right way he will guide in it. As 
 a type of this, he will lead the Jews, when they return out of 
 captivity, in a ready road to their own land again, and nothing shall 
 occur to perplex or embarrass them in their journey. These are great 
 things, and kind things, very great and very kind; but lest any should 
 say, "They are too great, too kind, to be expected from God by such an 
 undeserving people as that of the Jews, such an undeserving world as 
 that of the Gentiles," he adds, <I>These things will I do unto 
 them,</I> take my word for it I will, and <I>I will not forsake 
 them;</I> he that begins to show this great mercy will go on to do them 
 good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He will particularly put those to confusion who adhere to idols 
 notwithstanding the attempts made by the preaching of the gospel to 
 turn them from idols 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>They shall be turned back, and greatly ashamed, that trust in graven 
 images.</I> The Babylonians shall when they see how the Jews, who 
 despise their images, are owned and delivered by the God they worship 
 without images, and the Gentiles when they see how idolatry falls 
 before the preaching of the gospel, is scattered like darkness before 
 the light of the sun, and melts like snow before its heat. They shall 
 be ashamed that ever they said to these molten images, <I>You are our 
 gods;</I> for how can those help their worshippers who cannot help 
 themselves, nor save themselves from falling into contempt? In times of 
 reformation, when many turn from iniquity, and sin, being generally 
 deserted, becomes unfashionable, it may be hoped that those who will 
 not otherwise be reclaimed will be wrought upon by that consideration 
 to be ashamed of it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.
 &nbsp; 19  Who <I>is</I> blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger
 <I>that</I> I sent? who <I>is</I> blind as <I>he that is</I> perfect, and blind
 as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s servant?
 &nbsp; 20  Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the
 ears, but he heareth not.
 &nbsp; 21  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he
 will magnify the law, and make <I>it</I> honourable.
 &nbsp; 22  But this <I>is</I> a people robbed and spoiled; <I>they are</I> all of
 them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are
 for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith,
 Restore.
 &nbsp; 23  Who among you will give ear to this? <I>who</I> will hearken and
 hear for the time to come?
 &nbsp; 24  Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did
 not the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not
 walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law.
 &nbsp; 25  Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and
 the strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round about,
 yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid <I>it</I> not to
 heart.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet, having spoken by way of comfort and encouragement to the 
 believing Jews who waited for the consolation of Israel, here turns to 
 those among them who were unbelieving, for their conviction and 
 humiliation. Among those who were in captivity in Babylon there were 
 some who were as the evil figs in Jeremiah's vision, who were sent 
 thither <I>for their hurt, to be removed into all the kingdoms of the 
 earth, for a reproach and a proverb,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+24:9">Jer. xxiv. 9</A>.

 In them there was a type of the Jews who rejected Christ and were
 rejected by him, and then fell more than ever under the curse, when 
 those who believed were inheriting the blessing; for they were broken, 
 and ruined, and remain dispersed unto this day. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The call that is given to this people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "<I>Hear, you deaf,</I> and attend to the joyful sound, <I>and look you 
 blind, that you may see</I> the joyful light." There is no absurdity in 
 this command, nor is it unbecoming the wisdom and goodness of God to 
 call us to do that good which yet of ourselves we are not sufficient 
 for; for those have natural powers which they may employ so as to do 
 better than they do, and may have supernatural grace if it be not their 
 own fault, who yet labour under a moral impotency to that which is 
 good. This call to the deaf to hear and the blind to see is like the 
 command given to the man that had the withered hand to stretch it 
 forth; though he could not do this, because it was withered, yet, if he 
 had not attempted to do it, he would not have been healed, and his 
 being healed thereupon was owing, not to his act, but to the divine 
 power.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The character that is given of them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>):

 <I>Who is blind, but my servant, or deaf as my messenger?</I> The 
 people of the Jews were in profession God's servants, and their priests 
 and elders his messengers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:7">Mal. ii. 7</A>);
 
 but they were deaf and blind. The

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:18">verse before</A>

 may be understood as spoken to the Gentile idolaters, whom he calls
 <I>deaf</I> and <I>blind,</I> because they worshipped gods that were 
 so. "But," says he, "no wonder you are deaf and blind when my own 
 people are as bad as you, and many of them as much set upon 
 idolatry."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He complains of their sottishness--they are blind; and of their
 stubbornness--they are deaf. They were even worse than the Gentiles
 themselves. <I>Corruptio optimi est pessima--What is best becomes, when
 corrupted, the worst.</I> "Who is so wilfully, so scandalously, blind 
 and deaf as my servant and my messenger, as Jacob who is my servant 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:8"><I>ch.</I> xli. 8</A>),

 and as their prophets and teachers who are my messengers? Who is blind
 as he that in profession and pretension is perfect, that should come 
 nearer to perfection than other people, their priests and prophets? The 
 one prophesies falsely, and the other bears rule by their means; and 
 who so blind as those that will not see when they have the light 
 shining in their faces?" Note, 

 (1.) It is a common thing, but a very sad thing, for those that in 
 profession are God's servants and messengers to be themselves blind and 
 deaf in spiritual things, ignorant, erroneous, and very careless. 

 (2.) Blindness and deafness in spiritual things are worse in those that 
 profess themselves to be God's servants and messengers than in others.
 It is in them the greater sin and shame, the greater dishonour to God, 
 and to themselves a greater damnation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The prophet goes on 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>)

 to describe the blindness and obstinacy of the Jewish nation, just as 
 our Saviour describes it in his time 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:14,15">Matt. xiii. 14, 15</A>):

 <I>Seeing many things, but thou observest not.</I> Multitudes are
 ruined for want of observing that which they cannot but see; they 
 perish, not through ignorance, but mere carelessness. The Jews in our 
 Saviour's time saw many proofs of his divine mission, but they did not 
 observe them; they seemed to open their ears to him, but they did not 
 hear, that is, they did not heed, did not understand, or believe, or 
 obey, and then it was all one as if they had not heard.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The care God will take of the honour of his own name, 
 notwithstanding their blindness and deafness, especially of his word, 
 which he has magnified above all his name. <I>Shall the unbelief and 
 obstinacy of men make the promise of God of no effect? God forbid,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:3,4">Rom. iii. 3, 4</A>.

 No, though they are blind and deaf, God will be no loser in his glory

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>The Lord is well pleased for his righteousness' sake;</I> not well 
 pleased with their sin, but well pleased in the manifestation of his 
 own righteousness, in rejecting them for rejecting the great salvation. 
 He speaks as one well pleased,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:24"><I>ch.</I> i. 24</A>:

 <I>Ah! I will ease me of my adversaries;</I> and 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:13">Ezek. v. 13</A>,

 <I>I will be comforted.</I> The scripture was fulfilled in the casting
 off of the Jews as well as in the calling in of the Gentiles, and 
 therein the Lord will be well pleased. <I>He will magnify the law</I> 
 (divine revelation in all the parts of it) <I>and will make it 
 honourable.</I> The law is truly honourable, and the things of it are 
 great things; and, if men will not magnify it by their obedience to it, 
 God will magnify it himself by punishing them for their disobedience.
 He will magnify the law by accomplishing what is written in it, will 
 magnify its authority, its efficacy, its equity. He will do it at
 last, when all men shall be judged by the law of liberty,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:12">James ii. 12</A>.

 He is doing it every day. What is it that God is doing in the world,
 but magnifying the law and making it honourable?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The calamities God will bring upon the Jewish nation for their 
 wilful blindness and deafness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 They are <I>robbed and spoiled.</I> Those that were impenitent and 
 unreformed in Babylon were sentenced to perpetual captivity. It was for 
 their sins that they were spoiled of all their possessions, not only in 
 their own land, but in the land of their enemies. They were some of 
 them <I>snared in holes,</I> and others <I>hidden in prison-houses.</I> 
 They cannot help themselves, for they are snared. Their friends cannot
 help them, for they are hidden; and their enemies have forgotten them 
 in their prisons. They, and all they have, are for a prey and for a 
 spoil; and there is none that delivers either by force or ransom, nor 
 any that dares say to the proud oppressors, <I>Restore.</I> There they 
 lie, and there they are likely to lie. This had its full accomplishment 
 in the final destruction of the Jewish nation by the Romans, which God 
 brought upon them for rejecting the gospel of Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The counsel given them in order to their relief; for, though their 
 case be sad, it is not desperate.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The generality of them are deaf; they will not hearken to the voice 
 of God's word. He will therefore try his rod, and see <I>who among them 
 will give ear to that,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 We must not despair concerning those who have been long reasoned with 
 in vain; some of them may, at length, give ear and hearken. If one 
 method not take effect, another may, and sinners shall be left 
 inexcusable. Observe, 

 (1.) We may all of us, if we will, hear the voice of God, and we are 
 called and invited to hear it. 

 (2.) It is worth while to enquire who they are that perceive God 
 speaking to them and are willing to hear him. 

 (3.) Of the many that hear the voice of God there are very few that 
 hearken to it or heed it, that hear it with attention and application. 
 
 (4.) In hearing the word we must have an eye to the time to come. We
 must hear for hereafter, for what may occur between us and the grave; 
 we must especially hear for eternity. We must hear the word with 
 another world in our eye.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The counsel is, 

 (1.) To acknowledge the hand of God in their afflictions, and, whoever 
 were the instruments, to have an eye to him as the principal agent

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 "<I>Who gave Jacob and Israel,</I> that people that used to have such 
 an interest in heaven and such a dominion on earth, who gave them 
 <I>for a spoil to the robbers,</I> as they are now to the Babylonians 
 and to the Romans? <I>Did not the Lord?</I> You know he did; consider 
 it then, and hear his voice in these judgments." 

 (2.) To acknowledge that they had provoked God thus to abandon them, 
 and had brought all these calamities upon themselves.

 [1.] These punishments were first inflicted on them for their 
 disobedience to the laws of God: It is he <I>against whom we have 
 sinned;</I> the prophet puts himself into the number of the sinners, As 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:7,8">Dan. ix. 7, 8</A>.

 "<I>We have sinned;</I> we have all brought fuel to the fire; and there 
 are those among us that have wilfully refused to walk in his ways." 
 Jacob and Israel would never have been given up to the robbers if they 
 had not by their iniquities sold themselves. <I>Therefore</I> it is,
 because they have violated the commands of the law, that God has 
 brought upon them the curses of the law; he has not dropped, but 
 <I>poured upon him the fury of his anger and the strength of 
 battle,</I> all the desolations of war, which have <I>set him on fire 
 round about;</I> for God surrounds the wicked with his favours. See
 the power of God's anger; there is no resisting it, no escaping it.
 See the mischief that sin makes; it provokes God to anger against a 
 people, and so kindles a universal conflagration, sets all on fire.

 [2.] These judgments were continued upon them for their senselessness 
 and incorrigibleness under the rod of God. The fire of God's wrath 
 kindled upon him, and <I>he knew it not,</I> was not aware of it, took 
 no notice of the judgments, at least not of the hand of God in them. 
 Nay, <I>it burned him,</I> and, though he could not then but know it 
 and feel it, yet he <I>laid it not to heart,</I> was not awakened by 
 the fiery rebukes he was under nor at all affected with them. Those who 
 are not humbled by less judgments must expect greater; for when God 
 judges he will overcome.</P>
