 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This whole chapter is all to the same purport, all in the same strain; 
 it is a part of God's covenant with his church, which is spoken of in 
 the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:21">last verse</A>

 of the foregoing chapter, and the blessings here promised are the
 fruits of the word and Spirit there promised. The long continuance of 
 the church, even unto the utmost ages of time, was there promised, and 
 here the large extent of the church, even unto the utmost regions of 
 the earth; and both these tend to the honour of the Redeemer. It is 
 here promised, 

 I. That the church shall be enlightened and shone upon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. That it shall be enlarged and great additions made to it, to join
 in the service of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:3-8">ver. 3-8</A>.

 III. That the new converts shall be greatly serviceable to the church 
 and to the interests of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:9-13">ver. 9-13</A>.

 IV. That the church shall be in great honour and reputation among men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:14-16">ver. 14-16</A>.

 V. That it shall enjoy a profound peace and tranquility, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:17,18">ver. 17, 18</A>.
 
 VI. That, the members of it being all righteous, the glory and joy of 
 it shall be everlasting, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:19-22">ver. 19-22</A>.

 Now this has some reference to the peaceable and prosperous condition 
 which the Jews were sometimes in after their return out of captivity 
 into their own land; but it certainly looks further, and was to have 
 its full accomplishment in the kingdom of the Messiah, the enlargement 
 of that kingdom by the bringing in of the Gentiles into it, and the 
 spiritual blessings in heavenly things by Christ Jesus with which it 
 should be enriched, and all these earnests of eternal joy and 
 glory.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> is risen upon thee.
 &nbsp; 2  For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross
 darkness the people: but the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall arise upon thee, and his
 glory shall be seen upon thee.
 &nbsp; 3  And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the
 brightness of thy rising.
 &nbsp; 4  Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all they gather
 themselves together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come from
 far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at <I>thy</I> side.
 &nbsp; 5  Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and thine heart shall
 fear, and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be
 converted unto thee, the forces of the Gentiles shall come unto
 thee.
 &nbsp; 6  The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of
 Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall
 bring gold and incense; and they shall show forth the praises of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 7  All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee,
 the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee: they shall come up
 with acceptance on mine altar, and I will glorify the house of my
 glory.

 their windows?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is here promised that the gospel temple shall be very lightsome and 
 very large.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It shall be very lightsome: <I>Thy light has come.</I> When the Jews 
 returned out of captivity they had <I>light and gladness, and joy and 
 honour;</I> they then were made to <I>know the Lord</I> and to 
 <I>rejoice in his great goodness;</I> and upon both accounts their 
 light came. When the Redeemer came to Zion he brought light with him, 
 he himself came to be a light. Now observe, 

 1. What this light is, and whence it springs: <I>The Lord shall arise
 upon thee</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 <I>the glory of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)

 <I>shall be seen upon thee.</I> God is the father and fountain of 
 lights, and it is in his light that we shall see light. As far as we 
 have the knowledge of God in us, and the favour of God towards us, our 
 light has come. When God appears to us, and we have the comfort of his 
 favour, then <I>the glory of the Lord rises upon us</I> as the morning 
 light; when he appears for us, and we have the credit of his favour, 
 when he shows us some token for good and proclaims his favour to us, 
 then his glory is seen upon us, as it was upon Israel in the <I>pillar 
 of cloud and fire.</I> When Christ arose as the sun of righteousness, 
 and in him <I>the day-spring from on high visited us,</I> then <I>the 
 glory of the Lord was</I> seen upon us, the glory <I>as of the 
 first-begotten of the Father.</I> 

 2. What a foil there shall be to this light: <I>Darkness shall cover 
 the earth;</I> but, though it be gross darkness, darkness that might be 
 felt, like that of Egypt, that shall overspread the people, yet the 
 church, like Goshen, shall have light at the same time. When the case 
 of the nations that have not the gospel shall be very melancholy, those 
 <I>dark corners of the earth</I> being <I>full of the habitations of 
 cruelty</I> to poor souls, the state of the church shall be very 
 pleasant. 

 3. What is the duty which the rising of this light calls for:
 "<I>Arise, shine;</I> not only receive this light, and" (as the margin 
 reads it) "<I>be enlightened by it,</I> but reflect this light; 
 <I>arise and shine</I> with rays borrowed from it." The children of 
 light ought to shine as lights in the world. If God's glory be seen 
 upon us to our honour, we ought not only with our lips, but in our 
 lives, to return the praise of it <I>to his honour,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:16,Php+2:15">Matt. v. 16; Phil. ii. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It shall be very large. When the Jews were settled again in their 
 own land, after their captivity, many of the people of the land joined 
 themselves to them; but it does not appear that there ever was any such 
 numerous accession to them as would answer the fulness of this 
 prophecy; and therefore we must conclude that this looks further, to 
 the bringing of the Gentiles into the gospel church, not their flocking 
 to one particular place, though under that type it is here described. 
 There is no place now that is the centre of the church's unity; but the 
 promise respects their flocking to Christ, and coming by faith, and 
 hope, and holy love, into that society which is incorporated by the 
 charter of his gospel, and of the unity of which he only is the 
 centre--that family which is named from him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:15">Eph. iii. 15</A>.

 The gospel church is expressly called <I>Zion</I> and <I>Jerusalem,</I>
 and under that notion all believers are said to <I>come</I> to it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:22">Heb. xii. 22</A>.
 
 <I>You have come unto Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the
 heavenly Jerusalem</I>), which serves for a key to this prophecy, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:19">Eph. ii. 19</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What shall invite such multitudes to the church: "They shall <I>come 
 to thy light and to the brightness of thy rising,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 They shall be allured to join themselves to thee," 

 (1.) "By the light that shines upon thee," the light of the glorious 
 gospel, which the churches hold forth, in consequence of which they are 
 called <I>golden candlesticks.</I> This light which discovers so much 
 of God and his good will to man, by which life and immortality are 
 brought to light, this shall invite all the serious well-affected part 
 of mankind to come and join themselves to the church, that they may 
 have the benefit of this light to inform them concerning truth and 
 duty. 

 (2.) "By the light with which thou shinest." The purity and love of the 
 primitive Christians, their heavenly-mindedness, contempt of the world, 
 and patient sufferings, were the brightness of the church's rising, 
 which drew many into it. The beauty of holiness was the powerful 
 attractive by which Christ had a willing people brought to him in 
 <I>the day of his power,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:3">Ps. cx. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What multitudes shall come to the church. Great numbers <I>shall 
 come, Gentiles</I> (or <I>nations</I>) <I>of those that are saved,</I> 
 as it is expressed with allusion to this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:24">Rev. xxi. 24</A>.

 <I>Nations</I> shall be <I>discipled</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:19">Matt. xxviii. 19</A>),

 and even kings, men of figure, power, and influence, shall be <I>added
 to the church.</I> They come from all parts

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Lift up thy eyes round about, and see</I> them coming, <I>devout men 
 out of every nation under heaven,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:5">Acts ii. 5</A>.

 See how <I>white the fields are already to the harvest,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:35">John iv. 35</A>.

 See them coming in a body, as one man, and with one consent: They
 <I>gather themselves together,</I> that they may strengthen one 
 another's hands, and encourage one another. <I>Come, and let us go,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:3"><I>ch.</I> ii. 3</A>.

 "They come from the remotest parts: <I>They come to thee from far,</I>
 having <I>heard the report</I> of thee, as the queen of Sheba, or 
 <I>seen thy star in the east,</I> as the wise men, and they will not be 
 discouraged by the length of the journey from coming to thee. There 
 shall come some of both sexes. Sons and daughters shall come in the 
 most dutiful manner, as thy sons and thy daughters, resolved to be of 
 thy family, to submit to the laws of thy family and put themselves 
 under the tuition of it. They shall come <I>to be nursed at thy 
 side,</I> to have their education with thee from their cradle." The 
 church's children must be nursed at her side, not sent out to be nursed 
 among strangers; there, where alone the unadulterated milk of the word 
 is to be had, must the church's new-born babes be nursed, <I>that they 
 may grow thereby,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:1,2">1 Pet. ii. 1, 2</A>.

 Those that would enjoy the dignities and privileges of Christ's family 
 must submit to the discipline of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What they shall bring with them and what advantage shall accrue to 
 the church by their accession to it. Those that are brought into the 
 church by the grace of God will be sure to bring all they are worth in 
 with them, which with themselves they will devote to the honour and 
 service of God and do good with in their places. 

 (1.) The merchants shall write <I>holiness to the Lord</I> upon their 
 merchandise and their hire, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:18"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 18</A>.

 "<I>The abundance of the sea,</I> either the wealth that is fetched out
 of the sea (the fish, the pearls) or that which is imported by sea, 
 <I>shall</I> all <I>be converted to thee</I> and to thy use." The 
 wealth of the rich merchants shall be laid out in works of piety and 
 charity. 

 (2.) The mighty men of the nations shall employ their might in the 
 service of the church: "<I>The forces,</I> or troops, <I>of the 
 Gentiles shall come unto thee,</I> to guard thy coasts, strengthen thy 
 interests, and, if occasion be, to fight thy battles." The forces of 
 the Gentiles had often been against the church, but now they shall be 
 for it; for as God, when he pleases, can, and, when we please him, 
 will, make even <I>our enemies to be at peace with us</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+16:7">Prov. xvi. 7</A>),
 
 so, when Christ overcomes the strong man armed, he divides his spoils,
 and makes that to serve his interests which had been used against them,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:22">Luke xi. 22</A>.

 (3.) The wealth imported by land-carriage, as well as that by sea, 
 shall be made use of in the service of God and the church

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>The camels and dromedaries that bring gold and incense</I> (gold to 
 make the golden altar of and incense and sweet perfumes to burn upon 
 it), <I>those of Midian and Sheba,</I> shall bring the richest 
 commodities of their country, not to trade with, but to honour God 
 with, and not in small quantities, but camel-loads of them. This was in 
 part fulfilled when the <I>wise men of the east</I> (perhaps some of 
 the countries here mentioned), drawn by the brightness of the star, 
 came to Christ, and presented to him treasures of <I>gold, 
 frankincense, and myrrh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:11">Matt. ii. 11</A>.

 (4.) Great numbers of sacrifices shall be brought to God's altar, 
 acceptable sacrifices, and, though brought by Gentiles, they shall find 
 acceptance,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 <I>Kedar</I> was famous for flocks, and probably the fattest rams were 
 those of <I>Nebaioth;</I> these shall come up with acceptance on God's 
 altar. God must be served and honoured with what we have, according as
 he has blessed us, and with the best we have. This was fulfilled when 
 by the decree of Darius the governors beyond the rivers (perhaps of 
 some of these countries) were ordered to furnish the temple at 
 Jerusalem <I>with bullocks, rams, and lambs, for the burnt-offering of 
 the God of heaven,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:9">Ezra vi. 9</A>.

 It had a further accomplishment, and we trust will have, in the
 bringing in of the fulness of the Gentiles to the church, which is 
 called the <I>sacrificing</I> or <I>offering up of the Gentiles</I> 
 unto God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:16">Rom. xv. 16</A>.

 The flocks and rams are precious souls; for they are said to minister
 to the church, and to come up as living sacrifices, presenting 
 themselves to God by a <I>reasonable service</I> on <I>his altar,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:1">Rom. xii. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. How God shall be honoured by the increase of the church and the 
 accession of such numbers to it. 

 (1.) They shall intend the honour of God's name in it. When they bring 
 their gold and incense it shall not be to show the riches of their 
 country, nor to gain applause to themselves for piety and devotion, but 
 to <I>show forth the praises of the Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Our greatest services and gifts to the church are not acceptable 
 further than we have an eye to the glory of God in them. And this must
 be our business in our attendance on public ordinances, to <I>give unto 
 the Lord the glory due to his name;</I> for <I>therefore,</I> as these 
 here, we are called out of darkness into light, that we should <I>show 
 forth the praises of him that called us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:9">1 Pet. ii. 9</A>.

 (2.) God will advance the honour of his own name by it; so he has said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>I will glorify the house of my glory.</I> The church is the house of 
 God's glory, where he manifests his glory to his people and receives 
 that homage by which they do honour to him. And it is for the glory of 
 this house, and of him that keeps house there, both that the Gentiles 
 shall bring their offerings to it and that they shall be accepted 
 therein.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. How the church shall herself be affected with this increase of her 
 numbers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 (1.) She shall be in a transport of joy upon this account: "<I>Thou 
 shalt see</I> and <I>flow together</I>" (or flow to and fro), "as in a 
 pleasing agitation about it, surprised at it, but extremely glad of 
 it." 

 (2.) There shall be a mixture of fear with this joy: "<I>Thy heart 
 shall fear,</I> doubting whether it be lawful to <I>go in to the 
 uncircumcised</I> and <I>eat with them.</I>" Peter was so impressed 
 with this fear that he needed a vision and voice from heaven to help 
 him over it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:28">Acts x. 28</A>.
 
 But,

 (3.) "When this fear is conquered thy heart shall be enlarged in holy 
 love, so enlarged that thou shalt have room in it for all the Gentile 
 converts; thou shalt not have such a narrow soul as thou hast had nor 
 affections so confined within the Jewish pale." When God intends the 
 beauty and prosperity of his church he gives this largeness of heart 
 and an extensive charity.

 (4.) These converts flocking to the church shall be greatly admired

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):
 
 <I>Who are these that fly as a cloud?</I> Observe,

 [1.] How the conversion of souls is here described. It is flying to 
 Christ and to his church, for thither we are directed; it is flying 
 like a cloud, though in great multitudes, so as to overspread the 
 heavens, yet with great unanimity, all as one cloud. They shall come 
 with speed, as a cloud flying on the wings of the wind, and come 
 openly, and in the view of all, <I>their</I> very <I>enemies beholding 
 them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:12">Rev. xi. 12</A>),

 and yet not able to hinder them. They shall <I>fly as doves to their
 windows,</I> in great flights, many together; they fly on the wings of 
 the harmless dove, which flies low, denoting their innocency and 
 humility. They fly to Christ, to the church, to the word and 
 ordinances, as doves, by instinct, to their own windows, to their own 
 home; thither they fly for refuge and shelter when they are pursued by 
 the birds of prey, and thither they fly for rest when they have been 
 wandering and are weary, as Noah's dove to the ark.

 [2.] How the conversion of souls is here admired. It is spoken of with 
 wonder and pleasure: <I>Who are these?</I> We have reason to wonder 
 that so many flock to Christ: when we see them all together we shall 
 wonder whence they all came. And we have reason to admire with pleasure 
 and affection those that do flock to him: <I>Who are these?</I> How 
 excellent, how amiable are they! What a pleasant sight is it to see 
 poor souls hastening to Christ, with a full resolution to abide with 
 him!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish
 first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold
 with them, unto the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, and to the Holy One
 of Israel, because he hath glorified thee.
 &nbsp; 10  And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and
 their kings shall minister unto thee: for in my wrath I smote
 thee, but in my favour have I had mercy on thee.
 &nbsp; 11  Therefore thy gates shall be open continually; they shall
 not be shut day nor night; that <I>men</I> may bring unto thee the
 forces of the Gentiles, and <I>that</I> their kings <I>may be</I> brought.
 &nbsp; 12  For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall
 perish; yea, <I>those</I> nations shall be utterly wasted.
 &nbsp; 13  The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the
 pine tree, and the box together, to beautify the place of my
 sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious.
 &nbsp; 14  The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending
 unto thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves
 down at the soles of thy feet; and they shall call thee, The city

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The promises made to the church in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:1-8">foregoing verses</A>

 are here repeated, ratified, and enlarged upon, designed still for the
 comfort and encouragement of the Jews after their return out of 
 captivity, but certainly looking further, to the enlargement and 
 advancement of the gospel church and the abundance of spiritual 
 blessings with which it shall be enriched.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God will be very gracious and propitious to them. We must begin with 
 that promise, because thence all the rest take rise. The sanctuary that 
 was desolate begins to be repaired when God <I>causes his face to shine 
 upon it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:17">Dan. ix. 17</A>.

 All the favour that the people of God find with men is owing to the
 light of God's countenance and his favour to them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "All shall now make court to thee, <I>for in my wrath I smote thee,</I> 
 while thou wast in captivity" (and the sufferings of the church, 
 especially by its corruptions, decays, and divisions, against which 
 these promises will be its relief, are sad tokens of God's 
 displeasure), "But now <I>in my favour have I had mercy on thee,</I> 
 and therefore have all this mercy in store for thee."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Many shall be brought into the church, even from far countries 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Surely the isles shall wait for me,</I> shall welcome the gospel, 
 and shall attend God with their praises for it and their ready 
 subjection to it. <I>The ships of Tarshish,</I> transport-ships, shall 
 lie ready to carry members from far distant regions to the church, or 
 (which is equivalent) to carry the ministers of the church to remote 
 parts, to preach the gospel and to bring in souls to join themselves to 
 the Lord. Observe,

 1. Who are brought--<I>thy sons,</I> that is, such as are designed to
 be so, those <I>children of God that are scattered abroad,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:52">John xi. 52</A>.

 2. What they shall bring with them. They live at such a distance that 
 they cannot bring their flocks and their rams; but, like those who 
 lived remote from Jerusalem (who, when they came up to worship at the 
 feast, because they could not bring their tithes in kind, turned them 
 into money), they shall <I>bring their silver and gold with them.</I> 
 Note, When we give up ourselves to God we must with ourselves give up 
 all we have to him. If we honour him with our spirits, we shall honour 
 him with our substance. 

 3. To whom they shall devote and dedicate themselves and all they are
 worth--<I>to the name of the Lord thy God,</I> to God as the Lord of 
 all and the church's God and King, even to the <I>Holy One of 
 Israel</I> (whom Israel worships as a Holy One, in the beauty of 
 holiness), <I>because he has glorified thee.</I> Note, The honour God 
 puts upon his church and people should not only engage us to honour 
 them, but invite us to join ourselves to them. <I>We will go with you, 
 for God is with you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:23">Zech. viii. 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Those that come into the church shall be welcome; for so spacious 
 is the holy city that though, <I>Lord, it is done as thou hast 
 commanded, yet still there is room. "Therefore thy gates shall be open 
 continually</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 not only because thou hast no reason to fear thy enemies, but because 
 thou hast reason to expect thy friends." It is usual with us to leave 
 our doors open, or leave some one ready to open them, all night, if we 
 look for a child or a guest to come in late. Note, Christ is always
 ready to entertain those that come to him, is never out of the way, nor 
 can they ever come unseasonably; the gate of mercy is always open, 
 night and day, or shall soon be opened to those that knock. Ministers, 
 the door-keepers, must be always ready to admit those that offer 
 themselves to the Lord. God not only keeps a good house in his church, 
 but he keeps open house, that at any time, by the preaching of the 
 word, <I>in season and out of season, the forces of the Gentiles,</I> 
 and the kings or commanders of those forces, <I>may be brought</I> into 
 the church. <I>Lift up your heads, O you gates!</I> and let such 
 welcome guests as these come in.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. All that are about the church shall be made in some way or other 
 serviceable to it. Though dominion is far from being founded in men's 
 grace, it is founded in God's; and he that made the inferior creatures 
 useful to man will make the nations of men useful to the church. The 
 earth helped the woman. <I>All things are for your sakes.</I> So here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 "Even <I>the sons of strangers,</I> that have neither knowledge of thee 
 nor kindness for thee, that have always been <I>aliens to the 
 commonwealth of Israel,</I> even they <I>shall build up thy wall, and 
 their kings shall</I> in that and other things <I>ministers unto 
 thee</I> and not think it any disparagement to them to do so." This was 
 fulfilled when the king of Persia, and the governors of the provinces 
 by his order, were aiding and assisting Nehemiah in building the wall 
 about Jerusalem. Rather than Jerusalem's walls shall lie still in 
 ruins, the <I>sons of the stranger</I> shall be raised up to build 
 them. Even those that do not belong to the church may be a protection 
 to it. And the greatest of men should not think it below them to 
 minister to the church, but rejoice that they are in a capacity, and 
 have a heart, to do it any service. Nay, it is the duty of all to do 
 what they can in their places to advance the interests of God's kingdom 
 among men; it is at their peril if they do not; for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 <I>The nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish;</I> 
 not that they must perish by the sword or by human anathemas, or as if 
 this gave any countenance to the using of external force for the 
 propagating of the gospel, or as if men might be compelled by penalties 
 and punishments to come into the church; by no means. But those who 
 will not by faith submit to Jesus Christ, the King of the church, and 
 serve him, shall perish eternally, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:12">Ps. ii. 12</A>.

 Those that will not be subject to Christ's golden sceptre, to the
 government of his word and Spirit, that will not be brought under, or 
 kept in, by the discipline of his family, shall be broken in pieces by 
 his iron rod. <I>Bring them forth and slay them before me,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:27">Luke xix. 27</A>.

 Nations of such shall be utterly and eternally wasted, when Christ
 shall come to take vengeance on those that <I>obey not his gospel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+1:8">2 Thess. i. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. There shall be abundance of beauty added to the ordinances of divine 
 worship 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>The glory of Lebanon,</I> the strong and stately cedars that grow 
 there, <I>shall come unto thee,</I> as of old to Solomon, when he built 
 the temple 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+2:16">2 Chron. ii. 16</A>),

 and with them shall be brought other timber, proper for the carved work
 thereof, which the enemy had broken down,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:5,6">Ps. lxxiv. 5, 6</A>.

 The temple, the <I>place of God's sanctuary,</I> shall be not only 
 rebuilt, but beautified. It is the <I>place of his feet,</I> where he 
 rests and resides, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:7">Ezek. xliii. 7</A>.

 The ark is called his <I>footstool,</I> because it was under the
 mercy-seat,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:7">Ps. cxxxii. 7</A>.

 This he will make glorious in the eyes of his people and of all their
 neighbours. <I>The glory of the latter house,</I> to which this refers, 
 though in many instances inferior, was yet really <I>greater than the 
 glory of the former,</I> because Christ came to that temple,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:1">Mal. iii. 1</A>.

 It was likewise <I>adorned with goodly stones and gifts</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:5">Luke xxi. 5</A>),

 to which this promise may have some reference; yet so slightly did
 Christ speak of them there that we must suppose it to have its full 
 accomplishment in the beauties of holiness, and the graces and comforts 
 of the Spirit, with which gospel ordinances are adorned and 
 enriched.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The church shall appear truly great and honourable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 The people of the Jews, after their return out of captivity, by degrees 
 became more considerable, and made a better figure than one would have 
 expected, after they had been so much reduced, and than any of the 
 other nations recovered that had been in like manner humbled by the 
 Chaldeans. It is probable that many of those who had oppressed them in 
 Babylon, when they were themselves driven out by the Persians, made 
 their court to the Jews for shelter and supply and were willing to 
 scrape acquaintance with them. This prophecy is further fulfilled when 
 those that have been enemies to the church are wrought upon by the 
 grace of God to see their error, and come, and join themselves to it: 
 "<I>The sons of those that afflicted thee,</I> if not they themselves, 
 yet their children, shall crouch to thee, shall beg pardon for their 
 folly and beg an interest in thy favour and admission into thy family," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:36">1 Sam. ii. 36</A>.
 
 A promise like this is made to the church of Philadelphia,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:9">Rev. iii. 9</A>.
 
 And it is intended to be,

 1. A mortification to the proud oppressors of the church, that have
 afflicted her, and despised her, and taken a pleasure in doing so; they 
 shall be brought down; their spirits shall be broken, and their 
 condition shall be so mean and miserable that they shall be glad to be 
 obliged to those whom they have most studied to disoblige. Note, Sooner 
 or later God will pour contempt upon those that put contempt upon his 
 people. 

 2. An exaltation to the poor oppressed ones of the church; and this is 
 the honour that shall be done to them, they shall have an opportunity 
 of doing good to those who have done evil to them and saving those 
 alive who have afflicted and despised them. It is a pleasure to a good 
 man, and he accounts it an honour, to show mercy to those with whom he 
 has found no mercy. Yet this is not all. "They shall not only become 
 suppliants to thee for their own interest, but they shall give honour 
 to thee: <I>They shall call thee, The city of the Lord;</I> they shall 
 at length be convinced that thou art a favourite of heaven, and the 
 particular care of the divine providence." That city is truly great and 
 honourable, it is strong, it is rich, it is safe, it is beautiful, it 
 is the most desirable place that can be to live in, which is <I>the 
 city of the Lord,</I> which he owns, in which he dwells, in which 
 religion is uppermost. Such a one is Zion; it is the place which God 
 has chosen to put his name there; it is <I>the Zion of the Holy One of 
 Israel;</I> therefore, we may be sure, it is a holy city, else the Holy 
 One of Israel would never be called the patron of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The happy and glorious state of the church is here further foretold, 
 referring principally and ultimately to the Christian church and the 
 spiritual peace of that, but under the type of that little gleam of 
 outward peace which the Jews sometimes enjoyed after their return out 
 of captivity. This is here spoken of,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. As compared with what it had been. <I>This</I> made her peace and 
 honour the more pleasant, that her condition had been much 
 otherwise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. She had been despised, but now she should be honoured, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.
 
 Jerusalem had been forsaken and hated, abandoned by her friends, 
 abhorred by her enemies; no man went through that desolate city, but 
 declined it as a rueful spectacle; it was an <I>astonishment and a 
 hissing.</I> But now it shall be made an eternal excellency, being 
 reformed from idolatry and having recovered the tokens of God's favour, 
 and it shall be <I>the joy</I> of good people for <I>many 
 generations.</I> Yet considering how short Jerusalem's excellency was, 
 and how short it came of the vast compass of this promise, we must look 
 for the full accomplishment of it in the perpetual excellencies of the 
 gospel church, far exceeding those of the Old-Testament church, and the 
 glorious privileges and advantages of the Christian religion, which are 
 indeed the joy of many generations. Two things are here spoken of as 
 her excellency and joy, in opposition to her having been forsaken and 
 hated:--

 (1.) She shall find herself countenanced by her neighbours. The 
 nations, and their kings, that are brought to embrace Christianity, 
 shall lay themselves out for the good of the church, and maintain its 
 interests with the tenderness and affection that the nurse shows to the 
 child at her breasts

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 "<I>Thou shalt suck the milk of the Gentiles,</I> not suck their blood 
 (that is not the spirit of the gospel); thou <I>shalt suck the breast 
 of kings,</I> who shall be to thee as nursing fathers." 

 (2.) She shall find herself countenanced by her God: <I>"Thou shalt 
 know that I the Lord am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer,</I> shalt know it 
 by experience; for such a salvation, such a redemption, shall be 
 wrought out for thee as plainly discovers itself to be the work of the 
 Lord, the work of a mighty one, for it is a great salvation, of the 
 <I>Mighty One of Jacob,</I> for it secures the welfare of all those 
 that are Israelites indeed." They before knew the Lord to be their God; 
 now they know him to be their Saviour, their Redeemer. Their Holy One 
 now appears their Mighty One.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. She had been impoverished, but now she shall be enriched, and every 
 thing shall be changed for the better with her, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 When those who were raised out of the dust are set among princes, 
 instead of brass money in their purses they have bold, and instead of 
 iron vessels in their houses they have silver ones, and other 
 improvements agreeable: so much shall the spiritual glory of the 
 New-Testament church exceed the external pomp and splendour of the 
 Jewish economy, which had no glory in comparison with that which quite 
 excels it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:10">2 Cor. iii. 10</A>.

 When we had baptism in the room of circumcision, the Lord's supper in
 the room of the passover, and a gospel ministry in the room of a 
 Levitical priesthood, we had gold instead of brass. Sin turned gold 
 into brass when Rehoboam made brazen shields instead of the golden ones 
 he had pawned; but God's favour, when that returns, will turn brass 
 again into gold.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. She had been oppressed by her own princes, which was sadly 
 complained of, not only as her sin, but as her misery 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:14"><I>ch.</I> lix. 14</A>);

 but now all the grievances of that kind shall be redressed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):
 
 "<I>I will make thy officers peace;</I> men of peace shall be made 
 officers, and shall be indeed justices, not patrons of injustice, and 
 justices of peace, not instruments of trouble and vexation. They shall 
 <I>be peace,</I> that is, they shall sincerely seek thy welfare and by 
 their means thou shalt enjoy good." They shall be <I>peace,</I> for 
 they shall be righteousness; and <I>then</I> the peace is as a river, 
 when the righteousness is as the waves of the sea. Even 
 <I>exactors,</I> whose business it is to demand the public tribute, 
 though they be exact, must not be exacting, but must be just to the 
 subject as well as to the prince, and, according to the instructions 
 John Baptist gave to the publicans must <I>exact no more than is 
 appointed them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:13">Luke iii. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. She had been insulted by her neighbours, invaded, spoiled, and 
 plundered; but now it shall be so no more 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "<I>Violence shall no more be heard in thy land;</I> neither the 
 threats and triumphs of those that do violence nor the outcries and 
 complaints of those that suffer violence shall again be heard, but 
 every man shall peaceably enjoy his own. There shall be no <I>wasting 
 nor destruction,</I> either of persons of possessions, any where 
 <I>within thy borders;</I> but <I>thy walls shall be called 
 salvation</I> (they shall be safe, and means of safety to thee) <I>and 
 thy gates shall be praise,</I> praise to thee (every one shall commend 
 thee for the good condition they are kept in), and praise to thy God, 
 <I>who strengthens the bars of thy gates,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:13">Ps. cxlvii. 13</A>.

 When God's salvation is upon the walls it is fit that his praises
 should be in the gates, the places of concourse.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. As completed in what it shall be. It should seem that in the close 
 of this chapter we are directed to look further yet, as far forward as 
 to the glory and happiness of heaven, under the type and figure of the 
 flourishing state of the church on earth, which yet was never such as 
 to come any thing near to what is here foretold; and several of the 
 images and expressions here made use of we find in the description of 
 the <I>new Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:23,22:5">Rev. xxi. 23; xxii. 5</A>.

 As the prophets sometimes insensibly pass from the blessings of the
 Jewish church to the spiritual blessings of the Christian church, which 
 are eternal, so sometimes they rise from the church militant to the 
 church triumphant, where, and where only, all the promised peace, and 
 joy, and honour will be in perfection.

 1. God shall be all in all in the happiness here promised; so he is
 always to true believers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>The sun and the moon shall be no more thy light.</I> God's people, 
 when they enjoy his favour, and walk in the light of his countenance, 
 make little account of sun and moon, and the other lights of this 
 world, but could walk comfortably in the light of the Lord though they 
 should withdraw their shining. In heaven there shall be no occasion for 
 sun or moon, for it is the inheritance of the saints in light, such 
 light as will swallow up the light of the sun as easily as the sun does 
 that of a candle. "Idolaters worshipped the sun and moon (which some
 have thought the most ancient and plausible idolatry); but these 
 <I>shall be no more thy light,</I> shall no more be idolized, but the 
 Lord shall be to thee a constant light, both day and night, in the 
 night of adversity as well as in the day of prosperity." Those that 
 make God their only light shall have him their all-sufficient light, 
 their <I>sun and shield. Thy God shall be thy glory.</I> Note, God is 
 the glory of those whose God he is and will be so to eternity. It is 
 their glory that they have him for their God, and they glory in it; it 
 is to them instead of beauty. God's people are, upon <I>this</I>
 account, an honourable people, that they have an interest in God as 
 their sin covenant. 

 2. The happiness here promised shall know no change, period, or allay

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 "<I>Thy sun shall no more go down,</I> but it shall be eternal day, 
 eternal sunshine, with thee; that shall not be thy sun which is 
 sometimes eclipsed, often clouded, and, though it shine ever so bright, 
 ever so warm, will certainly set and leave thee in the dark, in the 
 cold, in a few hours; but <I>he</I> shall be a sun, a fountain of light 
 to thee, who is himself the <I>Father of all lights,</I> with whom 
 there is <I>no variableness,</I> nor <I>shadow of turning,</I>" 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:17">James i. 17</A>.

 We read of the sun's standing still once, and not hasting to go down
 for the space of a day, and it was a glorious day, never was the like; 
 but what was that to the day that shall never have a night? Or, if it 
 had, it should be a light night; for <I>neither shall thy moon withdraw 
 itself;</I> it shall never wane, shall never change, but be always at 
 the full. The comforts and joys that are in heaven, the glories 
 provided for the soul, as the light of the sun, and those prepared for 
 the glorified body too, as the light of the moon, shall never know the 
 least cessation or interruption; how should they when <I>the Lord 
 shall</I> himself <I>be thy everlasting light</I>--a light which never 
 wastes nor can ever be extinguished? <I>And the days of thy mourning 
 shall be ended,</I> so as never to return; for <I>all tears shall be 
 wiped away,</I> and the fountains of them, sin and affliction, dried 
 up, so that <I>sorrow and sighing shall flee away</I> for ever.

 3. Those that are entitled to this happiness, being duly prepared and
 qualified for it, shall never be put out of the possession of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>Thy people,</I> that shall inhabit this New Jerusalem, <I>shall all
 be righteous,</I> all justified by the righteousness of the Messiah, 
 all sanctified by his Spirit; all that people, that Jerusalem, must be 
 righteous, must have that <I>holiness without which no man shall see 
 the Lord.</I> They are all righteous, for we know that <I>the 
 unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</I> There are no 
 people on earth that are all righteous; there is a mixture of some bad 
 in the best societies on this side heaven; but there are no mixtures 
 there. They shall be <I>all righteous,</I> that is, they shall be 
 entirely righteous; as there shall be none corrupt among them, so there 
 shall be no corruption in them; the <I>spirits of just men</I> shall 
 there be <I>made perfect.</I> And they shall be <I>all the 
 righteous</I> together who shall replenish the New Jerusalem; it is 
 called the <I>congregation of the righteous,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:5">Ps. i. 5</A>.

 And, because they are <I>all righteous,</I> therefore <I>they shall
 inherit the land for ever,</I> for nothing but sin can turn them out of 
 it. The perfection of the saints' holiness secures the perpetuity of 
 their happiness.

 4. The glory of the church shall redound to the honour of the church's 
 God: "They shall appear to be the <I>branch of my planting, the work of 
 my hands,</I> and I will own them as such." It was by the grace of God 
 that they were designed to this happiness; they are <I>the branch of 
 his planting,</I> or of his plantations; he broke them off from the 
 wild olive and grafted them into the good olive, transplanted them out 
 of the field, when they were as tender branches, into his nursery, 
 that, being now planted in his <I>garden on earth,</I> they might 
 shortly be removed to his <I>paradise in heaven.</I> It was by his 
 grace likewise that they were prepared and fitted for this happiness; 
 they <I>are the work of his hands</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:10">Eph. ii. 10</A>),

 are <I>wrought to the self-same thing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:5">2 Cor. v. 5</A>.

 It is a work of time, and, when it shall be finished, will appear a
 work of wonder; and God will be glorified, who began it, and carried it 
 on; for the Lord Jesus will then be <I>admired in all those that 
 believe.</I> God will glorify himself in glorifying his chosen.

 5. They will appear the more glorious, and God will be the more
 glorified in them, if we compare what they are with what they were, the 
 happiness they have arrived at with the smallness of their beginnings

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 "<I>A little one shall become a thousand and a small one a strong 
 nation.</I>" The captives that returned out of Babylon strangely 
 multiplied, and became a strong nation. The Christian church was a 
 little one, a very small one at first--the number of their names was 
 once but 120; yet it became a thousand. The stone cut out of the 
 mountain without hands swelled so as to fill the earth. The triumphant 
 church, and every glorified saint, will be a thousand out of a little 
 one, a strong nation out of a small one. The grace and peace of the 
 saints were at first like a <I>grain of mustard-seed,</I> but they 
 increase and multiply, and make a little one to become a thousand, the 
 weak to be as David. When they come to heaven, and look back upon the 
 smallness of their beginning, they will wonder how they got thither.
 And so wonderful is all this promise that it needed the ratification 
 with which it is closed: <I>I the Lord will hasten it in his 
 time</I>--all that is here said relating to the Jewish and Christian 
 church, to the militant and triumphant church, and to every particular 
 believer. 

 (1.) It may seem too difficult to be brought about, and therefore may 
 be despaired of; but the God of almighty power has undertaken it: "<I>I 
 the Lord will do it,</I> who can do it, and who have determined to do 
 it." It will be done by him whose power is irresistible and his 
 purposes unalterable. 

 (2.) It may seem to be delayed and put off so long that we are out of 
 hopes of it; but, as the Lord will do it, so he will <I>hasten it,</I> 
 will do it with all convenient speed; though much time may pass before 
 it is done, no time shall be lost; he will <I>hasten it in its 
 time,</I> in the proper time, in the season wherein it will be 
 beautiful; he will do it in the time appointed by his wisdom, though 
 not in the time prescribed by our folly. And this is really hastening 
 it; for, though it seem to tarry, it does not tarry if it come in God's 
 time, for we are sure that that is the best time, which he that 
 believes will patiently wait for.</P>
