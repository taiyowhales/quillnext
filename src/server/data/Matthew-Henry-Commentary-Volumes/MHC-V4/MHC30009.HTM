 In this chapter we have, 

 I. Judgment threatened, which the sinners shall not escape 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>),

 which an almighty power shall inflict 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:5,6">ver. 5, 6</A>),

 which the people of Israel have deserved as a sinful people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:7,8">ver. 7, 8</A>);

 and yet it shall not be the utter ruin of their nation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:8">ver. 8</A>),

 for a remnant of good people shall escape, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:9">ver. 9</A>.

 But the wicked ones shall perish, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:10">ver. 10</A>.

 II. Mercy promised, which was to be bestowed in the latter days

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:11-15">ver. 11-15</A>),

 as appears by the application of it to the days of the Messiah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:16">Acts xv. 16</A>.

 And with those comfortable promises, after all the foregoing rebukes
 and threatenings, the book concludes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 I saw the Lord standing upon the altar: and he said, Smite
 the lintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in
 the head, all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the
 sword: he that fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he that
 escapeth of them shall not be delivered.
 &nbsp; 2 Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them;
 though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down:
 &nbsp; 3 And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will
 search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my
 sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the
 serpent, and he shall bite them:
 &nbsp; 4 And though they go into captivity before their enemies,
 thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I
 will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.
 &nbsp; 5 And the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> of hosts <I>is</I> he that toucheth the land, and
 it shall melt, and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it
 shall rise up wholly like a flood; and shall be drowned, as <I>by</I>
 the flood of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 6 <I>It is</I> he that buildeth his stories in the heaven, and hath
 founded his troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters of
 the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> his name.
 &nbsp; 7 <I>Are</I> ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O
 children of Israel? saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>. Have not I brought up Israel
 out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and
 the Syrians from Kir?
 &nbsp; 8 Behold, the eyes of the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> <I>are</I> upon the sinful
 kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth;
 saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 9 For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel
 among all nations, like as <I>corn</I> is sifted in a sieve, yet shall
 not the least grain fall upon the earth.
 &nbsp; 10 All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which
 say, The evil shall not overtake nor prevent us.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the justice of God passing sentence upon a provoking 
 people; and observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. With what solemnity the sentence is passed. The prophet saw in 
 vision <I>the Lord standing upon the altar</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 the altar of burnt-offerings; for the <I>Lord has a sacrifice,</I> and
 multitudes must fall as victims to his justice. He is removed from the 
 <I>mercy-seat</I> between the <I>cherubim,</I> and stands upon <I>the 
 altar,</I> the <I>judgment-seat,</I> on which the fire of God used to 
 fall, to devour the sacrifices. He stands upon <I>the altar,</I> to 
 show that the ground of his controversy with this people was their 
 profanation of his holy things; here he stands to avenge the quarrel of 
 his altar, as also to signify that the sin of the house of Israel, like 
 that of the house of Eli, shall <I>not be purged with sacrifice nor 
 offering forever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:14">1 Sam. iii. 14</A>.

 He stands on the altar, to prohibit sacrifice. Now the order given is,
 <I>Smite the lintel of the door</I> of the temple, the chapiter, smite 
 it with such a blow <I>that the posts may shake,</I> and <I>cut 
 them,</I> wound them <I>in the head, all of them;</I> break down the 
 doors of God's house, or of the courts of his house, in token of this, 
 that he is going out from it, and forsaking it, and then all judgments 
 are breaking in upon it. Or it signifies the destruction of those in 
 the first place that should be as the door-posts to the nation for its 
 defence, so that, they being broken down, it becomes as a <I>city 
 without gates and bars.</I> "Smite the king, who is as the lintel of 
 the door, that the princes, who are as <I>the posts,</I> may <I>shake; 
 cut them in the head,</I> cleave them down, <I>all of them,</I> as wood 
 for the fire; and <I>I will slay the last of them,</I> the posterity of 
 them, them and their families, or the <I>least</I> of them, them and 
 all that are employed under them; or, I will <I>slay them all,</I> them 
 and all that remain of them, till it comes to the last man; the 
 slaughter shall be general." There is no living for those on whom God 
 has said, <I>I will slay</I> them, no standing before his sword.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What effectual care is taken that none shall escape the execution 
 of this sentence. This is enlarged upon here, and is intended for 
 warning to all that <I>provoke the Lord to jealousy.</I> Let sinners 
 read it, and tremble; as there is no fighting it out with God, so there 
 is no fleeing from him. His judgments, when they come with commission, 
 as they will overpower the strongest that think to outface them, so 
 they will overtake the swiftest that think to out-run them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Those of them that flee, and take to their heels, shall soon be out of
 breath, and shall not flee away out of the reach of danger; for, as 
 sometimes <I>the wicked flee when none pursues,</I> so he cannot flee 
 away when God pursues, though <I>he would fain flee out of his 
 hand.</I> Nay, <I>he that escapes of them,</I> that thinks he has 
 gained his point, <I>shall not be delivered. Evil pursues sinners,</I> 
 and will arrest them. This is here enlarged upon by showing that 
 wherever sinners flee for shelter from God's justice, it will overtake 
 them, and the shelter will prove but a <I>refuge of lies.</I> What 
 David says of the ubiquity of God's presence

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:7-10">
 Ps. cxxxix. 7-10</A>)

 is here said of the extent of God's power and justice.

 (1.) Hell itself, though it has its name in English from its being 
 <I>hilled,</I> or <I>covered over,</I> or <I>hidden,</I> cannot hide 
 them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "Though <I>they dig into hell,</I> into the centre of the earth, or the
 darkest recesses of it, yet <I>thence shall my hand take them,</I> and 
 bring them forth to be made public monuments of divine justice." The 
 grave is a hiding-place to the righteous from the malice of the world

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:17">Job iii. 17</A>),

 but it shall be no hiding-place to the righteous from the justice of
 God; thence God's hands shall take them, when they shall rise in the 
 great day to <I>everlasting shame and contempt.</I>

 (2.) Heaven, though it has its name from being <I>heaved,</I> or lifted 
 up, shall not put them out of reach of God's judgments; as hell cannot 
 hide them, so heaven will not. Though they <I>climb up to heaven</I> in 
 their conceit, yet <I>thence will I bring them down.</I> Those whom God 
 brings to heaven by his grace shall never be brought down; but those 
 who climb thither themselves, by their own presumption, and confidence 
 in themselves, will be brought down and filled with shame. 

 (3.) <I>The top of Carmel,</I> one of the highest parts of the dust of 
 the world in that country, shall not protect them: "<I>Though they hide 
 themselves there,</I> where they imagine nobody will look for them, 
 <I>I will search, and take them out thence;</I> neither the thickest 
 bushes, nor the darkest caves, in the <I>top of Carmel,</I> will serve 
 to hide them." 

 (4.) The <I>bottom of the sea</I> shall not serve to conceal them; 
 though they think to hide themselves there, even there the judgments of 
 God shall find them out, and lay hold on them: <I>Thence will I command 
 the serpent, and he shall bite them,</I> the <I>crooked serpent,</I> 
 even <I>the dragon that is in the sea,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:1">Isa. xxvii. 1</A>.

 They shall find their plague and death where they hope to find shelter
 and protection; diving will stand them in no more stead than climbing.

 (5.) Remote countries will not befriend them, nor shall less judgments 
 excuse them from greater 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Thought they go into captivity before their enemies,</I> who carry
 them to places at a great distance, and mingle them with their own 
 people, among whom they seem to be lost, yet that shall not serve their 
 turn: <I>Thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them,</I> 
 the sword of the enemy, or one another's sword. When God judges he
 will overcome. That which binds on all this, makes their escape 
 impossible and their ruin inevitable, is that God will <I>set his eyes 
 upon them for evil, and not for good.</I> His eyes are in every place, 
 are upon all men and upon all the ways of men, upon some for good, to 
 <I>show himself strong</I> on their behalf, but upon others for evil, 
 to take notice of their sins

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:27">Job xiii. 27</A>)

 and take all opportunities of punishing them for their sins.
 <I>Their</I> case is truly miserable who have the providence of God: 
 and all the dispensations of it, against them, working for their 
 hurt.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What a great and mighty God he is that passes this sentence upon 
 them, and will take the executing of it into his own hands. 
 Threatenings are more or less formidable according to the power of him 
 that threatens. We laugh at impotent wrath; but the wrath of God is not 
 so; it is omnipotent wrath. <I>Who knows the power</I> of it? What he 
 had before said he would do 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+8:8"><I>ch.</I> viii. 8</A>)

 is here repeated, that he would <I>make the land melt</I> and tremble,
 and <I>all that dwell therein mourn,</I> that the judgment should 
 <I>rise up wholly like a flood,</I> and the country should be 
 <I>drowned,</I> and laid under water, <I>as by the flood of Egypt,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 But is he able to make his words good? Yes, certainly he is; he does
 but <I>touch the land</I> and <I>it melts, touch the mountains</I> and 
 they smoke; he can do it with the greatest ease, for,

 (1.) He is <I>the Lord God of hosts,</I> who undertakes to do it, the 
 God who has all the power in his hand, and all creatures at his beck 
 and call, who having made them all, and given them their several 
 capacities, makes what use he pleases of them and all their powers. 
 Very miserable is the case of those who have the Lord of hosts against 
 them, for they have hosts against them, the whole creation at war with 
 them.

 (2.) He is the Creator and governor of the upper world: <I>It is he 
 that builds his stories in the heavens,</I> the celestial orbs, or 
 spheres, one over another, as so many stories in a high and stately 
 palace. They are his, for he built them at first, when he said, <I>Let 
 there be a firmament, and he made the firmament;</I> and he builds them 
 still, is continually building them, not that they need repair, but by 
 his providence he still upholds them; his power is the pillars of 
 heaven, by which it is borne up. Now he that has the command of those 
 stories is certainly to be feared, for thence, as from a castle, he can 
 fire upon his enemies, or cast upon them great hailstones, as on the 
 Canaanites, or make the stars in their courses, the furniture of those 
 stories, to fight against them, as against Sisera. 

 (3.) He has the management and command of this lower world too, in 
 which we dwell, the terraqueous globe, both <I>earth</I> and 
 <I>sea,</I> so that, which way soever his enemies think to make their 
 escape, he will meet them, or to make opposition, he will match them. 
 Do they think to make a land-fight of it? He <I>has founded his troop 
 in the earth,</I> his troop of guards, which he has at command, and 
 makes use of for the protection of his subjects and the punishment of 
 his enemies. All the creatures on earth make one bundle (as the margin 
 reads it), one bundle of arrows, out of which he takes what he pleases 
 to discharge against the persecutors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:13">Ps. vii. 13</A>.

 They are all one <I>army,</I> one <I>body,</I> so closely are they
 connected, and so harmoniously and so much in concert do they act for 
 the accomplishing of their Creator's purposes. Do they think to make a
 sea-fight of it? He will be too hard for them there, for he has the
 waters of the sea at command; even its waves, the most tumultuous 
 rebellious waters, do obey him. He <I>calls for the waters of the 
 sea</I> in the course of his common providence, <I>causes vapours to 
 ascend</I> out of it, and <I>pours them out</I> in showers, the small 
 rain and the great rain of his strength, <I>upon the face of the 
 earth;</I> this was mentioned before as a reason why we should <I>seek 
 the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:8"><I>ch.</I> v. 8</A>)

 and make him our friend, as it is here made a reason why we should fear
 him and dread having him for our enemy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. How justly God passes this sentence upon the people of Israel. He 
 does not destroy them by an act of sovereignty, but by an act of 
 righteousness; for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 it is a <I>sinful kingdom,</I> and the <I>eyes of the Lord</I> are upon
 it, discovering it to be so; he sees the great sinfulness of it, and 
 therefore he will <I>destroy it from off the face of the earth.</I> 
 Note, When those kingdoms that in name and profession were holy 
 kingdoms, and kingdoms of priests, as Israel was, become sinful 
 kingdoms, no other can be expected than that they should be cut off and 
 abandoned. Let sinful kingdoms, and sinful families, and sinful persons 
 too, see the eyes of the Lord upon them, observing all their 
 wickedness, and reserving the notice of it for the day of reckoning and 
 recompence. This being a sinful kingdom, see how light God makes of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Of the relation wherein he stood to it: <I>Are you not as children 
 of Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel?</I> A sad change! Children 
 of Israel become as children of the Ethiopians! 

 [1.] They were so in themselves; that was their sin. It is a thing to 
 be greatly lamented that the children of Israel often become as 
 children of the Ethiopians; this children of godly parents degenerate, 
 and become the reverse of those that went before them. Those that were 
 well-educated, and trained up in the knowledge and fear of God, and set 
 out well, and promised fair, throw off their profession and become as 
 bad as the worst. <I>How has the gold become dim!</I> 

 [2.] The were so in God's account, and that was their punishment. He 
 valued them no more, though they were children of Israel, than if they 
 had been <I>children of the Ethiopians.</I> We read of one in the title 
 of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:1-17">Ps. vii.</A>

 that was <I>Cush</I> (an <I>Ethiopian,</I> as some understand it) and
 yet a Benjamite. Those that by birth and profession are children of 
 Israel, if they degenerate, and become wicked and vile, are to God no 
 more than children of the Ethiopians. This is an intimation of the 
 rejection of the unbelieving Jews in the days of the Messiah; because 
 they embraced not the doctrine of Christ, the kingdom of God was taken 
 from them, they were unchurched, and cast out of covenant, became as 
 children of the Ethiopians, and are so to this day. And it is true of 
 those that are called Christians, but do no live up to their name and 
 profession, that rest in the form of piety, but live under the power of 
 reigning iniquity, that they are to God as children of the Ethiopians; 
 he rejects them, and their services.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) See how light he makes of the favours he had conferred upon them; 
 they thought he would not, he could not, cast them off, and put them 
 upon a level with other nations, because he had done that for them 
 which he had not done for other nations, whereby they thought he was 
 bound to them, so as never to leave them. "No," says he, "The favours 
 shown to you are not so distinguishing as you think they are: <I>Have I 
 not brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt?</I>" It is true I have; 
 but I have also brought the <I>Philistines from Caphtor,</I> or 
 <I>Cappadocia,</I> where they were natives, or captives, or both; they 
 are called the <I>remnant of the country of Caphtor</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+47:4">Jer. xlvii. 4</A>),
 
 and the Philistim are joined with the Caphtorim, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:14">Gen. x. 14</A>.

 In like manner the Syrians were brought up from Kir when they had been
 carried away thither, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:9">2 Kings xvi. 9</A>.

 Note, If God's Israel lose the peculiarity of their holiness, they lose
 the peculiarity of their privileges; and what was designed as a favour 
 of special grace shall be set in another light, shall have its property 
 altered, and shall become an act of <I>common providence;</I> if 
 professors liken themselves to the world, God will level them with the 
 world. And, if we live not up to the obligation of God's mercies, we 
 forfeit the honour and comfort of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. How graciously God will separate between the precious and the vile 
 in the day of retribution. Though the wicked Israelites shall be as the 
 wicked Ethiopians, and their being called Israelites shall stand them 
 in no stead, yet the pious Israelites shall not be as the <I>wicked</I> 
 ones; no, the <I>Judge of all the earth will do right,</I> more right 
 than to <I>slay the righteous with the wicked,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:25">Gen. xviii. 25</A>.

 His <I>eyes are upon the sinful kingdom,</I> to spy out those in it who
 preserve their integrity and swim against the stream, who sigh and cry 
 for the abominations of their land, and they shall be marked for 
 preservation, so that the destruction shall not be total: <I>I will not 
 utterly destroy the house of Jacob,</I> not ruin them by wholesale and 
 in the gross, good and bad together, but I will distinguish, as becomes 
 a righteous judge. The house of Israel shall be <I>sifted as corn is 
 sifted;</I> they shall be greatly hurried, and shaken, and tossed, but 
 still in the hands of God, in both his hands, as the sieve in the hands 
 of him that sifts

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>I will sift the house of Israel among all nations.</I> Wherever they
 are shaken and scattered, God will have his eye upon them, and will 
 take care to separate between the corn and chaff, which was the thing 
 he designed in sifting them.

 (1.) The righteous ones among them, that are as the solid wheat, shall 
 none of them perish; they shall be delivered either from or through the 
 common calamities of the kingdom; <I>not the least grain shall fall on 
 the earth,</I> so as to be lost and forgotten--not the least 
 <I>stone</I> (so the word is), for the good corn is weighty as a stone 
 in comparison with that which we call <I>light corn.</I> Note, Whatever 
 shakings there may be in the world, God does and will effectually 
 provide that none who are truly his shall be truly miserable. 

 (2.) The wicked ones among them who are hardened in their sins shall 
 all of them perish, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 See what a height of impiety they have come to: <I>They say, The evil
 shall not overtake nor prevent us.</I> They think they are innocent, 
 and do not deserve punishment, or that the profession they make of 
 relation to God will be their exemption and security from punishment, 
 or that they shall be able to make their part good against the 
 judgments of God, that they shall flee so swiftly from them that they 
 shall not overtake them, or guard so carefully against them that they 
 shall not prevent or surprise them. Note, Hope of impunity is the 
 deceitful refuge of the impenitent. But see what it will come to at 
 last: <I>All the sinners</I> that thus flatter themselves, and affront 
 God, shall <I>die by the sword,</I> the sword of war, which to them 
 shall be the sword of divine vengeance; yea, though they be the 
 <I>sinners of my people,</I> for their profession shall not be their 
 protection. Note, Evil is often nearest those that put it at the 
 greatest distance from them.</P>

 that shall come, in which God will do great things for his church, by 
 the setting up of the kingdom of the Messiah, for the rejecting of 
 which the rejection of the Jews was foretold in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:1-10">foregoing verses</A>.

 The promise here is said to agree to the planting of the Christian
 church, and in that to be fulfilled, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:15-17">Acts xv. 15-17</A>.
 
 It is promised,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That in the Messiah the kingdom of David shall be restored 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);
 
 the <I>tabernacle of David</I> it is called, that is, his house and
 family, which, though great and fixed, yet, in comparison with the 
 kingdom of heaven, was mean and movable as a tabernacle. The church 
 militant, in its present state, dwelling as in shepherds' tents to 
 feed, as in soldiers' tents to fight, is the <I>tabernacle of 
 David.</I> God's tabernacle is called the tabernacle of David because 
 David desired and chose to <I>dwell in God's tabernacle for ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+61:4">Ps. lxi. 4</A>.
 
 Now,

 1. These tabernacles had fallen an gone to decay, the royal family was
 so impoverished, its power abridged, its honour stained, and laid in 
 the dust; for many of that race degenerated, and in the captivity it 
 lost the imperial dignity. Sore breaches were made upon it, and at 
 length it was laid in ruins. So it was with the church of the Jews; in 
 the latter days of it its glory departed; it was like a tabernacle 
 broken down and brought to ruin, in respect both of purity and of 
 prosperity. 

 2. By Jesus Christ these tabernacles were raised and rebuilt. In him
 God's covenant with David had its accomplishment; and the glory of that 
 house, which was not only sullied, but quite sunk, revived again; the 
 <I>breaches</I> of it were <I>closed</I> and its <I>ruins raised up, as 
 in the days of old;</I> nay, the spiritual glory of the family of 
 Christ far exceeded the temporal glory of the family of David when it 
 was at its height. In him also God's covenant with Israel had its 
 accomplishment, and in the gospel-church the tabernacle of God was set 
 up among men again, and raised up out of the ruins of the Jewish state. 
 This is quoted in the first council at Jerusalem as referring to the 
 calling in of the Gentiles and God's <I>taking out of them a people for 
 his name.</I> Note, While the world stands God will have a church in 
 it, and, if it be fallen down in one place and among one people, it 
 shall be raised up elsewhere.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That that kingdom shall be enlarged, and the territories of it 
 shall extend far, by the accession of many countries to it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),
 
 that the house of David may possess the <I>remnant of Edom, and of all
 the heathen,</I> that is, that Christ may have them given him for his 
 <I>inheritance,</I> even the <I>uttermost parts of the earth for his 
 possession,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:8">Ps. ii. 8</A>.

 Those that had been strangers and enemies shall become willing faithful
 subjects to the Son of David, shall be <I>added to the church,</I> or 
 those of them that are <I>called by my name, saith the Lord,</I> that 
 is, that belong to the election of grace and are ordained to eternal 
 life

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:48">Acts xiii. 48</A>),

 for it is true of the Gentiles as well as of the Jews that <I>the
 election hath obtained</I> and <I>the rest were blinded,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:7">Rom. xi. 7</A>.
 
 Christ died <I>to gather together in one the children of God that were
 scattered abroad,</I> here said to be those that were <I>called by his 
 name.</I> The promise is to all that are <I>afar off,</I> even as 
 <I>many</I> of them <I>as the Lord our God shall call,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:39">Acts ii. 39</A>.
 
 St. James expounds this as a promise <I>that the residue of men should
 seek after the Lord, even all the Gentiles upon whom my name is 
 called.</I> But may the promise be depended upon? Yes, the Lord says
 this, who does this, who can do it, who has determined to do it, the 
 power of whose grace is engaged for the doing of it, and with whom 
 saying and doing are not two things, as they are with us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That in the kingdom of the Messiah there shall be great plenty, an 
 abundance of all good things that the country produces 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>The ploughman shall overtake the reaper,</I> that is, there shall be
 such a plentiful harvest every year, and so much corn to be gathered 
 in, that it shall last all summer, even till autumn, when it is time to 
 begin to plough again; and in like manner the vintage shall continue 
 till seed-time, and there shall be such abundance of grapes that even 
 the <I>mountains shall drop new wine</I> into the vessels of the 
 grape-gatherers, and the hills that were dry and barren shall be 
 moistened and shall melt with the <I>fatness</I> or <I>mellowness</I> 
 (as we call it) <I>of the soil.</I> Compare this with 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:24,3:18">Joel ii. 24, and iii. 18</A>.

 This must certainly be understood of the abundance of spiritual
 blessings in heavenly things, which all those are, and shall be, 
 blessed with, who are in sincerity added to Christ and his church; they 
 shall be abundantly replenished with the goodness of God's house, with 
 the graces and comforts of his Spirit; they shall have bread, the bread 
 of life, to <I>strengthen their hearts,</I> and the wine of divine 
 consolations to <I>make them glad-meat indeed</I> and <I>drink 
 indeed</I>--all the benefit that comes to the souls of men from the 
 word and Spirit of God. These had been long confined to the vineyard of 
 the Jewish church; divine revelation, and the power that attended it, 
 were to be found only within that enclosure; but in gospel-times the 
 mountains and hills of the Gentile world shall be enriched with these 
 privileges by the gospel of Christ preached, and professed, and 
 received in the power of it. When great multitudes were converted to 
 the faith of Christ, and nations were born at once, when the preachers 
 of the gospel were <I>always caused to triumph in</I> the success of 
 their preaching, then the <I>ploughman overtook the reaper;</I> and 
 when, the Gentile churches were <I>enriched in all utterance, and in 
 all knowledge,</I> and all manner of <I>spiritual gifts</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:5">1 Cor. i. 5</A>),
 
 then the <I>mountains dropped sweet wine.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That the kingdom of the Messiah shall be well peopled; as the 
 country shall be replenished, so shall the cities be; there shall be 
 mouths for this meat, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Those that were carried captives shall be brought back out of their
 captivity; their enemies shall not be able to detain them in the land 
 of their captivity, nor shall they themselves incline to settle in it, 
 but the remnant shall return, and shall <I>build the waste cities and 
 inhabit them,</I> shall form themselves into Christian churches and set 
 up pure doctrine, worship, and discipline among them, according to the 
 gospel charter, by which Christ's cities are incorporated; and they 
 shall enjoy the benefit and comfort thereof; they shall <I>plant 
 vineyards,</I> and <I>make gardens.</I> Though the mountains and hills 
 drop wine, and the privileges of the gospel-church are laid in common, 
 yet they shall enclose for themselves, not to monopolize these 
 privileges, to the exclusion of others, but to appropriate and improve 
 these privileges, in communion with others, and they shall <I>drink the 
 wine,</I> and <I>eat the fruit,</I> of their own <I>vineyards and 
 gardens;</I> for those that take pains in religion, as men must do 
 about their vineyards and gardens, shall have both the pleasure and 
 profit of it. The <I>bringing again</I> of the <I>captivity</I> of 
 God's Israel, which is here promised, may refer to the cancelling of 
 the ceremonial law, which had been long to God's Israel as a <I>yoke of 
 bondage,</I> and the investing of them in the liberty wherewith Christ 
 came to make his church free,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:1">Gal. v. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. That the kingdom of the Messiah shall take such deep rooting in the 
 world as never to be rooted out of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>I will plant them upon their land.</I> God's spiritual Israel shall
 be planted by the right hand of God himself upon the land assigned 
 them, and <I>they shall no more be pulled up out of it,</I> as the old 
 Jewish church was. God will preserve them from throwing themselves out
 of it by a total apostasy, and will preserve them from being thrown out 
 of it by malice of their enemies; the church may be corrupted, but 
 shall not quite forsake God, may be persecuted, but shall not quite be 
 forsaken of God, so that the gates of hell, neither with their 
 temptations nor with their terrors, shall prevail against it. Two 
 things secure the perpetuity of the church:--

 1. God's grants to it: It <I>is the land which I have given them;</I>
 and God will confirm and maintain his own grants. The part he has given 
 to his people is that good part which shall never be taken from them; 
 he will not revoke his grant, and all the powers of earth and hell 
 shall not invalidate it. 

 2. Its interest in him: He is <I>the Lord thy God,</I> who has said
 it, and will make it good, <I>thine, O Israel!</I> who shall <I>reign 
 for ever</I> as thine <I>unto all generations.</I> And because he lives 
 the church shall live also.</P>
