 Daniel does not give a continued history of the reigns in which he 
 lived, nor of the state-affairs of the kingdoms of Chaldea and Persia, 
 though he was himself a great man in those affairs; for what are those 
 to us? But he selects such particular passages of story as serve for 
 the confirming of our faith in God and the encouraging of our obedience 
 to him, for the things written aforetime were written for our learning. 
 It is a very observable improvable story that we have in this chapter, 
 how Daniel by faith "stopped the mouths of lions," and so "obtained a 
 good report," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:33">Heb. xi. 33</A>.

 The three children were cast into the fiery furnace for not committing
 a known sin, Daniel was cast into the lions' den for not omitting a 
 known duty, and God's miraculously delivering both them and him is left 
 upon record for the encouragement of his servants in all ages to be 
 resolute and constant both in their abhorrence of that which is evil 
 and in their adherence to that which is good, whatever it cost them. In 
 this chapter we have,

 I. Daniel's preferment in the court of Darius, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. The envy and malice of his enemies against him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:4,5">ver. 4, 5</A>.

 III. The decree they obtained against prayer for thirty days, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:6-9">ver. 6-9</A>.
 
 IV. Daniel's continuance and constancy in prayer, notwithstanding that
 decree, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:10">ver. 10</A>.

 V. Information given against him for it, and the casting of him into
 the den of lions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:11-17">ver. 11-17</A>.

 VI. His miraculous preservation in the lions' den, and deliverance out 
 of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:18-23">ver. 18-23</A>.

 VII. The casting of his accusers into the den, and their destruction 
 there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:24">ver. 24</A>.

 VIII. The decree which Darius made upon this occasion, in honour of
 the God of Daniel, and the prosperity of Daniel afterwards, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:25-28">ver. 25-28</A>.

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and
 twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom;
 &nbsp; 2  And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel <I>was</I> first:
 that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the king
 should have no damage.
 &nbsp; 3  Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and
 princes, because an excellent spirit <I>was</I> in him; and the king
 thought to set him over the whole realm.
 &nbsp; 4  Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion
 against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none
 occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he <I>was</I> faithful, neither was
 there any error or fault found in him.
 &nbsp; 5  Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against
 this Daniel, except we find <I>it</I> against him concerning the law
 of his God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are told concerning Daniel,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What a <I>great man</I> he was. When Darius, upon his accession to 
 the crown of Babylon by conquest, new-modelled the government, he made 
 Daniel prime-minister of state, set him at the helm, and made him first 
 commissioner both of the treasury and of the great seal. Darius's 
 dominion was very large; all he got by his conquests and acquests was 
 that he had so many more countries to take care of; no more can be 
 expected from himself than what one man can do, and therefore others 
 must be employed under him. He <I>set over the kingdom 120 princes</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 and appointed them their districts, in which they were to administer 
 justice, preserve the public peace, and levy the king's revenue. Note, 
 Inferior magistrates are ministers of God to us for good as well as the 
 sovereign; and therefore we must submit ourselves both to the king as 
 supreme and to the governors that are constituted and commissioned by 
 him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:13,14">1 Pet. ii. 13, 14</A>.

 Over these princes there was a <I>triumvirate,</I> or <I>three
 presidents,</I> who were to take and state the public accounts, to 
 receive appeals from the princes, or complaints against them in case of 
 mal-administration, <I>that the king should have no damage</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),
 
 that he should not sustain loss in his revenue and that the power he 
 delegated to the princes might not be abused to the oppression of the 
 subject, for by that the king (whether he thinks so or no) receives 
 real damage, both as it alienates the affections of his people from him 
 and as it provokes the displeasure of his God against him. Of these 
 three Daniel was chief, because he was found to go beyond them all in 
 all manner of princely qualifications. He was <I>preferred above the
 presidents and princes</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and so wonderfully well pleased the king was with his management that 
 <I>he thought to set him over the whole realm,</I> and let him place 
 and displace at his pleasure. Now, 

 1. We must take notice of it to the praise of Darius that he would
 prefer a man thus purely for his personal merit, and his fitness for 
 business; and those sovereigns that would be well served must go by 
 that rule. Daniel had been a great man in the kingdom that was 
 conquered, and for that reason, one would think, should have been 
 looked upon as an enemy, and as such imprisoned or banished. He was a 
 native of a foreign kingdom, and a ruined one, and upon that account 
 might have been despised as a stranger and captive. But, Darius, it 
 seems, was very quick-sighted in judging of men's capacities, and was 
 soon aware that this Daniel had something extraordinary in him, and 
 therefore, though no doubt he had creatures of his own, not a few, that 
 expected preferment in this newly-conquered kingdom, and were gaping 
 for it, and those that had been long his confidants would depend upon 
 it that they should be now his presidents, yet so well did he consult 
 the public welfare that, finding Daniel to excel them all in prudence 
 and virtue, and probably having heard of his being divinely inspired, 
 he made him his right hand. 

 2. We must take notice of it, to the glory of God, that, though Daniel
 was now very old (it was above seventy years since he was brought a 
 captive to Babylon), yet he was as able as ever for business both in 
 body and mind, and that he who had continued faithful to his religion 
 through all the temptations of the foregoing reigns in a new government 
 was as much respected as ever. He kept in by being an oak, not by being 
 a willow, by a constancy in virtue, not by a pliableness to vice. Such 
 honesty is the best policy, for it secures a reputation; and those who 
 thus honour God he will honour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What a good man he was: <I>An excellent spirit was in him,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 And he was faithful to every trust, dealt fairly between the sovereign 
 and the subject, and took care that neither should be wronged, so that 
 there was <I>no error,</I> or <I>fault, to be found in him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 He was not only not chargeable with any treachery or dishonesty, but 
 not even with any mistake or indiscretion. He never made any blunder, 
 nor had any occasion to plead inadvertency or forgetfulness for his 
 excuse. This is recorded for an example to all that are in places of 
 public trust to approve themselves both careful and conscientious, that 
 they may be free, not only from fault, but from error, not only from 
 crime, but from mistake.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What ill-will was borne him, both for his greatness and for his 
 goodness. The presidents and princes envied him because he was advanced 
 above them, and probably hated him because he had a watchful eye upon 
 them and took care they should not wrong the government to enrich 
 themselves. See here, 

 1. The cause of envy, and that is every thing that is good. Solomon
 complains of it as a vexation that <I>for every right work a man is 
 envied of his neighbour</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+4:4">Eccl. iv. 4</A>),

 that the better a man is the worse he is thought of by his rivals.
 Daniel is envied because he has a more excellent spirit than his 
 neighbours. 

 2. The effect of envy, and that is every thing that is bad. Those that
 envied Daniel sought no less than his ruin. His disgrace would not 
 serve them; it was his death that they desired. <I>Wrath is cruel, and
 anger is outrageous, but who can stand before envy?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:4">Prov. xxvii. 4</A>.
 
 Daniel's enemies set spies upon him, to observe him in the management 
 of his place; they <I>sought to find occasion against him,</I> 
 something on which to ground an accusation <I>concerning the 
 kingdom,</I> some instance of neglect or partiality, some hasty word 
 spoken, some person borne hard upon, or some necessary business 
 overlooked. And if they could but have found the mote, the mole-hill, 
 of a mistake, it would have been soon improved to the beam, to the 
 mountain, of an unpardonable misdemeanour. But <I>they could find no 
 occasion against</I> him; they owned that they could not. Daniel always 
 acted honestly, and now the more warily, and stood the more upon his 
 guard, <I>because of his observers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:11">Ps. xxvii. 11</A>.

 Note, We have all need to walk circumspectly, because we have many eyes
 upon us, and some that watch for our halting. Those especially have 
 need to carry their cup even that have it full. They concluded, at 
 length, that they should not find any occasion against him except 
 <I>concerning the law of his God</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 It seems then that Daniel kept up the profession of his religion, and 
 held it fast without wavering or shrinking, and yet that was no bar to 
 his preferment; there was no law that required him to be of the king's 
 religion, or incapacitated him to bear office in the state unless he 
 were. It was all one to the king what God he prayed to, so long as he 
 did the business of his place faithfully and well. He was at the king's 
 service <I>usque ad aras--as far as the altars;</I> but there he left 
 him. In this matter therefore his enemies hoped to ensnare him. 
 <I>Qu&aelig;rendum est crimen l&aelig;s&aelig; religionis ubi 
 majestatis deficit--When treason could not be charged upon him he was 
 accused of impiety.</I> Grotius. Note, It is an excellent thing, and 
 much for the glory of God, when those who profess religion conduct 
 themselves so inoffensively in their whole conversation that their most 
 watchful spiteful enemies may find no occasion of blaming them, save 
 only in the matters of their God, in which they walk according to their 
 consciences. It is observable that, when Daniel's enemies could find no 
 occasion against him concerning the kingdom, they had so much sense of 
 justice left that they did not suborn witnesses against him to accuse 
 him of crimes he was innocent of, and to swear treason upon him, 
 wherein they shame many that were called Jews and are called 
 Christians.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the
 king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.
 &nbsp; 7  All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the
 princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted
 together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree,
 that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty
 days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of
 lions.
 &nbsp; 8  Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that
 it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and
 Persians, which altereth not.
 &nbsp; 9  Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.
 &nbsp; 10  Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went
 into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward
 Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and
 prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Daniel's adversaries could have no advantage against him from any law 
 now in being; they therefore contrive a new law, by which they hope to 
 ensnare him, and in a matter in which they knew they should be sure of 
 him; and such was his fidelity to his God that they gained their point. 
 Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Darius's impious law. I call it <I>Darius's,</I> because he gave the 
 royal assent to it, and otherwise it would not have been of force; but 
 it was not properly his: he contrived it not, and was perfectly 
 wheedled to consent to it. The presidents and princes framed the edict, 
 brought in the bill, and by their management it was agreed to by the 
 convention of the states, who perhaps were met at this time upon some 
 public occasion. It is pretended that this bill which they would have 
 to pass into a law was the result of mature deliberation, that <I>all 
 the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, princes, counsellors, and 
 captains, had consulted together</I> about it, and that they not only 
 agreed to it, but <I>advised it,</I> for <I>divers good causes and 
 considerations,</I> that they had done what they could to <I>establish 
 it for a firm decree;</I> nay, they intimate to the king that it was 
 carried <I>nemine contradicente--unanimously: "All the presidents</I>
 are of this mind;" and yet we are sure that Daniel, the chief of the 
 three presidents, did not agree to it, and have reason to think that 
 many more of the princes excepted against it as absurd and 
 unreasonable. Note, It is no new thing for that to be represented, and 
 with great assurance too, as the sense of the nation, which is far from 
 being so; and that which few approve of is sometimes confidently said 
 to be that which all agree to. But, O the infelicity of kings, who, 
 being under a necessity of seeing and hearing with other people's eyes 
 and ears, are often wretchedly imposed upon! These designing men, under 
 colour of doing honour to the king, but really intending the ruin of 
 his favourite, press him to pass this into a law, and make it a royal 
 statute, that <I>whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for 
 thirty days, save of the king, shall be</I> put to death after the most 
 barbarous manner, shall be <I>cast into the den of lions,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 This is the bill they have been hatching, and they lay it before the 
 king to be signed and passed into a law. Now, 

 1. There is nothing in it that has the least appearance of good, but 
 that it magnifies the king, and makes him seem both very great and very 
 kind to his subjects, which, they suggest, will be of good service to 
 him now that he has newly come to his throne, and will confirm his 
 interests. All men must be made to believe that the king is so rich, 
 and withal so ready to all petitioners, that none in any want or 
 distress need to apply either to God or man for relief, but to him 
 only. And for thirty days together he will be ready to give audience to 
 all that have any petition to present to him. It is indeed much for the 
 honour of kings to be benefactors to their subjects and to have their 
 ears open to their complaints and requests; but if they pretend to be 
 their sole benefactors, and undertake to be to them instead of God, and 
 challenge that respect from them which is due to God only, it is their 
 disgrace, and not their honour. But, 

 2. There is a great deal in it that is apparently evil. It is bad 
 enough to forbid asking a petition of any man. Must not a beggar ask an 
 alms, or one neighbour beg a kindness of another? If the child want 
 bread, must he not ask it of his parents, or be cast into the den of 
 lions if he do? Nay, those that have business with the king, may they 
 not petition those about him to introduce them? But it was much worse,
 and an impudent affront to all religion, to forbid asking a petition 
 <I>of any god.</I> It is by prayer that we give glory to God, fetch in 
 mercy from God; and so keep up our communion with God; and to interdict 
 prayer for thirty days is for so long to rob God of all the tribute he 
 has from man and to rob man of all the comfort he has in God. When the 
 light of nature teaches us that the providence of God has the ordering 
 and disposing of all our affairs does not the law of nature oblige us 
 by prayer to acknowledge God and seek to him? Does not every man's 
 heart direct him, when he is in want or distress, to call upon God, and 
 must this be made high treason? We could not live a day without God; 
 and can men live thirty days without prayer? Will the king himself be 
 tied up for so long from praying to God; or, if it be allowed him, will 
 he undertake to do it for all his subjects? Did ever any nation thus 
 slight their gods? But see what absurdities malice will drive men to. 
 Rather than not bring Daniel into trouble for praying to his God, they 
 will deny themselves and all their friends the satisfaction of praying 
 to theirs. Had they proposed only to prohibit the Jews from praying to 
 their God, Daniel would have been as effectually ensnared; but they 
 knew the king would not pass such a law, and therefore made it thus 
 general. And the king, puffed up with a fancy that this would set him 
 up as a little god, was fond of the <I>feather in his cap</I> (for so 
 it was, and not a <I>flower in his crown</I>) and <I>signed the writing 
 and the decree</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 which, being once done, according to the constitution of the united 
 kingdom of the Medes and Persians, was not upon any pretence whatsoever 
 to be altered or dispensed with, or the breach of it pardoned.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Daniel's pious disobedience to this law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 He did not retire into the country, nor abscond for some time, though 
 he knew the law was levelled against him; but, because he knew it was 
 so, therefore he stood his ground, knowing that he had now a fair 
 opportunity of honouring God before men, and showing that he preferred 
 his favour, and his duty to him, before life itself. <I>When Daniel 
 knew that the writing was signed</I> he might have gone to the king, 
 and expostulated with him about it; nay, he might have remonstrated 
 against it, as grounded upon a misinformation that <I>all the 
 presidents</I> had consented to it, whereas he that was chief of them 
 had never been consulted about it; but <I>he went to his house,</I> and 
 applied himself to his duty, cheerfully trusting God with the event. 
 Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Daniel's constant practice, which we were not informed of before 
 this occasion, but which we have reason to think was the general 
 practice of the pious Jews. 

 (1.) He <I>prayed in his house,</I> sometimes alone and sometimes with
 his family about him, and made a solemn business of it. Cornelius was a 
 man that <I>prayed in his house,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:30">Acts x. 30</A>.

 Note, Every house not only may be, but ought to be, a house of prayer;
 where we have a tent God must have an alter, and on it we must offer 
 spiritual sacrifices.

 (2.) In every prayer he gave thanks. When we pray to God for the 
 mercies we want we must praise him for those we have received. 
 Thanksgiving must be a part of every prayer.

 (3.) In his prayer and thanksgiving he had an eye to God as his God, 
 his in covenant, and set himself as in his presence. He did this 
 <I>before his God,</I> and with a regard to him.

 (4.) When he prayed and gave thanks he <I>kneeled upon his knees,</I> 
 which is the most proper gesture in prayer, and most expressive of 
 humility, and reverence, and submission to God. Kneeling is a begging 
 posture, and we come to God as beggars, beggars for our lives, whom it 
 concerns to be importunate.

 (5.) He <I>opened the windows of his chamber,</I> that the sight of the
 visible heavens might affect his heart with an awe of that God who 
 dwells above the heavens; but that was not all: he <I>opened them 
 towards Jerusalem,</I> the holy city, though now in ruins, to signify 
 the affection he had for its very stones and dust

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:14">Ps. cii. 14</A>)
 
 and the remembrance he had of its concerns daily in his prayers. Thus,
 though he himself lived great in Babylon, yet he testified his
 concurrence with the meanest of his brethren the captives, in
 remembering Jerusalem and preferring it before his <I>chief joy,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:5,6">Ps. cxxxvii. 5, 6</A>.

 Jerusalem was the place which God had chosen to put his name there;
 and, when the temple was dedicated, Solomon's prayer to God was that if 
 his people should <I>in the land of their enemies</I> pray unto him 
 with their eye towards the land which he gave them, and the city he had 
 chosen, and the house which was built to his name, then he would 
 <I>hear</I> and <I>maintain their cause</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:48,49">1 Kings viii. 48, 49</A>),

 to which prayer Daniel had reference in this circumstance of his
 devotions. 

 (6.) He did this <I>three times a day,</I> three times every day 
 according to the example of David

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+55:17">Ps. lv. 17</A>),

 <I>Morning, evening, and at noon, I will pray.</I> It is good to have
 our hours of prayer, not to bind, but to remind conscience; and, if we 
 think our bodies require refreshment by food thrice a day, can we think 
 seldomer will serve our souls? This is surely as little as may be to 
 answer the command of <I>praying always.</I>

 (7.) He did this so openly and avowedly that all who knew him knew it
 to be his practice; and he thus showed it, not because he was proud of 
 it (in the place where he was there was no room for that temptation, 
 for it was not reputation, but reproach, that attended it), but because 
 he was not ashamed of it. Though Daniel was a great man, he did not
 think it below him to be thrice a day upon his knees before his Maker 
 and to be his own chaplain; though he was an old man, he did not think 
 himself past it; nor, though it had been his practice from his youth 
 up, was he weary of this well doing. Though he was a man of business, 
 vast business, for the service of the public, he did not think that 
 would excuse him from the daily exercises of devotion. How inexcusable 
 then are those who have but little to do in the world, and yet will not 
 do thus much for God and their souls! Daniel was a man famous for 
 prayer, and for success in it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:14">Ezek. xiv. 14</A>),

 and he came to be so by thus making a conscience of prayer and making a
 business of it daily; and in thus doing God blessed him 
 wonderfully.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Daniel's constant adherence to this practice, even when it was made 
 by the law a capital crime. When he knew that <I>the writing was 
 signed</I> he continued to do <I>as he did aforetime,</I> and altered 
 not one circumstance of the performance. Many a man, yea, and many a 
 good man, would have thought it prudence to omit it for these thirty 
 days, when he could not do it without hazard of his life; he might have 
 prayed so much oftener when those days had expired and the danger was 
 over, or he might have performed the duty at another time, and in 
 another place, so secretly that it should not be possible for his 
 enemies to discover it; and so he might both satisfy his conscience and 
 keep up his communion with God, and yet avoid the law, and continue in 
 his usefulness. But, if he had done so, it would have been thought, 
 both by his friends and by his enemies, that he had thrown up the duty 
 for this time, through cowardice and base fear, which would have tended 
 very much to the dishonour of God and the discouragement of his 
 friends. Others who moved in a lower sphere might well enough act with 
 caution; but Daniel, who had so many eyes upon him, must act with 
 courage; and the rather because he knew that the law, when it was made, 
 was particularly levelled against him. Note, We must not omit duty for 
 fear of suffering, so, nor so much as <I>seems to come short</I> of it. 
 In trying times great stress is laid upon our <I>confessing Christ 
 before men</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:32">Matt. x. 32</A>),

 and we must take heed lest, under pretence of discretion, we be found
 guilty of cowardice in the cause of God. If we do not think that this 
 example of Daniel obliges us to do likewise, yet I am sure it forbids 
 us to censure those that do, for God owned him in it. By his constancy 
 to his duty it now appears that he had never been used to admit any 
 excuse for the omission of it; for, if ever any excuse would serve to 
 put it by, this would have served now, 

 (1.) That it was forbidden by the king his master, and in honour of the
 king too; but it is an undoubted maxim, in answer to that, We are to 
 obey God rather than men.

 (2.) That it would be the loss of his life, but it is an undoubted
 maxim, in answer to that, Those who throw away their souls (as those 
 certainly do that live without prayer) to save their lives make but a 
 bad bargain for themselves; and though herein they make themselves, 
 like the king of Tyre, <I>wiser than Daniel,</I> at their end they will 
 be fools.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and
 making supplication before his God.
 &nbsp; 12  Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning
 the king's decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man
 that shall ask <I>a petition</I> of any God or man within thirty days,
 save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The
 king answered and said, The thing <I>is</I> true, according to the law
 of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.
 &nbsp; 13  Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel,
 which <I>is</I> of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth
 not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but
 maketh his petition three times a day.
 &nbsp; 14  Then the king, when he heard <I>these</I> words, was sore
 displeased with himself, and set <I>his</I> heart on Daniel to deliver
 him: and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver
 him.
 &nbsp; 15  Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the
 king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians <I>is,</I>
 That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be
 changed.
 &nbsp; 16  Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast
 <I>him</I> into the den of lions. <I>Now</I> the king spake and said unto
 Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver
 thee.
 &nbsp; 17  And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den;
 and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet
 of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning
 Daniel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is 

 1. Proof made of Daniel's praying to his God, notwithstanding the late 
 edict to the contrary

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>These men assembled;</I> the <I>came tumultuously together,</I> so 
 the word is, the same that was used 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>,
 
 borrowed from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1">Ps. ii. 1</A>,

 <I>Why do the heathen rage?</I> They came together to visit Daniel, 
 perhaps under pretence of business, at that time which they knew to be 
 his usual hour of devotion; and, if they had not found him so engaged, 
 they would have upbraided him with his faint-heartedness and distrust 
 of his God, but (which they rather wished to do) they <I>found him on 
 his knees praying</I> and <I>making supplication before his God. For 
 his love they are his adversaries;</I> but, like his father David, he 
 <I>gives himself unto prayer,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+109:4">Ps. cix. 4</A>.

 2. Complaint made of it to the king. When they had found occasion 
 against Daniel concerning <I>the law of his God</I> they lost no time, 
 but applied to the king

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 and having appealed to his whether there was not such a law made, and 
 gained from him a recognition of it, and that it was so ratified that 
 it might not be altered, they proceeded to accuse Daniel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 They so describe him, in the information they give, as to exasperate 
 the king and incense him the more against him: "He is <I>of the 
 children of the captivity of Judah;</I> he is of Judah, that despicable 
 people, and now a captive in a despicable state, that can call nothing 
 his own but what he has by the king's favour, and yet <I>he regards not 
 thee, O king! nor the decree that thou hast signed.</I>" Note, It is no 
 new thing for that which is done faithfully, in the conscience towards 
 God, to be misrepresented as done obstinately and in contempt of the 
 civil powers, that is, for the best saints to be reproached as the 
 worst men. Daniel regarded God, and therefore prayed, and we have
 reason to think prayed for the king and his government, yet this is 
 construed as not regarding the king. That excellent spirit which Daniel 
 was endued with, and that established reputation which he had gained, 
 could not protect him from these poisonous darts. They do not say, He 
 makes his petition to his God, lest Darius should take notice of that 
 to his praise, but only, <I>He makes his petition,</I> which is the 
 thing the law forbids.

 3. The great concern the king was in hereupon. He now perceived that,
 whatever they pretended, it was not to honour him, but in spite to 
 Daniel, that they had proposed that law, and now he is <I>sorely 
 displeased with himself</I> for gratifying them in it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Note, When men indulge a proud vain-glorious humour, and please 
 themselves with that which feeds it, they know not what vexations they 
 are preparing for themselves; their flatterers may prove their 
 tormentors, and are but <I>spreading a net for their feet.</I> Now, the 
 king <I>sets his heart to deliver Daniel;</I> both by argument and by 
 authority he labours <I>till the going down of the sun</I> to 
 <I>deliver him,</I> that is, to persuade his accusers not to insist 
 upon his prosecution. Note, We often do that, through inconsideration, 
 which afterwards we see cause a thousand times to wish undone again, 
 which is a good reason why we should <I>ponder the path of our 
 feet,</I> for then <I>all our ways will be established.</I> 

 4. The violence with which the prosecutors demanded judgment,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 We are not told what Daniel said; the king himself is his advocate, he 
 needs not plead his own cause, but silently commits himself and it to 
 him that judges righteously. But the prosecutors insist upon it that 
 the law must have its course; it is a fundamental maxim in the 
 constitution of the government of the Medes and Persians, which had now 
 become the universal monarchy, that <I>no decree or statute which the 
 king establishes may be changed.</I> The same we find 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:19,8:8">Esth. i. 19; viii. 8</A>.
 
 The Chaldeans magnified the will of their king, by giving him a power
 to make and unmake laws at his pleasure, to slay and keep alive whom he 
 would. The Persians magnified the wisdom of their king, by supposing 
 that whatever law he solemnly ratified it was so well made that there 
 could be no occasion to alter it, or dispense with it, as if any human 
 foresight could, in framing a law, guard against all inconveniences.
 But, if this maxim be duly applied to Daniel's case (as I am apt to 
 think it is not, but perverted), while it honours the king's 
 legislative power it hampers his executive power, and incapacitates him 
 to show that mercy which upholds the throne, and to pass acts of 
 indemnity, which are the glories of a reign. Those who allow not the 
 sovereign's power to dispense with a disabling statute, yet never 
 question his power to pardon an offence against a penal statute. But 
 Darius is denied this power. See what need we have to pray for princes 
 that God would give them wisdom, for they are often embarrassed with 
 great difficulties, even the wisest and best are. 

 5. The executing of the law upon Daniel. The king himself, with the
 utmost reluctance, and against his conscience, signs the warrant for 
 his execution; and Daniel, that venerable grave man, who carried such a 
 mixture of majesty and sweetness in his countenance, who had so often 
 looked great upon the bench, and at the council-board, and greater upon 
 his knees, who had power with God and man, and had prevailed, is 
 brought, purely for worshipping his God, as if he had been one of the 
 vilest of malefactors, and <I>thrown into the den of lions,</I> to be 
 devoured by them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 One cannot think of it without the utmost compassion to the gracious 
 sufferer and the utmost indignation at the malicious prosecutors. To 
 make sure work, the stone <I>laid upon the mouth of the den</I> is 
 <I>sealed,</I> and the king (an over-easy man) is persuaded to seal it 
 <I>with his own signet</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 that unhappy signet with which he had confirmed the law that Daniel 
 falls by. But his lords cannot trust him, unless they add their signets 
 too. Thus, when Christ was buried, his adversaries <I>sealed the
 stone</I> that was rolled to the door of his sepulchre. 

 6. The encouragement which Darius gave to Daniel to trust in God:
 <I>Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 Here
 
 (1.) He justifies Daniel from guilt, owning all his crime to be serving 
 his God continually, and continuing to do so even when it was made a 
 crime.

 (2.) He leaves it to God to free him from punishment, since he could
 not prevail to do it: <I>He will deliver thee.</I> He is sure that his 
 God can deliver him, for he believes him to be an almighty God, and he 
 has reason to think he will do it, having heard of his delivering 
 Daniel's companions in a like case from the fiery furnace, and 
 concluding him to be always faithful to those who approve themselves 
 faithful to him. Note, Those who serve God continually he will 
 continually preserve, and will bear them out in his service.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night
 fasting: neither were instruments of music brought before him:
 and his sleep went from him.
 &nbsp; 19  Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in
 haste unto the den of lions.
 &nbsp; 20  And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable
 voice unto Daniel: <I>and</I> the king spake and said to Daniel, O
 Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest
 continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?
 &nbsp; 21  Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.
 &nbsp; 22  My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths,
 that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was
 found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.
 &nbsp; 23  Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that
 they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up
 out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because
 he believed in his God.
 &nbsp; 24  And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had
 accused Daniel, and they cast <I>them</I> into the den of lions, them,
 their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of
 them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at
 the bottom of the den.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The melancholy night which the king had, upon Daniel's account, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 He had said, indeed, that God would deliver him out of the danger, but 
 at the same time he could not forgive himself for throwing him into the 
 danger; and justly might God deprive him of a friend whom he had 
 himself used so barbarously. He <I>went to his palace,</I> vexed at 
 himself for what he had done, and calling himself unwise and unjust for 
 not adhering to the law of God and nature with a <I>non obstante--a 
 negative</I> to the law of the Medes and Persians. He ate no supper, 
 but <I>passed the night fasting;</I> his heart was already full of 
 grief and fear. He forbade the music; nothing is more unpleasing that 
 songs sung to a heavy heart. He went to bed, but got no sleep, was full 
 of <I>tossings to and fro</I> till the dawning of the day. Note, the 
 best way to have a good night is to keep a good conscience, then we may 
 lie down in peace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The solicitous enquiry he made concerning Daniel the next morning,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 He was up early, <I>very early;</I> for how could he lie in bed when he 
 could not sleep for dreaming of Daniel, nor lie awake quietly for 
 thinking of him? And he was no sooner up than he <I>went in haste to 
 the den of lions,</I> for he could not satisfy himself to send a 
 servant (that would not sufficiently testify his affection for Daniel), 
 nor had he patience to stay so long as till a servant would return. 
 When he comes to the den, not without some hopes that God had 
 graciously undone what he had wickedly done, he cries, <I>with a 
 lamentable voice,</I> as one full of concern and trouble, <I>O 
 Daniel!</I> art thou alive? He longs to know, yet trembles to ask the 
 question, fearing to be answered with the roaring of the lions after 
 more prey: <I>O Daniel! servant of the living God,</I> has <I>thy God 
 whom thou servest</I> made it to appear that he is <I>able to deliver 
 thee from the lions?</I> If he rightly understood himself when he 
 called him <I>the living God,</I> he could not doubt of his ability to 
 keep Daniel alive, for he that has life in himself quickens whom he 
 will; but has he thought fit in this case to exert his power? What he 
 doubted of we are sure of, that the <I>servants of the living God</I> 
 have a Master who is well able to protect them and bear them out in his 
 service.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The joyful news he meets with-that Daniel is alive, is safe, and 
 well, and unhurt in the lions' den, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.

 Daniel knew the king's voice, though it was now a lamentable voice, and 
 spoke to him with all the deference and respect that were due to him: 
 <I>O king! live for ever.</I> He does not reproach him for his 
 unkindness to him, and his easiness in yielding to the malice of his 
 persecutors; but, to show that he has heartily forgiven him, he meets 
 him with his good wishes. Note, We should not upbraid those with the
 diskindnesses they have done us who, we know, did them with reluctance, 
 and are very ready to upbraid themselves with them. The account Daniel 
 gives the king is very pleasant; it is triumphant. 

 1. God has preserved his life by a miracle. Darius had called him
 Daniel's god (<I>thy God whom thou servest</I>), to which Daniel does 
 as it were echo back, Yea, he is <I>my God,</I> whom I own, and who 
 owns me, for <I>he has sent his angel.</I> The same bright and glorious 
 being that was seen in <I>the form of the Son of God</I> with the three 
 children in the fiery furnace had visited Daniel, and, it is likely, in 
 a visible appearance had enlightened the dark den, and kept Daniel 
 company all night, and had <I>shut the lions' mouths, that they</I> had 
 not in the least <I>hurt him.</I> The angel's presence made even the 
 lions' den his strong-hold, his palace, his paradise; he had never had 
 a better night in his life. See the power of God over the fiercest 
 creatures, and believe his power to restrain the roaring lion that 
 <I>goes about continually seeking to devour</I> from hurting those that 
 are his. See the care God takes of his faithful worshippers, especially 
 when he calls them out to suffer for him. If he keeps their souls from 
 sin, comforts their souls with his peace, and receives their souls to 
 himself, he does in effect <I>stop the lions' mouths,</I> that they 
 cannot hurt them. See how ready the angels are to minister for the good 
 of God's people, for they own themselves their <I>fellow servants.</I> 
 
 2. God has therein pleaded his cause. He was represented to the king as
 disaffected to him and his government. We do not find that he said any 
 thing in his own vindication, but left it to God to clear up his 
 integrity as the light; and he did it effectually, by working a miracle 
 for his preservation. Daniel, in what he had done, had not offended 
 either God or the king: <I>Before him</I> whom I prayed to <I>innocency 
 was found in me.</I> He pretends not to a meritorious excellence, but 
 the testimony of his conscience concerning his sincerity is his 
 comfort--<I>As also that before thee, O king! I have done no hurt,</I> 
 nor designed thee any affront.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The discharge of Daniel from his confinement. His prosecutors 
 cannot but own that the law is satisfied, though they are not, or, if 
 it be altered, it is by a power superior to that of the Medes and 
 Persians; and therefore no cause can be shown why Daniel should not be 
 fetched out of the den 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>The king was exceedingly glad</I> to find him alive, and gave orders 
 immediately that they should <I>take him out of the den,</I> as 
 Jeremiah out of the dungeon; and, when they searched, <I>no manner of 
 hurt was found upon him;</I> he was nowhere crushed nor scarred, but 
 was kept perfectly well, <I>because he believed in his God.</I> Note, 
 Those who boldly and cheerfully trust in God to protect them in the way 
 of their duty shall never be made ashamed of their confidence in him, 
 but shall always find him a present help.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The committing of his prosecutors to the same prison, or place of 
 execution rather, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Darius is animated by this miracle wrought for Daniel, and now begins 
 to take courage and act like himself. Those that would not suffer him 
 to show mercy to Daniel shall, now that God has done it for him, be 
 made to feel his resentments; and he will do justice for God who had 
 shown mercy for him. Daniel's accusers, now that his innocency is 
 cleared, and Heaven itself has become his compurgator, have the same 
 punishment inflicted upon them which they designed against him, 
 according to the law of retaliation made against false accusers,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+19:18,19">Deut. xix. 18, 19</A>.

 Such they were to be reckoned now that Daniel was proved innocent; for,
 though the fact was true, yet it was not a fault. They were <I>cast 
 into the den of lions,</I> which perhaps was a punishment newly 
 invented by themselves; however, it was what they maliciously designed 
 for Daniel. <I>Nec lex est justior ulla qu&agrave;m necis artifices 
 arte perire su&acirc;--No law can be more just than that which adjudges 
 the devisers of barbarity to perish by it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:15,16,9:15,16">Ps. vii. 15, 16; ix. 15, 16</A>.
 
 And now Solomon's observation is verified

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+11:8">Prov. xi. 8</A>),

 <I>The righteous is delivered out of trouble,</I> and <I>the wicked
 cometh in his stead.</I> In this execution we may observe, 

 1. The king's severity, in ordering their wives and children to be 
 thrown to the lions with them. How righteous are God's statutes above 
 those of the nations! for God commanded that the children should not 
 die for the fathers' crimes,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:16">Deut. xxiv. 16</A>.

 Yet they were put to death in extraordinary cases, as those of Achan,
 and Saul, and Haman. 

 2. The lion's fierceness. They had the <I>mastery of them</I>
 immediately, and tore them to pieces <I>before they came to the bottom 
 of the den.</I> This verified and magnified the miracle of their 
 sparing Daniel; for hereby it appeared that it was not because they had 
 not appetite, but because they had not leave. Mastiffs that are kept 
 muzzled are the more fierce when the muzzle is taken off; so were these 
 lions. And the Lord is known by those judgments which he executes.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>25  Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and
 languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto
 you.
 &nbsp; 26  I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men
 tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he <I>is</I> the living
 God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom <I>that</I> which shall
 not be destroyed, and his dominion <I>shall be even</I> unto the end.
 &nbsp; 27  He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders
 in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power
 of the lions.
 &nbsp; 28  So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the
 reign of Cyrus the Persian.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Darius here studies to make some amends for the dishonour he had done 
 both to God and Daniel, in casting Daniel into the lions' den, by doing 
 honour to both.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He gives honour to God by a decree published to all nations, by 
 which they are required to fear before him. And this is a decree which 
 is indeed fit to be made unalterable, according to the laws of the 
 Medes and Persians, for it is the <I>everlasting gospel,</I> preached 
 to those that <I>dwell on the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:7">Rev. xiv. 7</A>.

 <I>Fear God, and give glory to him.</I> Observe, 

 1. To whom he sends this decree--<I>to all people, nations and 
 languages, that dwell in all the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 These are great words, and it is true that all the inhabitants of the 
 earth are obliged to that which is here decreed; but here they mean no 
 more than <I>every dominion of his kingdom,</I> which, though it 
 contained many nations, did not contain all nations; but so it is, 
 those that have much are ready to think they have all. 

 2. What the matter of the decree is--that <I>men tremble and fear
 before the God of Daniel.</I> This goes further than Nebuchadnezzar's 
 decree upon a similar occasion, for that only restrained people from 
 <I>speaking amiss</I> of this God, but this requires them to <I>fear 
 before him,</I> to keep up and express awful reverent thoughts of him.
 And well might this decree he prefaced, as it is, with <I>Peace be 
 multiplied unto you,</I> for the only foundation of true and abundant 
 peace is laid in the fear of God, for that is true wisdom. If we live 
 in the fear of God, and walk according to that rule, peace shall be 
 upon us, peace shall be multiplied to us. But, though this decree goes 
 far, it does not go far enough; had he done right, and come up to his 
 present convictions, he would have commanded all men not only to 
 tremble and fear before this God, but to love him and trust in him, to 
 forsake the service of their idols, and to worship him only, and call 
 upon him as Daniel did. But idolatry had been so long and so deeply 
 rooted that it was not to be extirpated by the edicts of princes, nor 
 by any power less than that which went along with the glorious gospel 
 of Christ. 

 3. What are the causes and considerations moving him to make this
 decree. They are sufficient to have justified a decree for the total 
 suppression of idolatry, much more will they serve to support this. 
 There is good reason why all men should fear before this God, for,

 (1.) His being is transcendent. "He is the <I>living God,</I> lives as
 a God, whereas the gods we worship are dead things, have not so much as 
 an animal life."

 (2.) His government is incontestable. He has a <I>kingdom,</I> and a
 <I>dominion;</I> he not only lives, but reigns as an absolute 
 sovereign.

 (3.) Both his being and his government are unchangeable. He is himself
 <I>stedfast for ever,</I> and with him is no shadow of turning. And his 
 <I>kingdom</I> too is <I>that which shall not be destroyed</I> by any 
 external force, nor has his <I>dominion</I> any thing in itself that 
 threatens a decay or tends towards it, and therefore it shall be 
 <I>even to the end.</I>

 (4.) He has an ability sufficient to support such an authority,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 He delivers his faithful servants from trouble and rescues them out of 
 trouble; he <I>works signs and wonders,</I> quite above the utmost 
 power of nature to effect, both <I>in heaven and on earth,</I> by which 
 it appears that he is sovereign Lord of both. 

 (5.) He has given a fresh proof of all this in <I>delivering</I> his
 servant <I>Daniel from the power of the lions.</I> This miracle, and 
 that of the delivering of the three children, were wrought in the eyes 
 of the world, were seen, published, and attested by two of the greatest 
 monarchs that ever were, and were illustrious confirmations of the 
 first principles of religion, abstracted from the narrow scheme of 
 Judaism, effectual confutations of all the errors of heathenism, and 
 very proper preparations for pure catholic Christianity.</P>

 II. He puts honour upon Daniel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 <I>So this Daniel prospered.</I> See how God brought to him good out of 
 evil. This bold stroke which his enemies made at his life was a happy 
 occasion of taking them off, and their children too, who otherwise 
 would still have stood in the way of his preferment, and have been upon 
 all occasions vexatious to him; and now he <I>prospered more than 
 ever,</I> was more in favour with his prince and in reputation with the 
 people, which gave him a great opportunity of doing good to his 
 brethren. Thus <I>out of the eater</I> (and that was a lion too) 
 <I>comes forth meat, and out of the strong sweetness.</I></P>
