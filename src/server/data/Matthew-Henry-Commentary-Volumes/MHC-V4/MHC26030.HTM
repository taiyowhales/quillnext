 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have, 

 I. A continuation of the prophecy against Egypt, which we had in the
 latter part of the foregoing chapter, just before the desolation of 
 that once flourishing kingdom was completed by Nebuchadnezzar, in which 
 is foretold the destruction of all her allies and confederates, all her 
 interests and concerns, and the several steps which the king of Babylon 
 should take in pushing on this destruction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:1-19">ver. 1-19</A>.

 II. A repetition of a former prophecy against Egypt, just before the
 desolation of it begun by their own bad conduct, which gradually
 weakened them and prepared the way for the king of Babylon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:20-26">ver. 20-26</A>.
 
 It is all much to the same purport with what we had before.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came again unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Howl
 ye, Woe worth the day!
 &nbsp; 3  For the day <I>is</I> near, even the day of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> near, a
 cloudy day; it shall be the time of the heathen.
 &nbsp; 4  And the sword shall come upon Egypt, and great pain shall be
 in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they shall
 take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken
 down.
 &nbsp; 5  Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the mingled people,
 and Chub, and the men of the land that is in league, shall fall
 with them by the sword.
 &nbsp; 6  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall;
 and the pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of
 Syene shall they fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 7  And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries
 <I>that are</I> desolate, and her cities shall be in the midst of the
 cities <I>that are</I> wasted.
 &nbsp; 8  And they shall know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, when I have set a
 fire in Egypt, and <I>when</I> all her helpers shall be destroyed.
 &nbsp; 9  In that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to
 make the careless Ethiopians afraid, and great pain shall come
 upon them, as in the day of Egypt: for, lo, it cometh.
 &nbsp; 10  Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; I will also make the multitude of
 Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.
 &nbsp; 11  He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations,
 shall be brought to destroy the land: and they shall draw their
 swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.
 &nbsp; 12  And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the
 hand of the wicked: and I will make the land waste, and all that
 is therein, by the hand of strangers: I the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> have spoken
 <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 13  Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; I will also destroy the idols, and
 I will cause <I>their</I> images to cease out of Noph; and there shall
 be no more a prince of the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear
 in the land of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 14  And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set fire in Zoan,
 and will execute judgments in No.
 &nbsp; 15  And I will pour my fury upon Sin, the strength of Egypt; and
 I will cut off the multitude of No.
 &nbsp; 16  And I will set fire in Egypt: Sin shall have great pain, and
 No shall be rent asunder, and Noph <I>shall have</I> distresses daily.
 &nbsp; 17  The young men of Aven and of Pi-beseth shall fall by the
 sword: and these <I>cities</I> shall go into captivity.
 &nbsp; 18  At Tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened, when I shall
 break there the yokes of Egypt: and the pomp of her strength
 shall cease in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her
 daughters shall go into captivity.
 &nbsp; 19  Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt: and they shall know
 that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophecy of the destruction of Egypt is here very full and 
 particular, as well as, in the general, very frightful. What can 
 protect a provoking people when the righteous God comes forth to 
 contend with them?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It shall be a very lamentable destruction, and such as shall 
 occasion great sorrow 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>):

 "<I>Howl you;</I> you may justly shriek now that it is coming, for you 
 will be made to shriek and make hideous outcries when it comes. Cry 
 out, <I>Woe worth the day!</I> or, <I>Ah the day! alas because of the 
 day!</I> the terrible day! <I>Woe and alas!</I> For <I>the day is 
 near;</I> the day we have so long dreaded, so long deserved. It is the 
 <I>day of the Lord,</I> the day in which he will manifest himself as a 
 God of vengeance. You have your day now, when you carry all before you, 
 and trample on all about you, but God will have his day shortly, the 
 day of the revelation of his righteous judgment," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:13">Ps. xxxvii. 13</A>.

 It will be <I>a cloudy day,</I> that is, dark and dismal, without the
 shining forth of any comfort; and it shall threaten a storm--<I>fire, 
 and brimstone, and a horrible tempest. It shall be the time of the
 heathen,</I> of reckoning with the heathen for all their heathenish 
 practices, that time which David spoke of when God would <I>pour out 
 his fury upon the heathen</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:6">Ps. lxxix. 6</A>),
 
 when <I>they should sink,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:15">Ps. ix. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It shall be the destruction of Egypt, and of all the states and 
 countries in confederacy with her and in her neighbourhood. 

 1. Egypt herself shall fall

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 The <I>sword shall come upon Egypt,</I> the sword of the Chaldeans, and 
 it shall be a victorious sword, for the <I>slain shall fall in 
 Egypt,</I> fall by it, fall before it. Is the country populous? They 
 shall <I>take away her multitude.</I> Is it strong, and well-fixed? 
 <I>Her foundations shall be broken down,</I> and then the fabric, 
 though built ever so fine, ever so high, will fall of course. 

 2. Her neighbours and inmates shall fall with her. When the slain fall 
 so thickly in Egypt <I>great pain shall be in Ethiopia,</I> both that 
 in Africa, which is in the neighbourhood of Egypt on one side, and that 
 in Asia, which is near to it on the other side. When their neighbour's 
 house was on fire they could not but apprehend their own in danger; nor 
 were their fears groundless, for they shall all <I>fall with them by 
 the sword,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 <I>Ethiopia and Libya</I> (Cush and Phut, so the Hebrew names are, two 
 of the sons of Ham who are mentioned, and Mizraim, that is, Egypt, 
 between them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:6">Gen. x. 6</A>),

 <I>and the Lydians</I> (who were famous archers, and are spoken of as
 confederates with Egypt,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:9">Jer. xlvi. 9</A>),
 
 these shall fall with Egypt and <I>Chub</I> (the Chaldeans, the
 inhabitants of the inner Libya); these and others were the <I>mingled 
 people;</I> there were those of all these and other countries who upon 
 some account or other resided in Egypt, as did also <I>the men of the 
 land that is in league,</I> some of the remains of the people of Israel 
 and Judah, the <I>children of the covenant,</I> or league, as they are 
 called 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:25">Acts iii. 25</A>),
 
 the <I>children of the promise,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:28">Gal. iv. 28</A>.
 
 These sojourned in Egypt contrary to God's command, and these shall
 <I>fall with them.</I> Note, Those that will take their lot with God's 
 enemies shall have their lot with them, yea, though they be in 
 profession the men of the land that is in league with God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. All that pretend to support the sinking interests of Egypt shall 
 come down under her, shall come down with her 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Those that uphold Egypt shall fall,</I> and then Egypt must fall of 
 course. See the justice of God; Egypt pretended to uphold Jerusalem 
 when that was tottering, but proved a deceitful reed; and now those 
 that pretended to uphold Egypt shall prove no better. Those that 
 deceive others are commonly paid in their own coin; they are themselves 
 deceived. 

 1. Does Egypt think herself upheld by the absolute authority and
 dominion of her king? The <I>pride of her power</I> shall <I>come 
 down,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 The power of the king of Egypt was his pride; but that shall be broken, 
 and humbled. 

 2. Is the multitude of her people her support? These shall <I>fall by
 the sword,</I> even <I>from the tower of Syene,</I> which is in the 
 utmost corner of the land, from that side of it by which the enemy 
 shall enter. Both the <I>countries</I> and the <I>cities,</I> the 
 husbandmen and the merchants, shall be desolate,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>,
 
 as before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:12"><I>ch.</I> xxix. 12</A>.

 Even <I>the multitude of Egypt shall be made to cease,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 That populous country shall be depopulated. The land shall be even 
 <I>filled with the slain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 3. Is the river Nile her support, and are the several channels of it a 
 defence to her? "<I>I will make the rivers dry</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 so that those natural fortifications which were thought impregnable, 
 because impassable, shall stand them in no stead." 

 4. Are her idols a support to her? They shall be destroyed; those 
 imaginary upholders shall appear more than ever to be imaginary, for so 
 images are when they pretend to be deliverers and strongholds

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>I will cause their images to cease out of Noph.</I> 

 5. Is her royal family her support? <I>There shall be no more a prince
 in the land of Egypt;</I> the royal family shall be extirpated and 
 extinguished, which had continued so long. 

 6. Is her courage her support, and does she think to uphold herself by
 the bravery of her men of war, who have now of late been inured to 
 service? That shall fail: <I>I will put a fear in the land of
 Egypt.</I> 

 7. Is the rising generation her support? is she upheld by her children, 
 and does she think herself happy because she has her quiver full of 
 them? Alas! <I>the young men shall fall by the sword</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>)

 and <I>the daughters shall go into captivity</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 and so she shall be robbed of all her hopes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. God shall inflict these desolating judgments on Egypt 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):
 
 <I>They shall know that I am the Lord,</I> and greater than all gods, 
 than all <I>their</I> gods, when I have <I>set a fire in Egypt.</I> The 
 fire that consumes nations is of God's kindling; and, when he sets fire 
 to a people, <I>all their helpers shall be destroyed.</I> Those that go 
 about to quench the fire shall themselves be devoured by it; for who 
 can stand before him when he is angry? When he <I>pours out his 
 fury</I> upon a place, when he sets fire to it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>),

 neither its strength nor its multitude can stand it in any stead.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The king of Babylon and his army shall be employed as instruments of 
 this destruction: <I>The multitude of Egypt shall be made to cease</I> 
 and be quite cut off <I>by the hand of the king of Babylon,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 Those that undertook to protect Israel from the king of Babylon shall 
 not be able to protect themselves. It is said of the Chaldeans, who 
 should destroy Egypt, 
 
 1. That they are <I>strangers</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 who therefore shall show no compassion for old acquaintance-sake, but 
 shall behave strangely towards them. 

 2. That they are <I>the terrible of the nations</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 both in respect of force and in respect of fierceness; and, being 
 terrible, they shall make terrible work. 

 (3.) That they are <I>the wicked,</I> who will not be restrained by 
 reason and conscience, the laws of nature or the laws of nations, for 
 they are without law: <I>I will sell the land into the hand of the 
 wicked.</I> They do violence <I>unjustly,</I> as they are wicked; yet, 
 so far as they are instruments in God's hand of executing his 
 judgments, it is on his part justly done. Note, God often makes one 
 wicked man a scourge to another; and even wicked men acquire a title to 
 prey, <I>jure belli--by the laws of war,</I> for God <I>sells it into 
 their hands.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. No place in the land of Egypt shall be exempted from the fury of 
 the Chaldean army, not the strongest, not the remotest: <I>The sword 
 shall go through the land.</I> Various places are here named: 
 <I>Pathros, Zoan, and No</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 <I>Sin and Noph</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>),
 
 <I>Aven and Pi-beseth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 and <I>Tehaphnehes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 These shall be made desolate, shall be fired, and God's judgments shall 
 be executed upon them, and his fury poured out upon them. Their 
 strength and multitude shall be <I>cut off;</I> they shall have 
 <I>great pain,</I> shall be <I>rent asunder</I> with fear, and shall 
 <I>have distresses daily.</I> Their <I>day shall be darkened;</I> their 
 honours, comforts, and hopes, shall be extinguished. Their <I>yokes</I> 
 shall be <I>broken,</I> so that they shall no more oppress and 
 tyrannize as they have done. The <I>pomp of their strength shall 
 cease,</I> and <I>a cloud shall cover them,</I> a cloud so thick that 
 through it they shall not see any hopes, nor shall their glory <I>be 
 seen,</I> or <I>shine further.</I> And, <I>lastly,</I> the Ethiopians, 
 who are at a distance from them, as well as those who are mingled with 
 them, shall share in their pain and terror. God will by his providence 
 spread the rumour, and the <I>careless Ethiopians</I> shall be <I>made 
 afraid,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Note, God can strike a terror upon those that are most secure; 
 fearfulness shall, when he pleases, surprise the most presumptuous 
 hypocrites.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The close of this prediction leaves, 

 1. The land of Egypt mortified: <I>Thus will I execute judgments on
 Egypt,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 The destruction of Egypt is the <I>executing of judgments,</I> which 
 intimates not only that it is done justly, for its sins, but that it is 
 done regularly and legally, by a judicial sentence. All the executions 
 God does are according to his judgments. 

 2. The God of Israel herein glorified: <I>They shall know that I am the 
 Lord.</I> The Egyptians shall be made to know it and the people of God 
 shall be made to know it better. <I>The Lord is known by the judgments
 which he executes.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first
 <I>month,</I> in the seventh <I>day</I> of the month, <I>that</I> the word of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 21  Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt;
 and, lo, it shall not be bound up to be healed, to put a roller
 to bind it, to make it strong to hold the sword.
 &nbsp; 22  Therefore thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Behold, I <I>am</I> against
 Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong, and
 that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of
 his hand.
 &nbsp; 23  And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will
 disperse them through the countries.
 &nbsp; 24  And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and
 put my sword in his hand: but I will break Pharaoh's arms, and he
 shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded
 <I>man.</I>
 &nbsp; 25  But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and
 the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I
 <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the
 king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of
 Egypt.
 &nbsp; 26  And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and
 disperse them among the countries; and they shall know that I
 <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This short prophecy of the weakening of the power of Egypt was 
 delivered about the time that the army of the Egyptians, which 
 attempted to raise the siege of Jerusalem, was frustrated in its 
 enterprises, and returned <I>re infect&acirc;--without accomplishing 
 their purpose;</I> whereupon the king of Babylon renewed the siege and 
 carried his point. The kingdom of Egypt was very ancient, and had been 
 for many ages considerable. That of Babylon had but lately arrived at 
 its great pomp and power, being built upon the ruins of the kingdom of 
 Assyria. Now it is with them as it is with families and states, some 
 are growing up, others are declining and going back; one must increase 
 and the others must of course decrease.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It is here foretold that the king of Egypt shall grow weaker and 
 weaker. The extent of his territories shall be abridged, his wealth and 
 power shall be diminished, and he shall become less able than ever to 
 help either himself or his friend. 
 
 1. This was in part done already
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>I have broken the arm of Pharaoh,</I> some time ago. One arm of that 
 kingdom might well be reckoned broken when the king of Babylon routed 
 the forces of Pharaoh-Necho at Carchemish 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:2">Jer. xlvi. 2</A>),

 and made himself master of <I>all that pertained to Egypt from the
 river of Egypt to Euphrates,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:7">2 Kings xxiv. 7</A>.

 Egypt had been long in gathering strength and extending its dominions,
 and therefore, that there may be a proportion observed in providence, 
 it loses its strength slowly and by degrees. It was soon after the king 
 of Egypt slew good king Josiah, and in the same reign, that its arm was 
 thus broken, and it received that fatal blow which it never recovered. 
 Before Egypt's heart and neck were broken its arm was. God's judgments 
 come upon a people by steps, that they may meet him repenting. When the 
 arm of Egypt is broken <I>it shall not be bound up to be healed,</I> 
 for none can heal the wounds that God gives but he himself. Those whom 
 he disarms, whom he disables, cannot again hold the sword.

 2. This was to be done again. One arm was broken before, and something 
 was done towards the setting of it, towards the healing of the deadly 
 wound that was given to the beast. But now

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 <I>I am against Pharaoh, and will break both his arms,</I> both <I>the 
 strong</I> and that <I>which was broken</I> and set again. Note, If 
 less judgments do not prevail to humble and reform sinners, God will 
 send greater. Now God will <I>cause the sword to fall out of his 
 hand,</I> which he caught hold of as thinking himself strong enough to 
 hold it. It is repeated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 <I>I will break Pharaoh's arms.</I> He had been a cruel oppressor to 
 the people of God formerly, and of late the <I>staff of a broken 
 rod</I> to them; and now God by breaking his arms reckons with him for 
 both. God justly breaks that power which is abused either to put wrongs 
 upon people or to put cheats upon them. But this is not all; 

 (1.) The king of Egypt shall be dispirited when he finds himself in 
 danger of the king of Babylon's forces: he <I>shall groan before him 
 with the groaning of a deadly wounded man.</I> Note, It is common for 
 those that are most elated in their prosperity to be most dejected and 
 disheartened in their adversity. Pharaoh, even before the sword touches 
 him, shall groan as if he had received his death's wound. 

 (2.) The people of Egypt shall be dispersed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:23,26"><I>v.</I> 23 and again <I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>I will scatter them among the nations.</I> Other nations had mingled 
 with them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>);

 now they shall be mingled with other nations, and seek shelter in them, 
 and so be made to know that the Lord is righteous.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It is here foretold that the king of Babylon shall grow stronger 
 and stronger, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>.

 <I>Put strength</I> into the king of Babylon's arms, that he may be 
 able to go through the service he is designed for.

 2. That he will <I>put a sword,</I> his sword, into the king of 
 Babylon's hand, which signified his giving him a commission and 
 furnishing him with arms for carrying on a war, particularly against 
 Egypt. Note, As judges on the bench, like Pilate 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:11">John xix. 11</A>),

 so generals in the field, like Nebuchadnezzar, have no power but what
 is given them from above.</P>
