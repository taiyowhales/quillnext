 We now return to Jerusalem, and must again hear what God has to say to 
 her, 

 I. By way of reproof and threatening, for the abundance of wickedness
 that was found in her, of which divers instances are given, with the 
 aggravations of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 II. By way of promise of mercy and grace, which God had yet in reserve
 for them. Two general heads of promises here are:--

 1. That God would bring in a glorious work of reformation among them,
 cleanse them from their sins, and bring them home to himself; many
 promises of this kind here are, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:8-13">ver. 8-13</A>.

 2. That he would bring about a glorious work of salvation for them,
 when he had thus prepared them for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:14-20">ver. 14-20</A>.

 Thus the "Redeemer shall come to Zion," and to clear his own way, shall
 "turn away ungodliness from Jacob." These promises were to have their
 full accomplishment in gospel-times and gospel-graces.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing
 city!
 &nbsp; 2 She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she
 trusted not in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; she drew not near to her God.
 &nbsp; 3 Her princes within her <I>are</I> roaring lions; her judges <I>are</I>
 evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.
 &nbsp; 4 Her prophets <I>are</I> light <I>and</I> treacherous persons: her
 priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to
 the law.
 &nbsp; 5 The just L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> in the midst thereof; he will not do
 iniquity: every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he
 faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame.
 &nbsp; 6 I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made
 their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are
 destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none
 inhabitant.
 &nbsp; 7 I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive
 instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I
 punished them: but they rose early, <I>and</I> corrupted all their
 doings.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 One would wonder that Jerusalem, the holy city, where God was known, 
 and his name was great, should be the city of which this black 
 character is here given, that a place which enjoyed such abundance of 
 the means of grace should become so very corrupt and vicious, and that 
 God should permit it to be so; yet so it is, to show that <I>the law 
 made nothing perfect;</I> but if this be the true character of 
 Jerusalem, as no doubt it is (for God's judgments will make none worse 
 than they are), it is no wonder that the prophet begins with <I>woe to 
 her.</I> For the holy God hates sin in those that are nearest to him, 
 nay, in them he hates it most. A sinful state is, and will be, a woeful 
 state.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is a very bad character given of the city in general. How has 
 the faithful city become a harlot! 

 1. She shames herself; she is <I>filthy and polluted</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 has made herself <I>infamous</I> (so some read it), <I>the 
 gluttonous</I> city (so the margin), always cramming, and making 
 provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts of it. Sin is the 
 filthiness and pollution of persons and places, and makes them odious 
 in the sight of the holy God. 

 2. She wrongs her neighbours and inhabitants; she is <I>the oppressing
 city.</I> Never any place had <I>statutes and judgments so 
 righteous</I> as this city had, and yet, in the administration of the 
 government, never was more unrighteousness.

 3. She is very provoking to her God, and in every respect walks 
 contrary to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 He had given his law, and spoken to her by his servants the prophets, 
 telling her what was the good she should do and what the evil she 
 should avoid; but <I>she obeyed not his voice,</I> nor made conscience 
 of doing as he commanded her, in any thing. He had taken her under an 
 excellent discipline, both of the word and of the rod; but she did not 
 receive the instruction of the one nor the correction of the other, did 
 not submit to God's will nor answer his end in either. He encouraged 
 her to depend upon him, and his power and promise, for deliverance from 
 evil and supply with good; but she <I>trusted not in the Lord;</I> her 
 confidence was placed in her alliances with the nations more than in 
 her covenant with God. He gave her tokens of his presence, and 
 instituted ordinances of communion for her with himself; but she 
 <I>drew not near to her God,</I> did not meet him where he appointed 
 and where he promised to meet her. She stood at a distance, and <I>said 
 to the Almighty, Depart.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is a very bad character of the leading men in it; those that 
 should by their influence suppress vice and profaneness there are the 
 great patterns and patrons of wickedness, and those that should be her 
 physicians are really her worst disease.

 1. <I>Her princes are</I> ravenous and barbarous as <I>roaring
 lions</I> that make a prey of all about them, and they are universally
 feared and hated; they use their power for destruction, and not for
 edification. 

 2. <I>Her judges,</I> who should be the protectors of injured
 innocence, <I>are evening wolves,</I> rapacious and greedy, and their 
 cruelty and covetousness both insatiable: <I>They gnaw not the bones 
 till the morrow;</I> they take so much delight and pleasure in cruelty 
 and oppression that when they have devoured a good man they reserve the 
 bones, as it were, for a sweet morsel, to be gnawed the next morning,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:31">Job xxxi. 31</A>.

 3. <I>Her prophets,</I> who pretend to be special messengers from
 heaven to them, <I>are light and treacherous persons,</I> fanciful, and 
 of a vain imagination, frothy and airy, and of a loose conversation, 
 men of no consistency with themselves, in whom one can put no 
 confidence. They were so given to bantering that it was hard to say 
 when they were serious. Their pretended prophecies were all a sham, and 
 they secretly laughed at those that were deluded by them. 

 4. <I>Her priests,</I> who are teachers by office and have the charge
 of the holy things, are false to their trust and betray it. They were 
 to preserve the purity of the <I>sanctuary,</I> but they did themselves 
 <I>pollute</I> it, and the sacred offices of it, which they were to 
 attend upon--such priests as Hophni and Phinehas, who by their wicked 
 lives <I>made the sacrifices of the Lord to be abhorred.</I> They were 
 to expound and apply <I>the law,</I> and to judge according to it; but, 
 in their explications and applications of it, they <I>did violence to 
 the law;</I> they corrupted the sense of it, and perverted it to the 
 patronising of that which was directly contrary to it. By forced 
 constructions, they made the law to speak what they pleased, to serve a 
 turn, and so, in effect, <I>made void the law.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We have here the aggravations of this general corruption of all 
 orders and degrees of men in Jerusalem.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They had the tokens of God's presence among them, and all the 
 advantages that could be of knowing his will, with the strongest 
 inducements possible to do it, and yet they persisted in their 
 disobedience, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 (1.) They had the honour and privilege of the Shechinah, God's dwelling 
 in their land, so as he dwelt not with any other people: "<I>The just 
 Lord is in the midst of thee,</I> to take cognizance of all thou doest 
 amiss and give countenance to all thou doest well; he is in the midst 
 of thee as a holy God, and therefore thy pollutions are the more 
 offensive, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:14">Deut. xxiii. 14</A>.

 He is in the midst of you as a just God, and therefore will punish the
 affronts you put upon him, and the wrongs and injuries you do to one 
 another."

 (2.) They had God's own example set before them, in the discovery he 
 made of himself to them, that they might conform to it: "<I>He will not 
 do iniquity,</I> and therefore you should not;" for this was the great 
 rule of their institution, "<I>Be you holy, for I am holy.</I> God will 
 be true to you; be not you then false to him." 

 (3.) He sent to them his prophets, rising up early and sending them: 
 <I>Every morning he brings his judgment to light,</I> as duly as the 
 morning comes; <I>he fails not.</I> He shows them plainly what the good 
 is which he requires of them, and puts them in mind of it; he <I>wakens 
 morning by morning</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:4">Isa. l. 4</A>),

 wakens his prophets with the rising sun, to bring to light the things
 which belong to their peace. So that, upon the whole matter, what more
 could have been done to his vineyard, to make it fruitful?
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:4">Isa. v. 4</A>.
 
 And yet, after all, <I>the unjust know no shame;</I> those that have
 been unjust are unjust still, and are not ashamed of their 
 unrighteousness, <I>neither can they blush.</I> If they had any sense 
 of honour, any shame left in them, they would not go so directly 
 contrary to their profession and to the instructions given them. But 
 those that are past shame are past cure.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. God had set before their eyes some remarkable monuments of his 
 justice, which were designed for warning to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>I have cut off the nations,</I> the seven nations of Canaan, which 
 the land spewed out for their wickedness, upon which they had this 
 caution given them, to take heed lest it <I>spew them out also,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:28">Lev. xviii. 28</A>.

 Or it may refer to some of the neighbouring nations that were made 
 desolate for their wickedness, especially to the nations of Israel, the 
 ten tribes. <I>Their towers were desolate,</I> their high towers,
 their strong towers, their pride and power broken; their <I>streets 
 were wasted,</I> so that none passed along through them; <I>their 
 cities</I> were <I>destroyed</I> and laid in ruins; <I>no man</I> was 
 to be found in them, <I>no inhabitant,</I> all were slain or carried 
 into captivity. The enemies did it, but God avows it: <I>I cut them
 off,</I> says he. And God designed this for an admonition to Jerusalem
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:9,11">Ezek. xxiii. 9, 11</A>):

 "<I>I said, Surely thou wilt fear me;</I> surely these judgments upon
 others will deter thee from the like wicked practices; <I>surely thou 
 wilt receive instruction</I> by these providences; it ought to be 
 expected that thou wouldst not continue to sin like the nations when 
 thou seest the ruin which their sin brought upon them." They could not 
 but see their own house in danger when their neighbour's was on fire; 
 and, when we are frightened, God should be feared.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He had set before them life and death, good and evil, both in his 
 word and in his providence. 

 (1.) He had assured them of the continuance of their prosperity if they 
 would fear him and receive instruction, for so <I>their dwelling would 
 not be cut off</I> as their neighbour's was; if they took the warning 
 given them, and reformed, what was past should be pardoned, and their 
 tranquility lengthened out. 

 (2.) He had made them feel the smart of the rod, though he reprieved 
 them from the sword: <I>Howsoever I punished them,</I> that, being 
 chastened, they might not be condemned. Such various methods did God 
 take with them, to reclaim them, but all in vain; they were not won 
 upon by gentle methods, nor had severe ones any effect, for <I>they 
 rose early, and corrupted all their doings;</I> they were more resolute 
 and eager in their wicked courses than ever, more studious and 
 solicitous in making provision for their lusts, and let slip no 
 opportunity for the gratification of them. God <I>rose up early,</I> to 
 send them his <I>prophets,</I> to reduce and reclaim them, but they 
 were <I>up before him,</I> to shut and bolt the door against them. 
 Their wickedness was universal: <I>All their doings</I> were corrupted; 
 and it was all owing to themselves; they could not lay the blame upon 
 the tempter, but they alone must bear it; they themselves wilfully and 
 designedly <I>corrupted all their doings;</I> for <I>every man is 
 tempted when he is drawn aside of his own lust and enticed.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8 Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, until the day that
 I rise up to the prey: for my determination <I>is</I> to gather the
 nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine
 indignation, <I>even</I> all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall
 be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.
 &nbsp; 9 For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they
 may all call upon the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to serve him with one
 consent.
 &nbsp; 10 From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, <I>even</I> the
 daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.
 &nbsp; 11 In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings,
 wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take
 away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and
 thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain.
 &nbsp; 12 I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor
 people, and they shall trust in the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 13 The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies;
 neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for
 they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make <I>them</I> afraid.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Things looked very bad with Jerusalem in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:1-7">foregoing verses</A>;

 she has got into a very bad name, and seems to be incorrigible,
 incurable, mercy-proof and judgment-proof. Now one would think it 
 should follow, Therefore expect no other but that she should be utterly 
 abandoned and rejected as <I>reprobate silver;</I> since they will not 
 be wrought upon by prophets or providences, let them be made a 
 desolation as their neighbours have been. But behold and wonder at the 
 riches of divine grace, which takes occasion from man's badness to 
 appear so much the more illustrious. They still grew worse and worse, 
 <I>therefore wait you upon me, saith the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 "Since the <I>law,</I> it seems, will <I>make nothing perfect,</I> the 
 <I>bringing in of a better hope shall.</I> Let those that lament the 
 corruptions of the church <I>wait upon God,</I> till he send his Son 
 into the world, to <I>save his people from their sins,</I> till he send 
 his gospel to reform and refine his church, and to purify to himself a 
 peculiar people both of Jews and Gentiles." And there were those who, 
 according to this direction and encouragement, <I>waited for 
 redemption,</I> for this redemption in Jerusalem; and long-looked-for 
 came at last, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:38">Luke ii. 38</A>.

 <I>For judgment</I> Christ will <I>come into this world,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:39">John ix. 39</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To avenge what has been done amiss against his church, to bring down 
 and destroy the enemies of it, its spiritual enemies, of which the 
 destruction of Babylon, and other oppressors of God's people, in the 
 Old-Testament times, was a type, and would be a happy presage. He will 
 <I>rise up to the prey,</I> to <I>lead captivity captive</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+67:18">Ps. lxvii. 18</A>),

 to conquer and spoil the powers of darkness, and the powers on earth
 that set themselves <I>against the Lord and his anointed;</I> he will 
 <I>break them with a rod of iron</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:5,9,11:5,6">Ps. ii. 5, 9; xi. 5, 6</A>);

 his <I>determination is to gather the nations</I> and to <I>assemble
 the kingdoms.</I> By the gospel of Christ preached to every creature 
 all nations are summoned, as it were, to appear in a body before the 
 Lord Jesus, who is about to set up his kingdom in the world. But, since 
 the greatest part of mankind will not obey the summons, he will <I>pour 
 upon them his indignation,</I> for he that <I>believes not is condemned 
 already.</I> At the time of the setting up of the kingdom of the 
 Messiah, there shall be on earth <I>distress of nations with 
 perplexity</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:25">Luke xxi. 25</A>),

 <I>great tribulation,</I> such as <I>never was, nor ever shall be,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:21">Matt. xxiv. 21</A>.

 Then God pours upon the nations his indignation, even <I>all his fierce
 anger,</I> for their indignation and fierce anger against the Messiah
 and his kingdom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1,2">Ps. ii. 1, 2</A>.

 Then <I>all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of his
 jealousy;</I> both Jews and Gentiles shall be reckoned with for their 
 enmity to the gospel. Principalities and powers shall be spoiled, and 
 <I>made a show of openly,</I> and the victorious Redeemer shall triumph 
 over them. The end of those that continue to be of the earth, and to 
 <I>mind earthly things,</I> after God has set up the <I>kingdom of 
 heaven</I> among men, <I>shall be destruction</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:19">Phil. iii. 19</A>);

 they shall be <I>devoured with the fire of God's jealousy.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. To amend what he finds amiss in his church. When God intends the 
 restoration of Israel, and the revival of their peace and prosperity, 
 he makes way for the accomplishment of his purpose by their reformation 
 and the revival of their virtue and piety; for this is God's method, 
 both with particular persons and with communities, first to make them 
 holy and then to make them happy. These promises were in part 
 accomplished after the return of the Jews out of Babylon, when by their 
 captivity they were thoroughly cured of their idolatry; and this was 
 all the fruit, even the taking away of sin. But they look further, to 
 the blessed effects of the gospel and the grace of it, to those 
 <I>times of reformation</I> in which we live, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:10">Heb. ix. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is promised that there shall be a reformation in men's discourse, 
 which had been generally corrupt, but should now be with grace seasoned 
 with salt 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>Then will I turn to the people a pure language;</I> I will turn the 
 people to such a language from that <I>evil communication</I> which has 
 almost ruined all <I>good manners</I> among them." Note, Converting 
 grace refines the language, not by making the phrases witty, but the 
 substance wise. Among the Jews, after the captivity, there needed a 
 reformation of the dialect, for they had mingled the language of Canaan 
 with that of Ashdod 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:24">Neh. xiii. 24</A>),

 and that grievance shall be redressed. But that is not all: their
 language shall be purified from all profaneness, filthiness, and 
 falsehood. I will turn them to a <I>choice language</I> (so some read 
 it); they shall not speak rashly, but with caution and deliberation; 
 they shall <I>choose out their words.</I> Note, An air of purity and 
 piety in common conversation is a very happy omen to any people; other 
 graces, other blessings, shall be given where God gives a pure language 
 to those who have been a <I>people of unclean lips.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That the worship of God, according to his will, shall be more 
 closely applied to, and more unanimously concurred in. Instead of 
 sacrifice and incense, they shall <I>call upon the name of the 
 Lord.</I> Prayer is the spiritual offering with which God must be 
 honoured; and, to prepare and fit us for that duty, it is necessary 
 that we have a <I>pure language.</I> We are utterly unfit to take God's 
 name into our lips, unless they be pure lips. The purifying of the 
 language in common conversation is necessary to the acceptableness of 
 the words of our mouth and the meditation of our heart on our devotion; 
 for how can <I>sweet waters and bitter</I> come <I>out of the same 
 fountain?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:9-12">James iii. 9-12</A>.

 It is likewise promised that their language being thus purified they
 shall serve God <I>with one consent,</I> with <I>one shoulder</I> (so 
 the word is), alluding to oxen in the yoke, that draw even. When 
 Christians are unanimous in the service of God the work goes on 
 cheerfully. This is the effect of the pure language, purified from 
 passion, envy, and censoriousness. Note, Purity is the way to unity; 
 the reformation of manners is the way to a comprehension. <I>The
 wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That those that were driven from God shall return to him and be 
 accepted of him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia,</I> that is, from Egypt (so
 described, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+18:1">Isa. xviii. 1</A>)

 or from some other very remote country--<I>my suppliants, even the 
 daughter of my dispersed, shall bring my offering.</I> Those that by 
 reason of their distance had almost forgotten God, their obligations to 
 him, shall be put in mind of him, as the prodigal son was of his 
 father's house, in the far country. Those that by reason of their
 dispersion, under the tokens of his displeasure, might be afraid of 
 coming to him, yet even they shall be gathered under his wings; the 
 <I>daughter of his dispersed,</I> that is <I>afar off,</I> will be 
 found among those whom <I>the Lord our God shall call;</I> and, though 
 they are dispersed, he will own them for his; his calling them <I>my 
 dispersed</I> puts honour upon them, sufficient to counterbalance all 
 the disgrace of their dispersion. These shall come,

 (1.) With their humble petitions: They are <I>my suppliants.</I> Note, 
 True converts are suppliants to God; they do not plead, but <I>make 
 supplication to their Judge</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:15">Job ix. 15</A>);

 and wherever they are, though <I>beyond the rivers of Ethiopia,</I> a
 great way off from his house of prayer, he has his eye upon them and 
 his ear open to them; they are his suppliants.

 (2.) With their spiritual sacrifices: <I>They shall bring my 
 offering,</I> shall bring themselves as spiritual sacrifices to God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:1">Rom. xii. 1</A>);

 the conversion of the Gentiles is called <I>the offering up of the
 Gentiles</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:16">Rom. xv. 16</A>);

 and with themselves they shall bring the gospel-sacrifices of prayer,
 and praise, and alms, with which God is well pleased.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That sin and sinners shall be purged out from among them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 God will take away, 

 (1.) Their just reproach: <I>In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for 
 all thy doings.</I> They shall be ashamed as penitents, and shall 
 continue to be so (see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:63">Ezek. xvi. 63</A>),

 but they shall not be ashamed as sinners that return to folly again.
 "<I>Thou shalt not be ashamed,</I> that is, thou shalt no more do a 
 shameful thing, as thou hast done." The guilt of sin being taken away 
 by pardoning mercy, the reproach of it shall be rolled away from the 
 sinner's own conscience, that being <I>purified,</I> and 
 <I>pacified,</I> and <I>cleansed from dead works.</I> When wickedness 
 and wicked people abound in a nation those few in it that are good are 
 ashamed of them and of their land; but when sinners are converted, and 
 the land reformed, that shame and the cause of it are removed.

 (2.) Their unjust glorying: "<I>I will take away out of the midst of 
 thee,</I> not only the profane, who are a shame to thy land, but the 
 hypocrites, who appear beautiful outwardly, and <I>rejoice in thy 
 pride,</I> in the holy city, the holy house." These were indeed 
 Israel's glory, but they made them their pride, and rejoiced in them, 
 as if they were an invincible bulwark to secure them in their sinful 
 ways; they relied on them as their righteousness and strength, boasting 
 of <I>the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:4">Jer. vii. 4</A>);
 
 they were <I>haughty because of the holy mountain,</I> were conceited
 of themselves, scornful of others, and set even the judgments of God at 
 defiance. Note, Church-privileges, when they are not duly improved as 
 they ought to be, are often made the matter of men's pride and the 
 ground of their security. But that haughtiness is the most offensive to 
 God which is supported and fed by the pretensions of holiness. This God 
 will silence and take away.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. That God will have a remnant of holy, humble, serious people among 
 them, that shall have the comfort of their relation to him and interest 
 in him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>I will leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people.</I> 
 When the Chaldeans carried away the Jews into captivity they <I>left of 
 the poor of the land for vine-dressers and husbandmen,</I> a type and 
 figure of God's distinguished remnant, whom he sets apart for himself. 
 They are <I>afflicted</I> and <I>poor,</I> low in the world; such 
 <I>God has chosen,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:5">James ii. 5</A>.

 The poor are evangelized, low in their own eyes, afflicted for sin,
 poor in spirit. They are God's leaving, for it is a <I>remnant
 according to the election of grace. I have reserved them to myself,</I> 
 says God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:4,5">Rom. xi. 4, 5</A>),

 <I>and they shall trust in the name of the Lord.</I> Note, Those whom
 God designs for the glory of his name he enables to trust in his name;
 and the greater their affliction and poverty in the world are the more
 reason they see to trust in God, having nothing else to trust to, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:5">1 Tim. v. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. That this select remnant shall be blessed with purity and peace, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 (1.) They shall be blessed with purity, both in words and actions: They 
 <I>shall neither do iniquity nor speak lies.</I> Justice and veracity 
 shall command them and govern them, though they be ever so much against 
 their secular interest. They shall not only not speak a direct 
 deliberate lie, but <I>there shall not be a deceitful tongue found in 
 their mouth,</I> not in the mouth of any of them; not the least 
 equivocation shall come from them. 

 (2.) They shall be blessed with peace. They shall, as the sheep of 
 God's pasture, <I>feed</I> and <I>lie down, and none shall make them 
 afraid.</I> They shall not be fearful themselves, nor shall any about 
 them be frightful to them. Note, Those that are careful not to do
 iniquity need not be afraid of any calamity, for it cannot hurt them, 
 and therefore should not terrify them.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 After the promises of the taking away of sin, here follow promises of 
 the taking away of trouble; for when the cause is removed the effect 
 will cease. What makes a people holy will make them happy of course. 
 The precious promises here made to the purified people were to have 
 their full accomplishment in the comforts of the gospel, in the hope, 
 and much more in the enjoyment, of which, they are here called upon, 

 1. To rejoice and sing

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>Sing, O daughter of Zion!</I> sing for joy; <I>Shout, O Israel!</I> 
 in a holy transport and exultation; <I>be glad and rejoice with all the 
 heart;</I> let the joy be inward, let it be great. Those that love God 
 with all their heart have occasion with all their heart to rejoice in 
 him. It was promised 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)

 that their sins should be mortified and their fears silenced, and then 
 follows, <I>Sing</I> and <I>rejoice.</I> Note, Those that reform have 
 cause to rejoice, whereas Israel cannot rejoice for joy as other 
 people, while she goes a whoring from her God. God's promises, applied
 by faith, furnish the saints with constant and abundant matter for joy; 
 they are filled with joy and peace in believing them. 

 2. To throw off all their discouragements

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem</I> (God will say it by 
 his prophets, by his providences, their neighbours shall say it, they 
 shall say it to one another), "<I>Fear thou not,</I> be not disposed to 
 fear, do not easily admit the impressions of it; when things are bad, 
 fear not their being worse, but hope they will mend; frighten not 
 thyself upon every occasion. <I>Let not thy hands be slack</I> or 
 <I>faint;</I> wring not thy hands in despair; drop not thy hands in 
 despondence; disfit not thyself for thy work and warfare by giving way 
 to doubts and fears. Pluck up thy spirits, and, in token of that, lift 
 up thy hands, the <I>hands that hung down,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:12.Isa+35:3">Heb. xii. 12; Isa. xxxv. 3</A>.
 
 Lift up thy hands in prayer to God; lift up thy hands to help thyself."
 Fear makes the hands slack, but faith and hope make them vigorous, and 
 the joy of the Lord will be our strength both for doing and 
 suffering.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Let us now see what these precious promises are which are here made to 
 the people of God, for the banishing of their griefs and fears and the 
 encouraging of their hopes and joys; and to us are these promises made 
 as well as to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. An end shall be put to all their troubles and distresses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):
 
 "<I>The Lord has taken away thy judgments,</I> has removed all the 
 calamities thou hast been groaning under, which were the punishments of 
 thy sin; the noise of war shall be silenced, the reproach of famine 
 done away, and the captivity brought back. Though some grievances 
 remain, they shall be only afflictions, and not judgments, for sin 
 shall be pardoned. <I>He has cast out thy enemy,</I> that has thrust 
 himself into thy land, and triumphed over thee. He has <I>swept out thy 
 enemy</I>" (so some read it), "as dirt is swept out of the house to the 
 dunghill." When they sweep out their sins with the besom of reformation 
 God will sweep out their enemies with the besom of destruction. If
 they should need correction, they shall fall into the hands of the 
 Lord, whose mercies are great, and shall not again fall into the hands 
 of man, whose tender mercies are cruel: "<I>Thou shalt not see evil any 
 more,</I> not such evil days as thou hast seen." Note, The way to get 
 clear of the evil of trouble is to keep clear from the evil of sin; and 
 to those that do so trouble has no real evil in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God will give them the tokens of his presence with them; though he 
 has long seemed to stand at a distance (they having provoked him to 
 withdraw), he will make it to appear that he is <I>with them of a 
 truth: "The Lord is in the midst of thee, O Zion!</I> of thee, <I>O 
 Jerusalem!</I> as the sun in the centre of the universe, to diffuse his 
 light and influence upon every part. He is <I>in the midst of thee,</I> 
 to preside in all thy affairs and to take care of all thy interests." 
 And, 
 
 1. "He is the <I>King of Israel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 and is in the midst of thee as a king in the midst of his people." With
 an eye to this, our Lord Jesus is called the <I>King of Israel</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:49">John i. 49</A>);

 and he is, and will be, in the midst of his church always, even to the 
 end of the world, to receive the homage of his subjects, and to give 
 out his favours to them, even <I>where</I> but <I>two or three are 
 gathered together in his name.</I> 

 2. "He is the Lord thy God, thine in covenant, and he is in the midst
 of thee as thy God, whom thou hast an interest in and whose own thou 
 art. He has put himself into dear relations to thee, laid himself by 
 promise under obligations to thee, and, that thou mayest have abundant 
 comfort in both, he <I>is in the midst of thee,</I> nigh at hand to 
 answer both."

 3. "He that is in the midst of thee as thy God and King is
 <I>mighty,</I> is almighty, is able to do all that for thee that thou
 needest and canst desire." 

 4. "He has engaged his power for thy succour: <I>He will save. He will
 be Jesus,</I> will answer the name, for he will save his people from 
 their sins."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. God will take delight in them, and in doing them good. The 
 expressions of this are very lively and affecting 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>He will rejoice over thee with joy,</I> will not only be well 
 pleased with thee, upon thy repentance and reformation, and take thee 
 into favour, but will take a complacency in thee, as the bridegroom 
 does in his bride, or the bride in her ornaments, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:3-5">Isa. lxii. 3-5</A>.

 The conversion of sinners and the consolation of saints are the joy of
 angels, for they are the joy of God him-self. The church should be the
 <I>joy of the whole earth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:2">Ps. xlviii. 2</A>),

 for it is the joy of the whole heaven. He will <I>rest in his love,</I>
 will be <I>silent in his love,</I> so the word is. "I will not rebuke
 thee as I have done, for thy sins; I will acquiesce in thee, and in my
 relation to thee." I know not where there is the like expression of
 Christ's love to his church, unless in that song of songs, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:9">Cant. iv. 9</A>,

 <I>Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse, with one of thy 
 eyes.</I> O the condescensions of divine grace! The great God not only
 loves his saints, but he loves to love them, is pleased that he has 
 pitched upon these objects of his love. He <I>will joy over them with 
 singing.</I> He that is grieved for the sin of sinners rejoices in the 
 graces and services of the saints, and is ready to express that joy by 
 singing over them. <I>The Lord takes plea-sure in those that fear 
 him,</I> and in them Jesus Christ will shortly be glorified and 
 admired.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. God will comfort Zion's mourners, who sympathize with her in her 
 griefs, and will wipe away their tears 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>I will gather those who are sorrowful for the solemn assemblies, to 
 whom the reproach of it was a burden.</I> See, 

 1. Who those are whom God will rejoice in and make to rejoice. They are
 such as are sorrowful. Those only must expect to reap in joy that sow
 in tears. The sorrowful now shall be for ever joyful. 

 2. What is the great matter of sorrow to Zion's mourners, when Zion is
 in mourning. Many are her calamities. The city is ruined, and the
 palaces are demolished; trade is at an end, and the administration of
 public justice; but all these are nothing to them in comparison with
 the desolations of the sanctuary, the destruction of the temple and the
 altar, to attend on which, in solemn feasts, all Israel used to come
 together three times a year. It is for those sacred solemn assemblies
 that they are sorrowful,

 (1.) Because they are dispersed; there is no temple to come up to, or,
 if there were, no people to come up to it; so that the <I>solemn feasts
 and sabbaths are forgotten in Zion,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+2:6">Lam. ii. 6</A>.

 Note, The restraining of public assemblies for religious worship, the
 scattering of them by their enemies, or the forsaking of them by their 
 friends, so that either there are no assemblies or not solemn ones, is 
 a very sorrowful thing to all good people. If <I>the ways of Zion 
 mourn,</I> the sons of Zion mourn too. And hereby they make it to 
 appear that they are indeed of Zion, living members of that body with 
 the grievances of which they are so sensibly affected.

 (2.) Because they are despised; the reproach of the solemn assemblies 
 is a burden to them. It had been the lot of the solemn assemblies to 
 lie under a great deal of reproach. Satan and his instruments having a
 particular spite at them, as the great support of the interest of God's 
 kingdom among men. Black and odious characters have been put upon those 
 assemblies; and this is a burden to all those that have a cordial 
 concern for the glory of God and the welfare of the souls of men. They 
 reckon that the reproaches of those who reproach the solemn assemblies 
 fall upon them, fall foul upon them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. God will recover the captives out of the hands of their oppressors, 
 and bring home the banished that seemed to be expelled, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 1. Their enemies shall be disabled to detain them in bondage: "<I>At
 that time I will undo all that afflict thee,</I> will break their 
 power, and blast their counsels, so that they shall be forced to 
 surrender the prey they have taken." <I>Conficiam--I will take them to 
 task;</I> "I will be doing with them shortly, and so as to make an end 
 of them." Note, Those that abuse and oppress God's people take the 
 ready way to undo themselves. 

 2. They shall be enabled to assert and recover their liberty, and all
 the difficulties in the way of it shall be surmounted. Is the church
 weak and wounded? <I>I will save her that halts,</I> as was promised, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+4:7">Mic. iv. 7</A>.

 He will help her when she cannot help herself; even <I>the lame shall
 take the prey,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:23">Isa. xxxiii. 23</A>.

 Is she dispersed, and not likely to incorporate for her common benefit?
 I will <I>gather her that was driven out,</I> and <I>bring her again at 
 the time that I gather her.</I> One act of mercy and grace shall serve 
 both to collect them out of their dispersions and to conduct them to 
 their own land. When the <I>people's hearts are prepared,</I> the work
 will be done suddenly; and who can hinder it if God undertake to effect 
 it? "<I>I will turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the 
 Lord;</I> you shall plainly discern the hand of God in it, and say, 
 <I>This is the Lord's doing.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. God will by all this put honour upon them and gain them respect 
 from all about them. Israel was at first <I>made high above all nations 
 in praise and fame,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+26:19">Deut. xxvi. 19</A>.

 The reproach brought upon them was therefore one of the sorest of their
 grievances (nothing cuts deeper to those that are in honour than 
 disgrace does); and therefore when God returns, in mercy, to his 
 church, it is here promised that she shall regain her credit; all the 
 reproach shall be for ever rolled way, as Israel's at Gilgal,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+5:9">Josh. v. 9</A>.

 The church shall be as honourable as ever she had been despicable.

 1. Even those that reproached her shall be made to respect her: "<I>I
 will get them praise and fame in every land, where they have been put 
 to shame,</I> that the same who were the witnesses of their disgrace 
 may see cause to change their mind concerning them." Those that said, 
 "This is Zion whom no man looks after," shall say, "This is Zion whom 
 the great God looks after." And she that was looked upon to be the 
 <I>offscouring of the earth</I> now appears to be the darling of 
 heaven.

 2. Even those that never knew her shall be brought to honour her

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the
 earth.</I> So the Jewish church was when <I>the fear of the Jews</I> 
 fell upon their neighbours 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+8:17">Esth. viii. 17</A>),

 and some of all nations said, <I>we will go with you, for we have heard 
 that God is with you,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:23">Zech. viii. 23</A>.

 So the Christian church was when it was made to flourish in the world,
 for there is that in it which may justly recommend it to the value and 
 esteem of all the people of the earth. And so the universal church of 
 the firstborn will be in the great day, when the saints shall be 
 brought together to Christ, that he may be admired and glorified in 
 them, and they admired and glorified in him before angels and men. Then 
 will God's Israel be <I>made a name and a praise</I> to eternity.</P>
