 We now come closer to Nineveh, that great city; she took, not warning 
 by the destruction of her armies and the fall of her king, and 
 therefore may expect, since she persists in her enmity to God, that he 
 will proceed in his controversy with her. Here is foretold, 

 I. The approach of the enemy that should destroy Nineveh, and the
 terror of his military preparations, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+2:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. The taking of the city, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+2:6">ver. 6</A>.

 III. The captivity of the queen, the flight of the inhabitants, the
 seizing of all its wealth, and the great consternation it should be in, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+2:7-10">ver. 7-10</A>.

 IV. All this is traced up to its true causes--their sinning against God
 and God's appearing against them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+2:11-13">ver. 11-13</A>.

 All this was fulfilled when Nebuchadnezzar, in the first year of his 
 reign, in conjunction with Cyaxares, or Ahasuerus, king of the Medes, 
 conquered Nineveh, and made himself master of the Assyrian 
 monarchy.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep
 the munition, watch the way, make <I>thy</I> loins strong, fortify
 <I>thy</I> power mightily.
 &nbsp; 2 For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the
 excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and
 marred their vine branches.
 &nbsp; 3 The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men
 <I>are</I> in scarlet: the chariots <I>shall be</I> with flaming torches in
 the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly
 shaken.
 &nbsp; 4 The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one
 against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches,
 they shall run like the lightnings.
 &nbsp; 5 He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their
 walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence
 shall be prepared.
 &nbsp; 6 The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall
 be dissolved.
 &nbsp; 7 And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought
 up, and her maids shall lead <I>her</I> as with the voice of doves,
 tabering upon their breasts.
 &nbsp; 8 But Nineveh <I>is</I> of old like a pool of water: yet they shall
 flee away. Stand, stand, <I>shall they cry;</I> but none shall look
 back.
 &nbsp; 9 Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for
 <I>there is</I> none end of the store <I>and</I> glory out of all the
 pleasant furniture.
 &nbsp; 10 She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth,
 and the knees smite together, and much pain <I>is</I> in all loins,
 and the faces of them all gather blackness.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. An alarm of war sent to Nineveh, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 The prophet speaks of it as just at hand, for it is neither doubtful 
 nor far distant: "Look about thee, and see, <I>he that dashes in pieces 
 has come up before thy face.</I> Nebuchadnezzar, who is noted, and will 
 be yet more so, for dashing nations in pieces, begins with thee, and 
 will dissipate and disperse thee;" so some render the word. Babylon is 
 called the <I>hammer of the whole earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:23">Jer. l. 23</A>.

 The attempt of Nebuchadnezzar upon Nineveh is public, bold, and daring:
 "He <I>has come up before thy face,</I> avowing his design to ruin
 thee; and therefore stand to thy arms, <I>O Nineveh! keep the
 munition;</I> secure thy towers and magazines: <I>watch the way;</I> 
 set guards upon all the avenues to the city; <I>make thy loins 
 strong;</I> encourage thy soldiers; animate thyself and them; 
 <I>fortify thy power mightily,</I> as cities do when an enemy is 
 advancing against them" (this is spoken ironically); "do the utmost 
 thou canst, yet thou shalt not be able to put by the stroke of this 
 judgment, for <I>there is no counsel or strength against the 
 Lord.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A manifesto published, showing the causes of the war 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>The Lord has turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency 
 of Israel,</I> that is, 

 1. The Assyrians have been abusive to Jacob, the two tribes (have 
 humbled and mortified them), as well as to Israel, the ten tribes, 
 <I>have emptied them, and marred their vine-branches.</I> For this God 
 will reckon with them; though done long since, it shall come into the 
 account now against that kingdom, and Nineveh the head-city of it. 
 God's quarrel with them is <I>for the violence done to Jacob.</I> Or, 
 
 (2.) God is now by Nebuchadnezzar about <I>to turn away the pride of 
 Jacob</I> by the captivity of the two tribes, as he did the pride of 
 Israel by their captivity; He has determined to do it, to bring 
 <I>emptiers</I> upon them, and the enemy that is to do it must begin 
 with Nineveh, and reduce that first, and humble the pride of that. God 
 is looking upon proud cities, and abasing them, even those that are 
 nearest to him. Samaria is humbled, and Jerusalem is to be humbled, and 
 their pride brought low; and shall not Nineveh, that proud city, be 
 brought down too? <I>Emptiers have emptied</I> the cities, <I>and 
 marred the vine-branches</I> in the country of Jacob and Israel; and 
 must not the excellency of Nineveh, that is so much her pride, be 
 turned away too?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A particular account given in of the terrors wherein the invading 
 enemy shall appear against Nineveh; every thing shall contribute to 
 make him formidable. 

 1. <I>The shields of his mighty men are made red,</I> and probably
 their other arms and array, as if they were already tinctured with the 
 blood they had shed, or intended hereby to signify they would put all 
 to the sword; they hung out a red flag, in token that they would give 
 no quarter. 

 2. <I>The valiant men are in scarlet;</I> not only red clothes, to
 intimate what bloody work they designed to make, but rich clothes, to 
 intimate the wealth of the army, and that is the sinews of war. 

 3. <I>The chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his
 preparation;</I> when they are making their approaches, they shall fly 
 as swiftly as lightning; the wheels shall strike fire upon the stones, 
 and those that drive them shall drive furiously with a flaming 
 indignation, as Jehu drove. Or they carried flaming torches with them 
 in the open chariots, when they made their approach in the night, as 
 Gideon's soldiers carried lamps in their pitchers, to be both a guide 
 to themselves and a terror to their enemies, and with them to set all 
 on fire wherever they went. 

 4. <I>The fir-trees shall be terribly shaken;</I> the great men of
 Nineveh, that overtop their neighbours, as the stately firs do the 
 shrubs; or the very standing trees shall be made to shake by the 
 violent concussions of the earth, which that great army shall cause. 

 5. The chariots of war shall be very terrible

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>They shall rage in the streets,</I> that is, those that drive them 
 shall rage; you would think the chariots themselves raged; they shall 
 be so numerous, and drive with so much fury, that even <I>in the broad 
 ways,</I> where, one would think, there should be room enough, they 
 shall <I>jostle one another;</I> and these iron chariots shall be made 
 so bright that in the beams of the sun <I>they shall seem like 
 torches</I> in the night; they shall <I>run like the lightnings,</I> so 
 swiftly, so furiously. Nebuchadnezzar's commanders are here called his 
 <I>worthies,</I> his <I>gallants</I> (so the margin reads it), his 
 <I>heroes;</I> those <I>he shall recount,</I> and order them 
 immediately and without fail to render themselves at their respective 
 posts, for he is entering upon action, is resolved to take the field 
 immediately, and to open the campaign with the siege of Nineveh. <I>His 
 worthies shall remember</I> (so some read it); they shall be mindful of 
 the duty of their place, and the charge they have received, and shall 
 thereby be made so intent upon their business that they <I>shall 
 stumble in their walks,</I> shall make more haste than good speed; they 
 stumble, but shall not fall; for <I>they shall make haste to the wall 
 thereof,</I> shall open the trenches; and the defence, or the covered 
 way, shall be prepared (something to shelter them from the darts of the 
 besieged), and they shall so closely carry on the siege, and with so 
 much vigour, that at length the <I>gates of the rivers shall be 
 opened</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 those gates of Nineveh which open upon the river Tigris (on which 
 Nineveh was built) shall be first forced by, or betrayed to, the enemy, 
 and by those gates they shall enter. And then the <I>palace shall be 
 dissolved,</I> either the king's house or the house of Nisroch his god; 
 the same word signifies both a palace and a temple. When the God of 
 heaven goes forth to contend with a people, neither the palaces nor 
 their kings, neither the temples nor their gods, can protect and 
 shelter them, but must all inevitably fall with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. A prediction of the consequences of this; and it is easy to guess 
 how dismal those will be. 

 1. The queen shall fall into the hands of the enemy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Huzzab shall be led away captive;</I> she that was 
 <I>established</I> (so some read it), thought herself safe because she 
 was concealed and shut up in secret, shall be <I>discovered</I> (so the 
 margin reads it) and shall be led <I>away captive,</I> in greater 
 disgrace than that of common prisoners; she shall be <I>brought up</I> 
 in a mock state, <I>and her maids</I> of honour <I>shall lead her,</I> 
 because she is weak and faint, not able to bear such frights and 
 hardships, which are doubly hard and frightful to those that have not 
 been used to them; they shall attend her, not to speak cheerfully to 
 her and to encourage her, but murmuring and moaning themselves, as 
 <I>with the voice of doves,</I> the <I>doves of the valleys</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:16">Ezek. vii. 16</A>),
 
 noted for their <I>mourning,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+38:14,59:11">Isa. xxxviii. 14; lix. 11</A>.

 They shall be <I>tabering upon their breasts,</I> beating their own
 breasts in grief and vexation, as if they were <I>drumming</I> upon
 them, for so the word signifies. 

 2. The inhabitants, though numerous, shall none of them be able to
 make head against the invaders, or stand their ground

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Nineveh is of old like a pool of water,</I> replenished with people 
 as a pool with water (and <I>waters</I> signify <I>multitudes,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:15">Rev. xvii. 15</A>),

 or as those waters with fish; it was long ago a populous city; in
 Jonah's time there were 120,000 little children in it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+4:11">Jonah iv. 11</A>),
 
 and, ordinarily, cities and countries are increasing in their number 
 every year; but, though they have so many hands to be employed in the 
 public service, yet they shall not be able to inspire one another with 
 courage, but <I>they shall flee away like cowards.</I> Their commanders 
 shall do what they can to animate them; they shall cry, "<I>Stand, 
 stand,</I> have a good heart on it, and we shall do well enough;" 
 <I>but none shall</I> so much as <I>look back;</I> they shall not have 
 the least spark of courage remaining, but every one shall think it is 
 his wisest course to make his best of the opportunity to escape; they 
 shall not so much as look back to see who calls for them. Note, God can 
 dispirit the strongest and boldest, in the day of distress, so that 
 they shall not be what one would expect from them, but <I>like a pool 
 of water,</I> the water whereof is dried up and gone. 

 3. The wealth of the city shall become a prey, and all its rich
 furniture shall fall into the hands of the victorious enemy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 they shall thus animate and excite one another to plunder: <I>Take the
 spoil of silver; take the spoil of gold;</I> thus the officers shall 
 stir up the soldiers to improve their opportunity; here are silver and 
 gold enough for them, for <I>there is no end of the store of money and 
 plate.</I> Nineveh, having been <I>of old like a pool of water,</I> has 
 gathered a vast deal of mud; and abundance of glory it has <I>out of 
 all the pleasant furniture,</I> all the <I>vessels of desire,</I> which 
 they have gloried in and which shall now be a prey and a pride to the 
 conquerors. Note, Those who prepare raiment as the clay, and heap up
 silver as the dust, know not who may put on the raiment and divide the 
 silver, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+27:16,17">Job xxvii. 16, 17</A>.

 Thus this rich city is empty, and void, and waste,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 See the vanity of worldly wealth; instead of defending its owners, it 
 does but expose them, and enable their enemies to do them so much the 
 more mischief. 

 4. The soldiers and people shall have no heart to appear for the
 defence of the city. Their spirits shall <I>melt</I> away like wax 
 before the fire; their <I>knees shall smite together</I> (as 
 Belshazzar's did, in his agony,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:6">Dan. v. 6</A>),

 so that they shall not be able to stand their ground, no, nor to make
 their escape; <I>much pain</I> shall be <I>in all loins,</I> as is the 
 case in extreme frights, so that they shall not be able to hold up 
 their backs. And the <I>faces of them all shall gather blackness,</I> 
 like that of a pot that is every day over the fire; so the word 
 signifies. Note, Guilt in the conscience will fill men with terror in
 an evil day, and those who place their happiness in the wealth of this 
 world and set their hearts upon it think themselves undone when their 
 silver, and their gold, and their pleasant furniture are taken from 
 them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11 Where <I>is</I> the dwelling of the lions, and the feeding-place
 of the young lions, where the lion, <I>even</I> the old lion, walked,
 <I>and</I> the lion's whelp, and none made <I>them</I> afraid?
 &nbsp; 12 The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and
 strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and
 his dens with ravin.
 &nbsp; 13 Behold, I <I>am</I> against thee, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, and I
 will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour
 thy young lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have Nineveh's ruin, 

 1. Triumphed in by its neighbours, who now remember against it all the
 oppressions and abuse of power it had been guilty of in its pomp and 
 prosperity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+2:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>):

 <I>Where is the dwelling of the lions?</I> It is gone; there appear no 
 remnants, no footsteps, of it. <I>Where is the feeding place of the 
 young lions,</I> where they glutted themselves with prey? The princes 
 of Nineveh had been as lions, as beasts of prey; cruel tyrants are no 
 better, nay, in this respect much worse--that, being men, humanity is 
 expected from them; nay, if they were indeed lions, they would not prey 
 upon those of their own kind. <I>Savis inter se convenit 
 urs&aelig;--Fierce bears agree together.</I> But in the shape of men 
 they had the cruelty of lions: they walked in Nineveh as a lion in the 
 woods, and <I>none made them afraid;</I> every one stood in awe of 
 them, and they were under no apprehensions of danger from any; though 
 nobody loved them, every body feared them, and that was all they 
 desired. <I>Oderint, dum metuant--Let them hate, so that they do but
 fear.</I> The king himself, as well as every prince, made it his 
 business, by all the arts of violence and extortion, to enrich himself 
 and raise his family; he did <I>tear in pieces enough for his 
 whelps</I> (and no little would be enough for them) and he <I>strangled 
 for his lioness,</I> killed all that came near him, and seized what 
 they had for his children, for his wives and concubines, and <I>filled 
 his holes with prey and his dens with ravin,</I> as lions are wont to 
 do. Note, Many make it an excuse for their rapine and injustice that 
 they have wives and children to provide for, whereas what is so got 
 will never do them any good; those that <I>fear the Lord,</I> and get 
 what they have honestly, shall not want a competency for themselves and 
 theirs; <I>verily they shall be fed,</I> when <I>the young lions,</I> 
 though dens and holes were <I>filled with prey and ravin</I> for them, 
 <I>shall lack, and suffer hunger,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:10">Ps. xxxiv. 10</A>.

 2. It is avowed by the righteous Judge of heaven and earth; it is his 
 doing, and let all the world take notice that it is so

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Behold, I am against thee, saith the Lord of hosts.</I> And what 
 good can hosts do for her in her defence, when <I>the Lord of hosts</I> 
 is against her for her destruction? The oppressors in Nineveh thought 
 they only set their neighbours against them, who were not a match for 
 them, and whom they could easily overpower; but it proved they set God 
 against them, who is, and will be, the asserter of right and the 
 avenger of wrong. God is against the princes of Nineveh, and then, 

 (1.) These military preparations will stand them in no stead: <I>I will 
 burn their chariots in the smoke;</I> he does not say <I>in the 
 fire,</I> but, in contempt of them, the very <I>smoke</I> of God's 
 indignation shall serve to burn their chariots; they shall be consumed 
 as soon as the fire of his indignation is kindled, while as yet it does 
 but smoke, and not flame out. Or, The drivers of the chariots shall be 
 smothered and stifled with the smoke; then the <I>chariots of their 
 glory</I> shall be the shame of their families, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:18">Isa. xxii. 18</A>.

 (2.) Their children, the hopes of their families, shall be cut off: 
 <I>The sword shall devour the young lions,</I> whom they were so 
 solicitous to provide for by oppression and extortion. Note, It is
 just with God to deprive those of their children, or (which is all one) 
 of comfort in them, that take sinful courses to enrich them, and (as 
 has been said of some) damn their souls to make their sons gentlemen. 
 
 (3.) The wealth they have heaped up by fraud and violence shall neither 
 be enjoyed by them nor employed for them: <I>I will cut off thy prey 
 from the earth;</I> not only thou shalt not be the better for it, but 
 no one else shall. Some understand it of the disabling of them for the 
 future to prey upon their neighbours. 

 (4.) Their agents abroad shall not have that respect from their 
 neighbours and that influence upon them which sometimes they had had: 
 <I>The voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard,</I> no more be 
 heeded, which some think refers to Rabshakeh, one of Nineveh's 
 messengers, that had blasphemed the living God, an iniquity which was 
 remembered against Nineveh long after. Those are not worthy to be heard 
 again that have once spoken reproachfully of God.</P>
