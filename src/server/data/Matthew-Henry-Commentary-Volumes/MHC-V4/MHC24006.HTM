 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter, as before, we have, 

 I. A prophecy of the invading of the land of Judah and the besieging of
 Jerusalem by the Chaldean army 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>),

 with the spoils they should make of the country 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:9">ver. 9</A>)

 and the terror which all should be seized with on that occasion, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:22-26">ver. 22-26</A>.

 II. An account of those sins of Judah and Jerusalem which provoked God
 to bring this desolating judgment upon them. Their oppression 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:7">ver. 7</A>),
 
 their contempt of the word of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:10-12">ver. 10-12</A>),

 their worldliness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:13">ver. 13</A>),
 
 the treachery of their prophets 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:14">ver. 14</A>),
 
 their impudence in sin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:15">ver. 15</A>),

 their obstinacy against reproofs 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:18,19">ver. 18, 19</A>),

 which made their sacrifices unacceptable to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:20">ver. 20</A>),

 and for which he gave them up to ruin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:21">ver. 21</A>),

 but tried them first 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:27">ver. 27</A>)

 and then rejected them as irreclaimable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:28-30">
 ver. 28-30</A>.

 III. Good counsel given them in the midst of all this, but in vain, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:8,16,17">ver. 8, 16, 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  O ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of
 the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up
 a sign of fire in Beth-haccerem: for evil appeareth out of the
 north, and great destruction.
 &nbsp; 2  I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate
 <I>woman.</I>
 &nbsp; 3  The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they
 shall pitch <I>their</I> tents against her round about; they shall
 feed every one in his place.
 &nbsp; 4  Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon.
 Woe unto us! for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the
 evening are stretched out.
 &nbsp; 5  Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her
 palaces.
 &nbsp; 6  For thus hath the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and
 cast a mount against Jerusalem: this <I>is</I> the city to be visited;
 she <I>is</I> wholly oppression in the midst of her.
 &nbsp; 7  As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her
 wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me
 continually <I>is</I> grief and wounds.
 &nbsp; 8  Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from
 thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is 

 I. Judgment threatened against Judah and Jerusalem. The city and the 
 country were at this time secure and under no apprehension of danger; 
 they saw no cloud gathering, but every thing looked safe and serene: 
 but the prophet tells them that they shall shortly be invaded by a 
 foreign power, an army shall be brought against them <I>from the 
 north,</I> which shall lay all waste, and shall cause not only a 
 general consternation, but a general desolation. It is here 
 foretold,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That the alarm of this should be loud and terrible. This is 
 represented, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 The children of Benjamin, in which tribe part of Jerusalem lay, are 
 here called to shift for their own safety in the country; for the city 
 (to which it was first thought advisable for them to flee,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:5,6"><I>ch.</I> iv. 5, 6</A>)

 would soon be made too hot for them, and they would find it the wisest
 course to flee out of the midst of it. It is common, in public frights, 
 for the people to think any place safer than that in which they are; 
 and therefore those in the city are for shifting into the country, in 
 hopes there to escape out of danger, and those in the country are for 
 shifting into the city, in hopes there to make head against the danger; 
 but it is all in vain when evil pursues sinners with commission. They 
 are told to send the alarm into the country, and to do what they can 
 for their own safety: <I>Blow the trumpet in Tekoa,</I> a city which 
 lay twelve miles north from Jerusalem. Let them be stirred up to stand 
 upon their guard: <I>Set up a sign of fire</I> (that is, kindle the 
 beacons) <I>in Beth-haccerem,</I> the <I>house of the vineyard,</I> 
 which lay on a hill between Jerusalem and Tekoa. Prepare to make a 
 vigorous resistance, <I>for the evil appears out of the north.</I> This 
 may be taken ironically: "Betake yourselves to the best methods you can 
 think of for your own preservation, but all shall be in vain; for, when 
 you have done your best, it will be a great destruction, for it is in 
 vain to contend with God's judgments."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That the attempt upon them should be bold and formidable and such as 
 they should be a very unequal match for. 

 (1.) See what <I>the daughter of Zion</I> is, on whom the assault is 
 made. She is compared <I>to a comely and delicate woman</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 bred up in every thing that is nice and soft, that will not set so much
 as the sole <I>of her foot to the ground for tenderness and 
 delicacy</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:56">Deut. xxviii. 56</A>),

 nor suffer the wind to blow upon her; and, not being accustomed to
 hardship, she will be the less able either to resist the enemy (for 
 those that make war must <I>endure hardness</I>) or to bear the 
 destruction with that patience which is necessary to make it tolerable. 
 The more we indulge ourselves in the pleasures of this life the more we 
 disfit ourselves for the troubles of this life.

 (2.) See what the daughter of Babylon is, by whom the assault is made.
 The generals and their armies are compared to <I>shepherds</I> and 
 <I>their flocks</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 in such numbers and in such order did they come, the soldiers following
 their leaders as the sheep their shepherds. The daughter of <I>Zion 
 dwelt at home</I> (so some read it), expecting to be courted with love, 
 but was invaded with fury. This comparing of the enemies to shepherds 
 inclines me to embrace another reading, which some give of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>,

 <I>The daughter of Zion is like a comely pasture-ground and a delicate 
 land,</I> which invite the shepherds to bring their flocks thither to 
 graze; and as the shepherds easily make themselves masters of an open 
 field, which (as was then usual in some parts) lies common, owned by 
 none, <I>pitch their tents</I> in it, and their flocks quickly eat it 
 bare, so shall the Chaldean army easily break in upon the land of 
 Judah, force for themselves a free quarter where they please, and in a 
 little time devour all. For the further illustration of this he shows, 
 
 [1.] How God shall commission them to make this destruction even of the 
 holy land and the holy city, which were his own possession. It is he 
 that says

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 <I>Prepare you war against her;</I> for he is the <I>Lord of hosts,</I>
 that has all hosts at his command, and he has said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),
 
 <I>Hew you down trees, and cast a mount against Jerusalem,</I> in order
 to the attacking of it. The Chaldeans have great power against Judah 
 and Jerusalem, and yet they have no power but what is <I>given them 
 from above.</I> God has marked out Jerusalem for destruction. He has 
 said, "<I>This is the city to be visited,</I> visited in wrath, visited 
 by the divine justice, and this is the time of her visitation." The day 
 is coming when those that are careless and secure in sinful ways will 
 certainly be visited. 

 [2.] How they shall animate themselves and one another to execute that 
 commission. God's counsels being against Jerusalem, which cannot be 
 altered or disannulled, the councils of war which the enemies held are 
 made to agree with his counsels. God having said, <I>Prepare war 
 against her,</I> their determinations are made subservient to his; and, 
 notwithstanding the distance of place and the many difficulties that 
 lay in the way, it is soon resolved, <I>nemine 
 contradicente--unanimously. Arise, and let us go.</I> Note, It is good 
 to see how the counsel and decree of God are pursued and executed in 
 the devices and designs of men, even theirs that know him not, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:6,7">Isa. x. 6, 7</A>.

 In this campaign, <I>First,</I> They resolve to be very expeditious.
 They have no sooner resolved upon it than they address themselves to 
 it; it shall never be said that they left any thing to be done towards 
 it to-morrow which they could do to-day: <I>Arise, let us go up at 
 noon,</I> though it be in the heat of the day; nay,

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),
 
 <I>Arise, let us go up at night,</I> though it be in the dark. Nothing
 shall hinder them; they are resolved to <I>lose no time.</I> They are 
 described as men in care to make despatch 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>Woe unto us, for the day goes away,</I> and we are not going on
 with our work; <I>the shadows of the evening are stretched out,</I> and 
 we sit still, and let slip the opportunity." O that we were thus eager 
 in our spiritual work and warfare, thus afraid of losing time, or any 
 opportunity, in taking the <I>kingdom of heaven by violence!</I> It is 
 folly to trifle when we have an eternal salvation to work out, and the 
 enemies of that salvation to fight against. <I>Secondly,</I> They 
 confidently expect to be very successful: "<I>Let us go up,</I> and let 
 us destroy her palaces and make ourselves masters of the wealth that is 
 in them." It was not that they might fulfill God's counsels, but that 
 they might fill their own treasures, that they were thus eager; yet God 
 thereby served his own purposes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The cause of this judgment assigned. It is all for their 
 wickedness; they have brought it upon themselves; they must bear it, 
 for they must bear the blame of it. They are thus oppressed because 
 they have been oppressors; they have dealt hardly with one another, 
 each in his turn, as they have had power and advantage, and now the 
 enemy shall come and deal hardly with them all. This sin of oppression, 
 and violence, and wrong-doing, is here charged upon them, 

 1. As a national sin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Therefore</I> this city <I>is to be visited,</I> it is time to make
 inquisition, for <I>she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.</I> 
 All orders and degrees of men, from the prince on the throne to the 
 meanest master of a shop, were oppressive to those that were under 
 them. Look which way you might, there were causes for complaints of 
 this kind. 
 
 2. As a sin that had become in a manner natural to them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 She <I>casts out wickedness,</I> in all the instances of malice and
 mischievousness, <I>as a fountain casts out her waters,</I> so 
 plentifully and constantly, the streams bitter and poisonous, like the 
 fountain. The waters out of the fountain will not be restrained, but 
 will find or force their way, nor will they be checked by laws or 
 conscience in their violent proceedings. This is fitly applied to the 
 corrupt heart of man in his natural state; it <I>casts out 
 wickedness,</I> one evil imagination or other, as a fountain <I>casts 
 out her waters,</I> naturally and easily; it is always flowing, and yet 
 always full. 

 3. As that which had become a constant practice with them; <I>Violence
 and spoil are heard in her.</I> The cry of it had come up before God as 
 that of Sodom: <I>Before me continually are grief and wounds</I>--the 
 complaint of those that find themselves aggrieved, being unjustly 
 wounded in their bodies or spirits, in their estates or reputation.
 Note, He that is the common Parent of mankind regards and resents, and 
 sooner or later will revenge, the mischiefs and wrongs that men do to 
 one another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The counsel given them how to prevent this judgment. Fair warning 
 is given now upon the whole matter: "<I>Be thou instructed, O 
 Jerusalem!</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Receive the instruction given thee both by the law of God and by the 
 prophets; be wise at length for thyself." They knew very well what they 
 had been instructed to do; nothing remained but to do it, for till then 
 they could not be said to be instructed. The reason for this counsel is 
 taken from the inevitable ruin they ran upon if they refused to comply 
 with the instructions given them: <I>Lest my soul depart,</I> or <I>be 
 disjoined, from thee.</I> This intimates what a tender affection and 
 concern God had had for them; his very soul had been joined to them, 
 and nothing but sin could disjoin it. Note,

 1. The God of mercy is loth to depart even from a provoking people,
 and is earnest with them by true repentance and reformation to prevent 
 things coming to that extremity. 

 2. Their case is very miserable from whom God's soul is disjoined; it 
 intimates the loss not only of their outward blessings, but of those 
 comforts and favours which are the more immediate and peculiar tokens 
 of his love and presence. Compare this with that dreadful word 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:38">Heb. x. 38</A>),

 <I>If any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.</I>

 3. Those whom God forsakes are certainly undone; when God's soul
 departs from Jerusalem she soon becomes desolate and uninhabited,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, They shall thoroughly glean the
 remnant of Israel as a vine: turn back thine hand as a
 grape-gatherer into the baskets.
 &nbsp; 10  To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear?
 behold, their ear <I>is</I> uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken:
 behold, the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> is unto them a reproach; they have
 no delight in it.
 &nbsp; 11  Therefore I am full of the fury of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; I am weary with
 holding in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon
 the assembly of young men together: for even the husband with the
 wife shall be taken, the aged with <I>him that is</I> full of days.
 &nbsp; 12  And their houses shall be turned unto others, <I>with their</I>
 fields and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon
 the inhabitants of the land, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 13  For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them
 every one <I>is</I> given to covetousness; and from the prophet even
 unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.
 &nbsp; 14  They have healed also the hurt <I>of the daughter</I> of my
 people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when <I>there is</I> no peace.
 &nbsp; 15  Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay,
 they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore
 they shall fall among them that fall: at the time <I>that</I> I visit
 them they shall be cast down, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 16  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask
 for the old paths, where <I>is</I> the good way, and walk therein, and
 ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not
 walk <I>therein.</I>
 &nbsp; 17  Also I set watchmen over you, <I>saying,</I> Hearken to the sound
 of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The heads of this paragraph are the very same with those of the last; 
 for precept must be upon precept and line upon line.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The ruin of Judah and Jerusalem is here threatened. We had before 
 the haste which the Chaldea army made to the war 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>);

 now here we have the havoc made by the war. How lamentable are the
 desolations here described! The enemy shall so long quarter among them, 
 and be so insatiable in their thirst after blood and treasure, that 
 they shall seize all they can meet with, and what escapes them at one 
 time shall fall into their hands another

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine;</I> as
 the <I>grape-gatherer,</I> who is resolved to leave none behind, still 
 <I>turns back his hand into the baskets,</I> to put more in, till he 
 has gathered all, so that they be picked up by the enemy, though 
 dispersed, though hid, and none of them shall escape their eye and 
 hand. Perhaps the people, being <I>given to covetousness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 had not observed that law of God which forbade them to <I>glean all
 their grapes</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:10">Lev. xix. 10</A>),

 and now they themselves shall be in like manner <I>thoroughly
 gleaned</I> and shall either fall by the sword or go into captivity. 
 This is explained

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>,

 where God's <I>fury</I> and his <I>hand</I> are said to be <I>poured 
 out</I> and <I>stretched out,</I> in the fury and by the hand of the 
 Chaldeans; for even wicked men are often made use of as God's hand 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:14">Ps. xvii. 14</A>),

 and in their anger we may see God angry. Now see on whom the fury is
 poured out in full vials--<I>upon the children abroad,</I> or <I>in the 
 streets,</I> where they are playing

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:5">Zech. viii. 5</A>)

 or whither they run out innocently to look about them: the sword of the
 merciless Chaldeans shall not spare them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:21"><I>ch.</I> ix. 21</A>.

 The children perish in the calamity which the fathers' sins have
 procured. The execution shall likewise reach <I>the assembly of young 
 men,</I> their merry meetings, their clubs which they keep up to 
 strengthen one another's hands in wickedness; they shall be <I>cut off 
 together.</I> Nor shall those only fall into the enemies' hands who 
 meet for lewdness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:7"><I>ch.</I> v. 7</A>),

 but <I>even the husband with the wife shall be taken,</I> these two in
 bed together, and neither left, but both taken prisoners. And, as they
 have no compassion for the weak but fair sex, so they have none for the 
 decrepit but venerable age: <I>The old with the full of days,</I> whose 
 deaths can contribute no more to their safety than their lives to their 
 service, who are not in a capacity to do them either good or harm, 
 shall be either cut off or carried off. <I>Their houses shall then be 
 turned to others</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 the conquerors shall dwell in their habitations, use their goods, and
 live upon their stores; their <I>fields and vines</I> shall fall 
 <I>together</I> into their hands, as was threatened,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:30">Deut. xxviii. 30</A>,

 &c. For God <I>stretches out his hand upon the inhabitants of the
 land,</I> and none can go out of the reach of it. Now as to this 
 denunciation of God's wrath, 

 1. The prophet justifies himself in preaching thus terribly, for herein
 he dealt faithfully

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 "<I>I am full of the fury of the Lord,</I> full of the thoughts and
 apprehensions of it, and am carried out with a powerful impulse, by the 
 spirit of prophecy, to speak of it thus vehemently." He took no delight 
 in threatening, nor was it any pleasure to him with such sermons as 
 these to make those about him uneasy; but he could not contain himself; 
 he was <I>weary with holding in;</I> he suppressed it as long as he 
 could, as long as he durst, but he was so <I>full of power by the 
 Spirit of the Lord of hosts</I> that he must speak, whether they will 
 hear or whether they will forbear. Note, When ministers preach the 
 terrors of the Lord according to the scripture we have no reason to be 
 displeased at them; for they are but messengers, and must deliver their 
 message, pleasing or unpleasing. 

 2. He condemns the false prophets who preached plausibly, for therein 
 they flattered people and dealt unfaithfully

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>):

 <I>The priest and the prophet,</I> who should be their watchmen and
 monitors, have <I>dealt falsely,</I> have not been true to their trust 
 not told the people their faults and the danger they were in; they 
 should have been their physicians, but they murdered their patients by 
 letting them have their will, by giving them every thing that had a 
 mind to, and flattering them into an opinion that they were in no 
 danger

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 They have <I>healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly,</I>
 or <I>according to the cure of some slight hurt,</I> skinning over the 
 wound and never searching it to the bottom, applying lenitives only, 
 when there was need of corrosives, soothing people in their sins, and 
 giving them opiates to make them easy for the present, while the 
 disease was preying upon the vitals. They said, "<I>Peace
 peace</I>--all shall be well." (if there were some thinking people 
 among them, who were awake, and apprehensive of danger, they soon 
 stopped their mouths with their priestly and prophetical authority, 
 boldly averring that neither church nor state was in any danger), when 
 <I>there is no peace,</I> because they went on in their idolatries and 
 daring impieties. Note, Those are to be reckoned our false friends 
 (that is, our worst and most dangerous enemies) who flatter us in a 
 sinful way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The sin of Judah and Jerusalem, which provoked God to bring this 
 ruin upon them and justified him in it, is here declared. 

 1. They would by no means bear to be told of their faults, nor of the
 danger they were in. God bids the prophet give them warning of the 
 judgment coming

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 "but," says he, "<I>to whom shall I speak and give warning?</I> I
 cannot find out any that will so much as give me a patient hearing. I 
 may give warning long enough, but these is nobody that will take 
 warning. I cannot speak <I>that they may hear,</I> cannot speak to any 
 purpose, or with any hope of success; for <I>their ear is 
 uncircumcised,</I> it is carnal and fleshly, indisposed to receive the 
 voice of God, so that <I>they cannot hearken.</I> They have, as it 
 were, a thick skin grown over the organs of hearing, so that divine 
 things might to as much purpose be spoken to a stone as to them. Nay, 
 they are not only deaf to it, but prejudiced against it; therefore they 
 cannot hear, because they are resolved that they will not: The <I>word 
 of the Lord is unto them a reproach;</I> both the reproofs and the 
 threatenings of the word are so;" they reckoned themselves wronged and 
 affronted by both, and resented the prophet's plain-dealing with them 
 as they would the most causeless slander and calumny. This was 
 <I>kicking against the pricks</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:5">Acts ix. 5</A>),

 as the lawyers against the word of Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:45">Luke xi. 45</A>,

 <I>Thus saying, thou repoachest us also.</I> Note, Those reproofs that
 are counted reproaches, and hated as such, will certainly be turned 
 into the heaviest woes. When it is here said, <I>They have no delight 
 in the word,</I> more is implied than is expressed; "they have an 
 antipathy to it; their hearts rise at it; it exasperates them, and 
 enrages their corruptions, and they are ready to fly in the face and 
 pull out the eyes of their reprovers." And how can those expect that 
 the word of the Lord should speak any comfort to them who have no 
 delight in it, but would rather be any where than within hearing of it?

 2. They were inordinately set upon the world, and wholly carried away 
 by the love of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 "<I>From the least of them even to the greatest,</I> old and young,
 rich and poor, high and low, those of all ranks, professions, and 
 employments, <I>every one is given to covetousness,</I> greedy of 
 filthy lucre, all for what they can get, <I>per fas per nefas--right or 
 wrong;</I>" and this made them oppressive and violent

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>),

 for of those evils, as well as others, the love of money is the bitter
 root. Nay, and this hardened their hearts against the word of God and 
 his prophets. It was the covetous Pharisees that derided Christ, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:14">Luke xvi. 14</A>.

 3. They had become impudent in sin and were past shame. After such a
 high charge of flagrant crimes proved upon them, it was very proper to 
 ask

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),
 
 <I>Were they ashamed when they had committed</I> all these 
 <I>abominations,</I> which are such a reproach to their reason and 
 religion? Did they blush at the conviction, and acknowledge that 
 confusion of face belonged to them? If so, there is some hope of them 
 yet. But, alas! there did not appear so much as this colour of virtue 
 among them; their hearts were so hardened that <I>they were not at all 
 ashamed, neither could they blush,</I> they had so brazened their 
 faces. They even gloried in their wickedness, and openly confronted
 the convictions which should have humbled them and brought them to 
 repentance. They resolved to face it out against God himself and not to 
 own their guilt. Some refer this to the priests and prophets, who had 
 healed the people slightly and told them that they should have peace, 
 and yet were not ashamed of their treachery and falsehood, no, not when 
 the event disproved them and gave them the lie. Those that are 
 shameless are graceless and their case is hopeless. But those that will 
 not submit to a penitential shame, nor take that to themselves as their 
 due, shall not escape an utter ruin; for so it follows: <I>Therefore 
 they shall fall among</I> those <I>that fall;</I> they shall have their 
 portion with those that are quite undone; and, when God visits the 
 nation in wrath, they shall be sure to be cast down and be made to 
 tremble, because they would not blush. Note, Those that sin and cannot 
 blush for it are in an evil case now, and it will be worse with them 
 shortly. At first they hardened themselves and would not blush, 
 afterwards they were so hardened that they could not. <I>Quod unum 
 habebant in malis bonum perdunt, peccandi verecundiam--they have lost
 the only good property which once blended itself with many bad ones, 
 that is, shame for having done amiss.</I>--Senec. De Vit. Beat.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They are put in mind of the good counsel which had been often 
 given them, but in vain. They had a great deal said to them to little 
 purpose,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. By way of advice concerning their duty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 God had been used to say to them, <I>Stand in the ways and see.</I> 
 That is, 

 (1.) He would have them to consider, not to proceed rashly, but to do 
 as travellers in the road, who are in care to find the right way which 
 will bring them to their journey's end, and therefore pause and enquire 
 for it. If they have any reason to think that they have missed their 
 way, they are not easy till they have obtained satisfaction. O that men 
 would be thus <I>wise for their souls,</I> and would ponder the path of 
 their feet, as those that believe lawful and unlawful are of no less 
 consequence to us than the right way and the wrong are to a traveller! 
 
 (2.) He would have them to consult antiquity, the observations and 
 experiences of those that went before them: "<I>Ask for the old paths, 
 enquire of the former age</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:8">Job viii. 8</A>),

 <I>ask thy father, thy elders</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:7">Deut. xxxii. 7</A>),

 and thou wilt find that the way of godliness and righteousness has
 always been the way which God has owned and blessed and in which men 
 have prospered. Ask for the <I>old paths,</I> the paths prescribed by 
 the law of God, the written word, that true standard of antiquity. Ask
 for the paths that the patriarchs travelled in before you, Abraham, and 
 Isaac, and Jacob; and, as you hope to inherit the promises made to 
 them, tread in their steps. <I>Ask for the old paths, Where is the
 good way?</I>" We must not be guided merely by antiquity, as if the 
 plea of prescription and long usage were alone sufficient to justify 
 our path. No; there is an <I>old way which wicked men have
 trodden,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:15">Job xxii. 15</A>.

 But, when we ask for the old paths, it is only in order to find out the
 <I>good way,</I> the highway of the upright. Note, The way of religion
 and godliness is a good old way, the way that all the saints in all 
 ages have walked in.

 (3.) He would have them to resolve to act according to the result of 
 these enquiries: "When you have found out which is the good way, 
 <I>walk therein,</I> practise accordingly, keep closely to that way, 
 proceed, and persevere in it." Some make this counsel to be given them 
 with reference to the struggles that were between the true and false 
 prophets, between those that said they should have peace and those that 
 told them trouble was at the door; they pretended they knew not which 
 to believe: "<I>Stand in the way,</I>" says God, "and see, and enquire, 
 which of these two agrees with the written word and the usual methods 
 of God's providence, which of these directs you to the good way, and do 
 accordingly." 

 (4.) He assures them that, if they do thus, it will secure the welfare
 and satisfaction of their own souls: "<I>Walk in the good old way</I> 
 and you will find your walking in that way will be easy and pleasant; 
 you will enjoy both your God and yourselves, and the way will lead you 
 to true rest. Though it cost you some pains to walk in that way, you 
 will find an abundant recompence at your journey's end." 

 (5.) He laments that this good counsel, which was so rational in itself 
 and so proper for them, could not find acceptance: "<I>But they said, 
 We will not walk therein,</I> not only we will not be at the pains to 
 enquire <I>which is the good way,</I> the <I>good old way;</I> but when 
 it is told us, and we have nothing to say to the contrary but that it 
 is the right way, yet we will not deny ourselves and our humours so far 
 as to <I>walk in it.</I>" Thus multitudes are ruined for ever by 
 downright wilfulness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. By way of admonition concerning their danger. Because they would not 
 be ruled by fair reasoning, God takes another method with them; by less 
 judgments he threatens greater, and sends his prophets to give them 
 this explication of them, and to frighten them with an apprehension of 
 the danger they were in 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);

 <I>Also I set watchmen over you.</I> God's ministers are watchmen, and
 it is a great mercy to have them set over us in the Lord. Now observe
 here, 

 (1.) The fair warning given by these watchmen. This was the burden of 
 their song; they cried again and again, <I>Hearken to the sound of the 
 trumpet.</I> God, in his providence, sounds the trumpet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:14">Zech. ix. 14</A>);
 
 the watchmen hear it themselves and are affected with it
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:19">Jer. iv. 19</A>),
 
 and they are to call upon others to hearken to it too, to hear the
 Lord's controversy, to observe the voice of Providence, to improve it, 
 and answer the intentions of it. 

 (2.) This fair warning slighted: "<I>But they said, We will not 
 hearken;</I> we will not hear, we will not heed, we will not believe; 
 the prophets may as well save themselves and us the trouble." The 
 reason why sinners perish is because they <I>do not hearken to the 
 sound of the trumpet;</I> and the reason why they do not is because 
 they will not; and they have no reason to give why they will not but 
 because they will not, that is, they are herein most unreasonable. One 
 may more easily deal with ten men's reasons than one man's will.</P>

 hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. God appeals to all the neighbours, nay, to the whole world, 
 concerning the equity of his proceedings against Judah and Jerusalem 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>):

 "<I>Hear, you nations, and know</I> particularly, <I>O congregation</I>
 of the mighty, the great men of the nations, that take cognizance of 
 the affairs of states about you and make remarks upon them. Observe now 
 what is doing among those of Judah and Jerusalem; you hear of the 
 desolations brought upon them, the earth rings of it, trembles under 
 it; you all wonder that <I>I</I> should <I>bring evil upon this 
 people,</I> that are in covenant with me, that profess relation to me, 
 that have worshipped me, and been highly favoured by me; you are ready 
 to ask, <I>Wherefore has the Lord done thus to this land?</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:24">Deut. xxix. 24</A>.
 
 Know then,"

 1. "That it is the natural product of their devices. The evil brought
 upon them is <I>the fruit of their thought.</I> They thought to
 strengthen themselves by their alliance with foreigners, and by that 
 very thing they weakened and diminished themselves, they betrayed and 
 exposed themselves." 

 2. "That it is the just punishment of their disobedience and rebellion. 
 God does but execute upon them the curse of the law for their violation 
 of its commands. It is because <I>they have not hearkened to my words 
 nor to my law,</I> nor regarded a word I have said to them, but 
 rejected it all. They would never have been ruined thus by the 
 judgments of God's hand if they had not refused to be ruled by the 
 judgments of his mouth: therefore you cannot say that they have any 
 wrong done them."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God rejects their plea, by which they insisted upon their external 
 services as sufficient to atone for all their sins. Alas! it is a 
 frivolous plea 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 "<I>To what purpose come there to me incense and sweet cane,</I> to be
 burnt for a perfume on the golden altar, though it was the best of the 
 kind, and far-fetched? What care I for <I>your burnt-offerings</I> and 
 <I>your sacrifices?</I>" They not only cannot profit God (no sacrifice 
 does, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:9">Ps. l. 9</A>),

 but they do not please him, for none does this but the sacrifice of the
 upright; that of the wicked is an <I>abomination to him.</I> Sacrifice 
 and incense were appointed to excite their repentance, and to direct 
 them to a Mediator, and assist their faith in him. Where this good use 
 was made of them they were acceptable, God had respect to them and to 
 those that offered them. But when they were offered with an opinion 
 that thereby they made God their debtor, and purchased a license to go 
 on in sin, they were so far from being pleasing to God that they were a 
 provocation to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He foretels the desolation that was now coming upon them. 

 1. God designs their ruin because they hate to be reformed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>I will lay stumbling-blocks before this people,</I> occasions of
 falling not into sin, but into trouble. Those whom God has marked for 
 destruction he perplexes and embarrasses in their counsels, and 
 obstructs and retards all the methods they take for their own safety. 
 The parties of the enemy, which they met with wherever they went, were 
 stumbling-blocks to them; in ever corner they stumbled upon them and 
 were dashed to pieces by them: <I>The fathers and the sons together 
 shall fall upon them;</I> neither the fathers with their wisdom, nor 
 the sons with their strength and courage, shall escape them, or get 
 over them. The sons that sinned with their fathers fall with them.
 Even the <I>neighbour and his friend shall perish</I> and not be able 
 to help either themselves or one another. 

 2. He will make use of the Chaldeans as instruments of it; for whatever 
 work God has to do he will find out proper instruments for the doing of 
 it. This is a people fetched <I>from the north, from the sides of the 
 earth.</I> Babylon itself lay a great way off northward; and some of 
 the countries that were subject to the king of Babylon, out of which 
 his army was levied, lay much further. These must be employed in this 
 service,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>.
 
 For, 
 
 (1.) It is a people very numerous, <I>a great nation,</I> which
 will make their invasion the more formidable. 

 (2.) It is a warlike people. <I>They lay hold on bow and spear,</I> and 
 at this time know how to use them, for they are used to them. <I>They 
 ride upon horses,</I> and therefore they march the more swiftly, and in 
 battle press the harder. No nation had yet brought into the field a 
 better cavalry that the Chaldeans. 

 (3.) It is a barbarous people. They <I>are cruel and have no mercy,</I> 
 being greedy of prey and flushed with victory. They take a pride in 
 frightening all about them; their voice <I>roars like the sea.</I> And, 
 
 (4.) They have a particular design upon Judah and Jerusalem, in hopes 
 greatly to enrich themselves with the spoil of that famous country. 
 They are <I>set in array against thee, O daughter of Zion!</I> The sins 
 of God's professing people make them an easy prey to those that are 
 God's enemies as well as theirs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He describes the very great consternation which Judah and Jerusalem 
 should be in upon the approach of this formidable enemy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:24-26"><I>v.</I> 24-26</A>.

 1. They own themselves in a fright, upon the first intelligence
 brought them of the approach of the enemy: "When <I>we have but heard 
 the fame thereof our hands wax feeble,</I> and we have no heart to make 
 any resistance; <I>anguish has taken hold of us,</I> and we are 
 immediately in an extremity of pain, like that of <I>a woman in 
 travail.</I>" Note, Sense of guilt quite dispirits men, upon the 
 approach of any threatening trouble. What can those hope to do for 
 themselves who have made God their enemy? 

 2. They confine themselves by consent to their houses, not daring to 
 show their heads abroad; for, though they could not but expect that the 
 sword of the enemy would at last find them out there, yet they would 
 rather die tamely and meanly there than run any venture, either by 
 fight or flight, to help themselves. Thus they say one to another, 
 "<I>Go not forth into the field,</I> no not to fetch in your provision 
 thence, <I>nor walk by the way;</I> dare not to go to church or market, 
 it is at your peril if you do, for the <I>sword of the enemy,</I> and 
 the fear of it, are <I>on every side;</I> the <I>highways are 
 unoccupied,</I> as in Jael's time," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:6">Judg. v. 6</A>.

 Let this remind us, when we travel the roads in safety and there is
 none to make us afraid, to bless God for our share in the public 
 tranquillity.

 3. The prophet calls upon them sadly to lament the desolations that
 were coming upon them. He was himself the lamenting prophet, and called 
 upon his people to join with him in his lamentations: "<I>O daughter of 
 my people,</I> hear they God calling thee to weeping and mourning, and 
 answer his call: do not only put on sackcloth for a day, but gird it on 
 for thy constant wear; do not only put ashes on thy head, but <I>wallow 
 thyself in ashes;</I> put thyself into close mourning, and use all the 
 tokens of bitter lamentation, not forced and for show only, but with 
 the greatest sincerity, as parents <I>mourn for an only son,</I> and 
 think themselves comfortless because they are childless. Thus do thou 
 lament for <I>the spoiler that suddenly comes upon us.</I> Though he 
 has not come yet, he is <I>coming,</I> the decree has <I>gone 
 forth:</I> let us therefore meet the execution of it with a suitable 
 sadness." As saints may rejoice in hope of God's mercies, though they 
 see them only in the promise, so sinners must mourn for fear of God's 
 judgments, though they see them only in the threatenings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He constitutes the prophet a judge over this people that now stand 
 upon their trial: as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:10"><I>ch.</I> i. 10</A>,

 <I>I have set thee over the nations;</I> so here, <I>I have set thee
 for a tower,</I> or as a sentinel, or a watchman, upon a tower, 
 <I>among my people,</I> as an inspector of their actions, <I>that thou 
 mayest know, and try their way,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Not that God needed any to inform him concerning them; on the contrary, 
 the prophet knew little of them in comparison but by the spirit of 
 prophecy. But thus God appeals to the prophet himself, and his own 
 observation concerning their character, that he might be fully 
 satisfied in the equity of God's proceedings against them and with the 
 more assurance give them warning of the judgments coming. God set him 
 for a tower, conspicuous to all and attacked by many, but made him a 
 <I>fortress,</I> a <I>strong tower,</I> gave him courage to stem the 
 tide and bear the shock of their displeasure. Those that will be 
 faithful reprovers have need to be firm as fortresses. Now in trying
 their way he will find two things:--

 1. That they are wretchedly debauched

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 <I>They are all grievous revolters, revolters of revolters</I> (so the
 word is), the worst of revolters, as a <I>servant of servants</I> is 
 the meanest servant. They have a revolting heart, have deeply
 revolted, and revolt more and more. They seemed to start fair, but they 
 revolt and start back. They <I>walk with slanders;</I> they make 
 nothing of belying and backbiting one another, nay, they make a perfect 
 trade of it; it is their constant course, and they govern themselves by 
 the slanders they hear, hating those that they hear ill-spoken of, 
 though ever so unjustly. They are <I>brass and iron,</I> base metals, 
 and there is nothing in them that is valuable. They were as silver and
 gold, but they have degenerated. Nay, as <I>they are all revolters,</I> 
 so <I>they are all corrupters,</I> not only debauched themselves, but 
 industrious to debauch others, to corrupt them as they themselves are 
 corrupt; nay, to make them seven times more the children of hell than 
 themselves. It is often so; sinners soon become tempters.

 2. That they would never be reclaimed and reformed; it was in vain to 
 think of reforming them, for various methods had been tried with them, 
 and all to no purpose,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:29,30"><I>v.</I> 29, 30</A>.

 He compares them to ore that was supposed to have some good metal in 
 it, and was therefore put into the furnace by the refiner, who used all 
 his art, and took abundance of pains, about it, but it proved all 
 dross, nothing of any value could be extracted out of it. God by his 
 prophets and by his providences had used the most proper means to 
 refine this people and to purify them from their wickedness; but it was 
 all in vain. By the continual preaching of the word, and in a series of 
 afflictions, they had been kept in a constant fire, but all to no 
 purpose. <I>The bellows</I> have been still kept so near the fire, to 
 blow it, that they <I>are burnt</I> with the heat of it, or they are 
 quite worn out with long use and thrown into the fire as good for 
 nothing. The prophets have preached their throats sore with crying 
 aloud against the sins of Israel, and yet they are not convinced and 
 humbled. The <I>lead,</I> which was then used in refining silver, as 
 quicksilver is now, <I>is consumed of the fire,</I> and has not done 
 its work. <I>The founder melts in vain;</I> his labour is lost, <I>for 
 the wicked are not plucked away,</I> no care is taken to separate 
 between the precious and the vile, to purge out the old leaven, to cast 
 out of communion those who, being corrupt themselves, are in danger of 
 infecting others. Or, <I>Their wickednesses are not removed</I> (so 
 some read it); they are still as bad as ever, and nothing will prevail 
 to part between them and their sins. They will not be brought off from 
 their idolatries and immoralities by all they have heard, and all they 
 have felt, of the wrath of God against them; and therefore that doom is 
 passed upon them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 <I>Reprobate silver shall they be called,</I> useless and worthless;
 they glitter as if they had some silver in them, but there is nothing 
 of real virtue or goodness to be found among them; and for this reason 
 <I>the Lord has rejected them.</I> He will no more own them as his 
 people, nor look for any good from them; he will <I>take them away like 
 dross</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:119">Ps. cxix. 119</A>),

 and prepare a consuming fire for those that would not be purified by a
 refining fire. By this it appears,

 (1.) That God has <I>no pleasure in the death</I> and ruin of sinners, 
 for he tries all ways and methods with them to prevent their 
 destruction and qualify them for salvation. Both his ordinances and his 
 providences have a tendency this way, to part between them and their 
 sins; and yet with many it is all lost labour. <I>We have piped unto 
 you, and you have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and you have 
 not wept.</I> Therefore, 

 (2.) God will be justified in the death of sinners and all the blame
 will lie upon themselves. He did not reject them till he had used all 
 proper means to reform them; did not cast them off so long as there was 
 any hope of them, nor abandon them as dross till it appeared that they 
 were <I>reprobate silver.</I></P>
