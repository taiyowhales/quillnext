 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have three sermons preached by the prophet Haggai
 for the encouragement of those that are forward to build the temple. In
 the first he assures the builders that the glory of the house they were
 now building should, in spiritual respects, though not in outward,
 exceed that of Solomon's temple, in which he has an eye to the coming
 of Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:1-9">ver. 1-9</A>.

 In the second he assures them that though their sin, in delaying to
 build the temple, had retarded the prosperous progress of all their
 other affairs, yet now that they had set about it in good earnest he
 would bless them, and give them success, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:10-19">ver. 10-19</A>.

 In the third he assures Zerubbabel that, as a reward of his pious zeal
 and activity herein, he should be a favourite of Heaven, and one of the 
 ancestors of Messiah the Prince, whose kingdom should be set up on the 
 ruins of all opposing powers,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 In the seventh <I>month,</I> in the one and twentieth <I>day</I> of the
 month, came the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> by the prophet Haggai, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of
 Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to
 the residue of the people, saying,
 &nbsp; 3 Who <I>is</I> left among you that saw this house in her first
 glory? and how do ye see it now? <I>is it</I> not in your eyes in
 comparison of it as nothing?
 &nbsp; 4 Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and be
 strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be
 strong, all ye people of the land, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and work: for
 I <I>am</I> with you, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts:
 &nbsp; 5 <I>According to</I> the word that I covenanted with you when ye
 came out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not.
 &nbsp; 6 For thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts; Yet once, it <I>is</I> a little
 while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea,
 and the dry <I>land;</I>
 &nbsp; 7 And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations
 shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 of hosts.
 &nbsp; 8 The silver <I>is</I> mine, and the gold <I>is</I> mine, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 of hosts.
 &nbsp; 9 The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the
 former, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts: and in this place will I give
 peace, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is,

 I. The date of this message, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 It was sent on the twenty-first day of the seventh month, when the 
 builders had been about a month at work (since the twenty-fourth day of 
 the sixth month), and had got it in some forwardness. Note, Those that 
 are hearty in the service of God shall receive fresh encouragements 
 from him to proceed in it, as their case calls for them. Set the wheels 
 a going, and God will oil them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The direction of this message, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The encouragements here are sent to the same persons to whom the 
 reproofs in the foregoing chapter are directed; for those that are 
 wounded by the convictions of the word shall be healed and bound up by 
 its consolations. <I>Speak to Zerubbabel, and Joshua, and the residue 
 of the people,</I> the very same that <I>obeyed the voice of the 
 Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:12"><I>ch.</I> i. 12</A>)

 and whose spirits God stirred up to do so

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:14"><I>ch.</I> i. 14</A>);

 to them are sent these words of comfort.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The message itself, in which observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The discouragements which those laboured under who were employed in 
 this work. That which was such a damp upon them, and an alloy to their 
 joy, when the foundation of the temple was laid, was still a clog upon 
 them--that they could not build such a temple now as Solomon built, not
 so large, so stately, so sumptuous, a one as that was. This fetched 
 tears from the eyes of many, when the dimensions of it were first laid 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:12">Ezra iii. 12</A>),

 and still it made the work go on heavily--that the glory of this house,
 <I>in comparison</I> with that of the former, was <I>as nothing,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 It was now about seventy years since Solomon's temple was destroyed 
 (for that was in the nineteenth year of the captivity, and this about 
 the nineteenth after the captivity), so that there might be some yet 
 alive who could remember to have seen it, and still they would be 
 upbraiding themselves and their brethren with the great disparity 
 between this house and that. One could remember the gold with which it 
 was overlaid, another the precious stones with which it was garnished; 
 one could describe the magnificence of the porch, another of the 
 pillars--and where are these now? This weakened the hands of the 
 builders; for, though our gracious God is pleased with us if we do in 
 sincerity as well as we can in his service, yet our proud hearts will 
 scarcely let us be pleased with ourselves unless we do as well as 
 others whose abilities far exceed ours. And it is sometimes the fault 
 of old people to discourage the services of the present age by crying 
 up too much the performances and attainments of the former age, with 
 which others should be provoked to emulation, but not exposed to 
 contempt. <I>Say not thou that the former days were better than 
 these</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:10">Eccl. vii. 10</A>),

 but thank God that there is any good in these, bad as they are.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The encouragement that is given them to go on in the work, 
 notwithstanding 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Yet now,</I> though this house is likely to be much inferior to the 
 former, <I>be strong, O Zerubbabel! and be strong, O Joshua!</I> Let 
 not these leading men give way to this suggestion, nor be disheartened 
 by it, but do as well as they can, when they cannot do so well as they 
 would; and let <I>all the people of the land be strong</I> too, <I>and 
 work;</I> and, if the leaders have but a good heart on it, it is hoped 
 that the followers will have the better heart. Note, Those that work 
 for God ought to exert themselves with vigour, and then to encourage 
 themselves with hope that it will end well.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The grounds of these encouragements. God himself says to them, 
 <I>Fear you not</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),
 
 and he gives good reasons for it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They have God with them, his Spirit and his special presence: 
 <I>Be strong, for I am with you, saith the Lord of hosts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 This he had said before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:13"><I>ch.</I> i. 13</A>),

 <I>I am with you.</I> But we need to have these assurances repeated,
 that we may have strong consolation. The presence of God with us, as
 the <I>Lord of hosts,</I> is enough to silence all our fears and to 
 help us over all the discouragements we may meet with in the way of our 
 duty. The Jews had hosts against them, but they had the Lord of hosts 
 with them, to take their part and plead their cause. He is with them; 
 for, 

 [1.] He adheres to his promise. His covenant is inviolable, and he will 
 be always theirs, and will appear and act for them, <I>according to the 
 word that he covenanted with them when they came out of Egypt.</I> 
 Though <I>he chastens them for their transgressions with the rod,</I> 
 yet he will not make his faithfulness to fail.

 [2.] He dwells among them by his Spirit, the Spirit of prophecy. When 
 he first formed them into a people <I>he gave his good Spirit to 
 instruct them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Neh+9:20">Neh. ix. 20</A>);

 and still the Spirit, though often grieved and provoked to withdraw,
 remained among them. It was the Spirit of God that stirred up their 
 spirits to come out of Babylon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:5">Ezra i. 5</A>),

 and now to build the temple, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:14">Hag. i. 14</A>.

 Note, We have reason to be encouraged as long as we have the Spirit of
 God remaining among us to work upon us, for so long we have God with us 
 to work for us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They shall have the Messiah among them shortly--<I>him that should
 come.</I> To him bore all the prophets witness and this prophet 
 particularly here, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 Here is an intimation of the time of his coming, that it should not be 
 long ere he came: "<I>Yet once, it is a little while,</I> and he shall 
 come. The Old-Testament church has but one stage more (if we may say 
 so) to travel; five stages were now past, from Adam to Noah, thence to 
 Abraham, thence to Moses, thence to Solomon's temple, thence to the 
 captivity, and now yet one stage more, its sixth day's journey, and 
 then comes the sabbatism of the Messiah's kingdom. Let the Son of man, 
 when he comes, find faith on the earth, and let the children of promise 
 continue still looking for him, for now it is but <I>a little while</I> 
 and he will come; <I>hold out, faith and patience,</I> yet awhile, for 
 <I>he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.</I>" And, as he 
 then said of his first appearance, so now of his second, <I>Surely I 
 come quickly.</I> Now concerning his coming it is here foretold, 

 [1.] That it shall be introduced by a general shaking

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry 
 land.</I> This is applied to the setting up of Christ's kingdom in the 
 world, to make way for which he will <I>judge among the heathen,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:6">Ps. cx. 6</A>.

 God will once again do for his church as he did when he brought them
 out of Egypt; he shook the heavens and earth at Mount Sinai, with 
 thunder, and lightnings, and earthquakes; he shook the sea and the dry 
 land when lanes were made through the sea and streams fetched out of 
 the rock. This shall be done again, when, at the sufferings of Christ, 
 the sun shall be darkened, the earth shake, the rocks rend--when, at 
 the birth of Christ, Herod and all <I>Jerusalem are troubled</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:3">Matt. ii. 3</A>),

 and he is <I>set for the fall and rising again of many.</I> When his
 kingdom was set up it was with a shock to the nations; the oracles were
 silenced, idols were destroyed, and the powers of the kingdoms were
 moved and removed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:27">Heb. xii. 27</A>.

 It denotes <I>the removing of the things that are shaken.</I> Note, The
 shaking of the nations is often in order to the settling of the church 
 and the establishing of the things that cannot be shaken.

 [2.] That it shall issue in a general satisfaction. He shall come as 
 <I>the desire of all nations</I>--desirable to all nations, for <I>in 
 him shall all the families of the earth be blessed</I> with the best of 
 blessings--long expected and desired by the good people in all nations, 
 that had any intelligence from the Old-Testament predictions concerning 
 him. Balaam in the land of Moab had spoken of a star that should arise 
 out of Jacob, and Job in the land of Uz of his living Redeemer; the 
 concourse of devout men from all parts at Jerusalem 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:5">Acts ii. 5</A>)

 was in expectation of the setting up of the Messiah's kingdom about
 that time. All the nations that are brought in to Christ, and
 discipled in his name, have called him, and will call him, <I>all their 
 salvation and all their desire.</I> This glorious title of Christ seems 
 to refer to Jacob's prophecy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:10">Gen. xlix. 10</A>),

 that <I>to him shall the gathering of the people be.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The house they are now building shall be filled with glory to such 
 a degree that its glory shall exceed that of Solomon's temple. The 
 enemies of the Jews followed them with reproach, and cast contempt upon 
 the house they were building; but they might very well endure that when 
 God undertook to fill it with glory. It is God's prerogative to fill 
 with glory; the glory that comes from him is satisfying, and not vain 
 glory. Moses's tabernacle and Solomon's temple were filled with glory 
 when God in a cloud took possession of them; but this house shall be 
 filled with glory of another nature. 

 [1.] Let them not be concerned because this house will not have so much 
 silver and gold about it as Solomon's temple had,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 God needs not the silver and gold to adorn his temple, for (says he), 
 <I>The silver is mine, and the gold is mine.</I> All the silver and 
 gold in the world are his; all that is hid in the bowels of the earth 
 (for <I>the earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof</I>), all that 
 is laid up in the exchequers, banks, and treasuries of the children of 
 men, and all that circulates for the maintaining of trade and commerce; 
 it is all <I>the Lord's.</I> Every penny bears his image as well as 
 C&aelig;sar's; and therefore when gold and silver are dedicated to his 
 honour, and employed in his service, no addition is made to him, for it 
 was his before. When David and his princes offered vast sums for the 
 service of the house of God, they acknowledged, <I>It is all thy own, 
 and of thy own, Lord, have we given thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:14,16">1 Chron. xxix. 14, 16</A>.
 
 Therefore God needs not sacrifice, for <I>every beast of the forest is 
 his,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:10">Ps. l. 10</A>.

 Note, If we have silver and gold, we must serve and honour God with
 them, for they are all his own, we have but the use of them, the 
 property remains in him; but, if we have not silver and gold to honour 
 him with, we must honour him with such as we have, and he will accept 
 us, for he needs them not; all the <I>silver and gold</I> in the world 
 are his already. <I>The earth is full of his riches,</I> so <I>is the 
 great and wide sea also.</I>

 [2.] Let them be comforted with this, that, though this temple have 
 less gold in it, it shall have more glory than Solomon's

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the 
 former.</I> This was never true in respect of outward glory. This 
 latter house was indeed in its latter times very much beautified and 
 enriched by Herod, and we find the disciples admiring the stones and 
 buildings of the temple, how fine they were 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:1">Mark xiii. 1</A>);

 but it was nothing in comparison with Solomon's temple; and, besides,
 the Jews own that several of the divine glories of the first temple 
 were wanting in this--the <I>ark,</I> the <I>urim</I> and 
 <I>thummim,</I> the <I>fire from heaven,</I> and the <I>Schechinah;</I> 
 so that we cannot conceive how the glory of this latter house should in 
 any thing exceed that of the former, but in that which would indeed 
 excel all the glories of the first house--the presence of the Messiah 
 in it, the Son of God, his being presented there <I>the glory of his 
 people Israel,</I> his attending there at twelve years old, and 
 afterwards his preaching and working miracles there, and his driving 
 the buyers and sellers out of it. It was necessary, then, that the 
 Messiah should come while the second temple stood; but, that being long 
 since destroyed, we must conclude that our Lord Jesus is the Christ, is 
 <I>he that should come,</I> and we are to <I>look for no other.</I> It 
 was also the <I>glory of this latter house, First,</I> That, before the 
 coming of Christ, it was always kept free from idols and idolatries, 
 and was never polluted with those abominable things, as the first 
 temple often was

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:11,12">2 Kings xxiii. 11, 12</A>),

 and in this its glory excelled all the glory of that. Note, The purity
 of the church, and the strict adherence to divine institutions, are
 much more its glory than external pomp and splendour. <I>Secondly,</I>
 That, after Christ, the gospel was preached in it by the apostles, even
 all the words of this life, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:20">Acts v. 20</A>.

 In the temple Jesus Christ was daily preached, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:42">Acts v. 42</A>.

 Now the ministration of righteousness and life by the gospel was
 unspeakably more glorious than the law, which was a <I>ministration of
 death and condemnation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:9,10">2 Cor. iii. 9, 10</A>.

 Note, That is the most valuable glory which arises from our relation to
 Christ and our interest in him. As, where Christ is, <I>behold a 
 greater than Solomon is there,</I> so the heart in which he dwells, and 
 makes a living temple, behold it is more glorious than Solomon's 
 temple, and will be so to eternity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) They should see a comfortable end of their present troubles, and 
 enjoy the pleasure of a happy settlement: <I>In this place will I give 
 peace, saith the Lord of hosts.</I> Note, God's presence with his 
 people in his ordinances secures to them all good. If God be with us, 
 peace is with us. But the Jews under the latter temple had so much 
 trouble that we must conclude this promise to have its accomplishment 
 in that spiritual peace which Jesus Christ has by his blood purchased 
 for, and by his last will and testament bequeathed to, all believers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:27">John xiv. 27</A>),

 that peace which Christ himself preached as the prophet of peace, and
 gives as the prince of peace. God will <I>give peace in this place;</I>
 he will give his Son to be the peace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:14">Eph. ii. 14</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10 In the four and twentieth <I>day</I> of the ninth <I>month,</I> in the
 second year of Darius, came the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> by Haggai the
 prophet, saying,
 &nbsp; 11 Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts; Ask now the priests
 <I>concerning</I> the law, saying,
 &nbsp; 12 If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with
 his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any
 meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.
 &nbsp; 13 Then said Haggai, If <I>one that is</I> unclean by a dead body
 touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered
 and said, It shall be unclean.
 &nbsp; 14 Then answered Haggai, and said, So <I>is</I> this people, and so
 <I>is</I> this nation before me, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and so <I>is</I> every
 work of their hands; and that which they offer there <I>is</I>
 unclean.
 &nbsp; 15 And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from
 before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 &nbsp; 16 Since those <I>days</I> were, when <I>one</I> came to a heap of
 twenty <I>measures,</I> there were <I>but</I> ten: when <I>one</I> came to the
 press-fat for to draw out fifty <I>vessels</I> out of the press, there
 were <I>but</I> twenty.
 &nbsp; 17 I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in
 all the labours of your hands; yet ye <I>turned</I> not to me, saith
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 18 Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and
 twentieth day of the ninth <I>month, even</I> from the day that the
 foundation of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s temple was laid, consider <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 19 Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the
 fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not
 brought forth: from this day will I bless <I>you.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This sermon was preached two months after that in the former part of 
 the chapter. The priests and Levites preached constantly, but the 
 prophets preached occasionally; both were good and needful. We have 
 need to be taught our duty <I>in season and out of season.</I> The 
 people were now going on vigorously with the building of the temple, 
 and in hopes shortly to have it ready for their use and to be employed 
 in the services of it; and now God sends them a message by his prophet, 
 which would be of use to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. By way of conviction and caution. They were now engaged in a very 
 good work, but they were concerned to see to it, not only that it was 
 good for the matter of it, but that it was done in a right manner, for 
 otherwise it would not be accepted of God. God sees there are many
 among them that spoil this good work, by going about it with 
 unsanctified hearts and hands, and are likely to gain no advantage to 
 themselves by it; these are here convicted, and all are warned thereby 
 to purify the hands they employ in this work, for <I>to the pure</I> 
 only <I>all things are pure,</I> and from the pure only that comes 
 which is pure. This matter is here illustrated by the established rules 
 of the ceremonial law, in putting <I>a difference between the clean and 
 the unclean,</I> about which many of the appointments of the law were 
 conversant. Hereby it appears that a spiritual use is to be made of the 
 ceremonial law, and that it was intended, not only as a divine ritual 
 to the Jews, but for <I>instruction in righteousness</I> to all, even 
 to us upon whom the ends of the world have come, to discover to us both 
 sin and Christ, both our disease and our remedy. Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What the rule of the law was. The prophet is ordered to enquire of 
 the priests concerning it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);

 for their <I>lips</I> should <I>keep</I> this <I>knowledge,</I> and the
 people should <I>enquire the law at their mouth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:7">Mal. ii. 7</A>.

 Haggai himself, though a prophet, must <I>ask the priests concerning
 the law.</I> His business, as an extraordinary messenger, was to 
 expound the providences of God, and to give directions concerning 
 particular duties, as he had done,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:8,9"><I>ch.</I> i. 8, 9</A>.

 But he would not take the priests' work out of the hands of those who
 were the ordinary ministers, and whose business it was to expound the 
 ordinances of God, to teach the people the meaning of them, and to give 
 the general rules for the observance of them. In a case of that nature, 
 Haggai must himself consult them. Note, God has given to his ministers 
 diversities of gifts, and calls them out to do diversities of services, 
 so that they have need one of another, should make use one of another, 
 and be helpful one to another. The prophet, though divinely inspired,
 cannot say to the priest, <I>I have no need of thee,</I> nor can the 
 priest say so to the prophet. Perhaps Haggai was <I>therefore</I> 
 ordered to consult the priests, that out of their own mouths he might 
 judge both them and the people committed to their charge, and convict 
 them of worse than ceremonial pollution. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+10:10,11">Lev. x. 10, 11</A>.

 Now the rules of the law, in the cases propounded, are, 

 (1.) That he that has holy flesh in his clothes cannot by the touch of 
 his clothes communicate holiness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment,</I> though the 
 garment is thereby so far made a devoted thing as that it is not to be 
 put to common use till it has first been washed in the holy place 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:27">Lev. vi. 27</A>),

 yet it shall by no means transmit a holiness to either meat or drink, 
 so as to make it ever the better to those that use it.

 (2.) That he that is ceremonially unclean by the touch of a dead body 
 does by his touch communicate that uncleanness. The law is express
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+19:22">Num. xix. 22</A>),

 <I>Whatsoever the unclean person touches shall be unclean;</I> yet this
 Haggai will have from the priests' own mouth, for concerning those 
 things that we find very plain in our Bibles yet it is good to have the 
 advice of our ministers. The sum of these two rules is that pollution
 is more easily communicated than sanctification; that is (says 
 Grotius), There are many ways of vice, but only one of virtue, and that 
 a difficult one. <I>Bonum oritur ex integris; malum ex quolibet 
 defectu--Good implies perfection; evil commences with the slightest 
 defect.</I> Let not men think that living among good people will 
 recommend them to God if they are not good themselves, but let them 
 fear that touching the unclean thing will defile them, and therefore 
 let them keep at a distance from it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How it is here applied 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>So is this people, and so is this nation, before me.</I> He does not 
 call them his people and his nation (they are unworthy to be owned by 
 him), but <I>this people,</I> and <I>this nation.</I> They have been 
 thus before God; they thought their offering sacrifices on the altar 
 would sanctify them, and excuse their neglect to build the temple, and 
 remove the curse which by that neglect they had brought upon their 
 common enjoyments: "No," says God, "your holy flesh and your altar will 
 be so far from sanctifying your meat and drink, your wine and oil, to 
 you, that your contempt of God's temple will bring a pollution, not 
 only on your common enjoyments, but even on your sacrifices too; so 
 that while you continued in that neglect all was unclean to you, nay, 
 and <I>so is this people</I> still; and so they will be; on these terms 
 they will still stand with me, and on no other--that if they be 
 profane, and sensual, and morally impure, if they have wicked hearts, 
 and live wicked lives, though they work ever so hard at the temple 
 while it is building, and though they offer ever so many and costly 
 sacrifices there when it is built, yet that shall not serve to sanctify 
 their meat and drink to them, and to give them a comfortable use of 
 them; nay, the impurity of their hearts and lives shall make even that 
 work of their hands, and all their offerings, unclean, and an 
 abomination to God." And the case is the same with us. Those whose
 devotions are plausible, but whose conversation is wicked, will find 
 their devotions unable to sanctify their enjoyments, but their 
 wickedness prevailing to pollute them. Note, When we are employed in 
 any good work we should be jealous over ourselves, lest we render it 
 unclean by our corruptions and mismanagements.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. By way of comfort and encouragement. If their hearts be right with 
 God, and their eye single in his service, they shall have the benefit 
 of their devotion. God will take away the judgment of famine wherewith 
 they have been corrected for their remissness, and will restore them 
 great plenty. This they are called to consider, and to observe whether 
 God would not be to the utmost as good as his word, and by his 
 providence remarkably countenance and recompense their reformation in 
 this matter. To make this the more signal, let them set down the day 
 when they began to work at the building of the temple, to raise the 
 structure upon the foundations that had been laid some time before. On 
 the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month they began to prepare 
 materials 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:15"><I>ch.</I> i. 15</A>),

 and now on the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month they began to
 <I>lay a stone upon a stone in the temple of the Lord;</I> let them 
 take notice of this day, and observe, 

 1. How they had gone behind-hand in their estates before this day. Let
 them remember the time when there was a sensible waste and decay in all 
 they had,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 A man went to his garner, expecting to find <I>a heap of twenty 
 measures</I> of corn, so much he used to have from such a piece of 
 ground, or so much used to be left at that time of the year, or so much 
 he took it for granted there was when he fetched the last from it, but 
 he found it unaccountably diminished, and, when he came to measure it, 
 <I>there were but ten</I> measures; it had run in and dried away in the 
 keeping, or vermin had eaten it, or it was stolen. In like manner he 
 went to <I>the wine-press,</I> expecting to draw <I>fifty vessels</I> 
 of wine, for so much he used to have from such a quantity of grapes, 
 but they did not yield as usual, for he could get <I>but twenty.</I> 
 This agrees with what we had,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:9"><I>ch.</I> i. 9</A>,

 <I>You looked for much, and it came to little.</I> Note, It is our
 folly that we are apt to raise our expectation from the creature, and 
 to think tomorrow must needs be as this day and much more abundant, but 
 we are commonly disappointed, and the more we expect the more grievous 
 the disappointment is. In the stores and treasures of the new covenant 
 we need not fear being disappointed when we come by faith to draw from 
 them. But this was not all. God did visibly contend with them in the
 weather 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>I smote you with blastings,</I> winds and frosts, which made every 
 green thing to wither, <I>and with mildew,</I> which choked the corn 
 when it was knitting, <I>and with hail,</I> which battered it down and 
 broke it when it had grown to some maturity; thus they were 
 disappointed <I>in all the labour of their hands,</I> while they 
 neglected to lay their hand to the work of God and to labour in that. 
 Note, While we take no care of God's interest we cannot expect he 
 should take care of ours. And, when he thus walks contrary to us, he 
 expects that we should return to him and to our duty. But this people 
 either saw not the hand of God in it (imputing it to chance) or saw not 
 their own sin as the provoking cause of it, and therefore turned not to 
 him. They were a long time incorrigible and unhumbled under these 
 rebukes, so that God's hand was <I>stretched out still,</I> for <I>the 
 people turned not to him that smote them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:12,13">Isa. ix. 12, 13</A>.

 They might easily observe that as long as they continued in neglect of
 the temple work all their affairs went backward. But,

 2. Let them now observe, and they should find that from this day
 forward God would bless them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>):

 "<I>Consider now</I> whether when you begin to change you way towards 
 God you do not find God changing his way towards you; from <I>this 
 day,</I> when you fall to work about the temple, <I>consider it,</I> I 
 say, and you shall find a remarkable turn given for the better to all 
 your affairs. <I>Is the seed yet in the barn?</I> Yes it is, and not 
 yet thrown into the ground. The fruit-trees do not as yet bud, <I>the 
 vine, and the fig-tree, and the olive-tree,</I> have not as <I>yet 
 brought forth,</I> so that nothing appears to promise a good harvest or 
 vintage next year. Nature does not promise it; but now that you begin 
 to apply in good earnest to your duty, the God of nature promises it; 
 he has said, <I>From this day I will bless you.</I> It is the best 
 day's work you ever did in your lives, for hence you may date the 
 return of your prosperity." He does not say what they shall be, but, in 
 general, <I>I will bless you;</I> and those that know what are the 
 fruits flowing from God's blessing know they can desire no more to make 
 them happy. "<I>I will bless you,</I> and then you shall soon recover 
 all your losses, shall thrive as fast as before you went backward; for 
 <I>the blessing of the Lord, that maketh rich,</I> and those <I>whom he 
 blesses are blessed indeed.</I>" Note, When we begin to make conscience 
 of our duty to God we may expect his blessing; and this tree of life is 
 so known by its fruits that one may discern almost to a day a 
 remarkable turn of Providence in favour of those that return in a way 
 of duty; so that they and others may say that <I>from this day they are 
 blessed.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:10">Mal. iii. 10</A>.

 And <I>whoso is wise will observe these things, and understand</I> by
 them <I>the lovingkindness of the Lord.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>20 And again the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto Haggai in the four
 and twentieth <I>day</I> of the month, saying,
 &nbsp; 21 Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake
 the heavens and the earth;
 &nbsp; 22 And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will
 destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I will
 overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the
 horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword
 of his brother.
 &nbsp; 23 In that day, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, will I take thee, O
 Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and
 will make thee as a signet: for I have chosen thee, saith the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 After Haggai's sermon <I>ad populum</I>--<I>to the people,</I> here
 follows one, the same day, <I>ad magistratum</I>--<I>to the
 magistrates,</I> a word directed particularly to <I>Zerubbabel, the 
 governor of Judah,</I> who was a leading active man in this good work 
 which the people now set about, and therefore he shall have some 
 particular marks put upon him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah,</I> speak to him by himself. 
 He has thoughts in his head far above those of the common people, as 
 wise princes are wont to have, who move in a higher and larger sphere 
 than others. The people of the land are in care about their corn-fields 
 and vineyards; God has assured them that they shall prosper, and we 
 hope that will make them easy; but Zerubbabel is concerned about the 
 community and its interests, about the neighbouring nations, and the 
 revolutions of their governments, and what will become of the few and 
 feeble Jews in those changes and convulsions, and how such a poor 
 prince as he is should be able to keep his ground and serve his 
 country. "Go to him," says God, "and tell him it shall be well with him 
 and his remnant, and let that make him easy."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Let him expect to hear of great commotions in the nations of the 
 earth, and let them not be a surprise to him; behold, he is told of 
 them before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>):

 <I>I will shake the heavens and the earth.</I> This he had said before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>),

 and now says it again to Zerubbabel; let him expect shaking times, 
 universal concussions. The world is like the sea, like the wheel, 
 always in motion, but sometimes in a special manner turbulent. But,
 Blessed be God, if the earth be shaken, it is to <I>shake the wicked 
 out of it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:13">Job xxxviii. 13</A>.

 In the apocalyptic visions earthquakes bode no ill to the church. Here
 the heavens and the earth are shaken, that proud oppressors may be 
 broken and brought down: <I>I will overthrow the throne of 
 kingdoms.</I> The Chaldean monarchy, which had been the throne of 
 kingdoms a great while, was already overthrown; and the powers that 
 are, and are yet to come, shall in like manner be overthrown; their day 
 will come to fall.

 1. Though they be ever so powerful, yet the <I>strength of their
 kingdoms</I> shall be destroyed. They <I>trust in chariots and
 horses</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:7">Ps. xx. 7</A>),

 but their <I>chariots</I> shall be <I>overthrown,</I> and <I>those that
 ride in them,</I> so that they shall not be able to attack the people
 of God, whom they persecute, not to escape the judgments of God, which
 persecute them. 

 2. Though there appear none likely to be the instruments of their
 destruction, yet God will bring it about, for they shall be brought 
 down <I>every one by the sword of his brother.</I> This reads the doom 
 of all the enemies of God's church, that will not repent to give him 
 glory; it seems likewise designed as a promise of Christ's victory over 
 the powers of darkness, his overthrow of Satan's throne, that <I>throne 
 of kingdoms,</I> the throne of the god of this world, the taking from 
 him all the armour wherein he trusted and <I>dividing the spoil.</I> 
 And all opposing <I>rule, principality, and power,</I> shall be put 
 down, that the <I>kingdom</I> may be <I>delivered up to God, even the 
 Father.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Let him depend upon it that he shall be safe under the divine 
 protection in the midst of all these commotions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Zerubbabel was active to build God a house, and therefore God makes the 
 same promise to him as he did to David on the like occasion--that he 
 would <I>build him a house,</I> and establish it, even <I>in that 
 day</I> when heaven and earth are shaken. This promise refers to this 
 good man himself and to his family. He honoured God, and God would 
 honour him. His successors likewise in the government of Judah might 
 take encouragement from it; though their authority was very precarious 
 as to men, yet God would confirm it, and this would contribute to the 
 stability of the people over whom God had set them. But this promise 
 has special reference to Christ, who lineally descended from 
 Zerubbabel, and is the sole builder of the gospel-temple. 

 1. Zerubbabel is here owned as <I>God's servant,</I> and it is an
 honourable mention that is hereby made of him, as Moses and David <I>my
 servants.</I> When God destroys his enemies he will prefer his
 servants. Our Lord Jesus is his Father's servant in the work of
 redemption, but faithful as a Son, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:1">Isa. xlii. 1</A>.

 2. He is owned as God's elect: <I>I have chosen thee</I> to this
 office; and whom God makes choice of he will make use of. Our Lord
 Jesus is chosen of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:4">1 Pet. ii. 4</A>.

 And he is the head of the chosen remnant; in him they are chosen. 

 3. It is promised that, being chosen, God will make him <I>as a
 signet.</I> Jeconiah had been as the <I>signet on God's right hand,</I> 
 but was <I>plucked thence</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:24">Jer. xxii. 24</A>);

 and now Zerubbabel is substituted in the room of him. He shall be near
 and dear to God, precious in his sight, and honourable, and his family 
 shall continue till the Messiah spring out of it, who is <I>the signet 
 on God's right hand.</I> This intimates,

 (1.) The delight the Father has in him. In him he once and again 
 declared himself to be <I>well pleased.</I> He is set as a <I>seal upon 
 his heart, a seal upon his arm,</I> is brought near unto him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:13">Dan. vii. 13</A>),
 
 is <I>hidden in the shadow of his hand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:2">Isa. xlix. 2</A>.

 (2.) The dominion the Father has entrusted him with. Princes sign their
 edicts, grants, and commissions, with their signet-rings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+3:10">Esth. iii. 10</A>.
 
 Our Lord Jesus is the signet on God's right hand, for all power is
 given to him and derived from him. By him the great charter of the
 gospel is signed and ratified, and it is in him that all the promises 
 of God are yea and amen.</P>
