 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Prophets were sent to be reprovers, to tell people of their faults, and 
 to warn them of the judgments of God, to which by sin they exposed 
 themselves; so the prophet is employed in this and the following 
 chapters. He is here, as counsel for the King of kings, opening an 
 indictment against the people of Israel, and labouring to convince them 
 of sin, and of their misery and danger because of sin, that he might 
 prevail with them to repent and reform. 

 I. He shows them what were the grounds of God's controversy with them,
 a general prevalency of vice and profaneness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>),

 ignorance and forgetfulness of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>),

 the worldly-mindedness of the priests 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:8">ver. 8</A>),

 drunkenness and uncleanness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:11">ver. 11</A>),

 using divination and witchcraft 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:12">ver. 12</A>),

 offering sacrifice in the high places 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:13">ver. 13</A>),
 
 whoredoms 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:14,18">ver. 14, 18</A>),
 
 and bribery among magistrates, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:18">ver. 18</A>.

 II. He shows them what would be the consequences of God's controversy.
 God would punish them for these things, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:9">ver. 9</A>.

 The whole land should be laid waste 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:3">ver. 3</A>),

 all sorts of people cut off 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:5">ver. 5</A>),
 
 their honour lost 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:7">ver. 7</A>),

 their creature-comforts unsatisfying 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:10">ver. 10</A>),

 and themselves made ashamed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:19">ver. 19</A>.

 And, which is several times mentioned here as the sorest judgment of
 all, they should be let alone in their sins 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:17">ver. 17</A>),

 they shall not reprove one another 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:4">ver. 4</A>),

 God will not punish them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:14">ver. 14</A>),

 nay, he will let them prosper, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:16">ver. 16</A>.

 III. He gives warning to Judah not to tread in the steps of Israel,
 because they saw their steps went down to hell,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Hear the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, ye children of Israel: for the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because
 <I>there is</I> no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.
 &nbsp; 2  By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and
 committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.
 &nbsp; 3  Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth
 therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with
 the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be
 taken away.
 &nbsp; 4  Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people
 <I>are</I> as they that strive with the priest.
 &nbsp; 5  Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also
 shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The court set, and both attendance and attention demanded: "<I>Hear 
 the word of the Lord, you children of Israel,</I> for to you is the 
 word of this conviction sent, whether you will hear or whether you will 
 forbear." Whom may God expect to give him a fair hearing, and take from 
 him a fair warning, but the children of Israel, his own professing 
 people? Yea, they will be ready enough to hear when God speaks 
 comfortably to them; but are they willing to hear when he has a 
 controversy with them? Yes, they must hear him when he pleads against 
 them, when he has something to lay to their charge: <I>The Lord has a 
 controversy with the inhabitants of the land,</I> of this land, of this 
 holy land. Note, Sin is the great mischief-maker; it sows discord 
 between God and Israel. God sees sin in his own people, and a good 
 action he has against them for it. Some more particular actions lie 
 against his own people, which do not lie against other sinners. He has 
 a controversy with them for breaking covenant with him, for bringing a 
 reproach upon him, and for an ungrateful return to him for his favours.
 God's controversy will be pleaded, pleaded by the judgments of his 
 mouth before they are pleaded by the judgments of his hand, that he may 
 be justified in all he does and may make it appear that he desires not 
 the death of sinners; and God's pleadings ought to be attended to, for, 
 sooner or later, they shall have a hearing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The indictment read, by which the whole nation stands charged with 
 crimes of a heinous nature, by which God is highly provoked. 

 1. They are charged with national omissions of the most important
 duties: <I>There is no truth nor mercy,</I> neither justice nor 
 charity, these most <I>weighty matters of the law,</I> as our Saviour 
 accounts them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:23">Matt. xxiii. 23</A>),

 <I>judgment, mercy, and faith.</I> The generality of the people seemed
 to have no sense at all of the thing called honesty; they made no 
 conscience of what they said and did, though ever so contrary to the 
 truth and injurious to their neighbour. Much less had they any sense
 of mercy, or any obligation they were under to pity and help the poor. 
 And it is not strange that there is no truth and mercy when there is 
 <I>no knowledge of God in the land.</I> What good can be expected where 
 there is no knowledge of God? It was the privilege of that land that 
 <I>in Israel God was</I> made <I>known,</I> and his <I>name</I> was 
 <I>great,</I> which was an aggravation of their sin, that they did not 
 <I>know him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:1">Ps. lxxvi. 1</A>.

 2. Hence follows national commissions of the most enormous sins against
 both the first and second table, for they had no regard at all to 
 either. <I>Swearing,</I> and <I>lying,</I> and <I>killing,</I> and 
 <I>stealing,</I> and <I>committing adultery,</I> against the third, 
 ninth, sixth, eighth, and seventh commandments, were to be found in all 
 corners of the land, and among all orders and degrees of men among 
 them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The corruption was universal; what good people there were among them 
 were either lost or hid, or they hid themselves. By these they <I>break 
 out,</I> that is, they transgress all bounds of reason and conscience, 
 and the divine law; <I>they have exceeded</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:9">Job xxxvi. 9</A>);

 they have been <I>overmuch wicked</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:17">Eccl. vii. 17</A>);

 they suffer their corruptions to break out; they themselves break over,
 and break through, all that stands in their way and would stop them in 
 their sinful career, as water overflows the banks. Note, Sin is a 
 violent thing and its power exorbitant; when men's hearts are <I>fully 
 set in them to do evil</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:11">Eccl. viii. 11</A>)
 
 <I>what will be restrained from them?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+11:6">Gen. xi. 6</A>.

 When they break out thus <I>blood touches blood,</I> that is, abundance
 of murders are committed in all parts of the country, and, as it were, 
 in a constant series and succession. <I>C&aelig;des ali&aelig; aliis 
 sunt contigu&aelig;--Murders touch murders;</I> a stream of blood runs 
 down among them, even royal blood. It was about this time that there 
 was so much blood shed in grasping at the crown; Shallum slew 
 Zechariah, and Menahem slew Shallum, Pekah slew Pekahiah, and Hoshea 
 slew Pekah; and the like bloody work, it is likely, there was among 
 other contenders, so that the land was <I>polluted with blood</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:38">Ps. cvi. 38</A>);

 <I>it was filled with blood from one end to the other,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:16">2 Kings xxi. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Sentence passed upon this guilty and polluted land, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 It shall be utterly destroyed and laid waste. The whole land is 
 infected with sin, and therefore <I>the whole land shall mourn</I> 
 under God's sore judgments, shall sit in mourning, being stripped of 
 all its wealth and beauty. As the valleys are said to <I>shout for joy, 
 and sing,</I> when there are plenty and peace, so here they are said to 
 <I>mourn</I> when by war and famine they are made desolate. The 
 <I>whole land shall be brimstone, and salt, and burning,</I> was as 
 threatened in the law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:33">Deut. xxix. 33</A>.

 They had broken all God's commandments, and now God threatens to take
 away all their comforts. The <I>land mourns</I> when there is neither
 <I>grass for the cattle nor herbs for the service of man;</I> and then 
 <I>every one that dwells therein shall languish</I> for want of nice 
 food to support a wasting life, and fret for want of the usual dainties 
 for delight. The <I>beasts of the field</I> will languish, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:5,6">Jer. xiv. 5, 6</A>.

 Nay, the destruction of the fruits of the earth shall be so great that
 there shall not be picking for the <I>fowls of the air,</I> to keep 
 them alive; they shall suffer with man, and their dying, or growing 
 lean, will be a punishment to those who used to have their tables 
 replenished with wild-fowl. Nay, <I>the fishes of the sea shall be 
 taken away,</I> or <I>gathered together,</I> that they may go away in 
 shoals to some other coast, and then the fishing trade will be worth 
 nothing. This desolation shall be in that respect more general than 
 that by Noah's flood, for that did not affect the fishes of the sea, 
 but this shall. It was part of one of the plagues of Egypt that he
 <I>slew their fish</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:29">Ps. cv. 29</A>);
 
 when the waters are dried the <I>fish die,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:2,Zep+1:2,3">Isa. l. 2; Zeph. i. 2, 3</A>.

 Note, When man becomes disobedient to God, it is just that the inferior
 creatures should be made unserviceable to man. Oh what reason have we 
 to admire God's patience and mercy to our land, that though there is in 
 it so much swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and 
 adultery, yet there is plenty of flesh, and fish, and fowl, on our 
 tables!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. An order of court that no pains should be taken with the condemned 
 criminal to bring him to repentance, with the reason for that order. 
 Observe, 
 
 1. The order itself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Yet let no man strive nor reprove another;</I> let no means be used 
 to reduce and reclaim them; let their physicians give them up as 
 desperate and past cure. It intimates that as long as there is any hope 
 we ought to reprove sinners for their sins; it is a duty we owe to one 
 another to give and to take reproofs; it was one of the laws of Moses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:17">Lev. xix. 17</A>),

 <I>Thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour;</I> it is an instance 
 of brotherly love. Sometimes there is need to rebuke sharply, not only 
 to reprove, but to strive, so loth are men to part with their sins. But 
 it is a sign that persons and people are abandoned to ruin when God 
 says, <I>Let them not be reproved.</I> Yet this is to be understood as 
 God's commands sometimes to the prophets not to <I>pray for them,</I> 
 notwithstanding which they did pray for them; but the meaning is, They 
 are so hardened in sin, and so ripened for ruin, that it will be to 
 little purpose either to deal with them or to deal with God for them.
 Note, It bodes ill to a people when reprovers are silenced, and when 
 those who should witness against the sins of the times, retire into a 
 corner, and give up the cause. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:16">2 Chron. xxv. 16</A>.

 2. The reasons of this order. Let them not reprove one another; for,

 (1.) They are determined to <I>go on in sin,</I> and no reproofs will 
 cure them of that: <I>Thy people are as those that strive with the 
 priests;</I> they have grown so very impudent in sin, so very insolent, 
 and impatient of reproof, that they will fly in the face even of a 
 priest himself if he should but give them the least check, without any 
 regard to his character and office; and how then can it be thought that 
 they should take a reproof from a private person? Note, Those sinners 
 have their hearts wickedly hardened who quarrel with their ministers 
 for dealing faithfully with them; and those who rebel against 
 ministerial reproof, which is an ordinance of God for their 
 reformation, have forfeited the benefit of brotherly reproof too.
 Perhaps this may refer to the late wickedness of Joash king of Judah, 
 and his people, who stoned Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada, for 
 delivering them a message from God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:21">2 Chron. xxiv. 21</A>.

 He was a <I>priest;</I> with him they <I>strove</I> when he was 
 officiating <I>between the temple and the altar;</I> and Dr. Lightfoot
 thinks the prophet had an eye to his case when he spoke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)

 of <I>blood touching blood;</I> the blood of the <I>sacrificer was
 mingled with the blood of the sacrifice,</I> That, says he, was the 
 <I>apex</I> of <I>their wickedness</I>--thence their ruin was to be 
 dated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:35">Matt. xxiii. 35</A>),

 as this is of <I>their incorrigibleness,</I> that they are as those who 
 <I>strive with the priest,</I> therefore let no man reprove them; for,

 (2.) God also is determined to <I>proceed in their ruin</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>Therefore,</I> because thou wilt take no reproof, no advice, 
 <I>thou shalt fall,</I> and it is in vain for any to think of 
 preventing it, for the <I>decree</I> has <I>gone forth.</I> Thou shalt 
 stumble and <I>fall in the day,</I> and <I>the prophet,</I> the false 
 prophet that flattered and seduced thee, shall <I>fall with thee in the 
 night;</I> both thou and thy prophet shall fall <I>night and day,</I> 
 shall be continually falling into one calamity or other; the darkness 
 of the night shall not help to cover thee from trouble nor the light of 
 the day help thee to flee from it." The prophets are blind leaders and 
 the people blind followers; and to the blind day and night are alike, 
 so that whether it be day or night both shall <I>fall together into the 
 ditch.</I> "Thou shalt fall <I>in the day,</I> when thy fall is least 
 feared by thyself and thou art very <I>secure;</I> and <I>in the 
 day,</I> when it will be seen and observed by others, and turn most to 
 thy shame; and the prophet shall <I>fall in the night,</I> when to 
 himself it will be most terrible." Note, The ruin of those who have 
 helped to ruin others will, in a special manner, be intolerable. And
 did the children think that when they were in danger of falling their 
 mother would help them? It shall be in vain to expect it, for <I>I will 
 destroy thy mother,</I> Samaria, the mother-city, the whole 
 <I>state,</I> or <I>kingdom,</I> which is as a mother to every part. It 
 shall all be <I>made silent.</I> Note, When all are involved in guilt 
 nothing less can be expected than that all should be involved in 
 ruin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou
 hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt
 be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy
 God, I will also forget thy children.
 &nbsp; 7  As they were increased, so they sinned against me:
 <I>therefore</I> will I change their glory into shame.
 &nbsp; 8  They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on
 their iniquity.
 &nbsp; 9  And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will
 punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.
 &nbsp; 10  For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit
 whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to
 take heed to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 11  Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God is here proceeding in his controversy both with the priests and 
 with the people. <I>The people</I> were as those <I>that strove with 
 the priests</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)

 when they had priests that did their duty; but the generality of them 
 lived in the neglect of their duty, and here is a word for those 
 priests, and for the people that love to have it so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:31">Jer. v. 31</A>.

 And it is observable here how the punishment answers to the sin, and
 how, for the justifying of his own proceedings, God sets the one 
 over-against the other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The people <I>strove with the priests</I> that should have taught 
 them the knowledge of God; justly therefore were they <I>destroyed for 
 lack of knowledge,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Note, Those that rebel against the light can expect no other than to 
 perish in the dark. Or it is a charge upon the priests, who should have 
 been still <I>teaching the people knowledge</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:9">Eccl. xii. 9</A>),

 but they did not, or did it in such a manner that it was as if they had
 not done it at all, so there was <I>no knowledge of God in the 
 land;</I> and because there was no vision, or none to any purpose, the 
 people <I>perished,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+29:18">Prov. xxix. 18</A>.

 Note, Ignorance is so far from being the mother of devotion that it is 
 the mother of destruction; lack of knowledge is ruining to any person 
 or people. They are <I>my people</I> that are thus <I>destroyed;</I> 
 their relation to God as his people aggravates both their sin in not 
 taking pains to get the knowledge of that God whose command they were 
 under and with whom they were taken into covenant, and likewise the sin 
 of those who should have taught them; God set his children to school to 
 them, and they never minded them nor took any pains with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Both priests and people rejected knowledge; and justly therefore 
 will God <I>reject them.</I> The reason why the people did not learn, 
 and the priests did not teach, was not because they had not the light, 
 but because they hated it--not because they had not ways of coming to
 the knowledge of God and of communicating it, but because they had no 
 heart to it; they <I>rejected</I> it. They <I>desired not the knowledge 
 of God's ways,</I> but put it from them, and shut their eyes against 
 the light; and therefore "<I>I will also reject thee;</I> I will refuse 
 to take cognizance of thee and to own thee; you will not know me, but 
 bid me <I>depart;</I> I will therefore say, <I>Depart from me, I know 
 you not. Thou</I> shalt be <I>no priest to me.</I>" 

 1. The priests shall be no longer admitted to the privileges, or
 employed in the services, of the priesthood, nor shall they ever be 
 received again, as we find, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:13">Ezek. xliv. 13</A>.

 Note, Ministers that reject knowledge, that are grossly ignorant and
 scandalous, ought not to be owned as ministers; but that which they 
 <I>seem to have</I> should be <I>taken away,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:18">Luke viii. 18</A>.

 2. The people shall be no longer as they have been, a <I>kingdom of 
 priests,</I> a royal priesthood, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:6">Exod. xix. 6</A>.

 God's people, by rejecting knowledge, forfeit their honour and profane
 their own crown.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They <I>forgot the law of God,</I> neither desired nor endeavoured 
 to retain it in mind, nor to transmit the remembrance of it to their 
 posterity, and therefore justly will God <I>forget</I> them and 
 <I>their children,</I> the people's children; they did not educate 
 them, as they ought to have done, in the knowledge of God and their 
 duty to him, and therefore God will disown them, as not in covenant 
 with him. Note, If parents do not teach their children, when they are 
 young, to <I>remember their Creator,</I> they cannot expect that their 
 Creator should remember them. Or it may be meant of the priests' 
 children; they shall not succeed them in the priests' office, but shall 
 be reduced to poverty, as is threatened against Eli's house, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:20">1 Sam. ii. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. They dishonoured God with that which was their honour, and justly 
 therefore will God strip them of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 It was their honour that they were increased in number, wealth, power, 
 and dignity. The beginning of their nation was small, but in process of 
 time it <I>greatly increased,</I> and grew very considerable; the 
 family of the priests increased wonderfully. But, <I>as they were 
 increased, so they sinned</I> against God. The more populous the nation 
 grew, the more sin was committed and the more profane they were; their 
 wealth, honour, and power, did but make them the more daring in sin. 
 Therefore, says God, <I>will I change their glory into shame.</I> Are 
 their numbers their glory? God will diminish them and make them few. Is 
 their wealth their glory? God will impoverish them and bring them low; 
 so that they shall themselves be ashamed of that which they gloried in. 
 Their priests shall be made <I>contemptible and base,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:9">Mal. ii. 9</A>.
 
 Note, That which is our honour, if we dishonour God with it, will
 sooner or later be turned into shame to us: for <I>those that despise 
 God shall be lightly esteemed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:30">1 Sam. ii. 30</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The priests ate up the sin of God's people, and therefore <I>they 
 shall eat and not have enough.</I> 

 1. They abused the maintenance that was allowed to the priests, to the
 priests of the house of Aaron, by the law of God, and to the 
 mock-priests of the calves by their constitution

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>They eat up the sin of my people,</I> that is, their sin-offerings. 
 If it be meant of the priests of the calves, it intimates their seizing 
 that which they had no right to; they usurped the revenues of the 
 priests, though they were no priests. If it be meant of those who were 
 legal priests, it intimates their greediness of the profits and 
 perquisites of their office, when they took no care at all to do the 
 duty of it. They feasted upon their part of the offerings of the Lord, 
 but forgot the work for which they were so well paid. They <I>set their 
 heart</I> upon the people's <I>iniquities;</I> they <I>lifted up their 
 soul</I> to them, that is, they were glad then people did commit 
 iniquity, that they might be obliged to bring an offering to make 
 atonement for it, which they should have their share of; the more sins 
 the more sacrifices, and therefore they cared not how much sin people 
 were guilty of. Instead of warning the people against sin, from the 
 consideration of the sacrifices, which showed them what an offence sin 
 was to God, since it needed such an expiation, they emboldened and 
 encouraged the people to sin, since an atonement might be made at so 
 small an expense. Thus they glutted themselves upon the sins of the 
 people, and helped to keep up that which they should have beaten down. 
 Note, It is a very wicked thing to be well pleased with the sins of 
 others because, in some way or other, they may turn to our advantage. 
 
 2. God will therefore deny them his blessing upon their maintenance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>They shall eat and not have enough.</I> Though they have great 
 plenty by the abundance of offerings that are brought in, yet they 
 shall have no satisfaction in it. Either their food shall yield no good 
 nourishment or their greedy appetites shall not be satisfied with it.
 Note, What is unlawfully gained cannot be comfortably used; no, nor 
 that which is inordinately coveted; it is just that the desires which 
 are insatiable should always be unsatisfied, and that those should 
 never have enough who never know when they have enough. See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:14,Hag+1:6">Mic. vi. 14; Hag. i. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The more they increased the more they sinned 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 and therefore though they <I>commit whoredom,</I> though they take the 
 most wicked methods to multiply their people, yet <I>they shall not 
 increase.</I> Though they have many wives and concubines, as Solomon 
 had, yet they shall not have their families built up thereby in a 
 numerous progeny, any more than he had. Note, Those that hope any way 
 to increase by unlawful means will be disappointed. And therefore God 
 will thus blast all their projects <I>because they have left off to 
 take heed to the Lord;</I> time was when they had some regard to God, 
 and to his authority over them and interest in them, but they have 
 <I>left it off;</I> they take no heed to his word nor to his 
 providences; they do not eye him in either. They <I>forsake him, so as 
 not to take heed to him;</I> they have apostatized to such a degree 
 that they have no manner of regard to God, but are perfectly <I>without 
 God in the world.</I> Note, Those that leave off to take heed to the 
 Lord leave off all good, and can expect no other than that all good 
 should leave them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The people and the priests did harden one another in sin; and 
 therefore justly shall they be sharers in the punishment 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>There shall be, like people, like priest.</I> So they were in 
 character; people and priest were both alike ignorant and profane, 
 regardless of God and their duty, and addicted to idolatry: and so they 
 shall be in condition; God will bring judgments upon them, that shall 
 be the destruction both of priest and people; the famine that deprives 
 the people of their meat shall deprive the priests of their 
 <I>meat-offerings,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:9">Joel i. 9</A>.

 It is part of the description of a universal desolation that it shall
 be <I>as with the people, so with the priest,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:2">Isa. xxiv. 2</A>.

 God's judgments, when they come with commission, will make no
 difference. Note, Sharers in sin must expect to be sharers in ruin. 
 Thus God will <I>punish them</I> both <I>for their ways,</I> and 
 <I>reward them for their doings.</I> God will <I>cause their doings to 
 return upon them</I> (so the word is); when a sin is committed the 
 sinner thinks <I>it is gone</I> and he shall hear no more of it, but he 
 shall find it <I>called over again,</I> and made to <I>return,</I> 
 either to his humiliation or to his condemnation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. They indulged themselves in the delights of sense, to hold up 
 their hearts; but they shall find that they <I>take away their 
 hearts</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>Whoredom, and wine, and new wine take away the heart.</I> Some join 
 this with the foregoing words. <I>They have forsaken the Lord,</I> to
 <I>take heed to whoredom, and wine, and new wine.</I> Or, 
 <I>Because</I> these <I>have taken away their heart.</I> Their sensual 
 pleasures have taken them off from their devotions and drowned all that 
 is good in them. Or we may take it as a distinct sentence, containing a 
 great truth which we see confirmed by every day's experience, that 
 drunkenness and uncleanness are sins which besot and infatuate men, 
 weaken and enfeeble them. They take away both the understanding and the 
 courage.</P>

 &nbsp; 13  They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have, as before,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The sins charged upon the people of Israel, for which God had a 
 controversy with them, and they are,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Spiritual whoredom, or idolatry. They have in them a <I>spirit of 
 whoredoms,</I> a strong inclination to that sin; the bent and bias of 
 their hearts are that way; it is <I>their own iniquity;</I> they are 
 carried out towards it with an unaccountable violence, and this 
 <I>causes them to err.</I> Note, The errors and mistakes of the 
 judgment are commonly owing to the corrupt affections; men 
 <I>therefore</I> have a good opinion of sin, because they have a 
 disposition towards it. And having such erroneous notions of idols, and 
 such passionate motions towards them, no marvel that with such a head 
 and such a heart they have <I>gone a whoring from under their God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 They ought to have been in subjection to him as their head and husband, 
 to have been under his guidance and command, but they revolted from 
 their allegiance, and put themselves under the guidance and protection 
 of false gods. So 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 Israel has <I>played the harlot;</I> their conduct in the worship of 
 their idols was like that of a harlot, wanton and impudent. And 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 <I>Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer,</I> as an 
 <I>untamed</I> heifer (so some), or as a <I>perverse</I> or 
 <I>refractory</I> one (so others), as a heifer that is turned loose 
 runs madly about the pasture, or, if put under the yoke (which seems 
 rather to be alluded to here), will draw back instead of going forward, 
 will struggle to get her neck out of the yoke and her feet out of the 
 furrow. Thus unruly, ungovernable, untractable, were the people of 
 Israel. They had begun to draw in the yoke of God's ordinances, but 
 they drew back, as <I>children of Belial,</I> that will not endure the 
 yoke; and when the prophets were sent with the goads of reproof, to put 
 them forward, they <I>kicked against the pricks,</I> and ran backwards.
 The sum of all is 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 <I>Ephraim is joined to idols,</I> is perfectly wedded to them; his 
 affections are glued to them, and his heart is upon them. There are two 
 instances given of their spiritual whoredom, in both which they gave 
 that honour to their idols which is due to God only:--

 (1.) They consulted them as oracles, and used those arts of divination 
 which they had learned from their idolatrous priests

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>My people ask counsel at their stocks,</I> their wooden gods; they 
 apply to them for advice and direction in what they should do and for 
 information concerning the event. They <I>say to a stock, Thou art my 
 father</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:27">Jer. ii. 27</A>);

 and, if it were indeed a father, it were worthy of this honour; but it
 was a great affront to God, who was indeed their Father, and whose 
 lively oracles they had among them, with which they had liberty to 
 consult at any time, thus to <I>ask counsel at their stocks.</I> And 
 they expect that their <I>staff</I> should <I>declare to them</I> what 
 course they should take and what the event should be. It is probable
 that this refers to some wicked methods of divination used among the 
 Gentiles, and which the Jews learned from them, by a <I>piece of 
 wood,</I> or by <I>a staff,</I> like Nebuchadnezzar's divining by 
 <I>his arrows,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:21">Ezek. xxi. 21</A>.

 Note, Those who forsake the oracles of God, to take their measures from
 the world and the flesh, do in effect but consult with their stocks and 
 their staves.

 (2.) They offered sacrifice to them as gods, whose favour they wanted 
 and whose wrath they dreaded and deprecated

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>They sacrifice to them,</I> to atone and pacify them, and <I>burn 
 incense</I> to them, to please and gratify them, and hope by both to 
 recommend themselves to them. God had pitched upon the place where he 
 would record his name; but they, having forsaken that, chose places for 
 their irreligious rites which pleased their own fancies; they chose,

 [1.] High places, <I>upon the tops of the mountains</I> and <I>upon the 
 hills,</I> foolishly imagining that the height of the ground gave them 
 some advantage in their approaches towards heaven.

 [2.] Shady places, <I>under oaks, and poplars, and elms, because the 
 shadow thereof</I> is pleasant to them, especially in those hot 
 countries, and therefore they thought it was pleasing to their gods; or 
 they fancied that a thick shade befriends contemplation, possesses the 
 mind with something of awe, and therefore is proper for devotion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Corporal whoredom is another crime here charged upon them: <I>They 
 have committed whoredom continually,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 They drove a trade of uncleanness; it was not a single act now and 
 then, but their constant practice, as it is of many that have <I>eyes 
 full of adultery</I> and <I>which cannot cease from</I> that 
 <I>sin,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:14">2 Pet. ii. 14</A>.

 Now the abominable filthiness and lewdness that was found in Israel is
 here spoken of,

 (1.) As a concomitant of their idolatry; their false gods drew them to 
 it; for the devil whom they worshipped, though a spirit, is an unclean 
 spirit. Those that worshipped idols were <I>separated with harlots,</I> 
 and they <I>sacrificed with harlots;</I> for because they <I>liked not 
 to retain God in their knowledge,</I> but dishonoured him, therefore 
 God <I>gave them up to vile affections,</I> by the indulging of which 
 they <I>dishonoured themselves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:24,28">Rom. i. 24, 28</A>.

 (2.) As a punishment of it. The <I>men</I> that worshipped idols were 
 <I>separated with harlots</I> that attended the idolatrous rites, as in 
 the worship of <I>Baal-peor,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:1,2">Num. xxv. 1, 2</A>.

 To punish them for that God gave up their wives and daughters to the 
 like vile affections: They <I>committed whoredom and adultery</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 which could not but be a great grief and reproach to their husbands and 
 parents; for those that are not chaste themselves desire to have their 
 wives and daughters so. But thus they might read their sin in their 
 punishment, as David's adultery was punished in the debauching of his 
 concubines by his own son, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:11">2 Sam. xii. 11</A>.

 Note, When the same sin in others is made men's grief and affliction
 which they have themselves been guilty of they must own that the Lord 
 is righteous.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The perverting of justice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 <I>Their rulers</I> (be it spoken to their shame) <I>do love, Give 
 ye,</I> that is, they love bribes, and have it continually in their 
 mouths, <I>Give, give.</I> They are given to <I>filthy lucre;</I> every 
 one that has any business with them must expect to be asked, What will 
 you give? Though, as rulers, they are bound by office to do justice, 
 yet none can have justice done them without a fee; and you may be sure 
 that for a fee they will do injustice. Note, The love of money is the 
 ruin of equity and the root of all iniquity. But of all men it is a 
 shame for rulers (who should be men <I>fearing God</I> and <I>hating 
 covetousness</I>) to love <I>Give ye.</I> Perhaps this is intended in 
 that part of the charge here, <I>Their drink is sour;</I> it is 
 <I>dead;</I> it is <I>gone.</I> Justice, duly administered, is 
 refreshing, like drink to the thirsty, but when it is perverted, and 
 rulers take rewards either to acquit the guilty or to condemn the 
 innocent, the <I>drink is sour;</I> they <I>turn judgment into 
 wormwood,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:7">Amos v. 7</A>.

 Or it may refer in general to the depraved morals of the whole nation;
 they had lost all their life and spirit, and were as offensive to God 
 as dead and sour drink is to us. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:32,33">Deut. xxxi. 32, 33</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The tokens of God's wrath against them for their sins. 

 1. Their wives and daughters should not be punished for the injury and
 disgrace they did to their families

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>I will not punish your daughters;</I> and, not being punished for 
 their sin, they would go on in it. Note, The impunity of one sinner is 
 sometimes made the punishment of another. Or, "<I>I will not punish</I> 
 them as I will punish you; for you must own, as Judah did concerning 
 his daughter-in-law, that <I>they are more righteous than you,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+38:26">Gen. xxxviii. 26</A>.

 2. They themselves should prosper for a while, but their prosperity
 should help to destroy them. It comes in as a token of God's wrath

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>The Lord will feed them as a lamb in a large place;</I> they shall
 have a fat pasture, and a large one, in which they shall be fed to the 
 full, and fed of the best, but it shall be only to prepare them for the 
 slaughter, as a lamb is that is so fed. If they <I>wax fat and 
 kick,</I> they do but wax fat for the butcher. But others make them 
 feed as <I>a lamb on the common,</I> a large place indeed, but where it 
 has short grass and lies exposed. The Shepherd of Israel will turn them 
 both out of his pastures and out of his protection. 

 3. No means should be used to bring them to repentance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 "<I>Ephraim is joined to idols,</I> is in love with them and addicted 
 to them, and therefore <I>let him alone,</I> as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>,

 <I>Let no man reprove</I> him. Let him be given up to <I>his own 
 heart's lusts,</I> and walk <I>in his own counsel;</I> we <I>would have 
 healed</I> him, and he <I>would not be healed,</I> therefore 
 <I>forsake</I> him," See <I>what their end will be,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:20">Deut. xxxii. 20</A>.
 
 Note, It is a sad and sore judgment for any man to be let alone in sin,
 for God to say concerning a sinner, "He is joined to his idols, the 
 world and the flesh; he is incurably proud, covetous, or profane, an 
 incurable drunkard or adulterer; <I>let him alone;</I> conscience, let 
 him alone; minister, let him alone; providences, let him alone. Let 
 nothing awaken him till the flames of hell do it." The father corrects 
 not the rebellious son any more when he determines to disinherit him.
 "Those that are not disturbed in their sin will be destroyed for their 
 sin." 
 
 4. They should be hurried away with a swift and shameful
 destruction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>The wind has bound her up in her wings,</I> to carry her away into 
 captivity, suddenly, violently, and irresistibly; he shall take <I>them 
 away as with a whirlwind,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:9">Ps. lviii. 9</A>.

 And then <I>they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices,</I>
 ashamed of their sin in offering sacrifice to idols, ashamed of their 
 folly in putting themselves to such an expense upon gods that have no 
 power to help them, and thereby making that God their enemy who has 
 almighty power to destroy them. Note, There are sacrifices that men 
 will one day be ashamed of. Those that have sacrificed their time, 
 strength, honour, and all their comforts, to the world and the flesh, 
 will shortly be ashamed of it. Yea, and those that bring to God blind, 
 and lame, and heartless sacrifices, will be ashamed of them too.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The warning given to Judah not to sin after the similitude of 
 Israel's transgression. It is said in the close of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>,

 <I>Those that do not understand shall fall;</I> those must needs fall 
 that do not understand how to avoid, or get over, the stumbling-blocks 
 they meet with (and therefore <I>let him that thinks he stands take 
 heed lest he fall</I>), particularly the two tribes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend.</I> 
 Though Israel be given to idolatry, yet let not Judah take the 
 infection. Now, 

 1. This was a very needful caution. The men of Israel were brethren,
 and near neighbours, to the men of Judah; Israel was more numerous, and 
 at this time in a prosperous condition, and therefore there was danger 
 lest the men of Judah should learn their way and get a snare to their 
 souls. Note, The nearer we are to the infection of sin the more need
 we have to stand upon our guard. 

 2. It was a very rational caution: "<I>Let Israel play the harlot,</I> 
 yet let not Judah do so; for Judah has greater means of knowledge than 
 Israel, has the temple and priesthood, and a king of the house of 
 David; from Judah Shiloh is to come; and for Judah God has reserved 
 great blessings in store; therefore <I>let not Judah offend,</I> for 
 more is expected from them than from Israel, they will have more to 
 answer for if they do offend, and from them God will take it more 
 unkindly. If <I>Israel play the harlot,</I> let not Judah do so too, 
 for then God will have no professing people in the world." God bespeaks 
 Judah here, as Christ does the twelve, when many turned their backs 
 upon him, <I>Will you also go away?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:67">John vi. 67</A>.

 Note, Those that have hitherto kept their integrity should, for that
 reason, still hold it fast, even in times of general apostasy. Now, to 
 preserve Judah from offending as Israel had done, two rules are here 
 given:--

 (1.) That they might not be guilty of idolatry they must keep at a 
 distance from the places of idolatry: <I>Come not you unto Gilgal,</I> 
 where <I>all their wickedness was</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:15,12:11"><I>ch.</I> ix. 15; xii. 11</A>);

 there they <I>multiplied transgression</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+4:4">Amos iv. 4</A>);

 and perhaps they contracted a veneration for that place because there
 it was said to Joshua, The place <I>where thou standest is holy 
 ground</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+5:15">Josh. v. 15</A>);

 therefore they are forbidden to <I>enter into Gilgal,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:5">Amos v. 5</A>.

 And for the same reason they must <I>not go up to Bethel,</I> here
 called the <I>house of vanity,</I> for so <I>Bethaven</I> signifies, 
 not the <I>house of God,</I> as <I>Bethel</I> signifies. Note, Those 
 that would be kept from sin, and not fall into the devil's hands, must 
 studiously avoid the occasions of sin and not come upon the devil's 
 ground.

 (2.) That they might not be guilty of idolatry they must take heed of 
 profaneness, and <I>not swear, The Lord liveth.</I> They are commanded 
 to swear, <I>The Lord liveth in truth and righteousness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:2">Jer. iv. 2</A>);
 
 and therefore that which is here forbidden is swearing so in untruth
 and unrighteousness, swearing rashly and lightly, or falsely and with 
 deceit, or swearing by the Lord and the idol, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:5">Zeph. i. 5</A>.

 Note, Those that would be steady in their adherence to God must possess
 themselves with an awe and reverence of God, and always speak of him 
 with solemnity and seriousness; for those that can make a jest of the 
 true God will make a god of any thing.</P>
