 The prophet Isaiah is, in this and the three following chapters, an 
 historian; for the scripture history, as well as the scripture 
 prophecy, is given by inspiration of God, and was dictated to holy men. 
 Many of the prophecies of the foregoing chapters had their 
 accomplishment in Sennacherib's invading Judah and besieging Jerusalem, 
 and the miraculous defeat he met with there; and therefore the story of 
 this is here inserted, both for the explication and for the 
 confirmation of the prophecy. The key of prophecy is to be found in 
 history; and here, that we might have the readier entrance, it is, as 
 it were, hung at the door. The exact fulfilling of this prophecy might 
 serve to confirm the faith of God's people in the other prophecies, the 
 accomplishment of which was at a greater distance. Whether this story 
 was taken from the book of the Kings and added here, or whether it was 
 first written by Isaiah here and hence taken into the book of Kings, is 
 not material. But the story is the same almost verbatim; and it was so 
 memorable an event that it was well worthy to be twice recorded, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:1-19:37">2 Kings xviii. and xix.</A>,

 and here, and an abridgment of it likewise,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:1-33">2 Chron. xxxii.</A>

 We shall be but short in our observations upon this story here, having
 largely explained it there. In this chapter we have, 

 I. The descent which the king of Assyria made upon Judah, and his 
 success against all the defenced cities, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+36:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. The conference he desired to have with Hezekiah, and the managers 
 on both sides, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+36:2,3">ver. 2, 3</A>.

 III. Rabshakeh's railing blasphemous speech, with which he designed to 
 frighten Hezekiah into a submission, and persuade him to surrender at 
 discretion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+36:4-10">ver. 4-10</A>.

 IV. His appeal to the people, and his attempt to persuade them to 
 desert Hezekiah, and so force him to surrender, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+36:11-20">ver. 11-20</A>.

 V. The report of this made to Hezekiah by his agents, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+36:21,22">ver. 21, 22</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah,
 <I>that</I> Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the
 defenced cities of Judah, and took them.
 &nbsp; 2  And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to
 Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by
 the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's
 field.
 &nbsp; 3  Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, which was
 over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the
 recorder.
 &nbsp; 4  And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus
 saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence <I>is</I>
 this wherein thou trustest?
 &nbsp; 5  I say, <I>sayest thou,</I> (but <I>they are but</I> vain words) <I>I
 have</I> counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust,
 that thou rebellest against me?
 &nbsp; 6  Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt;
 whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it:
 so <I>is</I> Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.
 &nbsp; 7  But if thou say to me, We trust in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God: <I>is it</I>
 not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken
 away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before
 this altar?
 &nbsp; 8  Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the
 king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if
 thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.
 &nbsp; 9  How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the
 least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for
 chariots and for horsemen?
 &nbsp; 10  And am I now come up without the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> against this land to
 destroy it? the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto me, Go up against this land, and
 destroy it.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We shall here only observe some practical lessons. 

 1. A people may be in the way of their duty and yet meet with trouble
 and distress. Hezekiah was reforming, and his people were in some
 measure reformed; and yet their country is at that time invaded and a 
 great part of it laid waste. Perhaps they began to grow remiss and cool 
 in the work of reformation, were doing it by halves, and ready to sit 
 down short of a thorough reformation; and then God visited them with 
 this judgment, to put life into them and that good cause. We must not 
 wonder if, when we are doing well, God sends afflictions to quicken us 
 to do better, to do our best, and to press forward towards perfection. 
 
 2. That we must never be secure of the continuance of our peace in this
 world, nor think our mountain stands so strong that it cannot be moved. 
 Hezekiah was not only a pious king, but prudent, both in his 
 administration at home and in his treaties abroad. His affairs were in 
 a good posture, and he seemed particularly to be upon good terms with 
 the king of Assyria, for he had lately made his peace with him by a 
 rich present

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:14">2 Kings xviii. 14</A>),

 and yet that perfidious prince pours an army into his country all of a
 sudden and lays it waste. It is good for us therefore always to keep up 
 an expectation of trouble, that, when it comes, it may be no surprise 
 to us, and then it will be the less a terror. 

 3. God sometimes permits the enemies of his people, even those that are
 most impious and treacherous, to prevail far against them. The king of 
 Assyria took all, or most, of the defenced cities of Judah, and then 
 the country would of course be an easy prey to him. Wickedness may 
 prosper awhile, but cannot prosper always. 

 4. Proud men love to talk big, to boast of what they are, and have, and
 have done, nay and of what they will do, to insult over others, and set 
 all mankind at defiance, though thereby they render themselves 
 ridiculous to all wise men and obnoxious to the wrath of that God who 
 resists the proud. But thus they think to make themselves feared, 
 though they make themselves hated, and to carry their point by <I>great 
 swelling words</I> of vanity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:16">Jude 16</A>.

 5. The enemies of God's people endeavour to conquer them by frightening
 them, especially by frightening them from their confidence in God. Thus 
 Rabshakeh here, with noise and banter, runs down Hezekiah as utterly 
 unable to cope with his master, or in the least to make head against 
 him. It concerns us therefore, that we may keep our ground against the 
 enemies of our souls, to keep up our spirits by keeping up our hope in 
 God. 

 6. It is acknowledged, on all hands, that those who forsake God's
 service forfeit his protection. If that had been true which Rabshakeh 
 alleged, that Hezekiah had thrown down God's altars, he might justly 
 infer that he could not with any assurance trust in him for succour and 
 relief,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+36:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>,

 We may say thus to presuming sinners, who say that they trust in the
 Lord and in his mercy. Is not this he whose commandments they have 
 lived in the contempt of, whose name they have dishonoured, and whose 
 ordinances they have slighted? How then can they expect to find favour 
 with him?

 7. It is an easy thing, and very common, for those that persecute the
 church and people of God to pretend a commission from him for so doing.
 Rabshakeh could say, <I>Have I now come up without the Lord?</I> when 
 really he had come up <I>against</I> the Lord,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:28"><I>ch.</I> xxxvii. 28</A>.

 Those that kill the servants of the Lord think they do him service and
 say, <I>Let the Lord be glorified.</I> But, sooner or later, they will 
 be made to know their error to their cost, to their confusion.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak,
 I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we
 understand <I>it:</I> and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in
 the ears of the people that <I>are</I> on the wall.
 &nbsp; 12  But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and
 to thee to speak these words? <I>hath he</I> not <I>sent me</I> to the men
 that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and
 drink their own piss with you?
 &nbsp; 13  Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the
 Jews' language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king,
 the king of Assyria.
 &nbsp; 14  Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he
 shall not be able to deliver you.
 &nbsp; 15  Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, saying, The
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered
 into the hand of the king of Assyria.
 &nbsp; 16  Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria,
 Make <I>an agreement</I> with me <I>by</I> a present, and come out to me:
 and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree,
 and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;
 &nbsp; 17  Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land,
 a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
 &nbsp; 18  <I>Beware</I> lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will
 deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his
 land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
 &nbsp; 19  Where <I>are</I> the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where <I>are</I> the
 gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my
 hand?
 &nbsp; 20  Who <I>are they</I> among all the gods of these lands, that have
 delivered their land out of my hand, that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> should deliver
 Jerusalem out of my hand?
 &nbsp; 21  But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for
 the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
 &nbsp; 22  Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that <I>was</I> over the
 household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the
 recorder, to Hezekiah with <I>their</I> clothes rent, and told him the
 words of Rabshakeh.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may hence learn these lessons:--

 1. That, while princes and counsellors have public matters under
 debate, it is not fair to appeal to the people. It was a reasonable 
 motion which Hezekiah's plenipotentiaries made, that this parley should 
 be held in a language which the people did not understand

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+36:36"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 because reasons of state are secret things and ought to be kept secret, 
 the vulgar being incompetent judges of them. It is therefore an unfair 
 practice, and not doing as men would be done by, to incense subjects 
 against their rulers by base insinuations. 

 2. Proud and haughty scorners, the fairer they are spoken to, commonly 
 speak the fouler. Nothing could be said more mildly and respectfully
 than that which Hezekiah's agents said to Rabshakeh. Besides that the 
 thing itself was just which they desired, they called themselves his 
 <I>servants,</I> they petitioned for it: <I>Speak, we pray thee;</I> 
 but this made him the more spiteful and imperious. To give rough 
 answers to those who give us soft answers is one way of rendering evil 
 for good; and those are wicked indeed, and it is to be feared 
 incurable, with whom that which usually turns away wrath does but make 
 bad worse. 

 3. When Satan would tempt men from trusting in God, and cleaving to
 him, he does so by insinuating that in yielding to him they may better 
 their condition; but it is a false suggestion, and grossly absurd, and 
 therefore to be rejected with the utmost abhorrence. When the world and 
 the flesh say to us, "<I>Make an agreement</I> with us <I>and come out 
 to us,</I> submit to our dominion and come into our interests, and 
 <I>you shall eat every one of his own vine,</I>" they do but deceive 
 us, promising liberty when they would lead us into the basest captivity 
 and slavery. One might as well take Rabshakeh's word as theirs for
 kind usage and fair quarter; therefore, <I>when they speak fair, 
 believe them not.</I> Let them say what they will, there is no land 
 like the land of promise, the holy land. 

 4. Nothing can be more absurd in itself, nor a greater affront to the
 true and living God, than to compare him with the gods of the heathen; 
 as if he could do no more for the protection of his worshippers than 
 they can for the protection of theirs, and as if the God of Israel 
 could as easily be mastered as the gods of Hamath and Arphad, whereas 
 they are vanity and a lie. They are nothing; he is the great <I>I 
 AM:</I> they are the creatures of men's fancy and the works of men's 
 hands; he is the Creator of all things. 

 5. Presumptuous sinners are ready to think that, because they have
 been too hard for their fellow-creatures, they are therefore a match 
 for their Creator. This and the other nation they have subdued, and
 therefore the Lord himself shall not deliver Jerusalem out of their 
 hand. But, though the potsherds may strive with the potsherds of the 
 earth, let them not strive with the potter. 

 6. It is sometimes prudent not to <I>answer a fool according to his
 folly.</I> Hezekiah's command was, "<I>Answer him not;</I> it will but 
 provoke him to rail and blaspheme yet more and more; leave it to God to 
 stop his mouth, for you cannot." They had reason enough on their side, 
 but it would be hard to speak it to such an unreasonable adversary 
 without a mixture of passion; and, if they should fall a railing like 
 him, Rabshakeh would be much too hard for them at that weapon. 

 7. It becomes the people of God to lay to heart the dishonour done to
 God by the blasphemies of wicked men, though they do not think it 
 prudent to reply to those blasphemies. Though they <I>answered him not 
 a word,</I> yet they rent their clothes, in a holy zeal for the glory 
 of God's name and a holy indignation at the contempt put upon it. They 
 tore their garments when they heard blasphemy, as taking no pleasure in 
 their own ornaments when God's honour suffered.</P>
