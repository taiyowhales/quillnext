 The prophecy of this chapter, as the two chapters before, is against 
 Egypt, and designed for the humbling and mortifying of Pharaoh. In 
 passing sentence upon great criminals it is usual to consult 
 precedents, and to see what has been done to others in the like case, 
 which serves both to direct and to justify the proceedings. Pharaoh 
 stands indicted at the bar of divine justice for his pride and 
 haughtiness, and the injuries he had done to God's people; but he 
 thinks himself so high, so great, as not to be accountable to any 
 authority, so strong, and so well guarded, as not to be conquerable by 
 any force. The prophet is therefore directed to make a report to him of 
 the case of the king of Assyria, whose head city was Nineveh. 

 I. He must show him how great a monarch the king of Assyria had been,
 what a vast empire he had, what a mighty sway he bore; the king of 
 Egypt, great as he was could not go beyond him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:3-9">ver. 3-9</A>.

 II. He must then show him how like he was to the king of Assyria in
 pride and carnal security, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:10">ver. 10</A>.

 III. He must next read him the history of the fall and ruin of the king 
 of Assyria, what a noise it made among the nations and what a warning 
 it gave to all potent princes to take heed of pride, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:11-17">ver. 11-17</A>.

 IV. He must leave the king of Egypt to apply all this to himself, to 
 see his own face in the looking-glass of the king of Assyria's sin, and 
 to foresee his own fall through the perspective glass of his ruin,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third
 <I>month,</I> in the first <I>day</I> of the month, <I>that</I> the word of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his
 multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness?
 &nbsp; 3  Behold, the Assyrian <I>was</I> a cedar in Lebanon with fair
 branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of a high stature;
 and his top was among the thick boughs.
 &nbsp; 4  The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with
 her rivers running round about his plants, and sent out her
 little rivers unto all the trees of the field.
 &nbsp; 5  Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the
 field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became
 long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.
 &nbsp; 6  All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and
 under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth
 their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations.
 &nbsp; 7  Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his
 branches: for his root was by great waters.
 &nbsp; 8  The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir
 trees were not like his boughs, and the chestnut-trees were not
 like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like
 unto him in his beauty.
 &nbsp; 9  I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so
 that all the trees of Eden, that <I>were</I> in the garden of God,
 envied him.

 This prophecy bears date the month before Jerusalem was taken, as that 
 in the close of the foregoing chapter about four months before. When 
 God's people were in the depth of their distress, it would be some 
 comfort to them, as it would serve likewise for a check to the pride 
 and malice of their neighbours, that insulted over them, to be told 
 from heaven that the cup was going round, even the cup of trembling, 
 that it would shortly be taken out of the hands of God's people and put 
 into the hands of those that hated them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:22,23">Isa. li. 22, 23</A>.

 In this prophecy,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The prophet is directed to put Pharaoh upon searching the records 
 for a case parallel to his own 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>Speak to Pharaoh and to his multitude,</I> to the multitude of his 
 attendants, that contributed so much to his magnificence, and the 
 multitude of his armies, that contributed so much to his strength. 
 These he was proud of, these he put a confidence in; and they were as 
 proud of him and trusted as much in him. Now ask him, <I>Whom art thou 
 like in thy greatness?</I> We are apt to judge of ourselves by 
 comparison. Those that think highly of themselves fancy themselves as 
 great and as good as such and such, that have been mightily celebrated. 
 The flatterers of princes tell them whom they equal in pomp and 
 grandeur. "Well," says God, "let him pitch upon the most famous 
 potentate that ever was, and it shall be allowed that he is <I>like him 
 in greatness</I> and no way inferior to him; but, let him pitch upon 
 whom he will, he will find that <I>his day came to fall;</I> he will 
 see there was <I>an end</I> of all <I>his perfection,</I> and must 
 therefore expect the end of his own in like manner." Note, The falls of 
 others, both into sin and ruin, are intended as admonitions to us not 
 to be secure or <I>high-minded,</I> nor to think we stand out of 
 danger.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He is directed to show him an instance of one whom he resembles in 
 greatness, and that was the Assyrian 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 whose monarchy had continued from Nimrod. Sennacherib was one of the 
 mighty princes of that monarchy; but it sunk down soon after him, and 
 the monarchy of Nebuchadnezzar was built upon its ruins, or rather 
 grafted upon its stock. Let us now see what a flourishing prince the 
 king of Assyria was. He is here compared to a stately cedar, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 The glory of the house of David is illustrated by the same similitude,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:3"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 3</A>.

 The olive-tree, the fig-tree, and the vine, which were all fruit-trees,
 had refused to be <I>promoted over the trees</I> because they would not 
 leave their fruitfulness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:8">Judg. ix. 8</A>,

 &c.), and therefore the choice falls upon the cedar, that is stately
 and strong, and casts a great shadow, but bears no fruit. 

 1. The Assyrian monarch was a tall cedar, such as the cedars in Lebanon
 generally were, of a <I>high stature,</I> and <I>his top among the 
 thick boughs;</I> he was attended by other princes that were 
 tributaries to him, and was surrounded by a life-guard of brave men. He 
 surpassed all the princes in his neighbourhood; they were all shrubs to 
 him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>His height was exalted above all the trees of the field;</I> they 
 were many of them very high, but he overtopped them all, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 The cedars, even those in the garden of Eden, which we may suppose were 
 the best of the kind, <I>would not hide him,</I> but his top branches 
 outshot theirs. 

 2. He was a spreading cedar; his branches did not only run up in 
 height, but run out in breadth, denoting that this mighty prince was 
 not only exalted to great dignity and honour, and had a name above the 
 names of the great men of the earth, but that he obtained great 
 dominion and power; his territories were large, and he extended his 
 conquests far and his influences much further. This cedar, like <I>a 
 vine,</I> sent forth <I>his branches to the sea, to the river,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:11">Ps. lxxx. 11</A>.

 <I>His boughs were multiplied; his branches became long</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>);

 so that <I>he had a shadowing shroud,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 This contributed very much to his beauty, that he grew proportionably 
 large as well as high. He was <I>fair in his greatness, in the length
 of his branches</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 very comely as well as very stately, <I>fair by the multitude of his 
 branches,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 His large dominions were well managed, like a spreading tree that is 
 kept in shape and good order by the skill of the gardener, so as to be 
 very beautiful to the eye. His government was as amiable in the eyes of 
 wise men as it was admirable in the eyes of all men. The 
 <I>fir-trees</I> were not <I>like his boughs,</I> so straight, so 
 green, so regular; nor were the branches of <I>the chestnut-trees like 
 his branches,</I> so thick, so spreading. In short, <I>no tree in the 
 garden of God,</I> in Eden, in Babylon (for that stood where paradise 
 was planted), where there was every tree that was <I>pleasant to the 
 sight</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:9">Gen. ii. 9</A>),

 was like <I>to this cedar in beauty;</I> that is, in all the
 surrounding nations there was no prince so much admired, so much 
 courted, and whom every body was so much in love with, as the king of 
 Assyria. Many of them <I>did virtuously,</I> but he <I>excelled them 
 all,</I> outshone them all. <I>All the trees of Eden envied him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 When they found they could not compare with him they were angry and 
 grieved that he so far outdid them, and secretly grudged him the praise 
 due to him. Note, It is the unhappiness of those who in any thing excel 
 others that thereby they make themselves the objects of envy; and 
 <I>who can stand before envy?</I> 

 3. He was serviceable, as far as a standing growing cedar could be, and
 that was only by his shadow

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>All the fowls of heaven,</I> some of all sorts, <I>made their nests 
 in his boughs,</I> where they were sheltered from the injuries of the 
 weather. The <I>beasts of the field</I> put themselves under the
 protection of <I>his branches.</I> There they were <I>levant--rising 
 up,</I> and <I>couchant--lying down;</I> there they <I>brought forth 
 their young;</I> for they had there a natural covert from the heat and 
 from the storm. The meaning of all is, <I>Under his shadow dwelt all 
 great nations;</I> they all fled to him for safety, and were willing to 
 swear allegiance to him if he would undertake to protect them, as 
 travellers in a shower come under thick trees for shelter. Note, Those 
 who have power ought to use it for the protection and comfort of those 
 whom they have power over; for to that end they are entrusted with 
 power. Even the bramble, if he be anointed king, invites the trees to
 come and <I>trust in his shadow,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:15">Judg. ix. 15</A>.

 But the utmost security that any creature, even the king of Assyria
 himself, can give, is but like the shadow of a tree, which is but a 
 scanty and slender protection, and leaves a man many ways exposed. Let 
 us therefore flee to God for protection, and he will take us <I>under 
 the shadow of his wings,</I> where we shall be warmer and safer than 
 under the shadow of the strongest and stateliest cedar,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:8,91:4">Ps. xvii. 8; xci. 4</A>.

 4. He seemed to be settled and established in his greatness and power.
 For,

 (1.) It was God that <I>made him fair,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 For by him kings reign. He was comely with the comeliness that God put 
 upon him. Note, God's hand must be eyed and owned in the advancement of 
 the great men of the earth, and therefore we must not envy them; yet 
 that will not secure the continuance of their prosperity, for he that 
 gave them their beauty, if they be deprived of it, knows how to turn it 
 into deformity.

 (2.) He seemed to have a good bottom. This cedar was not like the 
 <I>heath in the desert, made to inhabit the parched places</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:6">Jer. xvii. 6</A>);

 it was not a <I>root in a dry ground,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:2">Isa. liii. 2</A>.

 No; he had abundance of wealth to support his power and grandeur

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>The waters made him great;</I> he had vast treasures, large stores 
 and magazines, which were as <I>the deep that set him up on high,</I> 
 constant revenues coming in by taxes, customs, and crown-rents, which 
 were <I>as rivers running round about his plants;</I> these enabled him 
 to strengthen and secure his interests every where, for he <I>sent out 
 his little rivers,</I> or conduits, <I>to all the trees of the 
 field,</I> to water them; and when they had <I>maintenance from the 
 king's palace</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:14">Ezra iv. 14</A>),

 and <I>their country was nourished by the king's country</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:20">Acts xii. 20</A>),

 they would be serviceable and faithful to him. Those that have wealth
 flowing upon them in great rivers find themselves obliged to send it 
 out again in little rivers; for, <I>as goods are increased, those are 
 increased that eat them,</I> and the more men have the more occasion 
 they have for it; yea, and still the more they have occasion for. The 
 <I>branches</I> of this cedar <I>became long,</I> because of <I>the 
 multitude of waters</I> which fed them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:5,7"><I>v.</I> 5 and 7</A>);

 <I>his root was by great waters,</I> which seemed to secure it that 
 <I>its leaf should never wither</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:3">Ps. i. 3</A>),

 that it should not <I>see when heat came,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:8">Jer. xvii. 8</A>.

 Note, Worldly people may seem to have an established prosperity, yet it
 only seems so,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Therefore thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Because thou hast lifted
 up thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top among the thick
 boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;
 &nbsp; 11  I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty
 one of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven
 him out for his wickedness.
 &nbsp; 12  And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him
 off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys
 his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the
 rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down
 from his shadow, and have left him.
 &nbsp; 13  Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and
 all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches:
 &nbsp; 14  To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt
 themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the
 thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all
 that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the
 nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men,
 with them that go down to the pit.
 &nbsp; 15  Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; In the day when he went down to the
 grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I
 restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed:
 and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the
 field fainted for him.
 &nbsp; 16  I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I
 cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and
 all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that
 drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth.
 &nbsp; 17  They also went down into hell with him unto <I>them that be</I>
 slain with the sword; and <I>they that were</I> his arm, <I>that</I> dwelt
 under his shadow in the midst of the heathen.
 &nbsp; 18  To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among
 the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees
 of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the
 midst of the uncircumcised with <I>them that be</I> slain by the
 sword. This <I>is</I> Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord
 G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have seen the king of Egypt resembling the king of Assyria in pomp, 
 and power, and prosperity, how like he was to him in his greatness; now 
 here we see,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How he does likewise resemble him in his pride, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 For, as face answers to face in a glass, so does one corrupt carnal 
 heart to another; and the same temptations of a prosperous state by 
 which some are overcome are fatal to many others too. "<I>Thou,</I> O
 king of Egypt! <I>hast lifted up thyself in height,</I> hast been proud 
 of thy wealth and power,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:3"><I>ch.</I> xxix. 3</A>.

 And just so <I>he</I> (that is, the king of Assyria); when he had
 <I>shot up his top among the thick boughs his heart</I> was immediately 
 <I>lifted up in his height,</I> and he grew insolent and imperious, set 
 God himself at defiance, and trampled upon his people;" witness the 
 messages and letter which <I>the great king, the king of Assyria,</I> 
 sent to Hezekiah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+36:4">Isa. xxxvi. 4</A>.

 How haughtily does he speak of himself and his own achievements! how
 scornfully of that great and good man! There were other sins in which 
 the Egyptians and the Assyrians did concur, particularly that of 
 oppressing God's people, which is charged upon them both together

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:4">Isa. lii. 4</A>);

 but here that sin is traced up to its cause, and that was pride; for it
 is the <I>contempt of the proud</I> that they are <I>filled with.</I> 
 Note, When men's outward condition rises their minds commonly rise with 
 it; and it is very rare to find a humble spirit in the midst of great 
 advancements.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How he shall therefore resemble him in his fall; and for the 
 opening of this part of the comparison,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here is a history of the fall of the king of Assyria. For his part, 
 says God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 <I>I have therefore,</I> because he was thus lifted up, <I>delivered 
 him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen.</I> Cyaxares, king 
 of the Medes, in the twenty-sixth year of his reign, in conjunction 
 with Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon in the first year of his reign, 
 destroyed Nineveh, and with it the Assyrian empire. Nebuchadnezzar, 
 though he was not then, yet afterwards became, very emphatically, the 
 <I>mighty one of the heathen,</I> most mighty among them and most 
 mighty over them, to prevail against them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Respecting the fall of the Assyrian three things are 
 affirmed:--

 [1.] It is God himself that orders his ruin: <I>I have delivered him 
 into the hand</I> of the executioner; <I>I have driven him out.</I> 
 Note, God is the Judge, who puts down one and sets up another 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+75:7">Ps. lxxv. 7</A>);

 and when he pleases he can extirpate and expel those who think
 themselves, and seem to others, to have taken deepest root. And the
 mightiest ones of the heathens could not gain their point against those 
 they contended with if the Almighty did not himself deliver them into 
 their hands.

 [2.] It is his own sin that procures his ruin: <I>I have driven him out 
 for his wickedness.</I> None are driven out from their honour, power, 
 and possessions, but it is <I>for their wickedness.</I> None of our 
 comforts are ever lost but what have been a thousand times forfeited. 
 If the wicked are <I>driven away,</I> it is <I>in their wickedness.</I>

 [3.] It is a <I>mighty one of the heathen</I> that shall be the 
 instrument of his ruin; for God often employs one wicked man in 
 punishing another. <I>He shall surely deal with him,</I> shall know how 
 to manage him, great as he is. Note, Proud imperious men will, sooner 
 or later, meet with their match.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) In this history of the fall of the Assyrian observe, 

 [1.] A continuation of the similitude of the cedar. He grew very high, 
 and extended his boughs very far; but his day comes to fall. 
 <I>First,</I> This stately cedar was cropped: <I>The terrible of the 
 nations cut him off.</I> Soldiers, who being both armed and 
 commissioned to kill, and slay, and destroy, may well be reckoned among 
 <I>the terrible of the nations.</I> They have lopped off his branches 
 first, have seized upon some parts of his dominion and forced them out 
 of his hands; so that in all <I>mountains</I> and <I>valleys</I> of the 
 nations about, in the high-lands and low-lands, and <I>by all the 
 rivers,</I> there were cities or countries that were broken off from 
 the Assyrian monarchy, that had been subject to it, but had either 
 revolted or were recovered from it. Its feathers were borrowed; and, 
 when every bird had fetched back its own, it was naked like the stump 
 of a tree. <I>Secondly,</I> It was deserted: <I>All the people of the 
 earth,</I> that had fled to him for shelter, have <I>gone down from his 
 shadow and have left him.</I> When he was disabled to give them 
 protection they thought they no longer owed him allegiance. Let not 
 great men be proud of the number of those that attend them and have a 
 dependence upon them; it is only for what they can get. When Providence 
 frowns upon them their retinue is soon dispersed and scattered from 
 them. <I>Thirdly,</I> It was insulted over, and its fall triumphed in 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain,</I> to tread 
 upon the broken branches of this cedar. Its fall is triumphed in by the 
 other trees, who were angry to see themselves overtopped so much: 
 <I>All the trees of Eden,</I> that were cut down and had fallen before 
 him, <I>all that drank water</I> of the rain of heaven, as the stump of 
 the tree that is left in the <I>south</I> is said to be <I>wet with the 
 dew of heaven</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:23">Dan. iv. 23</A>)

 and to bud <I>through the scent of water</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+14:9">Job xiv. 9</A>),

 <I>shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth</I> when they
 see this proud cedar brought as low as themselves. <I>Solamen miseris
 socios habuisse doloris</I>--<I>To have companions in woe is a solace 
 to those who suffer.</I> But, on the contrary, the trees of Lebanon, 
 that are yet standing in their height and strength, <I>mourned for 
 him,</I> and <I>the trees of the field fainted for him,</I> because 
 they could not but read their own destiny in his fall. <I>Howl,
 fir-trees, if the cedar be shaken,</I> for they cannot expect to stand 
 long, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:2">Zech. xi. 2</A>.

 [2.] An explanation of the similitude of the cedar. By the cutting down 
 of this cedar is signified the slaughter of this mighty monarch and all 
 his adherents and supporters; they are all <I>delivered to death,</I> 
 to fall by the sword, as the cedar by the axe. He and his princes, who, 
 he said, were <I>altogether kings,</I> go down to the grace, <I>to the 
 nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men,</I> as 
 common persons of no quality or distinction. <I>They died like men</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:7">Ps. lxxxii. 7</A>);

 they were carried away with <I>those that go down to the pit,</I> and
 their pomp did neither protect them nor <I>descend after them.</I> 
 Again

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 He was <I>cast down to hell with those that descend into the pit;</I> 
 he went into the state of the dead, and was buried as others are, in 
 obscurity and oblivion. Again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 <I>They all that were his arm,</I> on whom he stayed, by whom he acted 
 and exerted his power, all <I>that dwelt under his shadow,</I> his 
 subjects and allies, and all that had any dependence on him, they all 
 <I>went down</I> into ruin, down into the grace <I>with him, unto those 
 that were slain with the sword,</I> to those that were cut off by 
 untimely deaths before them, under the load of guilt and shame. When 
 great men fall a great many fall with them, as a great many in like 
 manner have fallen before them.

 [3.] What God designed, and aimed at, in bringing down this mighty
 monarch and his monarchy. He designed thereby, <I>First, To give an 
 alarm</I> to the nations about, to put them all to a stand, to put them 
 all to a gaze 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall.</I> They were 
 all struck with astonishment to see so mighty a prince brought down 
 thus. It give a shock to all their confidences, every one thinking his 
 turn would be next. <I>When he went down to the grace</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 <I>I caused a mourning,</I> a general lamentation, as the whole kingdom 
 goes into mourning at the death of the king. In token of this general 
 grief, <I>I covered the deep for him,</I> put that into black, gave a 
 stop to business, in complaisance to this universal mourning. <I>I 
 restrained the floods, and the great waters were stayed,</I> that they 
 might run into another channel, that of lamentation. Lebanon 
 particularly, the kingdom of Syria, that was sometimes in confederacy 
 with the Assyrian, mourned for him; as the allies of Babylon, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:9">Rev. xviii. 9</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> To give an admonition to the nations about, and to 
 their kings 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>To the end that none of all the trees by the waters,</I> though ever 
 so advantageously situated, <I>may exalt themselves for their 
 height,</I> may be proud and conceited of themselves and <I>shoot up 
 their top among the thick boughs,</I> looking disdainfully upon others, 
 nor <I>stand upon themselves for their height,</I> confiding in their 
 own politics and powers, as if they could never be brought down. Let 
 them all take warning by the Assyrian, for he once held up his head as 
 high, and thought he kept his footing as firm, as any of them; but his 
 pride went before his destruction, and his confidence failed him. Note, 
 The fall of proud presumptuous men is intended for warning to others to 
 keep humble. It would have been well for Nebuchadnezzar, who was 
 himself active in bringing down the Assyrian, if he had taken the 
 admonition.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here is a prophecy of the fall of the king of Egypt in like manner, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 He thought himself like the Assyrian <I>in glory and greatness,</I> 
 over-topping <I>all the trees of Eden,</I> as the cypress does the 
 shrubs. "But <I>thou</I> also <I>shalt be brought down,</I> with the 
 other trees that are pleasant to the sight, as those in Eden. Thou 
 shalt be <I>brought to the grave,</I> to the nether or lower <I>parts 
 of the earth;</I> thou shalt <I>lie in the midst of the 
 uncircumcised,</I> that die in their uncleanness, die ingloriously, die 
 under a curse and at a distance from God; then shall those whom thou 
 hast trampled upon triumph over thee, saying, <I>This is Pharaoh and 
 all his multitude.</I> See how mean he looks, how low he lies; see what 
 all his pomp and pride have come to; here is all that is left of him." 
 Note, Great men and great multitudes, with the great figure and great 
 noise they make in the world, when God comes to contend with them, will 
 soon become little, less than nothing, such as Pharaoh and all his 
 multitude.</P>
