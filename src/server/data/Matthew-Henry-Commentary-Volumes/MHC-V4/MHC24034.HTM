 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have two messages which God sent by Jeremiah. 

 I. One to foretel the fate of Zedekiah king of Judah, that he should
 fall into the hands of the king of Babylon, that he should live a 
 captive, but should at last die in peace in his captivity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 II. Another to read the doom both of prince and people for their
 treacherous dealings with God, in bringing back into bondage their
 servants whom they had released according to the law, and so playing
 fast and loose with God. They had walked at all adventures with God
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:8-11">ver. 8-11</A>),

 and therefore God would walk at all adventures with them, in bringing
 the Chaldean army upon them again when they began to hope that they had
 got clear of them,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The word which came unto Jeremiah from the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, when
 Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the
 kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought
 against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the God of Israel; Go and speak to
 Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>;
 Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of
 Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:
 &nbsp; 3  And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely
 be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall
 behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with
 thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.
 &nbsp; 4  Yet hear the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus
 saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword:
 &nbsp; 5  <I>But</I> thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy
 fathers, the former kings which were before thee, so shall they
 burn <I>odours</I> for thee; and they will lament thee, <I>saying,</I> Ah
 lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 6  Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah
 king of Judah in Jerusalem,
 &nbsp; 7  When the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and
 against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish,
 and against Azekah: for these defenced cities remained of the
 cities of Judah.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This prophecy concerning Zedekiah was delivered to Jeremiah, and by him 
 to the parties concerned, before he was shut up in the prison, for we 
 find this prediction here made the ground of his commitment, as appears 
 by the recital of some passages out of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:4"><I>ch.</I> xxxii. 4</A>.

 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The time when this message was sent to Zedekiah; it was <I>when the 
 king of Babylon,</I> with all his forces, some out of <I>all the 
 kingdoms of the earth</I> that were within his jurisdiction, <I>fought 
 against Jerusalem and the cities thereof</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 designing to destroy them, having often plundered them. The cities that 
 now remained, and yet held out, are named 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 <I>Lachish and Azekah.</I> This intimates that things were now brought 
 to the last extremity, and yet Zedekiah obstinately stood it out, his 
 heart being hardened to his destruction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The message itself that was sent to him. 

 1. Here is a threatening of wrath. He is told that again which he had 
 been often told before, that the city shall be taken by the Chaldeans 
 <I>and burnt with fire</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 that he shall himself fall into the enemy's hands, shall be made a 
 prisoner, shall be brought before that furious prince Nebuchadnezzar, 
 and be carried away captive into Babylon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 yet Ezekiel prophesied that he <I>should not see Babylon;</I> nor did 
 he, for his eyes were put out, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:13">Ezek. xii. 13</A>.

 This Zedekiah brought upon himself from God by his other sins and from
 Nebuchadnezzar by breaking his faith with him.

 2. Here is a mixture of mercy. He shall die a captive, but he <I>shall
 not die by the sword</I> he shall die a natural death

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 he shall end his days with some comfort, <I>shall die in peace,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 He never had been one of the worst of the kings, but we are willing to 
 hope that what evil he had <I>done in the sight of the Lord</I> he 
 repented of in his captivity, as Manasseh had done, and it was forgiven 
 to him; and, God being reconciled to him, he might truly be said to 
 <I>die in peace,</I> Note, A man may die in a prison and yet <I>die in 
 peace.</I> Nay, he shall end his days with some reputation, more than 
 one would expect, all things considered. He shall be buried <I>with the 
 burnings of his fathers,</I> that is, with the respect usually shown to 
 their kings, especially those that had done good in Israel. It seems, 
 in his captivity he had conducted himself so well towards his own 
 people that they were willing to do him this honour, and towards 
 Nebuchadnezzar that he suffered it to be done. If Zedekiah had
 continued in his prosperity, perhaps he would have grown worse and 
 would have <I>departed</I> at last <I>without being desired;</I> but 
 his afflictions wrought such a change in him that his death was looked 
 upon as a great loss. It is better to live and die penitent in a prison 
 than to live and die impenitent in a palace. <I>They will lament thee,
 saying, Ah lord!</I> an honour which his brother Jehoiakim had not,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:18"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 18</A>.

 The Jews say that they lamented thus over him, <I>Alas! Zedekiah is
 dead, who drank the dregs of all the ages that went before him,</I> 
 that is, who suffered for the sins of his ancestors, the measure of 
 iniquity being filled up in his days. They shall thus lament him,
 <I>saith the Lord, for I have pronounced the word;</I> and what God 
 hath spoken shall without fail be made good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Jeremiah's faithfulness in delivering this message. Though he knew 
 it would be ungrateful to the king, and might prove, as indeed it did, 
 dangerous to himself (for he was imprisoned for it), yet he <I>spoke 
 all these words to Zedekiah,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 It is a mercy to great men to have those about them that will deal 
 faithfully with them, and tell them the evil consequences of their evil 
 courses, that they may reform and live.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  <I>This is</I> the word that came unto Jeremiah from the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the
 people which <I>were</I> at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them;
 &nbsp; 9  That every man should let his manservant, and every man his
 maidservant, <I>being</I> a Hebrew or a Hebrewess, go free; that
 none should serve himself of them, <I>to wit,</I> of a Jew his
 brother.
 &nbsp; 10  Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had
 entered into the covenant, heard that every one should let his
 manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that none
 should serve themselves of them any more, then they obeyed, and
 let <I>them</I> go.
 &nbsp; 11  But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the
 handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them
 into subjection for servants and for handmaids.
 &nbsp; 12  Therefore the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came to Jeremiah from the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, saying,
 &nbsp; 13  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the God of Israel; I made a covenant
 with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the
 land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying,
 &nbsp; 14  At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an
 Hebrew, which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served
 thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your
 fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear.
 &nbsp; 15  And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in
 proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a
 covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:
 &nbsp; 16  But ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his
 servant, and every man his handmaid, whom ye had set at liberty
 at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection,
 to be unto you for servants and for handmaids.
 &nbsp; 17  Therefore thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Ye have not hearkened unto
 me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every
 man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and
 I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.
 &nbsp; 18  And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant,
 which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had
 made before me, when they cut the calf in twain, and passed
 between the parts thereof,
 &nbsp; 19  The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the
 eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, which
 passed between the parts of the calf;
 &nbsp; 20  I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and
 into the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies
 shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts
 of the earth.
 &nbsp; 21  And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into
 the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek
 their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army,
 which are gone up from you.
 &nbsp; 22  Behold, I will command, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and cause them to
 return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take
 it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a
 desolation without an inhabitant.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here another prophecy upon a particular occasion, the history 
 of which we must take notice of, as necessary to give light to the 
 prophecy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. When Jerusalem was closely besieged by the Chaldean army the princes 
 and people agreed upon a reformation in one instance, and that was 
 concerning their servants.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The law of God was very express, that those of their own nation 
 should not be held in servitude above seven years, but, after they had 
 served one apprenticeship, they should be discharged and have their 
 liberty; yea, though they had sold themselves into servitude for the 
 payment of their debts, or though they were <I>sold by the judges</I> 
 for the punishment of their crimes. This difference was put between 
 their brethren and strangers, that those of other nations taken in war, 
 or bought with money, might be held in perpetual slavery, they and 
 theirs; but their brethren must serve but for seven years at the 
 longest. This God calls the covenant that he had made with them when he 
 <I>brought them out of the land of Egypt,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 This was the first of the judicial laws which God gave them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+21:2">Exod. xxi. 2</A>),
 
 and there was good reason for this law.

 (1.) God had put honour upon that nation, and he would have them thus 
 to preserve the honour of it themselves and to put a difference between 
 it and other nations. 

 (2.) God had brought them out of slavery in Egypt, and he would have 
 them thus to express their grateful sense of that favour, by letting 
 those go to whom their houses were <I>houses of bondage,</I> as Egypt 
 had been to their forefathers. That deliverance is therefore mentioned 
 here

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)

 as the ground of that law. Note, God's compassions towards us should 
 engage our compassions towards our brethren; we must release as we are 
 released, forgive as we are forgiven, and relieve as we are relieved.
 And this is called <I>a covenant;</I> for our performance of the duty 
 required is the condition of the continuance of the favours God has 
 bestowed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. This law they and their fathers had broken. Their worldly profit 
 swayed more with them than God's command or covenant. When their 
 servants had lived seven years with them they understood their 
 business, and how to apply themselves to it, better than they did when 
 they first came to them, and therefore they would then by no means part 
 with them, though God himself by his law had made them free: <I>Your 
 fathers hearkened not to me</I> in this matter 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 so that from the days of their fathers they had been in this trespass; 
 and they thought they might do it because their fathers did it, and 
 their servants had by disuse lost the benefit of the provision God made 
 for them; whereas against an express law, especially against an express 
 law of God, no custom, usage, nor prescription, is to be admitted in 
 plea. For this sin of theirs, and their fathers, God now brought them
 into servitude, and justly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. When they were besieged, and closely shut in, by the army of the 
 Chaldeans, they, being told of their fault in this matter, immediately 
 reformed, and let go all their servants that were entitled to their 
 freedom by the law of God, as Pharaoh, who, when the plague was upon 
 him, consented to <I>let the people go,</I> and bound themselves in a 
 covenant to do so. 

 (1.) The prophets faithfully admonished them concerning their sin. From 
 them they heard that they should let their Hebrew servants <I>go 
 free,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 They might have read it themselves in the book of the law, but did not, 
 or did not heed it, therefore the prophets told them what the law was. 
 See what need there is of the preaching of the word; people must hear 
 the word preached because they will not make the use they ought to make 
 of the word written. 

 (2.) All orders and degrees of men concurred in this reformation. The 
 <I>king,</I> and the <I>princes,</I> and <I>all the people,</I> agreed 
 to <I>let go their servants,</I> whatever loss or damage they might 
 sustain by so doing. When the king and princes led in this good work 
 the people could not for shame but follow. The example and influence of 
 great men would go very far towards extirpating the most inveterate 
 corruptions. 

 (3.) They bound themselves by a solemn oath and covenant that they 
 would do this, whereby they engaged themselves to God and one another. 
 Note, What God has bound us to by his precept, it is good for us to 
 bind ourselves to by our promise. This covenant was very solemn: it
 was made in a sacred place, <I>made before me, in the house which is 
 called by my name</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),
 
 in the special presence of God, the tokens of which, in the temple, 
 ought to strike an awe upon them and make them very sincere in their 
 appeals to him. It was ratified by a significant sign; they <I>cut a
 calf in two, and passed between the parts thereof</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>)

 with this dreadful imprecation, "Let us be in like manner cut asunder 
 if we do not perform what we now promise." This calf was probably 
 offered up in sacrifice to God, who was thereby made a party to the 
 covenant. When God covenanted with Abraham, for the ratification of it, 
 a <I>smoking furnace</I> and a <I>burning lamp passed between the 
 pieces</I> of the sacrifice, in allusion to this federal rite, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:17">Gen. xv. 17</A>.

 Note, In order that we may effectually oblige ourselves to our duty, it
 is good to alarm ourselves with the apprehensions of the terror of the 
 wrath and curse to which we expose ourselves if we live in the contempt 
 of it, that wrath which will <I>cut sinners asunder</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:51">Matt. xxiv. 51</A>),

 and sensible signs may be of use to make the impressions of it deep and
 durable, as here.

 (4.) They conformed themselves herein to the command of God and their 
 covenant with him; they did <I>let their servants go,</I> though at 
 this time, when the city was besieged, they could very ill spare them.
 Thus they did <I>right in God's sight,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Though it was their trouble that drove them to it, yet he was well 
 pleased with it; and if they had persevered in this act of <I>mercy to 
 the poor,</I> to their poor servants, it might have been a lengthening 
 of their tranquillity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:27">Dan. iv. 27</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. When there was some hope that the siege was raised and the danger 
 over they repented of their repentance, undid the good they had done, 
 and forced the servants they had released into their respective 
 services again. 

 1. The <I>king of Babylon's army</I> had now <I>gone up from them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Pharaoh was bringing an army of Egyptians to oppose the progress of the 
 king of Babylon's victories, upon the tidings of which the Chaldeans 
 raised the siege for a time, as we find,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+37:5"><I>ch.</I> xxxvii. 5</A>.

 <I>They departed from Jerusalem.</I> See how ready God was to put a
 stop to his judgments, upon the first instance of reformation, so slow 
 is he to anger and so swift to show mercy. As soon as ever they let 
 their servants go free God let them go free. 

 2. When they began to think themselves safe from the besiegers they 
 made their servants come back into subjection to them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>,
 
 and again 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 This was a great abuse to their servants, to whom servitude would be 
 more irksome, after they had had some taste of the pleasures of 
 liberty. It was a great shame to themselves that they could not keep in 
 a good mind when they were in it. But it was especially an affront to 
 God; in doing this they <I>polluted his name,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 It was a contempt of the command he had given them, as if that were of 
 no force at all, but they might either keep it or break it as they 
 thought fit. It was a contempt of the covenant they had made with him,
 and of that wrath which they had imprecated upon themselves in case 
 they should break that covenant. It was jesting with God almighty, as 
 if he could be imposed upon by fallacious promises, which, when they 
 had gained their point, they would look upon themselves no longer 
 obliged by. it was <I>lying to God with their mouths</I> and 
 <I>flattering him with their tongues.</I> It was likewise a contempt of 
 the judgments of God and setting them at defiance; as if, when once the 
 course of them was stopped a little and interrupted, they would never 
 proceed again and the judgment would never be revived; whereas 
 reprieves are so far from being pardons that if they be abused thus, 
 and sinners take encouragement from them to return to sin, they are but 
 preparatives for heavier strokes of divine vengeance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. For this treacherous dealing with God they are here severely 
 threatened. <I>Be not deceived; God is not mocked.</I> Those that think 
 to put a cheat upon God by a dissembled repentance, a fallacious 
 covenant, and a partial temporary reformation, will prove in the end to 
 have put the greatest cheat upon their own souls; for <I>the Lord, 
 whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.</I> it is here threatened, 
 with an observable air of displeasure against them, 

 1. That, since they had not given liberty to their servants to go where 
 they pleased, God would give all his judgments liberty to take their 
 course against them without control

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>You have not proclaimed liberty to your servants.</I> Though they 
 had done it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 yet they might truly be said not to have done it, because they did not 
 stand to it, but undid it again; and <I>factum non dicitur quod non 
 perseverat--that is not said to be done which does not last.</I> The 
 righteousness that is forsaken and turned away from shall be forgotten, 
 and <I>not mentioned</I> any more than if it had never been, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:24">Ezek. xviii. 24</A>.

 "<I>Therefore I will proclaim a liberty for you;</I> I will discharge
 you from my service, and put you out of my protection, which those 
 forfeit that withdraw from their allegiance. You shall have liberty to
 choose which of these judgments you will be cut off by, <I>sword, 
 famine, or pestilence;</I>" such a liberty as was offered to David, 
 which put him into a <I>great strait,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:14">2 Sam. xxiv. 14</A>.

 Note, Those that will not be in subjection to the law of God put
 themselves into subjection to the wrath and curse of God. But this 
 shows what liberty to <I>sin</I> really--it is but a liberty to the 
 sorest judgments.

 2. That, since they had brought their servants back into confinement
 in their houses, God would <I>make them to be removed into all the 
 kingdoms of the earth,</I> where they should live in servitude, and, 
 being strangers, could not expect the privileges of free-born subjects.

 3. That, since they had broken the covenant which they ratified by a 
 solemn imprecation, God would bring on them the evil which they 
 imprecated upon themselves in case they should break it. Out of their
 own mouth will he judge them, and so shall their doom be; the penalty 
 of their bond shall be recovered, because they have not performed the 
 condition; for so some read

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>,

 "<I>I will make the men which have transgressed my covenant as the calf 
 which they cut in twain;</I> I will divide them asunder as they divided 
 it asunder." 

 4. That, since they would not let go their servants out of the hands,
 God would deliver them into the hands of those that hated them, even 
 <I>the princes</I> and nobles both <I>of Judah and Jerusalem</I> (of 
 the country and of the city), <I>the eunuchs</I> (chamberlains, or 
 great officers of the court), <I>the priests, and all the people,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 They had all dealt treacherously with God, and therefore shall all be 
 involved in the common ruin without exception. They shall all be
 <I>given unto the hand of their enemies, that seek,</I> not their 
 wealth only, or their service, but <I>their life,</I> and they shall 
 have what they seek; but neither shall that content them: when they 
 have their lives they shall leave <I>their dead bodies</I> unburied, a 
 loathsome spectacle to all mankind and an easy prey to <I>the fowls and 
 beasts,</I> a lasting mark of ignominy being hereby fastened on them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 5. That, since they had emboldened themselves in returning to their 
 sin, contrary to their covenant, by the retreat of the Chaldean army 
 from them, God would therefore bring it upon them again: "They have now 
 <I>gone up from you,</I> and your fright is over for the present, but I 
 <I>will command them</I> to face about as they were; they shall 
 <I>return to this city, and take it and burn it,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Note, 

 (1.) As confidence in God is a hopeful presage of approaching 
 deliverance, so security in sin is a sad omen of approaching 
 destruction. 

 (2.) When judgments are removed from a people before they have done 
 their work, leave them, but leave them unhumbled and unreformed, it is 
 <I>cum animo revertendi</I>--<I>with a design to return;</I> they do 
 but retreat to come on again with so much the greater force; for when 
 God judges he will overcome. 

 (3.) It is just with God to disappoint those expectations of mercy 
 which his providence had given cause for when we disappoint those 
 expectations of duty which our professions, pretensions, and fair 
 promises, had given cause for. If we repent of the good we had
 purposed, God will repent of the good he had purposed. <I>With the
 froward thou will show thyself froward.</I></P>
