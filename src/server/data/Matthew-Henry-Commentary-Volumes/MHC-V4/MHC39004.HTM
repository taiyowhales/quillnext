 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here proper instructions given us (very proper to close the 
 canon of the Old Testament with), 

 I. Concerning the state of recompence and retribution that is before
 us, the misery of the wicked and the happiness of the righteous in that
 state, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 And this is represented to us under a prophecy of the destruction of
 Jerusalem, and the unbelieving Jews with it, and of the comforts and
 triumphs of those among them that received the gospel. 

 II. Concerning the state of trial and preparation we are now in, in
 which we are directed to have an eye to divine revelation, and to
 follow that; they then must keep to the law of Moses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:4">ver. 4</A>)

 and expect a further discovery of God's will by Elijah the prophet,
 that is, by John Baptist, the harbinger of the Messiah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:5,6">ver. 5, 6</A>.

 The last chapter of the New Testament is much to the same purport, 
 setting before us heaven and hell in the other world, and obliging us 
 to adhere to the word of God in this world.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and
 all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble:
 and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of
 hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.
 &nbsp; 2 But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness
 arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow
 up as calves of the stall.
 &nbsp; 3 And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes
 under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do <I>this,</I>
 saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The great and terrible day of the Lord is here prophesied of. This, 
 like the pillar of cloud and fire, shall have a dark side turned 
 towards the Egyptians that fight against God, and a bright side towards 
 the faithful Israelites that follow him: <I>The day cometh,</I> that 
 is, the Lord cometh, the day of the Lord; and it has reference both to 
 the first and to the second coming of Jesus Christ; the day of both was 
 fixed, and should answer the character here given of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. In both Christ is a consuming fire to those that rebel against him. 
 The day of his coming <I>shall burn as an oven;</I> it shall be a day 
 of wrath, of <I>fiery indignation.</I> This was foretold concerning the 
 Messiah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:9">Ps. xxi. 9</A>,

 <I>Thy hand shall find out all thy enemies,</I> and <I>shall make them
 as a fiery oven in the time of thy anger.</I> It will be a day of 
 terror and destruction like the burning of a city, or rather of a wood, 
 the trees whereof are withered and dried, for to that the allusion 
 seems to be, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:17,18">Isa. x. 17, 18</A>,

 <I>The light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a
 flame, and it shall consume the glory of his forest and of his fruitful 
 field.</I> Now observe here,

 1. Who shall be fuel to this fire--all <I>the proud</I> in heart, whose
 words have been stout against God, and their necks stiff and unapt to 
 yield to the yoke of his commandments (all those that <I>in the pride 
 of their countenances will not seek after God,</I> nor submit to the 
 grace and government of Jesus Christ--all that proudly say they <I>will 
 not have Christ to reign over them</I>), and all those that <I>do 
 wickedly</I> in their affections and conversations, that wilfully 
 persist in sin, in contempt of and contradiction to the law of God; 
 they are such as <I>do wickedly against the covenant,</I> as another 
 prophet had lately expressed it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:32">Dan. xi. 32</A>.

 God, that has perfect knowledge of every one's character, knows who are 
 <I>the proud,</I> and of every one's actions, knows who they are that 
 <I>do wickedly;</I> and they shall be as <I>stubble</I> to this fire; 
 they shall be consumed by it, easily consumed, utterly consumed, and it 
 is wholly owing to themselves that they shall be so, for they make 
 themselves stubble, that is, combustible matter, to this fire. If they 
 were not stubble, it would not burn them; for the fire will be to every 
 man according as he and his works are found; if they be <I>wood, 
 hay,</I> and <I>stubble,</I> they will be <I>consumed;</I> but if they 
 be <I>gold, silver, and precious stones,</I> they will <I>abide the 
 fire</I> and be purified by it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:13-15">1 Cor. iii. 13-15</A>.

 Those that by their unbelief oppose Christ thereby set themselves as
 <I>briers and thorns</I> before a <I>devouring fire,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:4,5">Isa. xxvii. 4, 5</A>.

 2. What shall be the force and what the fruit of this fire: <I>The day
 that cometh shall burn them up,</I> shall both terrify and ruin them, 
 and shall <I>leave them neither root nor branch,</I> neither <I>son</I> 
 nor <I>nephew</I> (so the Chaldee paraphrase): neither they nor their 
 posterity shall be spared; they shall be wholly extirpated and cut off. 
 <I>Who knows the power of God's anger? The proud and those that do 
 wickedly</I> will not fear it, but they shall be made to feel it. Where 
 are those now that <I>called the proud happy,</I> when thus they are 
 made completely miserable, when there remains no branch of their 
 happiness to be enjoyed for the present, nor any root of it out of 
 which it might again spring up? Now this was fulfilled,

 (1.) When Christ, in his doctrine, spoke terror and condemnation to the
 proud Pharisees and the other Jews that did wickedly, when he sent that
 fire on the earth which burnt up the chaff of the traditions of the
 elders and the corrupt glosses they had put upon the law of God. 

 (2.) When Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans, and the nation of the
 Jews, as a nation, quite blotted out from under heaven, and neither
 root nor branch left them. This seems to be principally intended here;
 our Saviour says that those should be the <I>days of vengeance,</I>
 when all the things that were written to that purport should be
 fulfilled, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:22">Luke xxi. 22</A>.

 Then the unbelieving Jews were as stubble to the devouring fire of
 God's judgments, which gathered together to them as the eagles to the
 carcase. 

 (3.) It is certainly applicable, and is to be applied, to the day of
 judgment, to the particular judgment at death (some of the Jewish 
 doctors refer it the <I>punishment that seizes on the souls of the 
 wicked immediately after they go out of the body</I>), but especially 
 to the general judgment, at the end of time, when Christ shall be 
 <I>revealed in flaming fire,</I> to execute judgment on <I>the proud, 
 and all that do wickedly.</I> The whole world shall then <I>burn as an 
 oven,</I> and all the children of this world, that set their hearts 
 upon it and choose their portion in it, shall take their ruin with it, 
 and the fire then kindled shall never be quenched.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. In both Christ is a rejoicing light to those who serve him 
 faithfully, to those who fear his name and give him the glory due to it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 who stand in awe of that name of his which the wicked profane and 
 trample upon. Here are mercy and comfort kept in store for all those 
 who fear the Lord and think on his name. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Whence this mercy and comfort shall flow to them: <I>To you that 
 fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise, with healing in his 
 wings.</I> The day that comes, as it will be a stormy day to the 
 wicked, a day in which God will rain upon them <I>fire and brimstone, 
 and a horrible tempest,</I> as he did on Sodom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+11:6">Ps. xi. 6</A>),

 a <I>day of clouds and thick darkness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:18,20">Amos v. 18, 20</A>),

 so it will be a fair and bright day to those who fear God, and reviving
 as the rising sun is to the earth; and particular notice is taken of
 the rising of the sun upon Zoar when that was mercifully distinguished
 from the cities of the plain, which the fire <I>consumed;</I> see 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:23">Gen. xix. 23</A>.

 So to those that fear God is comfort spoken. When the hearts of others
 <I>fail for fear</I> let them <I>lift up their heads for joy,</I> for
 <I>their redemption draws nigh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:28">Luke xxi. 28</A>.

 But by the <I>Sun of righteousness</I> here we are certainly to
 understand Jesus Christ, who would undertake to secure the believing 
 remnant, in the day of the general destruction of the Jews, from 
 falling with the rest, and to comfort them in that day of distress and 
 perplexity with his consolations; he directed those that were in Judea 
 to <I>flee to the mountains</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:16">Matt. xxiv. 16</A>),

 and they did so, and were all safe and easy in Pella. But it is to be
 applied more generally,

 (1.) To the coming of Christ in the flesh to seek and save those that
 were lost; then the <I>Sun of righteousness</I> arose upon this dark
 world. Christ is the <I>light of the world,</I> the true light, the
 great light that makes day and rules the day 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:12">John viii. 12</A>),

 as the sun. He is the <I>light of men</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:4">John i. 4</A>),

 is to men's souls as the sun is to the visible world, which without the
 sun would be a dungeon; so would mankind be darkness itself without the
 <I>light of the glory of God</I> shining <I>in the face of Christ.</I>
 Christ is the Sun that has light in himself, and is the fountain of
 light

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:4-6">Ps. xix. 4-6</A>);

 he is the <I>Sun of righteousness,</I> for he is himself a righteous
 Saviour. Righteousness is both the light and the heat of this Sun; the
 word of his righteousness is so; it guides, instructs, and quickens; so 
 is the <I>everlasting righteousness</I> he has brought in. He is 
 <I>made of God to us righteousness;</I> he is the <I>Lord our 
 righteousness,</I> and therefore is fitly called <I>the Sun of 
 righteousness.</I> Through him we are justified and sanctified, and so 
 are brought to see light. This Sun of righteousness, in the fulness of
 time, arose upon the world, and with him <I>light came into the 
 world</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:19">John iii. 19</A>),
 
 a <I>great light,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:16">Matt. iv. 16</A>.

 In him <I>the day-spring from on high visited us, to give light to 
 those that sit in darkness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:78,79">Luke i. 78, 79</A>.

 Righteousness sometimes signifies mercy or benignity, and it was in 
 Christ that the <I>tender mercy of our God</I> visited us.

 (2.) It is applicable to the graces and comforts of the Holy Spirit,
 brought into the souls of men. Grotius understands it of Christ's 
 giving the Spirit to those that are his, to shine in their hearts, and 
 to be a <I>comforter</I> to them, a <I>sun and a shield.</I> Those that 
 are possessed and governed by a holy fear of God and a dread of his 
 majesty shall have his <I>love</I> also <I>shed abroad in their hearts 
 by the Holy Ghost;</I> and then the sun may be said to arise there, and 
 to bring both a delightful day and a fruitful spring along with it. 
 
 (3.) Christ's second coming will be a glorious and welcome sun-rising
 to all that <I>fear his name;</I> it will be that morning of the
 resurrection in which <I>the upright shall have dominion,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:14">Ps. xlix. 14</A>.

 That day which to the wicked will <I>burn as an oven</I> will to the
 righteous be bright as the morning; and it is what they wait for, 
 <I>more than those that wait for the morning.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What this mercy and comfort shall bring to them: He <I>shall arise 
 with healing under his wings,</I> or in his <I>rays</I> or 
 <I>beams,</I> which are as the wings of the sun. Christ came, as <I>the 
 sun,</I> to bring not only light to a dark world, but health to a 
 diseased distempered world. The Jews (says Dr. Pocock) have a 
 proverbial saying, <I>As the sun riseth, infirmities decrease;</I> the 
 flowers which drooped and languished all night revive in the morning. 
 Christ came into the world to be the great physician, yea, and the 
 great medicine too, both the balm in Gilead and the physician there. 
 When he was upon earth, he went about as the sun in his circuit, doing 
 this good; he <I>healed all manner of sicknesses and diseases among the 
 people;</I> he healed by wholesale, as the sun does. He shall arise 
 <I>with healing in his skirts;</I> so some read it, and they apply it 
 to the story of the woman's touching <I>the hem of his garment,</I> and 
 being thereby <I>made whole,</I> and his finding that <I>virtue went 
 out of him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:28-30">Mark v. 28-30</A>.

 But his healing bodily diseases was a specimen of his great design in
 coming into the world to heal the diseases of men's souls, and to put 
 them into a good state of health, that they may serve and enjoy both 
 God and themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What good effect it shall have upon them. 

 (1.) It shall make them vigorous in themselves: "<I>You shall go 
 forth,</I> as those that are healed go abroad and return to their 
 business." The souls shall go forth out of their bodies at death, and 
 the bodies out of their graves at the resurrection, as prisoners out of 
 their dungeons, and both to see the light and be set at liberty. 
 "<I>You shall go forth</I> as plants out of the earth, when in the 
 spring the sun returns." Some make it to mean the going forth of the 
 Christians from Jerusalem, and the escape they thereby made from its 
 destruction. And thus the souls on whom the Sun of righteousness arises 
 go forth out of the world, go forth out of Babylon, as those that are 
 made <I>free indeed.</I> "You shall likewise <I>grow up;</I> being 
 restored to health and liberty, you shall increase in knowledge, and 
 grace, and spiritual strength." The souls on which the Sun of 
 righteousness arises are growing up towards <I>the perfect man;</I> 
 those that by the grace of God are made wise and good are by the same 
 grace made wiser and better; and their path, like that of the rising 
 sun, <I>shines more and more to the perfect day,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:18">Prov. iv. 18</A>.

 Their growth is compared to that of <I>the calves of the stall,</I> 
 which is a quick, strong, and useful growth. "You shall grow up, not
 as the <I>flower of the field,</I> which is slender, and weak, and of 
 little use, and withers soon after it has grown up, but as the 
 <I>calves of the stall,</I>" that, as one of the rabbin expounds it, 
 <I>grow great in flesh and fatness,</I> with which both God's altars 
 and men's tables are replenished; so the growth of the saints, on whom 
 the Sun of righteousness arises, honours both God and man. Some read 
 it, instead of <I>You shall grow up,</I> You shall <I>move 
 yourselves,</I> or <I>leap for joy,</I> shall be as frolicsome as 
 calves of the stall, when they are let loose in the open field; it 
 denotes the joy of the saints, who rejoice in Christ Jesus; they shall 
 even leap for joy; they are <I>always caused to triumph.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It shall make them victorious over their enemies 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>You shall tread down the wicked.</I> Time was when the wicked trod 
 them down, said to their souls, <I>Bow down, that we may go over;</I> 
 but the day will come when they shall <I>tread down the wicked.</I> The 
 wicked, being made Christ's footstool, are made theirs also 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:1">Ps. cx. 1</A>),
 
 and come and <I>worship before the feet</I> of the church, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:9">Rev. iii. 9</A>.

 <I>The elder shall serve the younger.</I> When believers by faith 
 <I>overcome the world,</I> when they suppress their own corrupt 
 appetites and passions, when the God of peace bruises Satan under their 
 feet, then they <I>tread down the wicked.</I> When it came to the turn 
 of the Christians to triumph over the Jews that had insulted over them, 
 then this promise was fulfilled: <I>They shall be ashes under the soles 
 of your feet;</I> they shall not only be <I>trodden down,</I> but 
 trodden <I>to dirt.</I> When the day that comes shall have <I>burnt 
 them up,</I> they shall trample upon them as ashes. When the righteous 
 shall rise to <I>everlasting life,</I> the wicked shall rise to 
 <I>everlasting contempt;</I> and, though they shall not triumph over 
 them, they shall triumph in that God whose justice is glorified in 
 their destruction. The saints in glory are said to have power given 
 them over the nations, to <I>rule them with a rod of iron,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:26,27">Rev. ii. 26, 27</A>.

 This <I>you shall do, in the day that I shall do this.</I> Note, The 
 saints' triumphs are all owing to God's victories; it is not they that 
 do this, but God that does it for them, that says, <I>Come set your 
 feet on the necks of these kings.</I> Some read it, "<I>In the day that 
 I make,</I> or shall make, the <I>great day</I> that I shall make 
 remarkable, of which you will say with joy, <I>This is the day which 
 the Lord has made.</I>" The day of the destruction of Jerusalem is 
 called the <I>great and notable day of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:20">Acts ii. 20</A>),

 and our Saviour in foretelling that destruction made use of such
 expressions as, like these, might be applied likewise to the <I>end of 
 the world</I> and the <I>last judgment;</I> for it was such a terrible 
 revelation of the wrath of God from heaven, and caused such a scene of 
 horror upon this earth, that it might fitly serve for a type of that 
 glorious transaction which will be an outlet to the days of time and an 
 inlet to the days of eternity. By the accomplishment of these 
 prophecies in the ruin of the Jewish nation, we should have our faith 
 confirmed in the assurances Christ has given us concerning the 
 dissolution of all things. <I>Surely I come quickly;</I> so says 
 Christ, <I>the Lord of hosts,</I> to whom all power in heaven and earth 
 is committed.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4 Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded
 unto him in Horeb for all Israel, <I>with</I> the statutes and
 judgments.
 &nbsp; 5 Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming
 of the great and dreadful day of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 &nbsp; 6 And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children,
 and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is doubtless intended for a solemn conclusion, not only of this 
 prophecy, but of the canon of the Old Testament, and is a plain 
 information that they were not to expect any more sayings nor writing 
 by divine inspiration, any more of the dictates of the Spirit of 
 prophecy, till the beginning of the gospel of the Messiah, which sets 
 aside the Apocrypha as no part of holy writ, and which therefore the 
 Jews never received.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now that prophecy ceases, and is about to be sealed up, there are two 
 things required of the people of God, that lived then:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They must keep up an obedient veneration for the law of Moses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Remember the law of Moses my servant,</I> and observe to do 
 according to it, even that law which <I>I commanded unto him in 
 Horeb,</I> that fiery law which was intended <I>for all Israel, with 
 the statutes and judgments,</I> not only the law of the ten 
 commandments, but all the other appointments, ceremonial and judicial, 
 then and there given. Observe here, 

 1. The honourable mention that is made of <I>Moses,</I> the first
 writer of the Old Testament, in <I>Malachi,</I> the last writer. God by 
 him calls him <I>Moses my servant;</I> for the righteous shall be had 
 in everlasting remembrance. See how the penmen of scripture, though
 they lived in several ages at a great distance from each other (it was 
 above 1200 years from Moses to Malachi), all concurred in the same 
 thing, and supported one another, being all actuated and guided by one 
 and the same Spirit. 

 2. The honourable mention that is made of the <I>law of Moses;</I> it 
 was what God himself <I>commanded;</I> he owns it for his law, and he 
 commanded it <I>for all Israel,</I> as the municipal law of their 
 kingdom. Thus will God <I>magnify his law and make it honourable.</I> 
 Note, We are concerned to keep the law because God has commanded it and 
 commanded it for us, for we are the spiritual Israel; and, if we expect 
 the benefit of the covenant with Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:10">Heb. viii. 10</A>),

 we must observe the commands given to Israel, those of them that were
 intended to be of perpetual obligation.

 3. The summary of our duty, with reference to the law. We must
 remember it. Forgetfulness of the law is at the bottom of all our 
 transgressions of it; if we would rightly remember it, we could not but 
 conform to it. We should remember it when we have occasion to use it, 
 remember both the commands themselves and the sanctions wherewith they 
 are enforced. The office of conscience is to bid us <I>remember the 
 law.</I> But how does this charge to remember the law of Moses come in 
 here?

 (1.) This prophet had reproved them for many gross corruptions and 
 irregularities both in worship and conversation, and now, for the 
 reforming and amending of what was amiss, he only charges them to 
 <I>remember the law of Moses:</I> "Keep to that rule, and you will do 
 all you should do." He will <I>lay upon them no other burden</I> than 
 what they <I>have received; hold that fast,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:24,25">Rev. ii. 24, 25</A>.

 Note, Corrupt churches are to be reformed by the written word, and 
 reduced into order by being reduced to the standard of <I>the law and 
 the testimony,</I> see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:23">1 Cor. xi. 23</A>.

 (2.) The church had long enjoyed the benefit of prophets, extraordinary
 messengers from God, and now they had a whole book of their prophecies 
 put together, and it was a finished piece; but they must not think that 
 hereby the <I>law of Moses</I> was superseded, and had become as an 
 almanac out of date, as if now they were advanced to a higher form and 
 might forget that. No; the prophets do but confirm and apply the law, 
 and press the observance of that; and therefore still <I>Remember the 
 law.</I> Note, Even when we have made considerable advances in 
 knowledge we must still retain the first principles of practical 
 religion and resolve to abide by them. Those that study the writings of 
 the prophets, and the apocalypse, must still remember the law of Moses 
 and the four gospels.

 (3.) Prophecy was now to cease in the church for some ages, and the 
 Spirit of prophecy not to return till the <I>beginning of the 
 gospel,</I> and now they are told to <I>remember the law of Moses;</I> 
 let them live by the rules of that, and live upon the promises of that.
 Note, We need not complain for want of visions and revelations as long 
 as we have the written word, and the canon of scripture complete, to be 
 our guide; for that is the most <I>sure word of prophecy,</I> and the 
 touchstone by which we are to <I>try the spirits.</I> Though we have 
 not prophets, yet, as long as we have Bibles, we may keep our communion 
 with God, and keep ourselves in his way. 

 (4.) They were to expect the coming of the Messiah, the preaching of 
 his gospel, and the setting up of his kingdom, and in that expectation 
 they must <I>remember the law of Moses,</I> and live in obedience to 
 that, and then they might expect the comforts that the Messiah would 
 bring to <I>the willing and obedient.</I> Let them observe the law of 
 Moses, and live up to the light which that gave them, and then they 
 might expect the benefit of the gospel of Christ, for <I>to him that 
 has,</I> and uses what he has well, <I>more shall be given, and he 
 shall have abundance.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They must keep up a believing expectation of the gospel of Christ, 
 and must look for the beginning of it in the appearing of Elijah the 
 prophet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>):

 "<I>Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet.</I> Though the Spirit of 
 prophecy cease for a time, and you will have only the law to consult, 
 yet it shall revive again in one that shall be sent <I>in the spirit 
 and power of Elias,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:17">Luke i. 17</A>.

 The <I>law and the prophets were until John</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:16">Luke xvi. 16</A>);

 they continued to be the only lights of the church till that
 morning-star appeared. Note, As God never <I>left himself without 
 witness</I> in the world, so neither in the church, but, as there was 
 occasion, carried the light of divine revelation further and further to 
 the perfect day. They had now Moses and the prophets, and might hear 
 them; but God will go further: he will send them Elijah. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Who this prophet is that shall be sent; it is <I>Elijah.</I> The 
 Jewish doctors will have it to be the same Elijah that prophesied in 
 Israel in the days of Ahab--that he shall come again to be the
 forerunner of the Messiah; yet others of them say not the same person, 
 but another of the same spirit. It should seem, those different 
 sentiments they had when they asked John, "<I>Art thou Elias,</I> or 
 <I>that prophet</I> that should bear his name?" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:19-21">John i. 19-21</A>.

 But we Christians know very well that John Baptist was the Elias that
 was to come, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:10-13">Matt. xvii. 10-13</A>;
 
 and very expressly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:14">Matt. xi. 14</A>,

 <I>This is Elias that was to come;</I> and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>,

 the same of whom it is written, <I>Behold, I send my messenger,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:1"><I>ch.</I> iii. 1</A>.

 Elijah was a man of great austerity and mortification, zealous for God,
 bold in reproving sin, and active to reduce an apostate people to God 
 and their duty; John Baptist was animated by the same spirit and power, 
 and preached repentance and reformation, as Elias had done; and all 
 held him for a prophet, as they did Elijah in his day, and that his 
 baptism was <I>from heaven,</I> and not <I>of men.</I> Note, When God 
 has such work to do as was formerly to be done he can raise up such men 
 to do it as he formerly raised up, and can put into a John Baptist the 
 spirit of an Elias.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. When he shall be sent--before the appearing of the Messiah, which,
 because it was the judgment of this world, and introduced the ruin of 
 the Jewish church and nation, is here called the <I>coming of the great 
 and dreadful day of the Lord.</I> John Baptist gave them fair warning 
 of this when he told them of the <I>wrath to come</I> (that <I>wrath to 
 the uttermost</I> which was hastening upon them) and put them into a
 way of escape from it, and when he told them of the <I>fan in Christ's
 hand,</I> with which Christ would thoroughly purge his floor; see 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:7,10,12">Matt. iii. 7, 10, 12</A>.

 That day of Christ, when he came first, was as that day will be when he
 comes again--though a great and joyful day to those that embrace him, 
 yet a <I>great and dreadful day</I> to those that oppose him. John 
 Baptist was sent before the coming of this day, to give people notice 
 of it, that they might get ready for it, and go forth to meet it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. On what errand he shall be sent: <I>He shall turn the heart of the 
 fathers to their children, and the heart of the children to their 
 fathers;</I> that is, "he shall be employed in this work; he shall 
 attempt it; his doctrine and baptism shall have a direct tendency to 
 it, and with many shall be successful: he shall be an instrument in 
 God's hand of <I>turning</I> many <I>to righteousness,</I> to <I>the 
 Lord their God,</I> and so <I>making ready a people prepared for 
 him,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:16,17">Luke i. 16, 17</A>.

 Note, The turning of souls to God and their duty is the best
 preparation of them for the great and dreadful day of the Lord. It is 
 promised concerning John,

 (1.) That he shall give a turn to things, shall make a bold stand
 against the strong torrent of sin and impiety which he found in full
 force among the children of his people, and beating down all before it.
 This is called his <I>coming to restore all things</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:11">Matt. xvii. 11</A>),

 to set them to rights, that they may again go in the right channel.
 
 (2.) That he shall preach a doctrine that shall reach men's hearts, and
 have an influence upon them, and work a change in them. God's word, in 
 his mouth, shall be <I>quick</I> and <I>powerful,</I> and a 
 <I>discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</I> Many had 
 their consciences awakened by his ministry who yet were not thoroughly 
 wrought upon, such a spirit and power was there in it. 

 (3.) That he shall turn the hearts of the fathers with the children, 
 and of the children with the fathers (for so some read it), to God and 
 to their duty. He shall call upon young and old to repent, and shall 
 not labour in vain, for many of the fathers that are going off, and 
 many of the children that are growing up, shall be wrought upon by his 
 ministry.

 (4.) That thus he shall be an instrument to revive and confirm love and 
 unity among relations, and shall bring them closer and bind them faster 
 to each other, by bringing and binding them all to their God. He shall 
 prepare the way for that kingdom of heaven which will make all its 
 faithful subjects of <I>one heart</I> and <I>one soul</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:32">Acts iv. 32</A>),
 
 which will be a kingdom of love, and will slay all enmities.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. With what view he shall be sent on this errand: <I>Lest I come and 
 smite the earth,</I> that is, the land of Israel, the body of the 
 Jewish nation (that were of the earth earthy), <I>with a curse.</I> 
 They by their impiety and impenitence in it had laid themselves open to 
 the curse of God, which is a separation to all evil. God was ready to 
 smite them with that curse, to bring utter ruin upon them, to strike 
 home, to strike dead, with the curse; but he will yet once more try 
 them, whether they will repent and return, and so prevent it; and 
 therefore he sends John Baptist to preach repentance to them, that
 their conversion might prevent their confusion; so unwilling is God 
 that any should perish, so willing to have his anger turned away. Had 
 they universally repented and reformed, their repentance would have had 
 this desired effect; but, they generally rejecting the counsel of God 
 in John's baptism, it proved against themselves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:30">Luke vii. 30</A>)

 and their land was smitten with the curse which both it and they lie
 under to this day. Note, Those must expect to be smitten with a sword,
 with a curse, who <I>turn not to him that smites them</I> with a rod,
 with a cross, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:13">Isa. ix. 13</A>.

 Now the <I>axe is laid to the root of the tree,</I> says John Baptist,
 and it is ready to be smitten, to be cut down, <I>with a curse;</I> 
 therefore <I>bring forth fruit meet for repentance.</I> Some observe 
 that the last word of the Old Testament is a curse, which threatens the 
 earth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+5:3">Zech. v. 3</A>),

 our desert of which we must be made sensible of, that we may bid Christ
 welcome, who comes with a blessing; and it is with a blessing, with the 
 choicest of blessings, that the New Testament ends, and with it let us 
 arm ourselves, or rather let God arm us, against this curse. <I>The 
 grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with us all. Amen.</I></P>
