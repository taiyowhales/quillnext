 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and
 prophesy against them,
 &nbsp; 3  And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord
 G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> to the mountains, and to the hills,
 to the rivers, and to the valleys; Behold, I, <I>even</I> I, will
 bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.
 &nbsp; 4  And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be
 broken: and I will cast down your slain <I>men</I> before your idols.
 &nbsp; 5  And I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel
 before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about
 your altars.
 &nbsp; 6  In all your dwelling-places the cities shall be laid waste,
 and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be
 laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and
 cease, and your images may be cut down, and your works may be
 abolished.
 &nbsp; 7  And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall
 know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. The prophecy is directed to <I>the mountains of Israel</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+6:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>);

 the prophet must <I>set his face towards</I> them. If he could see so 
 far off as the land of Israel, <I>the mountains</I> of that land would 
 be first and furthest seen; towards them therefore he must look, and 
 look boldly and stedfastly, as the judge looks at the prisoner, and 
 directs his speech to him, when he passes sentence upon him. Though 
 <I>the mountains of Israel</I> be ever so high and ever so strong, he 
 must <I>set his face against</I> them, as having judgments to denounce 
 that should shake their foundation. <I>The mountains of Israel</I> had 
 been <I>holy mountains,</I> but now that they had polluted them with 
 their high places God set his face against them and therefore the 
 prophet must. Israel is here put, not, as sometimes, for the ten 
 tribes, but for the whole land. <I>The mountains</I> are called upon to 
 <I>hear the word of the Lord,</I> to shame the inhabitants that would 
 not hear. The prophets might as soon gain attention from the 
 <I>mountains</I> as from that <I>rebellious and gainsaying people,</I> 
 to whom they all day long <I>stretched out their hands in vain. Hear, O 
 mountains! the Lord's controversy</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:1,2">Mic. vi. 1, 2</A>),

 for God's cause will have a hearing, whether we hear it or no. But from
 <I>the mountains the word of the Lord</I> echoes <I>to the hills, to 
 the rivers, and to the valleys;</I> for to them also <I>the Lord 
 God</I> speaks, intimating that the whole land is concerned in what is 
 now to be delivered and shall be witnesses against this people that 
 they had fair warning given them of the judgments coming, but they 
 would not take it; nay, they contradicted the message and persecuted 
 the messengers, so that God's prophets might more safely and 
 comfortably speak to <I>the hills and mountains</I> than to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That which is threatened in this prophecy is the utter destruction 
 of the idols and the idolaters, and both by the sword of war. God 
 himself is commander-in-chief of this expedition against <I>the 
 mountains of Israel.</I> It is he that says, <I>Behold, I, even I, will 
 bring a sword upon you</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+6:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 the sword of the Chaldeans is at God's command, goes where he sends it, 
 comes where he brings it, and lights as he directs it. In the 
 desolations of that war,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The idols and all their appurtenances should be destroyed. The 
 <I>high places,</I> which were on the tops of mountains 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+6:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 shall be levelled <I>and made desolate</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+6:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 they shall not be beautified, shall not be frequented as they had been.
 The <I>altars,</I> on which they offered sacrifice and burnt incense to 
 strange gods, <I>shall be broken</I> to pieces and <I>laid waste;</I> 
 the <I>images</I> and <I>idols</I> shall be defaced, <I>shall be broken 
 and cease,</I> and be cut down, and all the fine costly works about 
 them shall be abolished, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+6:4,6"><I>v.</I> 4, 6</A>.
 
 Observe here, 

 (1.) That war makes woeful desolations, which those persons, places, 
 and things that were esteemed most sacred cannot escape; for <I>the 
 sword devours one as well as another.</I> 

 (2.) That God sometimes ruins idolatries even by the hands of 
 idolaters, for such the Chaldeans themselves were; but, as if the deity 
 were a local thing, the greatest admirers of the gods of their own 
 country were the greatest despisers of the gods of other countries. 
 
 (3.) It is just with God to make that a desolation which we make an 
 idol of; for he is a jealous God and will not bear a rival.

 (4.) If men do not, as they ought, destroy idolatry, God will, first or 
 last, find out a way to do it. When Josiah had destroyed the high 
 places, altars, and images, with the sword of justice, they set them up 
 again; but God will now destroy them with the sword of war, and let us 
 see who dares re-establish them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The worshippers of idols and all their adherents should be destroyed 
 likewise. As <I>all their high places shall be laid waste,</I> so shall 
 all <I>their dwelling-places</I> too, even <I>all their cities,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+6:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Those that profane God's dwelling-place as they had done can expect no 
 other than that he should abandon theirs,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:11"><I>ch.</I> v. 11</A>.

 <I>If any man defile the temple of God, him will God destroy,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:17">1 Cor. iii. 17</A>.

 It is here threatened that <I>their slain shall fall in the midst of
 them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+6:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 there shall be abundance slain, even in those places which were thought 
 most safe; but it is added as a remarkable circumstance that they shall 
 fall <I>before their idols</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+6:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 that their <I>dead carcases</I> should be <I>laid,</I> and their 
 <I>bones scattered, about their altars,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 (1.) Thus their idols should be polluted, and those places profaned by 
 the dead bodies which they had had in veneration. If they will not 
 <I>defile the covering of their graven images,</I> God will, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:22">Isa. xxx. 22</A>.

 The throwing of the carcases among them, as upon the dunghill, 
 intimates that they were but dunghill-deities.

 (2.) Thus it was intimated that they were but dead things, unfit to be 
 rivals with <I>the living God;</I> for the carcases of dead men, that, 
 like them, <I>have eyes and see not, ears and hear not,</I> were the 
 fittest company for them. 

 (3.) Thus the idols were upbraided with their inability to help their 
 worshippers, and idolaters were upbraided with the folly of trusting in 
 them; for, it should seem, they fell by the sword of the enemy when 
 they were actually before their idols imploring their aid and putting 
 themselves under their protection. Sennacherib was slain by his sons 
 when he was <I>worshipping in the house of his god.</I> 

 (4.) The sin might be read in this circumstance of the punishment; the 
 <I>slain men</I> are <I>cast before the idols,</I> to show that 
 <I>therefore</I> they are slain, because they worshipped those idols; 
 see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:1,2">Jer. viii. 1, 2</A>.
 
 Let the survivors observe it, and take warning not to
 worship images; let them see it, and know that <I>God is the Lord,</I> 
 that <I>the Lord he is God</I> and he alone.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have <I>some</I> that
 shall escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be
 scattered through the countries.
 &nbsp; 9  And they that escape of you shall remember me among the
 nations whither they shall be carried captives, because I am
 broken with their whorish heart, which hath departed from me, and
 with their eyes, which go a whoring after their idols: and they
 shall loathe themselves for the evils which they have committed in
 all their abominations.
 &nbsp; 10  And they shall know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>and that</I> I have
 not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Judgment had hitherto triumphed, but in these verses mercy rejoices 
 against judgment. A sad end is made of this provoking people, but not a 
 full end. The ruin seems to be universal, and <I>yet will I leave a 
 remnant,</I> a little remnant, distinguished from the body of the 
 people, a few of many, such as are left when the rest perish; and it is 
 God that leaves them. This intimates that they deserved to be cut off 
 with the rest, and would have been cut off if God had not left them. 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:9">Isa. i. 9</A>.

 And it is God who by his grace works that in them which he has an eye
 to in sparing them. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It is a preserved remnant, saved from the ruin which the body of the 
 nation is involved in 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+6:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>That you may have some who shall escape the sword.</I> God said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:12"><I>ch.</I> v. 12</A>)

 that he would <I>draw a sword after those</I> who were
 <I>scattered,</I> that destruction should pursue them in their 
 dispersion; but here is <I>mercy remembered in the midst of</I> that 
 <I>wrath,</I> and a promise that some of <I>the Jews of the 
 dispersion,</I> as they were afterwards called, should <I>escape the 
 sword.</I> None of those who were to <I>fall by the sword about</I> 
 Jerusalem <I>shall escape;</I> for they trust to Jerusalem's walls for 
 security, and shall be made ashamed of that vain confidence. But some
 of them <I>shall escape the sword among the nations,</I> where, being 
 deprived of all other stays, they stay themselves upon God only. They 
 are said to <I>have</I> those who shall <I>escape;</I> for they shall 
 be the seed of another generation, out of which Jerusalem shall 
 flourish again.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It is a penitent remnant 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+6:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Those who escape of you shall remember me.</I> Note, To those whom 
 god designs for life he will give <I>repentance unto life.</I> They are 
 reprieved, and <I>escape the sword,</I> that they may have time to 
 return to God. Note, God's patience both leaves room for repentance and 
 is an encouragement to sinners to repent. Where God designs grace to 
 repent he allows space to repent; yet many who have the space want the 
 grace, many who <I>escape the sword</I> do not forsake the sin, as it 
 is promised that these shall do. This remnant, here marked for 
 salvation, is a type of the remnant reserved out of the body of mankind 
 to be monuments of mercy, who are made safe in the same way that these 
 were, by being brought to repentance. Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The occasion of their repentance, and that is a mixture of judgment 
 and mercy-judgment, that they were <I>carried captives,</I> but mercy, 
 that they <I>escaped the sword</I> in the land of their captivity. They 
 were driven out of their own land, but not out of the land of the 
 living, <I>not chased out of the world,</I> as other were and they 
 deserved to be. Note, The consideration of the just rebukes of 
 Providence we are under, and yet of the mercy mixed with them, should 
 engage us to repent, that we may answer God's end in both. And true 
 repentance shall be accepted of God, though we are brought to it by our 
 troubles; nay, sanctified afflictions often prove means of conversion, 
 as to Manasseh.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The root and principle of their repentance: <I>They shall remember 
 me among the nations.</I> Those who <I>forgot God</I> in the land of 
 their peace and prosperity, who <I>waxed fat and kicked,</I> were 
 brought to remember him in the land of their captivity. The prodigal 
 son never bethought himself of his father's house till he was ready to 
 perish for hunger in the far country. Their remembering God was the 
 first step they took in returning to him. Note, Then there begins to be 
 some hopes of sinners when they have sinned against, and to enquire, 
 <I>Where is God my Maker?</I> Sin takes rise in forgetting God, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:21">Jer. iii. 21</A>.

 Repentance takes rise from the remembrance of him and of our
 obligations to him. God says, <I>They shall remember me,</I> that is, 
 "I will give them grace to do so;" for otherwise they would for ever 
 forget him. That grace shall find them out wherever they are, and by 
 bringing God to their mind shall bring them to their right mind. The
 prodigal, when he remembered his father, remembered how he has 
 <I>sinned against Heaven and before</I> him; so do these penitents.

 (1.) They remember the base affront they had put upon God by their 
 idolatries, and this is that which an ingenuous repentance fastens upon 
 and most sadly laments. They had departed from God to idols, and given 
 that honour to pretended deities, the creatures of men's fancies and 
 the work of men's hands, which they should have given to the God of 
 Israel. They <I>departed from</I> God, from his word, which they should 
 have made their rule, from his work, which they should have made their 
 business. <I>Their hearts departed from</I> him. The heart, which he 
 requires and insists upon, and without which <I>bodily exercise profits 
 nothing,</I> the <I>heart,</I> which should be set upon him, and 
 carried out towards him, when that <I>departs from</I> him, is as the 
 treacherous elopement of a wife from her husband or the rebellious 
 revolt of a subject from his sovereign. <I>Their eyes</I> also <I>go 
 after their idols;</I> they doted on them, and had great expectations 
 from them. Their hearts followed their eyes in the choice of their gods 
 (they must have gods that they could see), and then their eyes followed 
 their hearts in the adoration of them. Now the malignity of this sin is 
 that it is spiritual whoredom; it is a <I>whorish heart</I> that 
 <I>departs from</I> God; and they are <I>eyes</I> that <I>go a whoring 
 after their idols.</I> Note, Idolatry is spiritual whoredom; it is the 
 breach of a marriage-covenant with God; it is the setting of the 
 affections upon that which is a rival with him, and the indulgence of a 
 base lust, which deceives and defiles the soul, and is a great wrong to 
 God in his honour, 

 (2.) They remember what a grief this was to him and how he resented it. 
 They shall remember <I>that I am broken with their whorish heart and 
 their eyes</I> that are full of this spiritual adultery, not only angry 
 at it, but grieved, as a husband is at the lewdness of a wife whom he 
 dearly loved, grieved to such a degree that he is broken with it; it 
 breaks his heart to think that he should be so disingenuously dealt 
 with; he is broken as an aged father is with the undutiful behaviour of 
 a rebellious and disobedient son, which sinks his spirits and makes him 
 to stoop. <I>Forty years long was I grieved with this generation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:10">Ps. xcv. 10</A>.

 <I>God's measures were broken</I> (so some); a stop was put to the
 current of his favours towards them, and he was even compelled to 
 punish them. This they shall remember in the day of their repentance, 
 and it shall affect and humble them more than any thing, not so much 
 that their peace was broken, and their country broken, as <I>that God 
 was broken</I> by their sin. Thus <I>they shall look on him whom they 
 have pierced and shall mourn,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:10">Zech. xii. 10</A>.

 Note, Nothing grieves a true penitent so much as to think that his sin
 has been a grief to God and to the Spirit of his grace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The product and evidence of their repentance: <I>They shall loathe 
 themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their 
 abominations.</I> Thus God will give them grace to qualify them for 
 pardon and deliverance. Though he had been <I>broken by their whorish 
 heart,</I> yet he would not quite cast them off. See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:17,18,Ho+2:13,14">Isa. lvii. 17, 18; Hos. ii. 13, 14</A>.

 His goodness takes occasion from their badness to appear the more
 illustrious. Note,

 (1.) True penitents see sin to be an abominable thing, that
 <I>abominable thing which the Lord hates</I> and which makes sinners, 
 and even their services, odious to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+44:4,Isa+1:11">Jer. xliv. 4; Isa. i. 11</A>.

 It defiles the sinner's own conscience, and makes him, unless he be
 past feeling, an abomination to himself. An idol is particularly called 
 <I>an abomination,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:19">Isa. xliv. 19</A>.

 Those gratifications which the hearts of sinners were set upon as
 delectable things the hearts of penitents are turned against as 
 detestable things.

 (2.) There are many <I>evils committed in these abominations,</I> many 
 included in them, attendant on them, and flowing from them, many 
 transgressions in one sin,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:21">Lev. xvi. 21</A>.

 In their idolatries they were sometimes guilty of whoredom (as in the 
 worship of Peor), sometimes of murder (as in the worship of Moloch);
 these were <I>evils committed in their abominations.</I> Or it denotes 
 the great malignity there is in sin; it is an abomination that has 
 abundance of evil in it. 

 (3.) Those that truly loathe sin cannot but loathe themselves because 
 of sin; self-loathing is evermore the companion of true repentance. 
 Penitents quarrel with themselves, and can never be reconciled to 
 themselves till they have some ground to hope that God is reconciled to 
 them; nay, <I>then</I> they shall lie down in their shame, when he is 
 pacified towards them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:63"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 63</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The glory that will redound to God by their repentance 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+6:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "<I>They shall know that I am the Lord;</I> they shall be convinced of 
 it by experience, and shall be ready to own it, <I>and that I have not 
 said in vain that I would do this evil unto them,</I> finding that what 
 I have said is made good, and made to work for good, and to answer a 
 good intention, and that it was not without just provocation that they 
 were thus threatened and thus punished." Note, 

 (1.) One way or other God will make sinners to know and own that he is 
 the lord, either by their repentance or by their ruin. 

 (2.) All true penitents are brought to acknowledge both the equity and 
 the efficacy of the word of God, particularly the threatenings of the 
 word, and to justify God in them and in the accomplishment of them.</P>

 with thy foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the
 house of Israel! for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine,
 and by the pestilence.
 &nbsp; 12  He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that
 is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is

 upon them.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The same threatenings which we had before in the foregoing chapter, and 
 in the former part of this, are here repeated, with a direction to the 
 prophet to lament them, that those he prophesied to might be the more 
 affected with the foresight of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He must by his gestures in preaching express the deep sense he had 
 both of the iniquities and of the calamities of the house of Israel 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+6:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>Smite with thy hand and stamp with thy foot.</I> Thus he must make 
 it to appear that he was in earnest in what he said to them, that he 
 firmly believed it and laid it to heart. Thus he must signify the just 
 displeasure he had conceived at their sins, and the just dread he was 
 under of the judgments coming upon them. Some would reject this use of 
 these gestures, and call them antic and ridiculous; but God bids him 
 use them because they might help to enforce the word upon some and give 
 it the setting on; and those that know the worth of souls will be 
 content to be laughed at by the wits, so they may but edify the weak.
 Two things the prophet must thus lament:--

 1. National sins. <I>Alas! for all the evil abominations of the house
 of Israel.</I> Note, The sins of sinners are the sorrows of God's 
 faithful servants, especially the <I>evil abominations of the house of 
 Israel,</I> whose sins are more abominable and have more evil in them 
 than the sins of others. Alas! <I>What will be in the end hereof?</I>

 2. National judgments. To punish them for these abominations <I>they 
 shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.</I> 
 Note, It is our duty to be affected not only with our own sins and 
 sufferings, but with the sins and sufferings of others; and to look 
 with compassion upon the miseries that wicked people bring upon 
 themselves; as Christ <I>beheld Jerusalem and wept over it.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He must inculcate what he had said before concerning the 
 destruction that was coming upon them. 

 1. They shall be run down and ruined by a variety of judgments which
 shall find them out and follow them wherever they are

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+6:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>He that is far off,</I> and thinks himself out of danger, because 
 out of the reach of the Chaldeans' arrows, shall find himself not out 
 of the reach of God's arrows, which fly day and night 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:5">Ps. xci. 5</A>):

 <I>He shall die of the pestilence. He that is near</I> a place of
 strength, which he hopes will be to him a place of safety, <I>shall 
 fall by the sword,</I> before he can retreat. <I>He that</I> is so
 cautious as not to venture out, but <I>remains</I> in the city, 
 <I>shall</I> there <I>die by the famine,</I> the saddest death of all. 
 <I>Thus will</I> God <I>accomplish his fury,</I> that is, do all that 
 against them which he had purposed to do.

 2. They shall read their sin in their punishment; for <I>their slain 
 men shall be among their idols, round about their altars,</I> as was 
 threatened before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+6:5-7"><I>v.</I> 5-7</A>.

 There, where they had prostrated themselves in honour of their idols, 
 God will lay them dead, to their own reproach and the reproach of their 
 idols. They lived among them and shall die among them. They had offered 
 sweet odours to their idols, but there shall their dead carcases send 
 forth an offensive smell, as it were to atone for that misplaced 
 incense. 

 3. The country shall be all laid waste, as, before, <I>the cities</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+6:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>I will make the land desolate.</I> That fruitful, pleasant, populous 
 country, that has been as the garden of the Lord, the glory of all 
 lands, shall be <I>desolate, more desolate than the wilderness towards 
 Diblath,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+6:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 It is called Diblathaim 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+33:46,Jer+48:22">Num. xxxiii. 46; Jer. xlviii. 22</A>),

 that <I>great and terrible wilderness</I> which is described, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:15">Deut. viii. 15</A>,

 wherein were <I>fiery serpents and scorpions.</I> The land of Canaan is
 at this day one of the most barren desolate countries in the world. 
 City and country are thus depopulated, <I>that the altars may be laid 
 waste and made desolate,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+6:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Rather than their idolatrous altars shall be left standing, both town 
 and country shall be laid in ruins. Sin is a desolating thing; 
 therefore <I>stand in awe and sin not.</I></P>
