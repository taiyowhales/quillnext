 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When we left the prophet, in the close of the foregoing chapter, so 
 pathetically poring out his prayers before God, we had reason to hope 
 that in this chapter we should find God reconciled to the land and the 
 prophet brought into a quiet composed frame; but, to our great 
 surprise, we find it much otherwise as to both. 

 I. Notwithstanding the prophet's prayers, God here ratifies the
 sentence given against the people, and abandons them to ruin turning a 
 deaf ear to all the intercessions made for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:1-9">ver. 1-9</A>.

 II. The prophet himself, notwithstanding the satisfaction he had in
 communion with God, still finds himself uneasy and out of temper. 

 1. He complains to God of his continual struggle with his persecutors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:10">ver. 10</A>.

 2. God assures him that he shall be taken under special protection,
 though there was a general desolation coming upon the land, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:11-14">ver. 11-14</A>.
 
 3. He appeals to God concerning his sincerity in the discharge of his 
 prophetic office and thinks it hard that he should not have more of the 
 comfort of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:15-18">ver. 15-18</A>.

 4. Fresh security is given him that, upon condition he continue 
 faithful, God will continue his care of him and his favour to him, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:19-21">ver. 19-21</A>.

 And thus, at length, we hope he regained the possession of his own 
 soul.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then said the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood
 before me, <I>yet</I> my mind <I>could</I> not <I>be</I> toward this people:
 cast <I>them</I> out of my sight, and let them go forth.
 &nbsp; 2  And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither
 shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Such as <I>are</I> for death, to death; and such as <I>are</I> for
 the sword, to the sword; and such as <I>are</I> for the famine, to the
 famine; and such as <I>are</I> for the captivity, to the captivity.
 &nbsp; 3  And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: the
 sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven,
 and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy.
 &nbsp; 4  And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the
 earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for
 <I>that</I> which he did in Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 5  For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall
 bemoan thee? or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest?
 &nbsp; 6  Thou hast forsaken me, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, thou art gone
 backward: therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and
 destroy thee; I am weary with repenting.
 &nbsp; 7  And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I
 will bereave <I>them</I> of children, I will destroy my people,
 <I>since</I> they return not from their ways.
 &nbsp; 8  Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas:
 I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a
 spoiler at noonday: I have caused <I>him</I> to fall upon it suddenly,
 and terrors upon the city.
 &nbsp; 9  She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the
 ghost; her sun is gone down while <I>it was</I> yet day: she hath been
 ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to
 the sword before their enemies, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We scarcely find any where more pathetic expressions of divine wrath 
 against a provoking people than we have here in these verses. The 
 prophet had prayed earnestly for them, and found some among them to 
 join with him; and yet not so much as a reprieve was gained, nor the 
 least mitigation of the judgment; but this answer is given to the 
 prophet's prayers, that the decree had gone forth, was irreversible, 
 and would shortly be executed. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What the sin was upon which this severe sentence was grounded. 

 1. It is in remembrance of a former iniquity; it is because of
 Manasseh, for that which he did in Jerusalem,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 What that was we are told, and that it was for it that Jerusalem was 
 destroyed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:3,4">2 Kings xxiv. 3, 4</A>.

 It was for his idolatry, and <I>the innocent blood which he shed, which 
 the Lord would not pardon.</I> He is called <I>the son of Hezekiah</I> 
 because his relation to so good a father was a great aggravation of his 
 sin, so far was it from being an excuse of it. The greatest part of a 
 generation was worn off since Manasseh's time, yet his sin is brought 
 into the account; as in Jerusalem's last ruin God brought upon it all 
 <I>the righteous blood shed on the earth,</I> to show how heavy the 
 guilt of blood will light and lie somewhere, sooner or later, and that 
 reprieves are not pardons.

 2. It is in consideration of their present impenitence. See how their 
 sin is described

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>Thou hast forsaken me,</I> my service and thy duty to me; <I>thou 
 hast gone backward</I> into the ways of contradiction, art become the 
 reverse of what thou shouldst have been and of what God by his law 
 would have led thee forward to." See how the impenitence is described 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>They return not from their ways,</I> the ways of their own hearts, 
 into the ways of God's commandments again. There is mercy for those who 
 have turned aside if they will return; but what favour can those expect 
 that persist in their apostasy?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What the sentence is. It is such as denotes no less than an utter 
 ruin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God himself abandons and abhors them: <I>My mind cannot be towards 
 them.</I> How can it be thought that the holy God should have any 
 remaining complacency in those that have such a rooted antipathy to 
 him? It is not in a passion, but with a just and holy indignation, that 
 he says, "<I>Cast them out of my sight,</I> as that which is in the 
 highest degree odious and offensive, and <I>let them go forth,</I> for 
 I will be troubled with them no more."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He will not admit any intercession to be made for them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):
 
 "<I>Though Moses and Samuel stood before me,</I> by prayer or sacrifice 
 to reconcile me to them, yet I could not be prevailed with to admit 
 them into favour." Moses and Samuel were two as great favourites of 
 Heaven as ever were the blessings of this earth, and were particularly 
 famed for the success of their mediation between God and his offending 
 people; many a time they would have been destroyed if Moses had not 
 stood before him in the breach; and to Samuel's prayers they owed their 
 lives 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+12:19">1 Sam. xii. 19</A>);

 yet even their intercessions should not prevail, no, not though they
 were now in a state of perfection, much less Jeremiah's who was now 
 <I>a man subject to like passions</I> as others. The putting of this
 as a case, <I>Though they should stand before me,</I> supposes that 
 they do not, and is an intimation that saints in heaven are not 
 intercessors for saints on earth. It is the prerogative of the Eternal 
 Word to be the only Mediator in <I>the other world,</I> whatever Moses, 
 and Samuel, and others were in this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He condemns them all to one destroying judgment or other. When God 
 casts them out of his presence, <I>whither shall they go forth?</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Certainly nowhere to be safe or easy, but to be met by one judgment 
 while they are pursued by another, till they find themselves surrounded 
 with mischiefs on all hands, so that they cannot escape; <I>Such as are 
 for death to death.</I> By death here is meant the pestilence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:8">Rev. vi. 8</A>),

 for it is death without visible means. <I>Such as are for death to 
 death,</I> or <I>for the sword to the sword;</I> every man shall perish 
 in that way that God has appointed: the law that appoints the 
 malefactor's death determines what death he shall die. Or, He that is 
 by his own choice for this judgment, let him take it, or for that, let 
 him take it, but by the one or the other they shall all fall and none 
 shall escape. It is a choice like that which David was put to, and was 
 thereby put into a <I>great strait,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:14">2 Sam. xxiv. 14</A>.

 <I>Captivity</I> is mentioned last, some think, because the sorest
 judgment of all, it being both a complication and continuance of 
 miseries. That of <I>the sword</I> is again repeated

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and is made the first of another four frightful set of destroyers, 
 which God will <I>appoint over them,</I> as officers over the soldiers, 
 to do what they please with them. As those that escape <I>the sword</I> 
 shall be cut off by pestilence, famine, or captivity, so those that 
 fall by the sword shall be cut off by divine vengeance, which pursues 
 sinners on the other side death; there shall be <I>dogs to tear</I> in 
 the field to devour. And, if there be any that think to outrun justice, 
 they shall be made the most public monuments of it: <I>They shall be 
 removed into all kingdoms of the earth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 like Cain, who, that he might be made a spectacle of horror to all, 
 became <I>a fugitive and a vagabond</I> in the earth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They shall fall without being relieved. Who can do any thing to help 
 them? for 

 (1.) God, even their own God (so he had been) appears against them:
 <I>I will stretch out my hand against thee,</I> which denotes a 
 deliberate determined stroke, which will reach far and wound deeply.
 <I>I am weary with repenting</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 it is a strange expression; they had behaved so provokingly, especially 
 by their treacherous professions of repentance, that they had put even 
 infinite patience itself to the stretch. God had often turned away his
 wrath when it was ready to break forth against them; but now he will 
 grant no more reprieves. Miserable is the case of those who have sinned 
 so long against God's mercy that at length they have sinned it away. 
 
 (2.) Their own country expels them, and is ready to <I>spue them
 out,</I> as it had done the Canaanites that were before them; for so it
 was threatened

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:28">Lev. xviii. 28</A>):

 <I>I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land,</I> in their 
 own gates, through which they shall be scattered, or <I>into the gates 
 of the earth,</I> into the cities of all the nations about them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 (3.) Their own children, that should assist them when they speak with 
 the enemy in the gate, shall be cut off from them: <I>I will bereave 
 them of children,</I> so that they shall have little hopes that the 
 next generation will retrieve their affairs, for <I>I will destroy my 
 people;</I> and, when the inhabitants are slain, the land will soon be 
 desolate. This melancholy article is enlarged upon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>,

 where we have,

 [1.] The destroyer brought upon them. When God has bloody work to do he 
 will find out bloody instruments to do it with. Nebuchadnezzar is here
 called <I>a spoiler at noon-day,</I> not a thief in the night, that is 
 afraid of being discovered, but one that without fear shall break 
 through and destroy all the fences of rights and properties, and this 
 in the face of the sun and in defiance of its light: <I>I have brought 
 against the mother a young man, a spoiler</I> (so some read it); for 
 Nebuchadnezzar, when he first invaded Judah, was but a <I>young 
 man,</I> in the first year of his reign. We read it, <I>I have brought 
 upon them,</I> even <I>against the mother of the young men, a 
 spoiler,</I> that is, against Jerusalem, a mother city, that had a very 
 numerous family of young men: or that invasion was in a particular 
 manner terrible to those mothers who had many sons fit for war, who 
 must now hazard their lives in the high places of the field, and, being 
 an unequal match for the enemy, would be likely to fall there, to the 
 inexpressible grief of their poor mothers, who had nursed them up with 
 a great deal of tenderness. The same God that brought the spoiler upon 
 them <I>caused him to fall upon it,</I> that is, upon the spoil 
 delivered to him, <I>suddenly</I> and by surprise; and then 
 <I>terrors</I> came <I>upon the city.</I> the original is very 
 abrupt--<I>the city and terrors. O the city!</I> what a consternation 
 will it then be in! <I>O the terrors</I> that shall then seize it! Then 
 the city and terrors shall be brought together, that seemed at a 
 distance from each other. <I>I will cause to fall suddenly upon her</I> 
 (upon Jerusalem) <I>a watcher and terrors;</I> so Mr. Gataker reads it, 
 for the word is used for a watcher 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:13,23">Dan. iv. 13, 23</A>),

 and the Chaldean soldiers were called watchers,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:16"><I>ch.</I> iv. 16</A>.

 [2.] The destruction made by this destroyer. A dreadful slaughter is
 here described. <I>First,</I> The wives are deprived of their husbands: 
 <I>Their widows are increased above the sand of the seas,</I> so 
 numerous have they now grown. It was promised that the men of Israel 
 (for those only were numbered) should be <I>as the sand of the sea for 
 multitude;</I> but now <I>they</I> shall be all cut off, and their 
 widows shall be so. But observe, God says, <I>They are increased to 
 me.</I> Though the husbands were cut off by the sword of his justice, 
 their poor widows were gathered in the arms of his mercy, who has taken 
 it among the titles of his honour to be <I>the God of the widows.</I> 
 Widows are said to be <I>taken into the number,</I> the number of those 
 whom God has a particular compassion and concern for. <I>Secondly,</I> 
 The parents are deprived of their children: <I>She that has borne 
 seven</I> sons, whom she expected to be the support and joy of her age, 
 now <I>languishes,</I> when she has seen them all cut off by the sword 
 in one day, who had been many years her burden and care. <I>She that 
 had many children has waxed feeble,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:5">1 Sam. ii. 5</A>.

 See what uncertain comforts children are; and let us therefore rejoice
 in them <I>as though we rejoiced not.</I> When the children are slain 
 the mother <I>gives up the ghost,</I> for her life was bound up in 
 theirs: <I>Her sun has gone down while it was yet day;</I> she is 
 bereaved of all her comforts just when she thought herself in the midst 
 of the enjoyment of them. She is now <I>ashamed and confounded</I> to 
 think how proud she was of her sons, how fond of them, and how much she 
 promised herself from them. Some understand, by this languishing 
 mother, Jerusalem lamenting the death of her inhabitants as 
 passionately as ever poor mother bewailed her children. Many are cut
 off already, <I>and the residue of them,</I> who have yet escaped, and, 
 as was hoped, were reserved to be the seed of another generation, even 
 these <I>will I deliver to the sword before their enemies</I> (as the 
 condemned malefactor is delivered to the sheriff to be executed), 
 <I>saith the Lord,</I> the Judge of heaven and earth, who, we are sure, 
 herein judges according to truth, though the judgment seem severe.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. They shall fall without being pitied 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>For who shall have pity on thee, O Jerusalem?</I> When thy God has 
 <I>cast thee out of his sight,</I> and his compassions fail and are 
 shut up from thee, neither thy enemies nor thy friends shall have any 
 compassion for thee. They shall have no sympathy with thee; they shall 
 not <I>bemoan thee</I> nor be sorry for thee; they shall have no 
 concern for thee, shall not go a step out of their way to <I>ask how 
 thou dost.</I>" For, 

 (1.) Their friends, who were expected to do these friendly offices, 
 were all involved with them in the calamities, and had enough to do to 
 bemoan themselves. 

 (2.) It was plain to all their neighbours that they had brought all 
 this misery upon themselves by their obstinacy in sin, and that they 
 might easily have prevented it by repentance and reformation, which 
 they were often in vain called to; and therefore <I>who can pity them? 
 O Israel! thou hast destroyed thyself.</I> Those will perish for ever 
 unpitied that might have been saved upon such easy terms and would not. 
 
 (3.) God will thus complete their misery. He will set their 
 acquaintance, as he did Job's at a distance from them; and his hand, 
 his righteous hand, is to be acknowledged in all the unkindnesses of 
 our friends, as well as in all the injuries done us by our foes.</P>

 Jeremiah has now returned from his public work and retired into his 
 closet; what passed between him and his God there we have an account of 
 in these and the following verses, which he published afterwards, to 
 affect the people with the weight and importance of his messages to 
 them. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The complaint which the prophet makes to God of the many 
 discouragements he met with in his work, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He met with a great deal of contradiction and opposition. He was a 
 <I>man of strife and contention to the whole land</I> (so it might be 
 read, rather than to <I>the whole earth,</I> for his business lay only 
 in that land); both city and country quarrelled with him, and set 
 themselves against him, and said and did all they could to thwart him. 
 He was a peaceable man, gave no provocation to any, nor was apt to 
 resent the provocations given him, and yet <I>a man of strife,</I> not 
 a man striving, but a man striven with; he was for peace, but, when he 
 spoke, they were for war. And, whatever they pretended, that which was 
 the real cause of their quarrels with him was his faithfulness to God 
 and to their souls. He showed them their sins that were working their 
 ruin, and put them into a way to prevent that ruin, which was the 
 greatest kindness he could do them; and yet this was it for which they 
 were incensed against him and looked upon him as their enemy. Even the 
 prince of peace himself was thus a man of strife, a sign spoken 
 against, continually <I>enduring the contradiction of sinners against 
 himself.</I> And the gospel of peace brings division, even to fire and 
 sword, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:34,35,Lu+12:49,51">Matt. x. 34, 35; Luke xii. 49, 51</A>.

 Now this made Jeremiah very uneasy, even to a degree of impatience. He
 cried out, <I>Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me,</I> as if 
 it were his mother's fault that she bore him, and he had better never 
 have been born than be born to such an uncomfortable life; nay, he is 
 angry that she had <I>borne him a man of strife,</I> as if he had been 
 fatally determined to this by the stars that were in the ascendant at 
 his birth. If he had any meaning of this kind, doubtless it was very 
 much his infirmity; we rather hope it was intended for no more than a 
 pathetic lamentation of his own case. Note,

 (1.) Even those who are most quiet and peaceable, if they serve God 
 faithfully, are often made men of strife. We can but <I>follow 
 peace;</I> we have the making only of one side of the bargain, and 
 therefore can but, <I>as much as in us lies, live peaceably.</I> 

 (2.) It is very uncomfortable to those who are of a peaceable
 disposition to live among those who are continually picking quarrels 
 with them. 

 (3.) Yet, if we cannot live so peaceably as we desire with our 
 neighbours, we must not be so disturbed at it as thereby to lose the 
 repose of our own minds and put ourselves upon the fret.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He met with a great deal of contempt, contumely, and reproach. They 
 every one of them cursed him; they branded him as a turbulent factious 
 man, as an incendiary and a sower of discord and sedition. They ought 
 to have blessed him, and to have blessed God for him; but they had 
 arrived at such a pitch of enmity against God and his word that for his 
 sake they cursed his messenger, spoke ill of him, wished ill to him, 
 did all they could to make him odious. They all did so; he had scarcely 
 one friend in Judah or Jerusalem that would give him a good word. Note, 
 It is often the lot of the best of men to have the worst of characters 
 ascribed to them. <I>So persecuted they the prophets.</I> But one would 
 be apt to suspect that surely Jeremiah had given them some provocation, 
 else he could not have lost himself thus: no, not the least: <I>I have
 neither lent</I> money <I>nor borrowed</I> money, have been neither 
 creditor nor debtor; for so general is the signification of the words 
 here. 

 (1.) It is implied here that those who deal much in the business of 
 this world are often involved thereby in strife and contention; <I>meum 
 et tuum--mine and thine</I> are the great make-bates; lenders and 
 borrowers sue and are sued, and great dealers often get a great deal of 
 ill-will. 

 (2.) it was an instance of Jeremiah's great prudence, and it is written 
 for our learning, that, being called to be a prophet, he <I>entangled 
 not himself in the affairs of this life,</I> but kept clear from them, 
 that he might apply the more closely to the business of his profession 
 and might not give the least shadow of suspicion that he aimed at 
 secular advantages in it nor any occasion to his neighbours to contend 
 with him. He <I>put out</I> no money, for he was no usurer, nor indeed 
 had he any money to lend: he <I>took up</I> no money, for he was no 
 purchaser, no merchant, no spendthrift. He was perfectly dead to this 
 world and the things of it: a very little served to keep him, and we 
 find

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:2"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 2</A>)

 that he had neither wife nor children to keep. And yet,

 (3.) Though he behaved thus discreetly, and so as one would think
 should have gained him universal esteem, yet he lay under a general 
 odium, through the iniquity of the times. Blessed be God, bad as things 
 are with us, they are not so bad but that there are those with whom 
 virtue has its praise; yet let not those who behave most prudently 
 think it strange if they have not the respect and esteem they deserve.
 <I>Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The answer which God gave to this complaint. Though there was in it 
 a mixture of passion and infirmity, yet God graciously took cognizance 
 of it, because it was <I>for his sake</I> that the prophet suffered 
 reproach. In this answer, 

 1. God assures him that he should weather the storm and be made easy at
 last,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Though his neighbours quarrelled with him for what he did in the 
 discharge of his office, yet God accepted him and promised to stand by 
 him. It is in the original expressed in the form of an oath: "<I>If 
 I</I> take not care of thee, let me never be counted faithful; 
 <I>verily it shall go well with thy remnant,</I> with the remainder of 
 thy life" (for so the word signifies); "the residue of thy days shall 
 be more comfortable to thee than those hitherto have been." <I>Thy end 
 shall be good;</I> so the Chaldee reads it. Note, It is a great and 
 sufficient support to the people of God that, how troublesome soever 
 their way may be, it shall be well with them in their latter end, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:37">Ps. xxxvii. 37</A>.

 They have still a <I>remnant,</I> a <I>residue,</I> something behind
 and left in reserve, which will be sufficient to counterbalance all 
 their grievances, and the hope of it may serve to make them easy. It
 should seem that Jeremiah, besides the vexation that his people gave 
 him, was uneasy at the apprehension he had of sharing largely in the 
 public judgments which he foresaw coming; and, though he mentioned not 
 this, God replied to his thought of it, as to Moses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:19">Exod. iv. 19</A>.

 Jeremiah thought, "If my friends are thus abusive to me, what will my
 enemies be?" And God had thought fit to awaken in him an expectation of 
 this kind,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:5"><I>ch.</I> xii. 5</A>.

 But here he quiets his mind with this promise: "<I>Verily I will cause
 the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil,</I> when all about 
 thee shall be laid waste." Note, God has all men's hearts in his hand, 
 and can turn those to favour his servants whom they were most afraid 
 of. And the prophets of the Lord have often met with fairer and better
 treatment among open enemies than among those that call themselves his 
 people. When we see trouble coming, and it looks very threatening, let 
 us not despair, but hope in God, because it may prove better than we 
 expect. This promise was accomplished when Nebuchadnezzar, having taken 
 the city, charged the captain of the guard to be kind to Jeremiah, and 
 let him have every thing he had a mind to,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+39:11,12"><I>ch.</I> xxxix. 11, 12</A>.

 The following words, <I>Shall iron break the northern iron, and the
 steel,</I> or <I>brass?</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 being compared with the promise of God made to Jeremiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:18"><I>ch.</I> i. 18</A>),

 that he would make him an <I>iron pillar</I> and <I>brazen walls,</I>
 seem intended for his comfort. They were continually clashing with him, 
 and were rough and hard as iron; but Jeremiah, being armed with power 
 and courage from on high, is as northern iron, which is naturally 
 stronger, and as steel, which is hardened by art; and therefore they 
 shall not prevail against him; compare this with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+2:6,3:8,9">Ezek. ii. 6; iii. 8, 9</A>.

 He might the better bear their quarrelling with him when he was sure of
 the victory.

 2. God assures him that his enemies and persecutors should be lost in 
 the storm, should be ruined at last, and that therein the word of God 
 in his mouth should be accomplished and he proved a true prophet,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 God here turns his speech from the prophet to the people. To them also 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>

 may be applied: <I>Shall iron break the northern iron, and the 
 steel?</I> Shall their courage and strength, and the most hardly and 
 vigorous of their efforts, be able to contest either with the counsel 
 of God or with the army of the Chaldeans, which are as inflexible, as 
 invincible, as the northern iron and steel. Let them therefore hear 
 their doom: <I>Thy substance and thy treasure will I give to the 
 spoil,</I> and that <I>without price;</I> the spoilers shall have it 
 <I>gratis;</I> it shall be to them a cheap and easy prey. Observe, The
 prophet was poor; he neither lent nor borrowed; he had nothing to lose, 
 neither <I>substance.</I> nor <I>treasure,</I> and therefore the enemy 
 will treat him well, <I>Cantabit vacuus coram latrone viator--The 
 traveller that has no property about him will congratulate himself when 
 accosted by a robber.</I> But the people that had great estates in 
 money and land would be slain for what they had, or the enemy, finding 
 they had much, would use them hardly, to make them confess more. And it 
 is their own iniquity that herein corrects them: It is <I>for all thy 
 sins, even in all thy borders.</I> All parts of the country, even those 
 which lay most remote, had contributed to the national guilt, and all 
 shall now be brought to account. Let not one tribe lay the blame upon 
 another, but each take shame to itself: It is for <I>all thy sins in 
 all thy borders.</I> Thus shall they stay at home till they see their 
 estates ruined, and then they shall be carried into captivity, to spend 
 the sad remains of a miserable life in slavery: "<I>I will make thee to 
 pass with thy enemies,</I> who shall lead thee in triumph <I>into a 
 land that thou knowest not,</I> and therefore canst expect to find no 
 comfort in it." All this is the fruit of God's wrath: "It is <I>a fire 
 kindled in my anger, which shall burn upon you,</I> and, if not 
 extinguished in time, will burn eternally."</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge
 me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know
 that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke.
 &nbsp; 16  Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was
 unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by
 thy name, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of hosts.

 sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with

 bring thee again, <I>and</I> thou shalt stand before me: and if thou
 take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth:
 let them return unto thee; but return not thou unto them.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, as before, we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The prophet's humble address to God, containing a representation 
 both of his integrity and of the hardships he underwent 
 notwithstanding. It is a matter of comfort to us that, whatever ails 
 us, we have a God to go to, before whom we may spread our case and to 
 whose omniscience we may appeal, as the prophet here, "<I>O Lord! thou 
 knowest;</I> thou knowest my sincerity, which men are resolved they 
 will not acknowledge; thou knowest my distress, which men disdain to 
 take notice of." Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What it is that the prophet prays for, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 (1.) That God would consider his case and be mindful of him: "<I>O 
 Lord! remember me;</I> think upon me for good." 

 (2.) That God would communicate strength and comfort to him: "<I>Visit 
 me;</I> not only remember me, but let me know that thou rememberest me, 
 that thou art nigh unto me." 

 (3.) That he would appear for him against those that did him wrong: 
 <I>Revenge me of my persecutors,</I> or rather, <I>Vindicate me from my 
 persecutors;</I> give judgment against them, and let that judgment be 
 executed so far as is necessary for my vindication and to compel them 
 to acknowledge that they have done me wrong. Further than this a good 
 man will not desire that God should avenge him. Let something be done 
 to convince the world that (whatever blasphemers say to the contrary) 
 Jeremiah is a righteous man and the God whom he serves is a righteous 
 God. 

 (4.) That he would yet spare him and continue him in the land of the 
 living: "<I>Take me not away</I> by a sudden stroke, but <I>in thy 
 long-suffering</I> lengthen out my days." The best men will own 
 themselves so obnoxious to God's wrath that they are indebted to his 
 patience for the continuance of their lives. Or, "While thou exercisest 
 long-suffering towards my persecutors, let not them prevail to take me 
 away." Though in a passion he complained of his birth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 yet he desires here that his death might not be hastened; for life is 
 sweet to nature, and the life of a useful man is so to grace. <I>I
 pray not that thou shouldst take them out of the world.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What it is that he pleads with God for mercy and relief against his 
 enemies, persecutors, and slanderers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That God's honour was interested in this case: <I>Know,</I> and 
 make it known, <I>that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke.</I> Those 
 that lay themselves open to reproach by their own fault and folly have 
 great reason to bear it patiently, but no reason to expect that God 
 should appear for them. But if it is for doing well that we suffer ill, 
 and for righteousness' sake that we have all manner of evil said 
 against us, we may hope that God will vindicate our honour with his 
 own. To the same purport 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 <I>I am called by thy name, O Lord of hosts!</I> It was for that reason 
 that his enemies hated him, and therefore for that reason he promised 
 himself that God would own him and stand by him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That the word of God, which he was employed to preach to others, 
 he had experienced the power and pleasure of in his own soul, and 
 therefore had the graces of the Spirit to qualify him for the divine 
 favour, as well as his gifts. We find some rejected of God who yet 
 could say, <I>Lord, we have prophesied in thy name.</I> But Jeremiah 
 could say more 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 "<I>Thy words were found,</I> found <I>by me</I>" (he searched the 
 scripture, diligently studied the law, and found that in it which was 
 reviving to him: if we seek we shall find), "found <I>for me</I>" (the 
 words which he was to deliver to others were laid ready to his hand, 
 were brought to him by inspiration), "<I>and I did</I> not only taste 
 them, but <I>eat them,</I> received them entirely, conversed with them 
 intimately; they were welcome to me, as food to one that is hungry; I 
 entertained them, digested them, turned them <I>in succum et 
 sanguinem--into blood and spirits,</I> and was myself delivered into 
 the mould of those truths which I was to deliver to others." The 
 prophet was told to <I>eat the roll,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+2:8,Re+10:9">Ezek. ii. 8; Rev. x. 9</A>.

 <I>I did eat it</I>--that is, as it follows, it <I>was to me the joy 
 and rejoicing of my heart,</I> nothing could be more agreeable.
 Understand it,

 [1.] Of the message itself which he was to deliver. Though he was to
 foretel the ruin of his country, which was dear to him, and in the ruin 
 of which he could not but have a deep share, yet all natural affections 
 were swallowed up in zeal for God's glory, and even these messages of 
 wrath, being divine messages, were a satisfaction to him. He also 
 rejoiced, at first, in hope that the people would take warning and 
 prevent the judgment. Or, 

 [2.] Of the commission he received to deliver this message. Though the 
 work he was called to was not attended with any secular advantages, 
 but, on the contrary, exposed him to contempt and persecution, yet, 
 because it put him in a way to serve God and do good, he took pleasure 
 in it, was glad to be so employed, and it was his <I>meat and drink to 
 do the will of him that sent him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:34">John iv. 34</A>.
 
 Or,

 [3.] Of the promise God gave him that he would assist and own him in 
 his work

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:18"><I>ch.</I> i. 8</A>);

 he was satisfied in that, and depended upon it, and therefore hoped it
 should not fail him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) That he had applied himself to the duty of his office with all 
 possible gravity, seriousness, and self-denial, though he had had of 
 late but little satisfaction in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 [1.] It was his comfort that he had given up himself wholly to the 
 business of his office and had done nothing either to divert himself 
 from it or disfit himself for it. He kept no unsuitable company,
 denied himself the use even of lawful recreations, abstained from every 
 thing that looked like levity, lest thereby he should make himself mean 
 and less regarded. He <I>sat alone,</I> spent a great deal of time in 
 his closet, <I>because of the hand</I> of the Lord that was strong upon 
 him to carry him on his work, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:14">Ezek. iii. 14</A>.

 "<I>For thou hast filled me with indignation,</I> with such messages of
 wrath against this people as have made me always pensive." Note, It 
 will be a comfort to God's ministers, when men despise them, if they 
 have the testimony of their consciences for them that they have not by 
 any vain foolish behaviour made themselves despicable, that they have 
 been dead not only to the wealth of the world, as this prophet was

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 but to the pleasures of it too, as here. But,

 [2.] It is his complaint that he had had but little pleasure in his 
 work. It was at first the rejoicing of his heart, but of late it had 
 made him melancholy, so that he had no heart to <I>sit in the meeting 
 of those that make merry.</I> He cared not for company, for indeed no 
 company cared for him. He <I>sat alone,</I> fretting at the people's 
 obstinacy and the little success of his labours among them. This filled 
 him with a holy <I>indignation.</I> Note, It is the folly and infirmity 
 of some good people that they lose much of the pleasantness of their 
 religion by the fretfulness and uneasiness of their natural temper, 
 which they humour and indulge, instead of mortifying it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) He throws himself upon God's pity and promise in a very passionate 
 expostulation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "<I>Why is my pain perpetual,</I> and nothing done to ease it? Why are 
 the wounds which my enemies are continually giving both to my peace and 
 to my reputation incurable, and nothing done to retrieve either my 
 comfort or my credit? I once little thought that I should be thus 
 neglected; will the God that has promised me his presence <I>be to me 
 as a liar,</I> the God on whom I depend to be me <I>as waters that 
 fail?</I>" We are willing to make the best we can of it, and to take it 
 as an appeal,

 [1.] To the mercy of God: "I know he will not let the pain of his 
 servant be perpetual, but he will ease it, will not let his wound be 
 incurable, but he will heal it; and therefore I will not despair." 

 [2.] To his faithfulness: "<I>Wilt thou be to me as a liar?</I> No; I 
 know thou wilt not. God is not a man that he should lie. The fountain 
 of life will never be to his people as <I>waters that fail.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God's gracious answer to this address, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:19-21"><I>v.</I> 19-21</A>.

 Though the prophet betrayed much human frailty in his address, yet God 
 vouchsafed to answer him with good words and comfortable words; for he 
 knows our frame. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What God here requires of him as the condition of the further 
 favours he designed him. Jeremiah had done and suffered much for God, 
 yet God is no debtor to him, but he is still upon his good behaviour. 
 God will own him. But, 

 (1.) He must recover his temper, and be reconciled to his work, and 
 friends with it again, and not quarrel with it any more as he had done. 
 He must <I>return,</I> must shake off these distrustful discontented 
 thoughts and passions, and not give way to them, must regain the 
 peaceable possession and enjoyment of himself, and resolve to be easy. 
 Note, When we have stepped aside into any disagreeable frame or way our 
 care must be to return and compose ourselves into a right temper of 
 mind again; and <I>then</I> we may expect God will help us, if thus we 
 endeavour to help ourselves. 

 (2.) He must resolve to be faithful in his work, for he could not 
 expect the divine protection any longer than he did approve himself so. 
 Though there was no cause at all to charge Jeremiah with 
 unfaithfulness, and God knew his heart to be sincere, yet God saw fit 
 to give him this caution. Those that do their duty must not take it ill 
 to be told their duty. In two things he must be faithful:--

 [1.] He must distinguish between some and others of those he preached 
 to: Thou must <I>take forth the precious from the vile.</I> The 
 righteous are the precious be they ever so mean and poor; the wicked 
 are the vile be they ever so rich and great. In our congregations these 
 are mixed, wheat and chaff in the same floor; we cannot distinguish 
 them by name, but we must by character, and must give to each a 
 portion, speaking comfort to precious saints and terror to vile 
 sinners, neither <I>making the heart of the righteous sad</I> nor 
 <I>strengthening the hands of the wicked</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:22">Ezek. xiii. 22</A>),

 but <I>rightly dividing the word of truth.</I> Ministers must take
 those whom they see to be precious into their bosoms, and not <I>sit 
 alone</I> as Jeremiah did, but keep up conversation with those they may 
 do good to and get good by.

 [2.] He must closely adhere to his instructions, and not in the least 
 vary from them: <I>Let them return to thee, but return not thou to 
 them,</I> that is, he must do the utmost he can, in his preaching, to 
 bring people up to the mind of God; he must tell them they must, at 
 their peril, comply with that. Those that had flown off from him, that 
 did not like the terms upon which God's favour was offered to them, 
 "<I>Let them return to thee,</I> and, upon second thoughts, come up to 
 the terms and strike the bargain; but do not thou <I>return to 
 them,</I> do not compliment them, nor comply with them, nor think to 
 make the matter easier to them than the word of God has made it." Men's 
 hearts and lives must come up to God's law and comply with that, for 
 God's law will never come down to them nor comply with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What God here promises to him upon the performance of these 
 conditions. If he approve himself well, 

 (1.) God will tranquilize his mind and pacify the present tumult of his 
 spirits: <I>If thou return, I will bring thee again,</I> will 
 <I>restore thy soul,</I> as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+23:3">Ps. xxiii. 3</A>.

 The best and strongest saints, if at any time they have gone aside out
 of the right way, and are determined to return, need the grace of God 
 to bring them again.

 (2.) God will employ him in his service as a prophet, whose work, even 
 in those bad times, had comfort and honour enough in it to be its own 
 wages: "<I>Thou shalt stand before me,</I> to receive instructions from 
 me, as a servant from his master; and <I>thou shalt be as my mouth</I> 
 to deliver my messages to the people, as an ambassador is the mouth of 
 the prince that sends him." Note, Faithful ministers are God's mouth to 
 us; they are so to look upon themselves, and to speak God's mind and 
 <I>as becomes the oracles of God;</I> and we are so to look upon them, 
 and to hear God speaking to us by them. Observe, If thou keep close to 
 thy instructions, <I>thou shalt be as my mouth,</I> not otherwise; so 
 far, and no further, God will stand by ministers, as they go by the 
 written word. "<I>Thou shalt be as my mouth,</I> that is, what thou 
 sayest shall be made good, as if I myself had said it." See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:26,1Sa+3:19">Isa. xliv. 26; 1 Sam. iii. 19</A>.

 (3.) He shall have strength and courage to face the many difficulties 
 he meets with in his work, and his spirit shall not fail again as now 
 it does

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 "<I>I will make thee unto this people as a fenced brazen wall,</I> 
 which the storm batters and beats violently upon, but cannot shake. 
 <I>Return not thou to them</I> by any sinful compliances, and then 
 trust thy God to arm thee by his grace with holy resolutions. Be not 
 cowardly, and God will make thee daring." He had complained that he was 
 made a <I>man of strife.</I> "Expect to be so (says God); they will 
 <I>fight against thee,</I> they will still continue their opposition, 
 <I>but they shall not prevail against thee</I> to drive thee off from 
 thy work nor to cut thee off from the land of the living." 

 (4.) He shall have God for his protector and mighty deliverer: <I>I am 
 with thee to save thee.</I> Those that have God with them have a 
 Saviour with them who has wisdom and strength enough to deal with the 
 most formidable enemy; and those that are with God, and faithful to 
 him, he will deliver

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>)

 either from trouble or through it. They may perhaps fall <I>into the 
 hand of the wicked,</I> and they may appear terrible to them, but God 
 will rescue them <I>out of their hands.</I> They shall not be able to 
 kill them till they have finished their testimony; they shall not 
 prevent their happiness. God will so deliver them as to <I>preserve 
 them to his heavenly kingdom</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:18">2 Tim. iv. 18</A>),

 and that is deliverance enough. There are many things that appear very
 frightful that yet do not prove at all hurtful to a good man.</P>
