 Still God is justifying himself in the desolations he is about to bring 
 upon Jerusalem; and very largely, in this chapter, he shows the 
 prophet, and orders him to show the people, that he did but punish them 
 as their sins deserved. In the foregoing chapter he had compared 
 Jerusalem to an unfruitful vine, that was fit for nothing but the fire; 
 in this chapter he compares it to an adulteress, that, in justice, 
 ought to be abandoned and exposed, and he must therefore show the 
 people their abominations, that they might see how little reason they 
 had to complain of the judgments they were under. In this long 
 discourse are set forth, 

 I. The despicable and deplorable beginnings of that church and nation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>.

 II. The many honours and favours God had bestowed upon them, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:6-14">ver. 6-14</A>.
 
 III. Their treacherous and ungrateful departures from him to the
 services and worship of idols, here represented by the most impudent 
 whoredom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:15-34">ver. 15-34</A>.

 IV. A threatening of terrible destroying judgments, which God would
 bring upon them for this sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:35-43">ver. 35-43</A>.

 V. An aggravation both of their sin and of their punishment, by
 comparison with Sodom and Samaria, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:44-59">ver. 44-59</A>.

 VI. A promise of mercy in the close, which God would show to a penitent 
 remnant, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:60-63">ver. 60-63</A>.
 
 And this is designed for admonition to us.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Again the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,
 &nbsp; 3  And say, Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> unto Jerusalem; Thy birth
 and thy nativity <I>is</I> of the land of Canaan; thy father <I>was</I> an
 Amorite, and thy mother a Hittite.
 &nbsp; 4  And <I>as for</I> thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy
 navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple
 <I>thee;</I> thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.
 &nbsp; 5  None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have
 compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field,
 to the loathing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born.

 Ezekiel is now among the captives in Babylon; but, as Jeremiah at 
 Jerusalem wrote for the use of the captives though they had Ezekiel 
 upon the spot with them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=eze+29:1-21"><I>ch.</I> xxix.</A>),

 so Ezekiel wrote for the use of Jerusalem, though Jeremiah himself was
 resident there; and yet they were far from looking upon it as an 
 affront to one another's help both by preaching and writing. Jeremiah 
 wrote to the captives for their consolation, which was the thing they 
 needed; Ezekiel here is directed to write to the inhabitants of 
 Jerusalem for their conviction and humiliation, which was the thing 
 they needed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. This is his commission 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>Cause Jerusalem to know her abominations</I> (that is, her sins); 
 set them in order before her." Note, 

 1. Sins are not only <I>provocations</I> which God is angry at, but
 <I>abominations</I> which he hates, as contrary to his nature, and 
 which we ought to hate, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+44:4">Jer. xliv. 4</A>.

 2. The sins of Jerusalem are in a special manner so. The practice of 
 profaneness appears most odious in those that make a profession of 
 religion. 

 3. Though Jerusalem is a place of great knowledge, yet she is loth
 <I>to know her abominations;</I> so partial are men in their own favour 
 that they are hardly made to see and own their own badness, but deny 
 it, palliate or extenuate it. 

 4. It is requisite that we should know our sins, that we may confess 
 them, and may justify God in what he brings upon us for them. 

 5. It is the work of ministers to cause sinners, sinners in Jerusalem,
 <I>to know their abominations,</I> to set before them the glass of the 
 law, that in it they may see their own deformities and defilements, to 
 tell them plainly of their faults. <I>Thou art the man.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That Jerusalem may be made <I>to know her abominations,</I> and 
 particularly the abominable ingratitude she had been guilty of, it was 
 requisite that she should be put in mind of the great things God had 
 done for her, as the aggravations of her bad conduct towards him; and, 
 to magnify those favours, she is in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:1-5">these verses</A>

 made to know the meanness and baseness of her original, from what poor 
 beginnings God raised her, and how unworthy she was of his favour and 
 of the honour he had put upon her. Jerusalem is here put for the
 Jewish church and nation, which is here compared to an outcast child, 
 base-born and abandoned, which the mother herself has no affection nor 
 concern for.

 1. The extraction of the Jewish nation was mean: "<I>Thy birth is of
 the land of Canaan</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 thou hadst from the very first the spirit and disposition of a 
 Canaanite." The patriarchs dwelt in Canaan, and they were there but 
 <I>strangers and sojourners,</I> had no possession, no power, not one 
 foot of ground of their own but a burying-place. Abraham and Sarah were 
 indeed their <I>father and mother,</I> but they were only inmates with 
 the Amorites and Hittites, who, having the dominion, seemed to be as 
 parents to the seed of Abraham, witness the court Abraham made to the 
 <I>children of Seth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+23:4,8">Gen. xxiii. 4, 8</A>),

 the dependence they had upon their neighbours the Canaanites, and the
 fear they were in of them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:7,34:30">Gen. xiii. 7; xxxiv. 30</A>.

 If the patriarchs, at their first coming to Canaan, had conquered it,
 and made themselves masters of it, this would have put an honour upon 
 their family and would have looked great in history; but, instead of 
 that, they <I>went from one nation to another</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:13">Ps. cv. 13</A>),

 as tenants from one farm to another, almost as beggars from one door to
 another, when they <I>were but few in number,</I> yea, very few. And 
 yet this was not the worst; their fathers had <I>served other gods in 
 Ur of the Chaldees</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:2">Josh. xxiv. 2</A>);

 even in Jacob's family there were <I>strange gods,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:2">Gen. xxxv. 2</A>.

 Thus early had they a genius leading them to idolatry; and upon this
 account their ancestors were Amorites and Hittites.

 2. When they first began to multiply their condition was really very 
 deplorable, like that of a new-born child, which must of necessity die 
 from the womb if the knees prevent it not, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:11,12">Job iii. 11, 12</A>.

 The children of Israel, when they began to increase into a people and
 became considerable, were thrown out from the country that was intended 
 for them; a famine drove them thence. Egypt was <I>the open field</I> 
 into which they were cast; there they had no protection or countenance 
 from the government they were under, but, on the contrary, were ruled 
 with rigour, and their lives embittered; they had no encouragement 
 given them to build up their families, no help to build up their 
 estates, no friends or allies to strengthen their interests. Joseph, 
 who had been the <I>shepherd and stone of Israel,</I> was dead; the 
 king of Egypt, who should have been kind to them for Joseph's sake, set 
 himself to <I>destroy this man-child as soon as it was born</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:4">Rev. xii. 4</A>),

 ordered all the males to be slain, which, it is likely, occasioned the 
 exposing of many as well as Moses, to which perhaps the similitude here 
 has reference. The founders of nations and cities had occasion for all 
 the arts and arms they were masters of, set their heads on work, by 
 policies and stratagems, to preserve and nurse up their infant states. 
 <I>Tant&aelig; molis erat Romanam condere gentem--So vast were the 
 efforts requisite to the establishment of the Roman name.</I> Virgil. 
 But the nation of Israel had no such care taken of it, no such pains 
 taken with it, as Athens, Sparta, Rome, and other commonwealths had 
 when they were first founded, but, on the contrary, was doomed to 
 destruction, like an infant new-born, exposed to wind and weather, 
 <I>the navel-string not cut,</I> the poor babe <I>not washed,</I> not 
 clothed, <I>no swaddled,</I> because not <I>pitied,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 Note, We owe the preservation of our infant lives to the natural pity 
 and compassion which the God of nature has put into the hearts of 
 parents and nurses towards new-born children. This infant is said to be 
 <I>cast out, to the loathing of her person;</I> it was a sign that she 
 was loathed by those that bore her, and she appeared loathsome to all 
 that looked upon her. <I>The Israelites were an abomination to the 
 Egyptians,</I> as we find 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+43:32,46:34">Gen. xliii. 32; xlvi. 34</A>.

 Some think that this refers to the corrupt and vicious disposition of
 that people from their beginning: they were not only the weakest and 
 <I>fewest of all people</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:7">Deut. vii. 7</A>),

 but the worst and most ill-humoured of all people. <I>God giveth thee
 this good land, not for thy righteousness, for thou art a stiff-necked 
 people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:6">Deut. ix. 6</A>.
 
 And Moses tells them there

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 <I>You have been rebellious against the Lord from the day that I knew 
 you.</I> They were not <I>suppled,</I> nor <I>washed,</I> nor 
 <I>swaddled;</I> they were not at all tractable or manageable, nor cast 
 into any good shape. God took them to be his people, not because he saw 
 any thing in them inviting or promising, but <I>so it seemed good in 
 his sight.</I> And it is a very apt illustration of the miserable 
 condition of all the children of men by nature. <I>As for</I> our 
 <I>nativity, in the day that we were born</I> we were shapen in 
 iniquity and conceived in sin, our understandings darkened, our minds 
 alienated from the life of God, polluted with sin, which rendered us 
 loathsome in the eyes of God. <I>Marvel not</I> then that we are told,
 <I>You must be born again.</I></P>

 In there verses we have an account of the great things which God did 
 for the Jewish nation in raising them up by degrees to be very 
 considerable. 

 1. God saved them from the ruin they were upon the brink of in Egypt

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>When I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thy own blood,</I> 
 loathed and abandoned, and appointed to die, <I>as sheep for the 
 slaughter,</I> then <I>I said unto thee, Live.</I> I designed thee for 
 life when thou wast doomed to destruction, and resolved to save thee 
 from death." Those shall live to whom God commands life. God looked 
 upon the world of mankind as thus cast off, thus cast out, thus 
 polluted, thus weltering in blood, and his thoughts towards it were 
 thoughts of good, designing it <I>life, and that more abundantly.</I> 
 By converting grace, he says to the soul, <I>Live.</I> 

 2. He looked upon them with kindness and a tender affection, not only 
 pitied them, but <I>set his love upon them,</I> which was 
 unaccountable, for there was nothing lovely in them; but <I>I looked 
 upon thee,</I> and, <I>behold, thy time was the time of love,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 It was <I>the kindness and love of God our Saviour</I> that sent Christ 
 to redeem us, that sends the Spirit to sanctify us, that brought us out 
 of a state of nature into a state of grace. That <I>was a time of 
 love</I> indeed, distinguishing love, when God manifested his love to 
 us, and courted our love to him. <I>Then was I in his eyes as one that 
 found favour,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:10">Cant. viii. 10</A>.

 3. He took them under his protection: "<I>I spread my skirt over
 thee,</I> to shelter thee from wind and weather, and to <I>cover thy 
 nakedness,</I> that the shame of it might not appear." Boaz <I>spread 
 his skirt over</I> Ruth, in token of the special favour he designed 
 her, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+3:9">Ruth iii. 9</A>.

 God took them into his care, as an <I>eagle bears her young ones upon
 her wings,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:11,12">Deut. xxxii. 11, 12</A>.

 When God owned them for his people, and sent Moses to Egypt to deliver
 them, which was an expression of the good-will of him <I>that dwelt in 
 the bush,</I> then he <I>spread his skirt over them.</I>

 4. He cleared them from the reproachful character which their bondage 
 in Egypt laid them under

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>Then washed I thee with water,</I> to make thee clean, <I>and 
 anointed thee with oil,</I> to make thee sweet and supple thee." All 
 the disgrace of their slavery was rolled away when they were brought, 
 <I>with a high hand and a stretched-out arm, into the glorious liberty 
 of the children of God.</I> When God said, <I>Israel is my son, my 
 first-born--Let my people go, that they may serve me,</I> that word, 
 backed as it was with so many works of wonder, <I>thoroughly washed 
 away their blood;</I> and when God led them under the convoy of <I>the 
 pillar of cloud and fire</I> he <I>spread his skirt over them.</I> 

 5. He multiplied them and built them up into a people. This is here
 mentioned

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>)

 before his <I>spreading his skirt over them,</I> because <I>their 
 numbers increased exceedingly</I> while they were yet bond-slaves in 
 Egypt. They <I>multiplied as the bud of the field</I> in spring time; 
 they <I>waxed great, exceedingly mighty,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+1:7,20">Exod. i. 7, 20</A>.

 Their <I>breasts were fashioned</I> when they were formed into distinct
 tribes and had officers of their own

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+5:19">Exod. v. 19</A>);

 their <I>hair grew</I> when they grew numerous, whereas they had been
 <I>naked and bare,</I> very few and therefore contemptible.

 6. He admitted them into covenant with himself. See what glorious 
 nuptials this poor forlorn infant is preferred to at last. How she is 
 dignified who at first had scarcely her life <I>given her for a prey: I 
 swore unto thee and entered into covenant with thee.</I> This was done 
 at Mount Sinai: "when the covenant between God and Israel was sealed 
 and ratified then <I>thou becamest mine.</I>" God called them his 
 people, and himself the God of Israel. Note, Those to whom God gives 
 spiritual life he takes into covenant with himself; by that covenant 
 they become his subjects and servants, which intimates their duty--his 
 portion, his treasure, which intimates their privilege; and it is 
 <I>confirmed with an oath, that we might have strong consolation.</I> 

 7. He beautified and adorned them. This maid cannot forget her
 ornaments, and she is gratified with abundance of them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:10-13"><I>v.</I> 10-13</A>.

 We need not be particular in the application of these. Her wardrobe was 
 well furnished with rich apparel; they had <I>embroidered work</I> to 
 wear, shoes of fine <I>badgers' skins, linen</I> girdles, and 
 <I>silk</I> veils, <I>bracelets</I> and <I>necklaces, jewels</I> and 
 <I>ear-rings,</I> and even <I>a beautiful crown,</I> or coronet. 
 Perhaps this may refer to the jewels and other rich goods which they 
 took from the Egyptians, which might well be spoken of thus long after 
 as a merciful circumstance of their deliverance, when it was spoken of 
 long before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:14">Gen. xv. 14</A>.

 <I>They shall come out with great substance.</I> Or it may be taken
 figuratively for all those blessings of heaven which adorned both their 
 church and state. In a little time they came to <I>excellent 
 ornaments,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The laws and ordinances which God gave them were to them as 
 <I>ornaments of grace to the head and chains about the neck,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:9">Prov. i. 9</A>.

 God's sanctuary, which he set up among them, was <I>a beautiful crown 
 upon their head;</I> it was the <I>beauty of holiness.</I> 

 8. He fed them with abundance, with plenty, with dainty: <I>Thou didst 
 eat fine flour, and honey, and oil</I>--manna, angels' food--<I>honey 
 out of the rock, oil out of the flinty rock.</I> In Canaan they did eat 
 bread to the full, the finest of the wheat, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:13,14">Deut. xxxii. 13, 14</A>.

 Those whom God takes into covenant with himself are fed with the bread
 of life, clothed with the robe of righteousness, adorned with the 
 graces and comforts of the spirit. The <I>hidden man of the heart is 
 that which is incorruptible.</I>

 9. He gave them great reputation among their neighbours, and made them
 considerable, acceptable to their friends and allies and formidable to 
 their adversaries: <I>Thou didst prosper into a kingdom</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 which speaks both dignity and dominion; and, <I>They renown went forth 
 among the heathen for thy beauty,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 The nations about had their eye upon them, and admired them for the 
 excellent laws by which they were governed, the privilege they had of 
 access to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:7,8">Deut. iv. 7, 8</A>.

 Solomon's wisdom, and Solomon's temple, were very much <I>the 
 renown</I> of that nation; and, if we put all the privileges of the 
 Jewish church and kingdom together, we must own that it was the most 
 accomplished beauty of all the nations of the earth. The beauty of it
 was perfect; you could not name the thing that would be the honour of a 
 people but it was to be found in Israel, in David's and Solomon's time, 
 when that kingdom was in its zenith-piety, learning, wisdom, justice, 
 victory, peace, wealth, and all sure to continue if they had kept close 
 to God. <I>It was perfect, saith God, through my comeliness which I had 
 put upon thee,</I> through the beauty of their holiness, as they were a 
 people set apart for God, and devoted to him, to be to him <I>for a 
 name, and for a praise, and for a glory.</I> It was this that put a 
 lustre upon all their other honours and was indeed the perfection of 
 their beauty. We may apply this spiritually. Sanctified souls are
 truly beautiful; they are so in God's sight, and they themselves may 
 take the comfort of it. But God must have all the glory, for they were 
 by nature deformed and polluted, and, whatever comeliness they have, it 
 is that which God has put upon them and beautified them with, and he 
 will be well pleased with the work of his own hands.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the
 harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications
 on every one that passed by; his it was.
 &nbsp; 16  And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high
 places with divers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon:
 <I>the like things</I> shall not come, neither shall it be <I>so.</I>
 &nbsp; 17  Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my
 silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of
 men, and didst commit whoredom with them,
 &nbsp; 18  And tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them: and
 thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them.
 &nbsp; 19  My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and
 honey, <I>wherewith</I> I fed thee, thou hast even set it before them
 for a sweet savour: and <I>thus</I> it was, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 20  Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom
 thou hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them
 to be devoured. <I>Is this</I> of thy whoredoms a small matter,
 &nbsp; 21  That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to
 cause them to pass through <I>the fire</I> for them?
 &nbsp; 22  And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast
 not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and
 bare, <I>and</I> wast polluted in thy blood.
 &nbsp; 23  And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto
 thee! saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>;)
 &nbsp; 24  <I>That</I> thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place, and
 hast made thee a high place in every street.
 &nbsp; 25  Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and
 hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet to
 every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms.
 &nbsp; 26  Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy
 neighbours, great of flesh; and hast increased thy whoredoms, to
 provoke me to anger.
 &nbsp; 27  Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee,
 and have diminished thine ordinary <I>food,</I> and delivered thee
 unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the
 Philistines, which are ashamed of thy lewd way.
 &nbsp; 28  Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because
 thou wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them,
 and yet couldest not be satisfied.
 &nbsp; 29  Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of
 Canaan unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith.
 &nbsp; 30  How weak is thine heart, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, seeing thou
 doest all these <I>things,</I> the work of an imperious whorish woman;
 &nbsp; 31  In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of
 every way, and makest thine high place in every street; and hast
 not been as a harlot, in that thou scornest hire;
 &nbsp; 32  <I>But as</I> a wife that committeth adultery, <I>which</I> taketh
 strangers instead of her husband!
 &nbsp; 33  They give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to
 all thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee on
 every side for thy whoredom.
 &nbsp; 34  And the contrary is in thee from <I>other</I> women in thy
 whoredoms, whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and
 in that thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee,
 therefore thou art contrary.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have an account of the great wickedness of the 
 people of Israel, especially in worshipping idols, notwithstanding the 
 great favours that God had conferred upon them, by which, one would 
 think, they should have been for ever engaged to him. This wickedness 
 of theirs is here represented by the lewd and scandalous conversation 
 of that beautiful maid which was rescued from ruin, brought up and well 
 provided for by a kind friend and benefactor, that had been in all 
 respects as a father and a husband to her. Their idolatry was the great 
 provoking sin that they were guilty of; it began in the latter end of 
 Solomon's time (for from Samuel's till then I do not remember that we 
 read any thing of it), and thenceforward continued more or less the 
 crying sin of that nation till the captivity; and, though it now and 
 then met with some check from the reforming kings, yet it was never 
 totally suppressed, and for the most part appeared to a high degree 
 impudent and barefaced. They not only worshipped the true God by 
 images, as the ten tribes by the calves at Dan and Bethel, but they 
 worshipped false gods, Baal and Moloch, and all the senseless rabble of 
 the pagan deities.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is that which is here all along represented (as often elsewhere) 
 under the similitude of whoredom and adultery, 

 1. Because it is the violation of a marriage-covenant with God,
 forsaking him and embracing the bosom of a stranger; it is giving that 
 affection and that service to his rivals which are due to him alone. 

 2. Because it is the corrupting and defiling of the mind, and the
 enslaving of the spiritual part of the man, and subjecting it to the 
 power and dominion of sense, as whoredom is. 

 3. Because it debauches the conscience, sears and hardens it; and
 those who by their idolatries dishonour the divine nature, and change 
 the truth of God into a lie and his glory into shame, God justly 
 punishes by giving them over to a reprobate mind, to dishonour the 
 human nature with vile affections,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:23">Rom. i. 23</A>,

 &c. It is a besotting bewitching sin; and, when men are given up to it,
 they seldom recover themselves out of the snare. 

 4. Because it is a shameful scandalous sin for those that have joined 
 themselves to the Lord to join themselves to an idol. Now observe 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What were the causes of this sin. How came the people of God to be 
 drawn away to the service of idols? How came a virgin so well taught, 
 so well educated, to be debauched? Who would have thought it? But, 

 1. They grew proud

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 "<I>Thou trustedst to thy beauty,</I> and didst expect that that should 
 make thee an interest, and didst <I>play the harlot because of thy 
 renown.</I>" They thought, because they were so complimented and 
 admired by their neighbours, that, further to ingratiate themselves 
 with them and return their compliments, they must join with them in 
 their worship and conform to their usages. Solomon admitted idolatry, 
 to gratify his wives and their relations. Note, Abundance of young 
 people are ruined by pride and particularly pride in their beauty. 
 <I>Rara est concordia form&aelig; atque pudiciti&aelig;--Beauty and 
 chastity are seldom associated</I> 
 
 2. They forgot their beginning

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>)

 "<I>Thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth,</I> how poor, and 
 mean, and despicable thou wast, and what great things God did for thee 
 and what lasting obligations he laid upon thee thereby." Note, It 
 should be an effectual check to our pride and sensuality to consider 
 what we are and how much we are beholden to the free grace of God. 

 3. They were weak in understanding and in resolution

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 <I>How weak is thy heart, seeing thou dost all these things.</I> Note, 
 The strength of men's lusts is an evidence of the weakness of their 
 hearts; they have no acquaintance with themselves, nor government of 
 themselves. She is weak, and yet an imperious whorish woman. Note, 
 Those that are most foolish are commonly most imperious, and think 
 themselves fit to manage others when they are far from being able to 
 manage themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What were the particulars of it. 

 1. They worshipped all the idols that came in their way, all that they
 were ever courted to the worship of; they were at the beck of all their 
 neighbours

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>Thou pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by; his 
 it was.</I> They were ready to close with every temptation of this 
 kind, though ever so absurd. No foreign idol could be imported, no new 
 god invented, but they were ready to catch at it, as a common trumpet 
 that prostitutes herself to all comers and <I>multiplies her 
 whoredoms,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 Thus some common drunkards will be company for every one that puts up 
 the finger to them; how weak are the hearts of such! 

 2. They adorned their idol-temples, and groves, and high places, with 
 the fine rich clothing that God had given them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:16,18"><I>v.</I> 16, 18</A>):

 <I>Thou deckedst thy high places with divers colours,</I> with the 
 coats of divers colours, like Joseph's, which God had given them as 
 particular marks of his favour, <I>and hast played the harlot</I> (that 
 is, worshipped idols) <I>thereupon.</I> Of this he saith, "<I>The like 
 things shall not come, neither shall it be so;</I> that is, this is a 
 thing by no means to be suffered; I will never endure such practices as 
 these without showing my resentments." 

 3. They made images for worship of the jewels which God had given them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>The jewels of my gold and my silver which I had given thee.</I> 
 Note, It is God that gives us our gold and silver; the products of 
 trade, of art and industry, are the gifts of God's providence to us, as 
 well as the fruits of the earth. And what God gives us the use of he 
 still retains a property in. "It is <I>my silver</I> and <I>my 
 gold,</I> though I have <I>given it to thee.</I>" It is his still, so 
 that we ought to serve and honour him with it, and are accountable to 
 him for the disposal of it. Every penny has God's image upon it as well 
 as C&aelig;sar's. Should we make our silver and gold, our plate, money, 
 and jewels, the matter of our pride and contention, our covetousness 
 and prodigality, if we duly considered that they were God's silver and 
 his gold? The Israelites began betimes to turn their jewels into idols, 
 when Aaron made the golden calf of their earrings.

 4. They served their idols with the good things which God gave them for 
 their own use and to serve him with

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "<I>Thou hast set my oil and my incense before the,</I> upon their 
 altars, as perfumes to these dunghill-deities; <I>my meat, and fine 
 flour, and oil,</I> and that honey which Canaan flowed with, and 
 <I>wherewith I fed thee,</I> thou hast regaled them and their hungry 
 priests with, hast made an offering of it to them for <I>a sweet 
 savour,</I> to purify them, and procure acceptance with them: and 
 <I>thus it was, saith the Lord God;</I> it is too plain to be denied, 
 too bad to be excused. <I>These things thou hast done.</I> He that 
 knows all things knows it." See how fond they were of their idols, that 
 they would part with that which was given them for the necessary 
 subsistence of themselves and their families to honour them with, which 
 may shame our niggardliness and strait-handedness in the service of the 
 true and living God. 

 5. They had sacrificed their children to their idols. This is insisted
 upon here, and often elsewhere, as one of the worst instances of their 
 idolatry, as indeed there was none in which the devil triumphed so much 
 over the children of men, both their natural reason and their natural 
 affection, as in this (see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:31,19:5,32:35">Jer. vii. 31; xix. 5; xxxii. 35</A>):

 <I>Thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters,</I> and not only made
 them to pass through the fire, or between two fires, in token of their 
 being dedicated to Moloch, but thou hast <I>sacrificed them to be 
 devoured,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Never was there such an instance of the degenerating of the paternal 
 authority into the most barbarous tyranny as this was. Yet that was not 
 the worst of it: it was an irreparable wrong to God himself, who 
 challenged a special property in their children more than in their gold 
 and silver and their meat: They are <I>my children</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 the <I>sons and daughters which thou hast borne unto me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 He is the <I>Father of spirits,</I> and rational souls are in a 
 particular manner his; and therefore the taking away of life, human 
 life, unjustly, is a high affront to the <I>God of life.</I> But the 
 children of Israelites were his by a further right; they were the 
 <I>children of the covenant,</I> born in God's house. He had said to 
 Abraham, <I>I will be a God to thee and to thy seed;</I> they had the 
 seal of the covenant in their flesh from eight days old; they were to 
 bear God's name, and keep up his church; to murder them was in the 
 highest degree inhuman, but to murder them in honour of an idol was in 
 the highest degree impious. One cannot think of it without the utmost 
 indignation: to see the pitiless hands of the parents shedding the 
 guiltless blood of their own children, and by offering those pieces of 
 themselves to the devil for buying sacrifices openly avowing the 
 offering up of themselves to him for living sacrifices! How absurd was 
 this, that the children which were born to God should be <I>sacrificed 
 to devils!</I> Note, The children of parents that are members of the 
 visible church are to be looked upon as born unto God, and his 
 children,; as such, and under that character, we are to love them, and 
 pray for them, bring them up for him, and, if he calls for them, 
 cheerfully part with them to him; for <I>may he not do what he will 
 with his own?</I> Upon this instance of their idolatry, which indeed 
 ought not to pass without a particular brand, this remark is made 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 <I>Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter?</I> which intimates that 
 there were those who made a small matter of it, and turned it into a 
 jest. Note, There is no sin so heinous, so apparently heinous, which 
 men of profligate consciences will not make a mock at. But is
 whoredom, is spiritual whoredom, a small matter? Is it a small matter 
 for men to make their children brutes and the devil their god? It will
 be a great matter shortly. 

 6. They built temples in honour of their idols, that others might be
 invited to resort thither and join with them in the worship of their 
 idols: "<I>After all thy wickedness</I> of this kind committed in 
 private, for which, <I>woe, woe, unto thee</I>" (that comes in in a sad 
 parenthesis, denoting those to be in a woeful condition who are going 
 on in sin, and giving them warning in time, if they would but take it), 
 "thou hast at length arrived at such a pitch of impudence as to 
 proclaim it; thou hast long had a whore's heart, but now thou hast come 
 to have a whore's forehead, and canst not blush,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:23-35"><I>v.</I> 23-35</A>.

 <I>Thou hast built there an eminent place,</I> a <I>brothel-house</I> 
 (so the margin reads it), and such their idol temples were. <I>Thou 
 hast made for thyself a high place,</I> for one idol or other, <I>in 
 every street,</I> and <I>at every head of the way;</I> and again 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.
 
 They did all they could to seduce and debauch others, and to spread the 
 contagion, by making the temptations to idolatry as strong as possibly 
 they could; and hereby the ringleaders in idolatry did but <I>make 
 themselves vile,</I> and even those that had courted them to it, 
 finding themselves outdone by them, began to be surfeited with the 
 abundance and violence of their idolatries: <I>Thou hast made thy 
 beauty to be abhorred,</I> even by those that had admired it. The 
 Jewish nation, by leaving their own God, and doting on the gods of the 
 nations round about them, had made themselves mean and despicable in 
 the eyes even of their heathen neighbours; much more was their 
 <I>beauty abhorred</I> by all that were wise and good, and had any 
 concern for the honour of God and religion. Note, Those shame
 themselves that bring a reproach on their profession. And justly will
 that beauty, that excellency, at length be made the object of the 
 loathing of others which men have made the matter of their own 
 pride.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What were the aggravations of this sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They were fond of the idols of those nations which had been their 
 oppressors and persecutors. As, 

 (1.) The Egyptians. They were a people notorious for idolatry, and for 
 the most sottish senseless idolatries; they had of old abused Israel by 
 their barbarous dealings, and of late by their treacherous 
 dealings-were always either cruel or false to them; and yet so 
 infatuated were they that <I>they committed fornication with the 
 Egyptians their neighbours,</I> not only by joining with them in their 
 idolatries, but by entering into leagues and alliances with them, and 
 depending upon them for help in their straits, which was an adulterous 
 departure from God. 

 (2.) The Assyrians. They had also been vexatious to Israel: "And <I>yet 
 thou hast played the whore with them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>);

 though they lived at a greater distance, yet thou hast entertained 
 their idols and their superstitious usages, and so <I>hast multiplied 
 thy fornications unto Chaldea,</I> hast borrowed images of gods, 
 patterns of altars, rites of sacrificing, and one foolery or other of 
 that kind, from that remote country, that enemy's country, and hast 
 imported them <I>into the land of Canaan,</I> enfranchised and 
 established them there." Thus Mr. George Herbert long since foretold, 
 or feared at least,</P>

 <CENTER>
 <TABLE BORDER=0>
 <TR><TD>That Seine shall swallow Tiber, and the Thames
 <BR>By letting in them both pollute her streams.
 </TD></TR>
 </TABLE>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They had been under the rebukes of Providence for their sins, and 
 yet they persisted in them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>I have stretched out my hand over thee,</I> to threaten and frighten 
 thee. So God did before he <I>laid his hand upon them</I> to ruin and 
 destroy them; and that is his usual method, to try to bring men to 
 repentance first by less judgments. He did so here. Before he brought 
 such a famine upon them as broke the staff of bread he <I>diminished 
 their ordinary food,</I> but them short before he cut them off. When 
 the overplus is abused, it is just with God to diminish that which is 
 for necessity. Before he delivered them to the Chaldeans to be 
 destroyed he delivered them <I>to the daughters of the Philistines</I> 
 to be ridiculed for their idolatries; for they hated them, and, though 
 they were idolaters themselves, yet were ashamed of the lewd way of the 
 Israelites, who had grown more profane in their idolatries than any of 
 their neighbours, who changed their gods, whereas other nations did not 
 change theirs, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:10,11">Jer. ii. 10, 11</A>.

 For this they were justly chastised by the Philistines. Or it may
 refer to the inroads which the Philistines made upon the south of Judah 
 in the reign of Ahaz, by which it was weakened and impoverished, and 
 which was the beginning of sorrows to them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:18">2 Chron. xxviii. 18</A>);

 but they did not take warning by those judgments, and therefore were
 justly abandoned to ruin at last. Note, In the account which impenitent 
 sinners shall be called to they will be told not only of the mercies 
 for which they have been ungrateful, but of the afflictions under which 
 they have been incorrigible, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+4:11">Amos iv. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They were insatiable in their spiritual whoredom: Thou <I>couldst 
 not be satisfied,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:28,29"><I>v.</I> 28 
 and again <I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 When they had multiplied their idols and superstitious usages beyond 
 measure, yet still they were enquiring after new gods and new fashions 
 in worship. Those that in sincerity join themselves to the true God 
 find enough in him for their satisfaction; and, though they still 
 desire more of God, yet they never desire more than God. But those that 
 forsake this living fountain for broken cisterns will find themselves 
 soon surfeited, but never satisfied; they have soon enough of the gods 
 they have, and are still enquiring after more.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They were at great expense with their idolatry, and laid out a great 
 deal of wealth in purchasing patterns of images and altars, and hiring 
 priests to attend upon them from other countries. Harlots generally had 
 their hire; but this impudent adulteress, instead of being hired to 
 serve idols, hired idols to protect her and accept her homage. This is 
 much insisted on, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:31-34"><I>v.</I> 31-34</A>.

 "In this respect <I>the contrary is in thee from other women in thy 
 whoredoms:</I> others are courted, but thou makest court to those that 
 do not follow thee, art fond of making leagues and alliances with those 
 heathen nations that despise thee; others have gifts given them, but 
 thou givest thy gifts, the gifts which God had graciously given thee, 
 to thy idols; herein thou art like a wife that commits adultery, not 
 for gain, as harlots do, but entirely for the sin's sake." Note, 
 Spiritual lusts, those of the mind, such as theirs after idols were, 
 are often as strong and impetuous as any carnal lusts are. And it is a 
 great aggravation of sin when men are their own tempters, and, instead 
 of proposing to themselves any worldly advantage by their sin, are at 
 great expense with it; such are <I>transgressors without cause</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+25:3">Ps. xxv. 3</A>),
 
 wicked transgressors indeed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 And now is not Jerusalem in all this made to know her abominations? For 
 what greater abominations could she be guilty of than these? Here we 
 may see with wonder and horror what the corrupt nature of men is when 
 God leaves them to themselves, yea, though they have the greatest 
 advantages to be better and do better. And the way of sin is down-hill. 
 <I>Nitimur in vetitum--We incline to what is forbidden.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>35  Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 &nbsp; 36  Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Because thy filthiness was poured
 out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy
 lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the
 blood of thy children, which thou didst give unto them;
 &nbsp; 37  Behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom
 thou hast taken pleasure, and all <I>them</I> that thou hast loved,
 with all <I>them</I> that thou hast hated; I will even gather them
 round about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto
 them, that they may see all thy nakedness.
 &nbsp; 38  And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed
 blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and
 jealousy.
 &nbsp; 39  And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall
 throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high
 places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take
 thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.
 &nbsp; 40  They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they
 shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their
 swords.
 &nbsp; 41  And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute
 judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause
 thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give
 no hire any more.
 &nbsp; 42  So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy
 shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more
 angry.
 &nbsp; 43  Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but
 hast fretted me in all these <I>things;</I> behold, therefore I also
 will recompense thy way upon <I>thine</I> head, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>:
 and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine
 abominations.

 Adultery was by the law of Moses made a capital crime. This notorious 
 adulteress, the criminal at the bar, being in the foregoing verses 
 found guilty, here has sentence passed upon her. It is ushered in with 
 solemnity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 The prophet, as the judge, in God's name calls to her, <I>O harlot! 
 hear the word of the Lord.</I> Our Saviour preached to harlots, for 
 their conversion, to bring them into the kingdom of God, not as the 
 prophet here, to expel them out of it. Note, An apostate church is a 
 harlot. Jerusalem is so if she become idolatrous. <I>How has the
 faithful city become a harlot!</I> Rome is so represented in the 
 Revelation, when it is marked for ruin, as Jerusalem here. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:1">Rev. xvii. 1</A>,

 <I>Come, and I will show thee the judgments of the great whore.</I>
 Those who will not hear the commanding word of the Lord and obey it 
 shall be made to hear the condemning word of the Lord and shall tremble 
 at it. Let us attend while judgment is given.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The crime is stated and the articles of the charge are summed up 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>)

 and (as is usual) with the attendant aggravations 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>);

 for when God speaks in wrath he will be justified, and clear when he 
 judges, clear when he is judged; and sinners, when they are condemned, 
 shall have their sins so set in order before them that their mouth 
 shall be stopped and they shall not have a word to object against the 
 equity of the sentence. The crimes which this harlot stands convicted 
 of, and is now to be condemned for, are, 

 1. The violation of the first two commandments of the first table by
 idolatry, which is here called her <I>whoredoms with her lovers</I> (so 
 she called them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:12">Hos. ii. 12</A>,

 because she loved them as if they had been indeed her benefactors),
 that is, with <I>all the idols of her abominations,</I> the abominable 
 idols which she served and worshipped. This was the sin which provoked
 God to jealousy.

 2. The violation of the first two commandments of the second table by 
 the murder of their own innocent infants: <I>The blood of thy children 
 which thou didst give unto them.</I> It is not strange if those that 
 have cast off God and his fear break through the strongest and most 
 sacred bonds of natural affection. Their sins are aggravated from the 
 consideration,

 (1.) Of the dishonour they had thereby done to themselves: "Hereby 
 <I>thy filthiness was poured out;</I> the uncleanness that was in thy 
 heart was hereby discovered and brought to light, and thy nakedness was 
 exposed to view, and thou wast there by exposed to contempt." God is 
 displeased with his professing people for shaming themselves by their 
 sins. 

 (2.) Their base ingratitude is another aggravation of their sins: 
 "<I>Thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth,</I> and the 
 kindness that was done thee then, when otherwise thou wouldst have 
 perished,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>.
 
 And, 

 (3.) The vexation which their sins gave to God, whom they ought to have 
 pleased: "<I>Thou hast fretted me in all these things,</I> not only 
 angered me, but grieved me." It is a strange expression, and, one would 
 think, enough to melt a heart of stone, that the great God, who cannot 
 admit any uneasiness, is pleased to speak of the sins and follies of 
 his professing people as <I>fretting</I> to him. <I>Forty years long 
 was I grieved with this generation.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The sentence is passed in general: <I>I will judge thee as women 
 that break wedlock and shed blood are judged</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>),

 and those two crimes were punished with death, with an ignominious 
 death. "Thou hast <I>shed blood,</I> and therefore I will <I>give thee 
 blood;</I> thou hast <I>broken wedlock,</I> and therefore I will give 
 it thee, not only in justice, but in jealousy, not only as a righteous 
 Judge, but as an injured and incensed husband, who <I>will not spare in 
 the day of vengeance,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:34,35">Prov. vi. 34, 35</A>.

 He will <I>recompense their way upon their head,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>.

 In all the judgments God executes upon sinners we must see <I>their own 
 way recompensed upon their head;</I> they are dealt with not only as 
 they deserved, but as they procured. It is the end which their sin, as
 a way, had a direct tendency to. More particularly, 

 1. This criminal must be (as is usually done with criminals) exposed to
 public shame,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 Malefactors are not executed privately, but are made a spectacle to the 
 world. Care is here taken to bring spectators together: "<I>All those
 whom thou hast loved, with whom thou hast taken pleasure,</I> shall 
 come to be witnesses of the execution, that they may take warning and 
 prevent their own like ruin; and those also <I>whom thou hast 
 hated,</I> who will insult over thee and triumph in thy fall." Both 
 ways the calamities of Jerusalem will be aggravated, that they will be 
 the grief of her friends and the joy of her foes. These shall not only
 be gathered <I>around her,</I> but <I>gathered against her;</I> even 
 those with whom she took unlawful pleasure, with whom she contracted 
 unlawful leagues, the Egyptians and Assyrians, shall now contribute to 
 her ruin. As, <I>when a man's ways please the Lord, he makes even his 
 enemies to be at peace with him,</I> so when a man's ways displease the 
 Lord he makes even his friends to be at war with him; and justly makes 
 those a scourge and a plague to sinners, and instruments of their 
 destruction, who were their tempters, and with whom they were partakers 
 in wickedness. Those whom they have suffered to strip them of their 
 virtue shall see them stripped, and perhaps help to strip them, of all 
 their other ornaments; to <I>see the nakedness of the land</I> will 
 they come. It is added, to the same purport 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>),

 <I>I will execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women;</I> 
 thou shalt be made an example of <I>in terrorem--that others may see 
 and fear</I> and do no more presumptuously. 

 2. The criminal is <I>condemned to die,</I> for her sins are such as 
 death is the wages of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>):

 <I>They shall bring up a company</I> (that is, a company shall be 
 brought up) <I>against thee,</I> and <I>they shall stone thee with 
 stones,</I> and <I>thrust thee through with their swords;</I> so great 
 a death, so many deaths in one, is this adulteress adjudged to. When 
 the walls of Jerusalem were battered down with stones shot against 
 them, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem were put to the sword, then this 
 sentence was executed in the letter of it. 

 3. The estate of the criminal is confiscated, and all that belonged to
 her destroyed with her

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>):

 <I>They shall throw down thy eminent place,</I> and 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>)

 they <I>shall burn thy houses,</I> as the habitations of bad women are 
 destroyed, in detestation of their lewdness. Their high places, erected 
 in honour of their idols, by which they thought to ingratiate 
 themselves with their neighbours, shall be an offence to them, and even 
 <I>they</I> shall <I>break them down.</I> It was long the complaint, 
 even in some of the best reigns of the kings of Judah, that <I>the high 
 places were not taken away;</I> but now the army of the Chaldeans, when 
 they lay all waste, shall break them down. If iniquity be not taken
 away by the justice of the nation, it shall be taken away by the 
 judgments of God upon the nation. 

 4. Thus both the sin and the sinners shall be abolished together, and 
 an end put to both: <I>Thou shalt cease from playing the harlot;</I> 
 there shall be no remainders of idolatry in the land, because the 
 inhabitants shall be wholly extirpated, and they shall <I>give no more 
 hire</I> because they shall have no more to give. Some that will not
 leave their sins live till their sins leave them. When all that with
 which they honoured their idols is taken from them they shall not 
 <I>give hire any more</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>):

 "Then <I>thou shalt not commit this lewdness</I> of sacrificing thy 
 children, which was a crime provoking <I>above all thy 
 abominations,</I> for thy children shall all be cut off by the sword or 
 carried into captivity, so that thou shalt have none to sacrifice," 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>.

 Or it may be meant of the reformation of those of them that escape and 
 survive the punishment; they shall take warning, and shall <I>do no 
 more presumptuously.</I> The captivity in Babylon made the people of 
 Israel to cease for ever <I>from playing the harlot;</I> it effectually 
 cured them of their inclination to idolatry. And then all shall be 
 well, when this is the fruit, even the <I>taking away of sin;</I> then 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>)

 <I>my jealousy shall depart. I will be quiet, and no more angry.</I> 
 When we begin to be at war with sin God will be at peace with us; for 
 he continues the affliction no longer than till it has done its work. 
 When sin departs God's jealousy will soon depart, for he is never 
 jealous but when we give him just cause to be so. Yet some understand 
 this as a threatening of utter ruin, that God will <I>make a full 
 end</I> and the fire of his anger shall burn as long as there is any 
 fuel for it. <I>His fury shall rest upon them,</I> and not remove.
 Compare this with that doom of unbelievers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:36">John iii. 36</A>.

 <I>The wrath of God abideth on them.</I> They shall drink the dregs of
 the cup, and then God will be <I>no more angry,</I> for he is <I>eased 
 of his adversaries</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:24">Isa. i. 24</A>),

 is satisfied in the abandoning of them, and therefore will be <I>no
 more angry,</I> because there are no more for his anger to fasten upon. 
 They had fretted him, when judgment and mercy were contesting; but now 
 <I>he is quiet,</I> as he will be in the eternal damnation of sinners, 
 wherein he will be glorified, and therefore he will be satisfied.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>44  Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use <I>this</I>
 proverb against thee, saying, As <I>is</I> the mother, <I>so is</I> her
 daughter.
 &nbsp; 45  Thou <I>art</I> thy mother's daughter, that loatheth her husband
 and her children; and thou <I>art</I> the sister of thy sisters, which
 loathed their husbands and their children: your mother <I>was</I> an
 Hittite, and your father an Amorite.
 &nbsp; 46  And thine elder sister <I>is</I> Samaria, she and her daughters
 that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that
 dwelleth at thy right hand, <I>is</I> Sodom and her daughters.
 &nbsp; 47  Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after
 their abominations: but, as <I>if that were</I> a very little <I>thing,</I>
 thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways.
 &nbsp; 48  <I>As</I> I live, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, Sodom thy sister hath not
 done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy
 daughters.
 &nbsp; 49  Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride,
 fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her
 daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and
 needy.
 &nbsp; 50  And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me:
 therefore I took them away as I saw <I>good.</I>
 &nbsp; 51  Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou
 hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast
 justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast
 done.
 &nbsp; 52  Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own
 shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than
 they: they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded
 also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy
 sisters.
 &nbsp; 53  When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of
 Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her
 daughters, then <I>will I bring again</I> the captivity of thy
 captives in the midst of them:
 &nbsp; 54  That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be
 confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort
 unto them.
 &nbsp; 55  When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to
 their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return
 to their former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return
 to your former estate.
 &nbsp; 56  For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the
 day of thy pride,
 &nbsp; 57  Before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of
 <I>thy</I> reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all <I>that are</I>
 round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which despise
 thee round about.
 &nbsp; 58  Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 59  For thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; I will even deal with thee as
 thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the
 covenant.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet here further shows Jerusalem her abominations, by comparing 
 her with those places that had gone before her, and showing that she 
 was worse than any of them, and therefore should, like them, be utterly 
 and irreparably ruined. We are all apt to judge of ourselves by 
 comparison, and to imagine that we are sufficiently good if we are but 
 as good as such and such, who are thought passable; or that we are not 
 dangerously bad if we are no worse than such and such, who, though bad, 
 are not of the worst. Now God by the prophet shows Jerusalem,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That she was as bad as <I>her mother,</I> that is, as the accursed 
 devoted Canaanites that were the possessors of this land before her. 
 Those that use proverbs, as most people do, shall apply that proverb to 
 Jerusalem, <I>As is the mother, so is her daughter,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>.

 She is her <I>mother's own child.</I> The Jews are as like the 
 Canaanites in temper and inclination as if they had been their own 
 children. The character of the mother was that she <I>loathed her 
 husband and her children,</I> she had all the marks of an adulteress; 
 and that is the character of the daughter: she <I>forsakes the guide of 
 her youth,</I> and is barbarous to the children of her own bowels. When 
 God brought Israel into Canaan he particularly warned them not to do 
 according to the abominations of <I>the men of that land, who went 
 before them</I> (for which <I>it had spued them out,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:27,28">Lev. xviii. 27, 28</A>),

 the monuments of whose idolatry, with the remains of the idolaters 
 themselves, would be a continual temptation to them; but they learned 
 their way, and trod in their steps, and were as well affected to the 
 <I>idols of Canaan</I> as ever they were 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:38">Ps. cvi. 38</A>),

 and thus, in respect of imitation, it might truly be said that <I>their
 mother</I> was a <I>Hittite</I> and their <I>father</I> an 
 <I>Amorite</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>),
 
 for they resembled them more than Abraham and Sarah.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That she was worse than her sisters Sodom and Samaria, that were 
 adulteresses too, that <I>loathed their husbands and their 
 children,</I> that were weary of the gods of their fathers, and were 
 for introducing new gods, <I>a-la-mode--quite in style,</I> that came
 newly up, and new fashions in religion, and were given to change. On 
 this comparison between Jerusalem and <I>her sisters</I> the prophet 
 here enlarges, that he might either shame them into repentance or 
 justify God in their ruin. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Who Jerusalem's sisters were, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>.

 Samaria and Sodom. Samaria is called the <I>elder</I> sister, or rather 
 the <I>greater,</I> because it was a much larger city and kingdom, 
 richer and more considerable, and more nearly allied to Israel. If 
 Jerusalem look northward, this is partly <I>on her left hand.</I> This 
 city of Samaria, and the towns and villages, that were as 
 <I>daughters</I> to that <I>mother-city,</I> these had been 
 <I>lately</I> destroyed for their <I>spiritual whoredom.</I> Sodom, and 
 the adjacent towns and villages that were her daughters, dwelt at 
 Jerusalem's <I>right hand,</I> and was her <I>less sister,</I> less 
 than Jerusalem, less than Samaria, and these were of old destroyed for 
 their corporeal whoredom,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:7">Jude 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Wherein Jerusalem's sins resembled her sisters', particularly 
 Sodom's 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>):

 <I>This was the iniquity of Sodom</I> (it is implied, and this is 
 <I>thy</I> iniquity too), <I>pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of 
 idleness.</I> Their <I>going after strange flesh,</I> which was Sodom's 
 most flagrant wickedness, is not mentioned, because notoriously known, 
 but those sins which did not look so black, but opened the door and led 
 the way to these more enormous crimes, and began to fill that measure 
 of her sins, which was filled up at length by their unnatural 
 filthiness. Now these initiating sins were, 

 (1.) Pride, in which the heart lifts up itself above and against both 
 God and man. Pride was the first sin that turned angels into devils, 
 and the <I>garden of the Lord</I> into a <I>hell upon earth.</I> It was 
 the pride of the Sodomites that they despised <I>righteous Lot,</I> and 
 would not bear to be reproved by him; and this ripened them for ruin.
 
 (2.) Gluttony, here called <I>fulness of bread.</I> It was God's great 
 mercy that they had plenty, but their great sin that they abused it, 
 glutted themselves with it, ate to excess and drank to excess, and made 
 that the gratification of their lusts which was given them to be the 
 support of their lives.

 (3.) Idleness, <I>abundance of idleness,</I> a dread of labour and a 
 love of ease. Their country was fruitful, and the abundance they had 
 they came easily by, which was a temptation to them to indulge 
 themselves in sloth, which disposed them to all that abominable 
 filthiness which kindled their flames. Note, Idleness is an inlet to 
 much sin. The men of Sodom, who were idle, were <I>wicked,</I> and 
 <I>sinners before the Lord exceedingly,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:13">Gen. xiii. 13</A>.

 The standing waters gather filth and the sitting bird is the fowler's
 mark. When David <I>arose from off his bed at evening</I> he saw
 Bathsheba. <I>Qu&aelig;ritur, &AElig;gisthus quare sit factus adulter?
 In promptu causa est; desidiosus erat--What made &AElig;gisthus an 
 adulterer? Indolence.</I>

 (4.) Oppression: Neither did she <I>strengthen the hands of the poor
 and needy;</I> probably it is implied that she weakened their hands and 
 <I>broke</I> their arms; however, it was bad enough that, when she had 
 so much wealth, and consequently power and interest and leisure, she 
 did nothing for the relief of the poor, in providing for whose wants 
 those that themselves are <I>full of bread</I> may employ their time 
 well; they need not be so abundantly idle as too often they are. These 
 were the sins of the Sodomites, and these were Jerusalem's sins. Their 
 pride, the cause of their sins, is mentioned again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>):

 <I>They were haughty,</I> with the horrid effects of their sins, their 
 <I>abominations</I> which they <I>committed before God.</I> Men arrive 
 gradually at the height of impiety and wickedness. <I>Nemo repente fit 
 turpissimus--No man reaches the height of vice at once.</I> But, where 
 pride has got the ascendant in a man, he is in the high road to all 
 abominations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. How much the sins of Jerusalem exceeded those of Sodom and Samaria; 
 they were more heinous in the sight of God, either in themselves or by 
 reason of several aggravations: "<I>Thou hast not only walked after 
 their ways,</I> and trod in their steps, but hast quite outdone them in 
 wickedness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>.

 Thou thoughtest it <I>a very little thing</I> to do as they did; didst 
 laugh at them as sneaking sinners and silly ones; thou wouldst be more 
 cunning, more daring, in wickedness, wouldst triumph more boldly over 
 thy convictions, and bid more open defiance to God and religion: 'if a
 man will break, let him break for <I>something.'</I> Thus <I>thou wast 
 corrupted more than they in all thy ways.</I>" Jerusalem was more 
 polite, and therefore sinned with more wit, more art and ingenuity, 
 than Sodom and Samaria could. Jerusalem had more wealth and power, and
 its government was more absolute and arbitrary, and therefore had the 
 more opportunity of oppressing the poor, and shedding malignant 
 influences around her, than Sodom and Samaria had. Jerusalem had the 
 temple, and the ark, and the priesthood, and kings of the house of 
 David; and therefore the wickedness of that holy city, that was so 
 dignified, so near, so dear to God, was more provoking to him than the 
 wickedness of Sodom and Samaria, that had not Jerusalem's privileges 
 and means of grace. Sodom has <I>not done as thou hast done,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>.
 
 This agrees with what Christ says. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:24">Matt. xi. 24</A>,

 <I>It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of
 judgment than for thee.</I> The kingdom of the ten tribes had been very 
 wicked; and yet <I>Samaria has not committed half thy sins</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>),

 has not worshipped half so many idols, nor slain half so many prophets. 
 It was bad enough that those of Jerusalem were guilty of Sodom's sins, 
 Sodomy itself not excepted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:24,2Ki+23:7">1 Kings xiv. 24; 2 Kings xxiii. 7</A>.

 And though the Dead Sea, the standing monument of Sodom's sin and ruin,
 bordered upon their country

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+34:12">Num. xxxiv. 12</A>),

 and that sulphureous lake was always under their nose (God having
 <I>taken away Sodom and her daughters</I> in such way and manner as he 
 <I>saw good,</I> as he says here,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>,

 so as that one thing should effectually make their <I>overthrow</I> an 
 <I>example to those that afterwards should live ungodly,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:6">2 Pet. ii. 6</A>),

 yet they did not take warning, but <I>multiplied their abominations
 more than they;</I> and,

 (1.) By this they <I>justified Sodom and Samaria,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>.

 They pretended, in their haughtiness and superciliousness, to <I>judge 
 them,</I> and in the days of old, when they retained their integrity, 
 they did judge them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:52"><I>v.</I> 52</A>.

 But now they justify them comparatively: <I>Sodom and Samaria</I> are 
 <I>more righteous than thou,</I> that is, less wicked. It will look
 like some extenuation of their sins that, bad as they were, Jerusalem 
 was worse, though it was God's own city. Not that it will serve for a
 plea to justify Sodom, but it condemns Jerusalem, against which Sodom 
 and Samaria will <I>rise up in judgment.</I> 

 (2.) For this they ought themselves to be greatly ashamed: "Thou who 
 hast <I>judged thy sisters,</I> and cried out shame on them, now 
 <I>bear thy own shame, for thy sins which thou hast committed,</I> 
 which, though of the same kind with theirs, yet, being committed <I>by 
 thee,</I> are <I>more abominable than theirs,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:52"><I>v.</I> 52</A>.

 This may be taken either as foretelling their ruin (<I>Thou shalt bear 
 thy shame</I>) or as inviting them to repentance: "<I>Be thou 
 confounded and bear thy shame;</I> take the shame to thyself that is 
 due to thee." It may be hoped that sinners will forsake their sins when 
 they begin to be heartily ashamed of them. And therefore they shall go 
 into captivity, and there they shall lie, that they may be 
 <I>confounded in all that they have done,</I> because they had been a 
 comfort and encouragement to Sodom and Samaria, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>.

 Note, There is nothing in sin which we have more reason to be ashamed 
 of than this, that by our sin we have encouraged others in sin, and 
 comforted them in that for which they must be grieved or they are 
 undone. Another reason why they must now be ashamed is because in the 
 day of their prosperity they had looked with so much disdain upon their 
 neighbours: <I>Thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thee in the day of 
 they pride,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:56"><I>v.</I> 56</A>.

 They thought Sodom not worthy to be named the same day with Jerusalem, 
 little dreaming that Jerusalem would at length lie under a worse and 
 more scandalous character than Sodom herself. Those that are high may
 perhaps come to stand upon a level with those they contemn. Or "Sodom
 was <I>not mentioned,</I> that is, the warning designed to be given to 
 thee by Sodom's ruin was not regarded." If the Jews had but talked more 
 frequently and seriously to one another, and to their children, 
 concerning <I>the wrath of God revealed from heaven</I> against 
 <I>Sodom's ungodliness and unrighteousness,</I> it might have kept them 
 in awe, and prevented their treading in their steps; but they kept the 
 thought of it at a distance, would not bear the mention of it, and (as 
 the ancients say) put Isaiah to death for putting them in mind of it, 
 when he called them <I>rulers of Sodom</I> and <I>people of 
 Gomorrah,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:10">Isa. i. 10</A>.

 Note, Those are but preparing judgments for themselves that will not
 take notice of God's judgments upon others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. What desolations God had brought and was bringing upon Jerusalem for 
 these wickednesses, wherein they had exceeded Sodom and Samaria. 

 (1.) She has already long ago been disgraced, and has fallen into 
 contempt, among her neighbours

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:57"><I>v.</I> 57</A>):

 <I>Before her wickedness was discovered,</I> before she came to be so 
 grossly and openly flagitious, she bore the just punishment of her 
 secret and more concealed lewdness, when she fell under <I>the reproach 
 of the daughters of Syria, of the Philistines,</I> who were said to 
 <I>despise her</I> and <I>be ashamed of her</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 and under the reproach of <I>all that were round about her,</I> which 
 seems to refer to the descent made upon Judah by the Syrians in the 
 days of Ahaz, and soon after another by the Philistines, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:5,18">2 Chron. xxviii. 5, 18</A>.

 Note, Those that disgrace themselves by yielding to their lusts will
 justly be brought into disgrace by being made to yield to their 
 enemies; and it is observable that before God brought potent enemies 
 upon them, for <I>their destruction,</I> he brought enemies upon them 
 that were less formidable, <I>for their reproach.</I> If less judgments 
 would do the work, God would not send greater. In this <I>thou hast 
 borne thy lewdness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:58"><I>v.</I> 58</A>.

 Those that will not cast off their sins by repentance and reformation 
 shall be made to bear their sins to their confusion. 

 (2.) She is now <I>in captivity,</I> or hastening into captivity, and 
 therein is reckoned with, not only for her lewdness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:58"><I>v.</I> 58</A>),

 but for her perfidiousness and covenant-breaking 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:59"><I>v.</I> 59</A>):

 "<I>I will deal with thee as thou hast done;</I> I will forsake thee as 
 thou hast forsaken me, and cast thee off as thou hast cast me off, for 
 thou hast <I>despised the oath, in breaking the covenant.</I>" This 
 seems to be meant of the covenant God made with their fathers at Mount 
 Sinai, whereby he took them and theirs to be a peculiar people to 
 himself. They flattered themselves with a conceit that because God had
 hitherto continued his favour to them, notwithstanding their 
 provocations, he would do so still. "No," says God, "you have <I>broken 
 covenant with me,</I> have despised both the promises of the covenant 
 and the obligations of it, and therefore I will <I>deal with thee as 
 thou hast done.</I>" Note, Those that will not adhere to God as their 
 God have no reason to expect that he should continue to own them as his 
 people.

 (3.) The captivity of the wicked Jews, and their ruin, shall be as 
 irrevocable as that of Sodom and Samaria. In this sense, as a 
 threatening, most interpreters take

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:53,55"><I>v.</I> 53, 55</A>.

 "<I>When I shall bring again the captivity of Sodom and Samaria, and 
 when they shall return to their former estate, then I will bring again 
 the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them,</I> and as it were 
 for their sakes, and under their shadow and protection, because they 
 are <I>more righteous than thou,</I> and <I>then thou shalt return to 
 thy former estate,</I>" But Sodom and Samaria were never brought back, 
 nor ever returned to their former estate, and therefore let not 
 Jerusalem expect it, that is, those who now remained there, whom God 
 would <I>deliver to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for 
 their hurt,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+24:9,10">Jer. xxiv. 9, 10</A>.

 Sooner shall the Sodomites arise out of the salt sea, and the
 Samaritans return out of the land of Assyria, than they enjoy their 
 peace and prosperity again; for, to their shame be it spoken, it is 
 <I>a comfort</I> to those of the ten tribes, who are dispersed and in 
 captivity, to see those of the two tribes who had been as bad as they, 
 or worse, in like manner dispersed and in captivity; and therefore they 
 shall live and die, shall stand and fall, together. The bad ones of 
 both shall perish together; the good ones of both shall return 
 together. Note, Those who do as the worst of sinners do must expect to 
 fare as they fare. <I>Let my enemy be as the wicked.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, in the close of the chapter, after a most shameful conviction of 
 sin and a most dreadful denunciation of judgments, mercy is remembered, 
 mercy is reserved, for those who shall come after. As was when God 
 swore in his wrath concerning those who came out of Egypt that they 
 should not enter Canaan, "Yet" (says God) "your little ones shall;" so 
 here. And some think that what is said of the return of Sodom and 
 Samaria 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:53,55"><I>v.</I> 53, 55</A>),

 and of Jerusalem with them, is a promise; it may be understood so, if 
 by Sodom we understand (as Grotius and some of the Jewish writers do) 
 the Moabites and Ammonites, the posterity of Lot, who once dwelt in 
 Sodom; their captivity was returned 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:47,49:6">Jer. xlviii. 47; xlix. 6</A>),

 as was that of many of the ten tribes, and Judah's with them. But
 these closing verses are, without doubt, a previous promise, which was 
 in part fulfilled at the return of the penitent and reformed Jews out 
 of Babylon, but was to have its full accomplishment in gospel-times, 
 and in that <I>repentance and</I> that <I>remission of sins</I> which 
 should then be <I>preached</I> with success <I>to all nations, 
 beginning at Jerusalem.</I> Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Whence this mercy should take rise-from <I>God himself,</I> and his 
 <I>remembering his covenant</I> with them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:60"><I>v.</I> 60</A>):

 <I>Nevertheless,</I> though they had been so provoking, and God had 
 been provoked to such a degree that one would think they could never be 
 reconciled again, yet "<I>I will remember my covenant with thee,</I> 
 that covenant which I made with thee <I>in the days of thy youth,</I> 
 and will revive it again. Though thou hast <I>broken the covenant</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:59"><I>v.</I> 59</A>),

 I will remember it, and it shall flourish again." See how much it is 
 our comfort and advantage that God is pleased to deal with us in a 
 covenant-way, for thus the mercies of it come to be <I>sure mercies</I> 
 and <I>everlasting</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:3">Isa. lv. 3</A>);

 and, while this root stands firmly in the ground, there is <I>hope of
 the tree,</I> though it be <I>cut down,</I> that <I>through the scent 
 of water it will bud again.</I> We do not find that they put him in 
 mind of the covenant, but <I>ex mero motu--from his own mere good 
 pleasure,</I> he <I>remembers</I> it as he had promised.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:42">Lev. xxvi. 42</A>,

 <I>Then will I remember my covenant, and will remember the land.</I> He 
 that bids us to be ever mindful of the covenant no doubt will himself 
 be ever mindful of it, the word <I>which he commanded</I> (and what he 
 commands stands fast for ever) to <I>a thousand generations.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How they should be prepared and qualified for this mercy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:61"><I>v.</I> 61</A>):
 
 "<I>Thou shalt remember thy ways,</I> thy evil ways; God will put thee 
 in mind of them, will set them in order before thee, that thou mayest 
 be <I>ashamed of them.</I>" Note, God's good work in us commences and 
 keeps pace with his good-will towards us. When he remembers his 
 covenant for us, that he may not remember our sins against us, he puts 
 us upon remembering our sins against ourselves. And if we will but be 
 brought to remember our ways, how crooked and perverse they have been 
 and how we have walked contrary to God in them, we cannot but be 
 ashamed; and, when we are so, we are best prepared to receive the 
 honour and comfort of a sealed pardon and a settled peace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What the mercy is that God has in reserve for them. 

 1. He will take them into covenant with himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:60"><I>v.</I> 60</A>):

 <I>I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant;</I> and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:62"><I>v.</I> 62</A>),

 <I>I will establish,</I> re-establish, and establish more firmly than 
 ever, <I>my covenant with thee.</I> Note, It is an unspeakable comfort 
 to all true penitents that the covenant of grace is so well ordered in 
 all things that every transgression in the covenant does not throw us 
 out of the covenant, for that is inviolable. 

 2. He will bring the Gentiles into church-communion with them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:61"><I>v.</I> 61</A>):

 "<I>Thou shalt receive thy sisters,</I> the Gentile nations that are 
 found about thee, <I>thy elder and thy younger,</I> greater than thou 
 art and less, ancient nations and modern, and <I>I will give them unto 
 thee for daughters;</I> they shall be founded, nursed, taught, and 
 educated, by that gospel, that <I>word of the Lord,</I> which shall 
 <I>go forth from</I> Zion and from <I>Jerusalem;</I> so that all the 
 neighbours shall call Jerusalem <I>mother,</I> while the church 
 continues there, and shall acknowledge the Jerusalem which is from 
 above, and <I>which is free,</I> to be <I>the mother of us all,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:26">Gal. iv. 26</A>.

 They shall be thy <I>daughters,</I> but <I>not by thy covenant,</I> not
 by the covenant of peculiarity, not as being proselytes to the Jewish 
 religion and subject to the yoke of the ceremonial law, but as being 
 converts with thee to the Christian religion." Or <I>not by thy 
 covenant</I> may mean, "not upon such terms as thou shalt think fit to 
 impose upon them as conquered nations, as captives and homagers to whom 
 thou mayest give law at pleasure" (such a dominion as that the carnal 
 Jews hope to have over the nations); "no, they shall be thy daughters 
 <I>by my covenant,</I> the covenant of grace made with thee and them in 
 concert, as in <I>indenture tripartite.</I> I will be a Father, a 
 common Father, both to Jews and Gentiles, and so they shall become 
 sisters to one another. And, when thou <I>shalt receive them,</I> thou 
 shalt be <I>ashamed of thy own evil ways</I> wherein thou wast 
 conformed to them. Thou shalt blush to look a Gentile in the face, 
 remembering how much worse than the Gentiles thou wast in the day of 
 thy apostasy."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. What the fruit and effect of this will be. 

 1. God will hereby be glorified

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:62"><I>v.</I> 62</A>):

 "<I>Thou shalt know that I am the Lord.</I> It shall hereby be known 
 that the God of Israel is Jehovah, a God of power, and faithful to his 
 covenant; and thou shalt know it who hast hitherto lived as if thou 
 didst not know or believe it." It had often been said in wrath, <I>You 
 shall know that I am the Lord,</I> shall know it to your cost; here it 
 is said in mercy, You shall know it to your comfort; and it is one of 
 the most precious promises of the new covenant which God has made with 
 us that <I>all shall know him from the least to the greatest.</I> 

 2. They shall hereby be more humbled and abased for sin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:63">
 <I>v.</I> 63</A>):

 "<I>That thou mayest be</I> the more <I>confounded</I> at the 
 <I>remembrance of all that thou hast done</I> amiss, mayest reproach 
 thyself for it and call thyself a thousand times unwise, undutiful, 
 ungrateful, and unlike what thou wast, and mayest never <I>open thy 
 mouth any more</I> in contradiction to God, reflection on him, or 
 complaints of him, but mayest be for ever silent and submissive 
 <I>because of thy shame.</I>" Note, Those that rightly remember their 
 sins will be truly ashamed of them; and those that are truly ashamed of 
 their sins will see great reason to be patient under their afflictions, 
 to be dumb, and not open their mouths against what God does. But that 
 which is most observable is, that all this shall be <I>when I am 
 pacified towards thee, saith the Lord God.</I> Note, It is the gracious 
 ingenuousness of true penitents that the clearer evidences and the 
 fuller instances they have of God's being reconciled to them the more 
 grieved and ashamed they are that ever they have offended God. God is 
 in Jesus Christ <I>pacified towards us;</I> he is our peace, and it is 
 by his cross that we are reconciled, and in his gospel that God is 
 reconciling the world to himself. Now the consideration of this should 
 be powerful to melt our hearts into a godly sorrow for sin. This is 
 repenting because <I>the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</I> The 
 prodigal, after he had received the kiss which assured him that his 
 father was <I>pacified towards him,</I> was ashamed and confounded, and 
 said, <I>Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee.</I> And 
 the more our shame for sin is increased by the sense of pardoning mercy 
 the more will our comfort in God be increased.</P>
