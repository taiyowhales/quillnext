 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the close of the foregoing chapter we left Daniel's companions, 
 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in honour and power, princes of the 
 provinces, and preferred for their relation to the God of Israel and 
 the interest they had in him. I know not whether I should say. It were 
 well if this honour had all the saints. No, there are many whom it 
 would not be good for; the saints' honour is reserved for another 
 world. But here we have those same three men as much under the king's 
 displeasure as when they were in his favour, and yet more truly, more 
 highly, honoured by their God than there they were honoured by their 
 prince, both by the grace wherewith he enabled them rather to suffer 
 than to sin and by the miraculous and glorious deliverance which he 
 wrought for them out of their sufferings. It is a very memorable story, 
 a glorious instance of the power and goodness of God, and a great 
 encouragement to the constancy of his people in trying times. The 
 apostle refers to it when he mentions, among the believing heroes, 
 those who by faith "quenched the violence of fire," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:34">Heb. xi. 34</A>.

 We have here,

 I. Nebuchadnezzar's erecting and dedicating a golden image, and his 
 requiring all his subjects, of what rank or degree soever, to fall down 
 and worship it, and the general compliance of his people with that 
 command, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 II. Information given against the Jewish princes for refusing to
 worship this golden image, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:8-12">ver. 8-12</A>.

 III. Their constant persisting in that refusal, notwithstanding his 
 rage and menaces, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:13-18">ver. 13-18</A>.

 IV. The casting of them into the fiery furnace for their refusal, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:19-23">ver. 19-23</A>.

 V. Their miraculous preservation in the fire by the power of God, and
 their invitation out of the fire by the favour of the king, who was by 
 this miracle convinced of his error in casting them in, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:24-27">ver. 24-27</A>.

 VI. The honour which the king gave to God hereupon, and the favour he
 showed to those faithful worthies,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height
 <I>was</I> threescore cubits, <I>and</I> the breadth thereof six cubits: he
 set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.
 &nbsp; 2  Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the
 princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the
 treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of
 the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which
 Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
 &nbsp; 3  Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges,
 the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers
 of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of
 the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood
 before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
 &nbsp; 4  Then a herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people,
 nations, and languages,
 &nbsp; 5  <I>That</I> at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute,
 harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye
 fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the
 king hath set up:
 &nbsp; 6  And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same
 hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
 &nbsp; 7  Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound
 of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of
 music, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down
 <I>and</I> worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king
 had set up.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have no certainty concerning the date of this story, only that if 
 this image, which Nebuchadnezzar dedicated, had any relation to that 
 which he dreamed of, it is probable that it happened not long after 
 that; some reckon it to be about the seventh year of Nebuchadnezzar, a 
 year before Jehoiachin's captivity, in which Ezekiel was carried away.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A <I>golden image set up</I> to be worshipped. Babylon was full of 
 idols already, yet nothing will serve this imperious prince but they 
 must have one more; for those who have forsaken the one only living 
 God, and begin to set up many gods, will find the gods they set up so 
 unsatisfying, and their desire after them so insatiable, that they will 
 multiply them without measure, wander after them endlessly, and never 
 know when they have sufficient. Idolaters are fond of novelty and 
 variety. <I>They choose new gods.</I> Those that have many will wish to 
 have more. Nebuchadnezzar the king, that he might exert the prerogative 
 of his crown, to make what god he thought fit, <I>set up</I> this 
 image, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. The <I>valuableness</I> of it; it was <I>an image of gold,</I> not 
 all gold surely; rich as he was, it is probable that he could not 
 afford that, but overlaid with gold. Note, The worshippers of false 
 gods are not wont to mind charges in setting up images and worshipping 
 them; they <I>lavish gold out of the bag</I> for that purpose 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:6">Isa. xlvi. 6</A>),

 which shames our niggardliness in the worship of the true God.

 2. The vastness of it; it was <I>threescore cubits high and six cubits
 broad.</I> It exceeded the ordinary stature of a man fifteen times (for 
 that is reckoned but four cubits, or six feet), as if its being 
 monstrous would make amends for its being lifeless. But why did 
 Nebuchadnezzar set up this image? Some suggest that it was to clear 
 himself from the imputation of having turned a Jew, because he had 
 lately spoken with great honour of the God of Israel and had preferred 
 some of his worshippers. Or perhaps he set it up as an image of 
 himself, and designed to be himself worshipped in it. Proud princes 
 affected to have divine honours paid them; Alexander did so, pretending 
 himself to be the son of Jupiter Olympius. He was told that in the 
 image he had seen in his dream he was represented by the <I>head of 
 gold,</I> which was to be succeeded by kingdoms of baser metal; but 
 here he sets up to be himself the whole image, for he makes it all of 
 gold. See here, 

 (1.) How the good impressions that were then made upon him were quite
 lost, and quickly. He then acknowledged that the God of Israel is of a 
 truth a <I>God of gods</I> and a <I>Lord of kings;</I> and yet now, in 
 defiance of the express law of that God, he sets up an image to be 
 worshipped, not only continues in his former idolatries, but contrives 
 new ones. Note, Strong convictions often come short of a sound 
 conversion. Many a pang have owned the absurdity and dangerousness of 
 sin, and yet have gone on in it.

 (2.) How that very dream and the interpretation of it, which then made
 such good impressions upon him, now had a quite contrary effect. Then 
 it made him fall down as a humble worshipper of God; now it made him 
 set up for a bold competitor with God. Then he thought it a great thing 
 to be the golden head of the image, and owned himself obliged to God 
 for it; but, his mind rising with his condition, now he thinks that too 
 little, and, in contradiction to God himself and his oracle, he will be 
 <I>all in all.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A general convention of the states summoned to attend the solemnity 
 of the dedication of this image, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 Messengers are despatched to all parts of the kingdom to <I>gather 
 together the princes,</I> dukes, and lords, all the peers of the realm, 
 with all officers civil and military, <I>the captains</I> and 
 commanders of the forces, <I>the judges, the treasurers or general 
 receivers, the counsellors,</I> and <I>the sheriffs, and all the rulers 
 of the provinces;</I> they must all <I>come to the dedication of this 
 image</I> upon pain and peril of what shall fall thereon. He summons 
 the great men, for the great honour of his idol; it is therefore 
 mentioned to the glory of Christ that <I>kings shall bring presents 
 unto him.</I> If he can bring them to pay homage to his golden image, 
 he doubts not but the inferior people will follow of course. In 
 obedience to the king's summons all the magistrates and officers of 
 that vast kingdom leave the services of their particular countries, and 
 come to Babylon, to the dedication of this golden image; long journeys 
 many of them took, and expensive ones, upon a very foolish errand; but, 
 as the idols are senseless things, such are the worshippers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A proclamation made, commanding all manner of persons present 
 before the image, upon the signal given, to fall down prostrate, and 
 worship the image, under the style and title of <I>The golden image 
 which Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up.</I> A herald proclaims this 
 aloud throughout this vast assembly of grandees, with their numerous 
 train of servants and attendants, and a great crowd of people, no 
 doubt, that were not sent for; let them all take notice, 

 1. That the king does strictly charge and command all manner of persons
 to fall down and <I>worship the golden image;</I> whatever other gods 
 they worship at other times, now they must worship this. 

 2. That they must all do this just at the same time, in token of their
 communion with each other in this idolatrous service, and that, in 
 order hereunto, notice shall be given by a concert of music, which 
 would likewise serve to adorn the solemnity and to sweeten and soften 
 the minds of those that were loth to yield and bring them to comply 
 with the king's command. This mirth and gaiety in the worship would be 
 very agreeable to carnal sensual minds, that are strangers to that 
 spiritual worship which is due to God who is a spirit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The general compliance of the assembly with this command, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 They heard the sound of the musical instruments, both wind-instruments
 and hand-instruments, <I>the cornet and flute,</I> with the <I>harp, 
 sackbut, psaltery,</I> and <I>dulcimer,</I> the melody of which they 
 thought was ravishing (and fit enough it was to excite such a devotion 
 as they were then to pay), and immediately they all, as one man, as 
 soldiers that are wont to be exercised by beat of drum, <I>all the 
 people, nations, and languages, fell down and worshipped the golden 
 image.</I> And no marvel when it was proclaimed, That whosoever would 
 not <I>worship this golden image</I> should be immediately thrown 
 <I>into the midst of a burning fiery furnace,</I> ready prepared for 
 that purpose, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Here were the charms of music to allure them into a compliance and the 
 terrors of the fiery furnace to frighten them into a compliance. Thus 
 beset with temptation, they all yielded. Note, That way that sense 
 directs the most will go; there is nothing so bad which the careless 
 world will not be drawn to by a concert of music, or driven to by a 
 fiery furnace. And by such methods as these false worship has been set 
 up and maintained.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and
 accused the Jews.
 &nbsp; 9  They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live
 for ever.
 &nbsp; 10  Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall
 hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and
 dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship
 the golden image:
 &nbsp; 11  And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, <I>that</I> he should
 be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
 &nbsp; 12  There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs
 of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego;
 these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy
 gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.
 &nbsp; 13  Then Nebuchadnezzar in <I>his</I> rage and fury commanded to
 bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these
 men before the king.
 &nbsp; 14  Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, <I>Is it</I> true, O
 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor
 worship the golden image which I have set up?
 &nbsp; 15  Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of
 the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all
 kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have
 made; <I>well:</I> but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same
 hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who <I>is</I> that
 God that shall deliver you out of my hands?
 &nbsp; 16  Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the
 king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we <I>are</I> not careful to answer thee in
 this matter.
 &nbsp; 17  If it be <I>so,</I> our God whom we serve is able to deliver us
 from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver <I>us</I> out of
 thine hand, O king.
 &nbsp; 18  But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not
 serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set
 up.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It was strange that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, would be present 
 at this assembly, when, it is likely, they knew for what intent it was 
 called together. Daniel, we may suppose, was absent, either his 
 business calling him away or having leave from the king to withdraw, 
 unless we suppose that he stood so high in the king's favour that none 
 durst complain of him for his noncompliance. But why did not his 
 companions keep out of the way? Surely because they would obey the 
 king's orders as far as they could, and would be ready to bear a public 
 testimony against this gross idolatry. They did not think it enough not 
 to bow down to the image, but, being in office, thought themselves 
 obliged to stand up against it, though it was the image which the king 
 their master set up, and would be a golden image to those that 
 worshipped it. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Information is brought to the king by <I>certain Chaldeans</I> 
 against these three gentlemen that they did not obey the king's edict, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Perhaps these Chaldeans that accused them were some of those 
 <I>magicians or astrologers</I> that were particularly called 
 <I>Chaldeans</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:2"><I>ch.</I> ii. 2, 4</A>)

 who bore a grudge to Daniel's companions for his sake, because he had
 eclipsed them, and so had these companions. They by their prayers had 
 obtained the mercy which saved the lives of these Chaldeans, and, 
 behold, how they requite them evil for good! for their love they are 
 their adversaries. Thus Jeremiah <I>stood before God, to speak good for 
 those</I> who afterwards <I>dug a pit for his life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:20">Jer. xviii. 20</A>.

 We must not think it strange if we meet with such ungrateful men. Or
 perhaps they were such of the Chaldeans as expected the places to which 
 they were advanced, and envied them their preferments; <I>and who can 
 stand before envy ?</I> They appeal to the king himself concerning the 
 edict, with all due respect to his majesty, and the usual compliment, 
 <I>O king! live forever</I> (as if they aimed at nothing but his 
 honour, and to serve his interest, when really they were putting him 
 upon that which would endanger the ruin of him and his kingdom); they 
 beg leave,

 1. To put him in mind of the law he had lately made, That all manner of
 persons, without exception of nation or language, should <I>fall down 
 and worship this golden image;</I> they put him in mind also of the 
 penalty which by the law was to be inflicted upon recusants, that they 
 were to be <I>cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 It cannot be denied but that this was the law; whether a righteous law 
 or no ought to be considered. 

 2. To inform him that these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
 had not conformed to this edict,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 It is probable that Nebuchadnezzar had no particular design to ensnare 
 them in making the law, for then he would himself have had his eye upon 
 them, and would not have needed this information; but their enemies, 
 that sought an occasion against them, laid hold on this, and were 
 forward to accuse them. To aggravate the matter, and incense the king 
 the more against them, 

 (1.) They put him in mind of the dignity to which the criminals had
 been preferred. Though they were Jews, foreigners, captives, men of a
 despised nation and religion, yet the king had <I>set them over the 
 affairs of the province of Babylon.</I> It was therefore very 
 ungrateful, and an insufferable piece of insolence, for them to disobey 
 the king's command, when they had shared so much of the king's favour. 
 And, besides, the high station they were in would make their refusal 
 the more scandalous; it would be a bad example, and have a bad 
 influence upon others; and therefore it was necessary that it should be 
 severely animadverted upon. Thus princes that are incensed enough 
 against innocent people commonly have but too many about them who do 
 all they can to make them worse.

 (2.) They suggest that it was done maliciously, contumaciously, and in
 contempt of him and his authority: "They have <I>set no regard upon 
 thee;</I> for they <I>serve not the gods</I> which thou servest, and 
 which thou requirest them to serve, nor <I>worship the golden image 
 which thou hast set up.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. These three pious Jews are immediately brought before the king, and 
 arraigned and examined upon this information. Nebuchadnezzar fell into 
 a great passion, and <I>in his rage and fury commanded</I> them to be 
 seized, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 How little was it the honour of this mighty prince that he had rule 
 over so many nations when at the same time he had no <I>rule over his 
 own spirit,</I> that there were so many who were subjects and captives 
 to him when he was himself a perfect slave to his own brutish passions 
 and led captive by them! How unfit was he to rule reasonable men who 
 could not himself be ruled by reason! It needed not be a surprise to 
 him to hear that these three men did not now serve his gods, for he 
 knew very well they never had served them, and that their religion, 
 which they had always adhered to, forbade them to do it. Nor had he any 
 reason to think that they designed any contempt of his authority, for 
 they had in all instances shown themselves respectful and dutiful to 
 him as their prince. But it was especially unseasonable at this time,
 when he was in the midst of his devotions, dedicating his golden image, 
 to be in such a rage and fury, and so much to discompose himself. The 
 <I>discretion of a man,</I> one would think, should at least have 
 <I>deferred this anger.</I> True devotion calms the spirit, quiets and 
 meekens it; but superstition, and a devotion to false gods, inflame 
 men's passions, inspire them with rage, and fury, and turn them into 
 brutes. <I>The wrath of a king is as the roaring of a lion;</I> so was 
 the wrath of this king; and yet, when he was in such a heat, these 
 three men were <I>brought before him,</I> and appeared with an 
 undaunted courage, and unshaken constancy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The case is laid before them in short, and it is put to them 
 whether they will comply or no. 

 1. The king asked them whether it was true that they had not worshipped
 the golden image when others did,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 "<I>Is it of purpose?</I>" so some read it. "Was it designedly and 
 deliberately done, or was it only through inadvertency, that you have 
 not <I>served my gods?</I> What! you that I have nourished and brought 
 up, that have been educated and maintained at my charge, that I have 
 been so kind to and done so much for, you that have been in such 
 reputation for wisdom, and therefore should better have known your duty 
 to your prince; what! do not you <I>serve my gods nor worship the 
 golden image which I have set up?</I>" Note, The faithfulness of God's 
 servants to him has often been the wonder of their enemies and 
 persecutors, who <I>think it strange</I> that they <I>run not with them 
 to the same excess of riot.</I> 

 2. He was willing to admit them to a new trial; if they did on purpose
 not do it before, yet, it may be, upon second thoughts, they will 
 change their minds; it is therefore repeated to them upon what terms 
 they now stand,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 (1.) The king is willing that music shall play again, only for their 
 sakes, to soften them into a compliance; and if they will not, like the 
 deaf adder, stop their ears, but will hearken to the voice of the 
 charmers and will <I>worship the golden image,</I> well and good; their 
 former omission shall be pardoned. But, 

 (2.) The king is resolved, if they persist in their refusal, that they
 shall immediately be <I>cast into the fiery furnace,</I> and shall not 
 have so much as an hour's reprieve. Thus does the matter lie in a 
 little compass--<I>Turn, or burn;</I> and, because he knew they buoyed 
 themselves up in their refusal with a confidence in their God, he 
 insolently set him a defiance: "<I>And who is that God that shall 
 deliver you out of my hands?</I> Let him, if he can." Now he forgot 
 what he himself once owned, that their God was a <I>God of gods</I> and 
 a <I>Lord of kings,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:47"><I>ch.</I> ii. 47</A>.

 Proud men are still ready to say, as Pharaoh, <I>Who is the Lord that I
 should obey his voice?</I> or, as Nebuchadnezzar, Who is the Lord, that 
 I should <I>fear his power?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. They give in their answer, which they all agree in, that they still 
 adhere to their resolution not to worship the golden image, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:16-18"><I>v.</I> 16-18</A>.
 
 We have here such an instance of fortitude and magnanimity as is 
 scarcely to be paralleled. We call these the <I>three children</I> (and 
 they were indeed <I>young men</I>), but we should rather call them the 
 three champions, the <I>first three</I> of the <I>worthies</I> of God's 
 <I>kingdom among men.</I> They did not break out into any intemperate 
 heat or passion against those that did worship the golden image, did 
 not insult or affront them; nor did they rashly thrust themselves upon 
 the trial, or go out of their way to court martyrdom; but, when they 
 were duly called to the fiery trial, they acquitted themselves bravely, 
 with a conduct and courage that became sufferers for so good a cause. 
 The king was not so daringly bad in making this idol, but they were as 
 daringly good in witnessing against it. They keep their temper 
 admirably well, do not call the king a tyrant or an idolater (the cause 
 of God needs not the wrath of man), but, with an exemplary calmness and 
 sedateness of mind, they deliberately give in their answer, which they 
 resolve to abide by. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Their gracious and generous contempt of death, and the noble 
 negligence with which they look upon the dilemma that they are put to: 
 <I>O Nebuchadnezzar! we are not careful to answer thee in this 
 matter.</I> They do not in sullenness deny him an answer, nor stand 
 mute; but they tell him that they are in no care about it. <I>There 
 needs not an answer</I> (so some read it); they are resolved not to 
 comply, and the king is resolved they shall die if they do not; the 
 matter therefore is determined, and why should it be disputed? But it 
 is better read, "<I>We want not an answer for thee,</I> nor have it to 
 seek, but come prepared." 

 (1.) They needed no time to deliberate concerning the matter of their
 answer; for they did not in the least hesitate whether they should 
 comply or no. It was a matter of life and death, and one would think 
 they might have considered awhile before they had resolved; life is 
 desirable, and death is dreadful. But when the sin and duty that were 
 in the case were immediately determined by the letter of the second 
 commandment, and no room was left to question what was right, the life 
 and death that were in the case were not to be considered. Note, Those 
 that would avoid sin must not parley with temptation. When that which 
 we are allured or affrighted to is manifestly evil the motion is rather 
 to be rejected with indignation and abhorrence than reasoned with; 
 stand not to pause about it, but say, as Christ has taught us, <I>Get 
 thee behind me, Satan.</I>

 (2.) They needed no time to contrive how they should <I>word</I> it.
 While they were advocates for God, and were called out to witness in 
 his cause, they doubted not but it should be <I>given them in that same 
 hour what they should speak,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:19">Matt. x. 19</A>.

 They were not contriving an evasive answer, when a direct answer was
 expected from them; no, nor would they seem to court the king not to 
 insist upon it. Here is nothing in their answer that looks like 
 compliment; they begin not, as their accusers did, with, <I>O king! 
 live for ever,</I> no artful insinuation, <I>ad captandam 
 benevolentiam--to put him into a good humour,</I> but every thing that 
 is plain and downright: O Nebuchadnezzar! <I>we are not careful to 
 answer thee.</I> Note, Those that make their duty their main care need 
 not be careful concerning the event.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Their believing confidence in God and their dependence upon him, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 It was this that enabled them to look with so much contempt upon death, 
 death in pomp, death in all its terrors: they trusted in the living 
 God, and by that faith chose rather to suffer than to sin; they 
 therefore <I>feared not the wrath of the king,</I> but endured, because 
 by faith they had an eye to <I>him that is invisible</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:25,27">Heb. xi. 25, 27</A>):

 "<I>If it be so,</I> if we are brought to this strait, if we must be
 thrown into the fiery furnace unless we serve thy gods, know then,"

 (1.) "That though we worship not <I>thy gods</I> yet we are not
 atheists; there is a God whom we can call ours, to whom we faithfully 
 adhere." 

 (2.) "That we serve this God; we have devoted ourselves to his honour;
 we employ ourselves in his work, and depend upon him to protect us, 
 provide for us, and reward us."

 (3.) "That we are well assured that this God is <I>able to deliver us
 from the burning fiery furnace;</I> whether he will or no, we are sure 
 that he can either prevent our being cast into the furnace or rescue us 
 out of it." Note, The faithful servants of God will find him a Master 
 able to bear them out in his service, and to control and overrule all 
 the powers that are armed against them. <I>Lord, if thou wilt, thou 
 canst.</I>

 (4.) "That we have reason to hope <I>he will deliver us,</I>" partly
 because, in such a vast appearance of idolaters, it would be very much 
 for the honour of his great name to deliver them, and partly because 
 Nebuchadnezzar had defied him to do it--<I>Who is that God that shall 
 deliver you?</I> God sometimes appears wonderfully for the silencing of 
 the blasphemies of the enemy, as well as for the answering of the 
 prayers of his people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:18-22.De+32:27">Ps. lxxiv. 18-22; Deut. xxxii. 27</A>.

 "But, if he do not deliver us from the fiery furnace, he will
 <I>deliver us out of thy hand.</I>" Nebuchadnezzar can but torment and 
 kill the body, and after that, there is no more that he can do; then 
 they are got out of his reach, delivered out of his hand. Note, Good
 thoughts of God, and a full assurance that he is with us while we are 
 with him, will help very much to carry us through sufferings; and, if 
 he be for us, we need not fear what man can do unto us; let him do his 
 worst. God will deliver us either from death or in death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Their firm resolution to adhere to their principles, whatever might 
 be the consequence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "<I>But, if not,</I> though God should not think fit to deliver us from 
 the fiery furnace (which yet we know he can do), if he should suffer us 
 to <I>fall into thy hand,</I> and fall by thy hand, yet <I>be it known 
 unto thee, O king! we will not serve</I> these gods, though they are 
 <I>thy gods, nor worship this golden image,</I> though thou thyself 
 hast <I>set it up.</I>" They are neither ashamed nor afraid to own 
 their religion, and tell the king to his face that they do not fear 
 him, they will not yield to him; had they consulted with flesh and 
 blood, much might have been said to bring them to a compliance, 
 especially when there was no other way of avoiding death, <I>so great a 
 death.</I> 

 (1.) They were not required to abjure their own God, or to renounce his
 worship, no, nor by any verbal profession or declaration to own this 
 golden image to be a god, but only to bow down before it, which they 
 might do with a secret reserve of their hearts for the God of Israel, 
 inwardly detesting this idolatry, as Naaman bowed in the house of 
 Rimmon.

 (2.) They were not to fall into a course of idolatry; it was but one
 single act that was required of them, which would be done in a minute, 
 and the danger was over, and they might afterwards declare their sorrow 
 for it.

 (3.) The king that commanded it had an absolute power; they were under
 it, not only as subjects, but as captives; and, if they did it, it was 
 purely by coercion and duress, which would serve to excuse them.

 (4.) He had been their benefactor, had educated and preferred them, and
 in gratitude to him they ought to go as far as they could, though it 
 were to strain a point, a point of conscience.

 (5.) They were now driven into a strange country, and to those that
 were so driven out it was, in effect, said, <I>Go, and serve other 
 gods,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+26:19">1 Sam. xxvi. 19</A>.

 It was taken for granted that in their disposition they would <I>serve
 other gods,</I> and it was made a part of the judgment,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:28">Deut. iv. 28</A>.

 They might be excused if they should go down the stream, when it is so
 strong.

 (6.) Did not their kings, and their princes, and their fathers, yea,
 and their priests too, set up idols even in God's temple, and worship 
 them there, and not only bow down to them, but erect altars, burn 
 incense, and offer sacrifices, even their own children, to them? Did 
 not all the ten tribes, for many ages, worship gods of gold at Dan and 
 Bethel? And shall they be more precise than their fathers? <I>Communis 
 error facit jus</I>--<I>What all do must be right.</I>

 (7.) If they should comply, they would save their lives and keep their
 places, and so be in a capacity to do a great deal of service to their 
 brethren in Babylon, and to do it long; for they were young men, and 
 rising men. But there is enough in that one word of God wherewith to
 answer and silence these and many more such like carnal reasonings: 
 <I>Thou shalt not bow down thyself to any images, nor worship them.</I> 
 They know they must obey God rather than man; they must rather suffer 
 than sin, and must not do evil that good may come. And therefore none 
 of these things move them; they are resolved rather to die in their 
 integrity than live in their iniquity. While their brethren, who yet
 remained in their own land, were worshipping images by choice, they in 
 Babylon would not be brought to it by constraint, but, as if they were 
 good by <I>antiperistasis,</I> were most zealous against idolatry in an 
 idolatrous country. And truly, all things considered, the saving of 
 them from this sinful compliance was as great a miracle in the kingdom 
 of grace as the saving of them out of the fiery furnace was in the 
 kingdom of nature. These were those who formerly resolved not to defile 
 themselves with the <I>king's meat,</I> and now they as bravely resolve 
 not to defile themselves with his gods. Note, A stedfast self-denying 
 adherence to God and duty in less instances will qualify and prepare us 
 for the like in greater. And in this we must be resolute, never, under 
 any pretence whatsoever, to worship images, or to say "A confederacy" 
 with those that do so.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his
 visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego:
 <I>therefore</I> he spake, and commanded that they should heat the
 furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.
 &nbsp; 20  And he commanded the most mighty men that <I>were</I> in his army
 to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, <I>and</I> to cast <I>them</I>
 into the burning fiery furnace.
 &nbsp; 21  Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and
 their hats, and their <I>other</I> garments, and were cast into the
 midst of the burning fiery furnace.
 &nbsp; 22  Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the
 furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that
 took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
 &nbsp; 23  And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell
 down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
 &nbsp; 24  Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in
 haste, <I>and</I> spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we
 cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered
 and said unto the king, True, O king.
 &nbsp; 25  He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in
 the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the
 fourth is like the Son of God.
 &nbsp; 26  Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning
 fiery furnace, <I>and</I> spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and
 Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come
 <I>hither.</I> Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the
 midst of the fire.
 &nbsp; 27  And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's
 counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose
 bodies the fire had no power, nor was a hair of their head
 singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire
 had passed on them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The casting of these three faithful servants of God into the fiery 
 furnace. Nebuchadnezzar had himself known and owned so much of the true 
 God that, one would have thought, though his pride and vanity induced 
 him to make this golden image, and set it up to be worshipped, yet what 
 these young men now said (whom he had formerly found to be wiser than 
 all his wise men) would revive his convictions, and at least engage him 
 to excuse them; but it proved quite otherwise. 

 1. Instead of being convinced by what they said, he was exasperated,
 and made more outrageous,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 It made him <I>full of fury,</I> and the <I>form of his visage was 
 changed</I> against these men. Note, Brutish passions the more they are 
 indulged the more violent they grow, and even change the countenance, 
 to the great reproach of the wisdom and reason of a man. 
 Nebuchadnezzar, in this heat, exchanged the awful majesty of a prince 
 upon his throne, or a judge upon the bench, for the frightful fury of a 
 <I>wild bull in a net.</I> Would men in a passion but view their faces 
 in a glass, they would blush at their own folly and turn all their 
 displeasure against themselves. 

 2. Instead of mitigating their punishment, in consideration of their
 quality and the posts of honour they were in, he ordered it to be 
 heightened, that they should <I>heat the furnace seven times more than 
 it was wont to be heated</I> for other malefactors, that is, that they 
 should put seven times more fuel to it, which, though it would not make 
 their death more grievous, but rather dispatch them sooner, was 
 designed to signify that the king looked upon their crime as seven 
 times more heinous than the crimes of others, and so made their death 
 more ignominious. But God brought glory to himself out of this foolish 
 instance of the tyrant's rage; for, though it would not have made their 
 death the more grievous, yet it did make their deliverance much the 
 more illustrious. 

 3. He ordered them to be bound in their clothes, and cast into the
 midst of the burning fiery furnace, which was done accordingly,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.

 They were bound, that they might not struggle, or make any resistance, 
 were bound in their clothes, for haste, or that they might be consumed 
 the more slowly and gradually. But God's providence ordered it for the 
 increase of the miracle, in that their clothes were not so much as 
 singed. They were bound in their <I>coats</I> or mantles, their 
 <I>hosen</I> or breeches, and their <I>hats</I> or turbans, as if, in 
 detestation of their crime, they would have their clothes to be burnt 
 with them. What a terrible death was this--to be <I>cast bound into the 
 midst of a burning fiery furnace!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 It makes one's flesh tremble to think of it, and horror to take hold on 
 one. It is amazing that the tyrant was so hard-hearted as to inflict 
 such a punishment, and that the confessors were so stout-hearted as to 
 submit to it rather than sin against God. But what is this to the
 <I>second death,</I> to that furnace into which the tares shall be cast 
 in bundles, to that lake which burns eternally with fire and brimstone? 
 Let Nebuchadnezzar heat his furnace as hot as he can, a few minutes 
 will finish the torment of those who are cast into it; but hell-fire 
 tortures and does not kill. The pain of damned sinners is more 
 exquisite, and the <I>smoke of their torment ascends for ever and 
 ever,</I> and <I>those have no rest,</I> no intermission, no cessation 
 of their pains, <I>who have worshipped the beast and his image</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:10,11">Rev. xiv. 10, 11</A>),

 whereas their pain would be soon over that were cast into this furnace 
 for not worshipping this Babylonian beast and his image. 

 4. It was a remarkable providence that the men, the <I>mighty men,</I>
 that bound them, and threw them into the furnace, were themselves 
 consumed or suffocated by the flame,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 The <I>king's commandment was urgent,</I> that they should dispatch 
 them quickly, and be sure to do it effectually; and therefore they 
 resolved to go to the very mouth of the furnace, that they might throw 
 them <I>into the midst</I> of it, but they were in such haste that they 
 would not take time to arm themselves accordingly. The apocryphal
 additions to Daniel say that the flame ascended forty-nine cubits above 
 the mouth of the furnace. Probably God ordered it so that the wind
 blew it directly upon them with such violence that it smothered them. 
 God did thus immediately plead the cause of his injured servants, and 
 take vengeance for them on their persecutors, whom he punished, not 
 only in the very act of their sin, but by it. But these men were only 
 the instruments of cruelty; he that bade them do it had the greater 
 sin; yet they suffered justly for executing an unjust decree, and it is 
 very probable that they did it with pleasure and were glad to be so 
 employed. Nebuchadnezzar himself was reserved for a further reckoning.
 There is a day coming when proud tyrants will be punished, not only for 
 the cruelties they have been guilty of, but for employing those about 
 them in their cruelties, and so exposing them to the judgments of 
 God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The deliverance of these three faithful servants of God out of the 
 furnace. When they were cast bound into the midst of that devouring 
 fire we might well conclude that we should hear no more of them, that 
 their very bones would be calcined; but, to our amazement, we here find 
 that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, are yet alive.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Nebuchadnezzar finds them walking in the fire. <I>He was astonished, 
 and rose up in haste,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Perhaps the slaying of the men that executed his sentence was that 
 which astonished him, as well it might, for he had reason to think his 
 own turn would be next; or it was some unaccountable impression upon 
 his own mind that astonished him, and made him rise up in haste, and go 
 to the furnace, to see what had become of those he had cast into it. 
 Note, God can strike those with astonishment whose hearts are most 
 hardened both against him and against his people. He that made the soul 
 can make his sword to approach to it, even to that of the greatest 
 tyrant. In his astonishment he calls his counsellors about him, and 
 appeals to them. <I>Did we not cast three men bound into the fire?</I>
 It seems, it was done by order, not only of the king, but of the 
 council. They durst not but concur with him, which he forced them to 
 do, that they might share with him in the guilt and odium? "<I>True, O 
 king!</I>" say they; "we did order such an execution to be done and it 
 was done." "But now," says the king, "I have been looking into the 
 furnace, and I <I>see four men, loose, walking in the midst of the 
 fire,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 (1.) They were loosed from their bonds. The fire that did not so much
 as singe their clothes burnt the cords wherewith they were bound, and 
 set them at liberty; thus God's people have their hearts enlarged, 
 through the grace of God, by those very troubles with which their 
 enemies designed to straiten and hamper them. 

 (2.) They had no hurt, made no complaint, felt no pain or uneasiness in
 the least; the flame did not scorch them; the smoke did not stifle 
 them; they were alive and as well as ever in the midst of the flames. 
 See how God of nature can, when he pleases, control the powers of 
 nature, to make them serve his purposes. Now was fulfilled in the 
 letter gracious promise

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:2">Isa. xliii. 2</A>),
 
 <I>When thou walkest through the fire thou shalt not be burnt, neither
 shall the flame kindle upon thee.</I> By faith they <I>quench the 
 violence of the fire, quench the fiery darts of the wicked.</I> 

 (3.) They <I>walked in the midst of the fire.</I> The furnace was
 large, so that they had room to walk; they were unhurt, so that they 
 were able to walk; their minds were easy, so that they were disposed to 
 walk, as in a paradise or garden of pleasure. <I>Can a man walk upon 
 hot coals and his feet not be burnt?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:28">Prov. vi. 28</A>.

 Yes, they did it with as much pleasure as the king of Tyrus <I>walked 
 up and down in the midst of his stones of fire,</I> his precious stones 
 that sparkled as fire, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:14">Ezek. xxviii. 14</A>.

 They were not striving to get out, finding themselves unhurt; but,
 leaving it to that God who preserved them in the fire to bring them out 
 of it, they walked up and down <I>in the midst of it</I> unconcerned. 
 One of the apocryphal writings relates at large the prayer which 
 Azariah, one of the three, prayed in the fire (wherein he laments the 
 calamities and iniquities of Israel, and entreats God's favour to his 
 people), and the song of praise which they all three sang in the midst 
 of the flames, in both which there are remarkable strains of devotion; 
 but we have reason to think, with Grotius, that they were composed by 
 some Jew of a later age, not as what were used, but only as what might 
 have been used, on this occasion, and therefore we justly reject them 
 as no part of holy writ.

 (4.) There was a fourth seen with them in the fire, whose form, in
 Nebuchadnezzar's judgment, was <I>like the Son of God;</I> he appeared 
 as a divine person, a messenger from heaven, not as a servant, but as a 
 son. <I>Like an angel</I> (so some); and angels are called <I>sons of 
 God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:7">Job xxxviii. 7</A>.

 In the apocryphal narrative of this story it is said, <I>The angel of
 the Lord came down into the furnace;</I> and Nebuchadnezzar here says

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 God <I>sent his angel and delivered them;</I> and it was an angel that 
 shut the lions' mouths when Daniel was in the den,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:22"><I>ch.</I> vi. 22</A>.

 But some think it was the eternal Son of God, the angel of the
 covenant, and not a created angel. He appeared often in our nature 
 before he assumed it in his incarnation, and never more seasonable, nor 
 to give a more proper indication and presage of his great errand into 
 the world in the fulness of time, than now, when, to deliver his chosen 
 out of the fire, he came and walked with them in the fire. Note, Those 
 that suffer for Christ have his gracious presence with them in their 
 sufferings, even in the fiery furnace, even in the valley of the shadow 
 of death, and therefore even there they need <I>fear no evil.</I> 
 Hereby Christ showed that what is done against his people he takes as 
 done against himself; whoever throws them into the furnace does, in 
 effect, throw him in. <I>I an Jesus, whom thou persecutest,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:9">Isa. lxiii. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Nebuchadnezzar calls them out of the furnace 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 He <I>comes near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace,</I> and 
 bids them <I>come forth and come hither. Come forth, come</I> (so some 
 read it); he speaks with a great deal of tenderness and concern, and 
 stands ready to lend them his hand and help them out. He is convinced 
 by their miraculous preservation that he did evil in casting them into 
 the furnace; and therefore he does not <I>thrust them out privily; no 
 verily, but he will come himself and fetch them out,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:37">Acts xvi. 37</A>.
 
 Observe the respectful title that he gives them. When he was in the
 heat of his fury and rage against them it is probable that he called 
 them rebels, and traitors, and all the ill names he could invent; but 
 now he owns them <I>for the servants of the most high God,</I> a God 
 who now appears <I>able to deliver them out of his hand.</I> Note, 
 Sooner or later, God will convince the proudest of men that he is the 
 most high God, and above them, and too hard for them, even in those 
 things wherein they deal proudly and presumptuously, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:11">Exod. xviii. 11</A>.

 He will likewise let them know are who his servants, and that he owns
 them and will stand by them. Elijah prayed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:36">1 Kings xviii. 36</A>),

 <I>Let it be known that thou art God and that I am thy servant.</I>
 Nebuchadnezzar now embraces those whom he had abandoned, and is very 
 officious about them, now that he perceives them to be the favourites 
 of Heaven. Note, What persecutors have done against God's servants, 
 when God opens their eyes, they must as far as they can undo again. How 
 the <I>fourth,</I> whose <I>form was like the Son of God,</I> withdrew, 
 and whether he vanished away or visibly ascended, we are not told, but 
 of the other three we are informed,

 (1.) That they <I>came forth out of the midst of the fire,</I> as
 Abraham their father out of Ur (that is, <I>the fire) of the 
 Chaldees,</I> into which, says this tradition of the Jews, he was cast, 
 for refusing to worship idols, and out of which he was delivered, as 
 those his <I>three children</I> were. When they had their discharge 
 they did not tempt God by staying in any longer, but came forth as 
 brands out of the burning.

 (2.) That it was made to appear, to the full satisfaction of all the
 amazed spectators, that they had not received the least damage by the 
 fire,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 All the great men came together to view them, and found that there was 
 not so much as <I>a hair of their head singed.</I> Here that was true 
 in the letter which our Saviour spoke figuratively, for an assurance to 
 his suffering servants that they should sustain no real damage 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:18">Luke xxi. 18</A>),

 <I>There shall not a hair of your head perish.</I> Their clothes did
 not so much as change colour, nor smell of fire, much less were their 
 bodies in the least scorched or blistered; no, <I>the fire had no power 
 on them.</I> The Chaldeans worshipped the fire, as a sort of image of 
 the sun, so that, in restraining the fire now, God put contempt, not 
 only upon their king, but upon their god too, and showed that <I>his 
 voice divides the flames of fire</I> as well as the floods of water

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+29:7">Ps. xxix. 7</A>),

 when he pleases to make a way for his people through the midst of it.
 It is our God only that is <I>the consuming fire</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:29">Heb. xii. 29</A>);

 other fire, if he but speak the word, shall not consume.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>28  <I>Then</I> Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed <I>be</I> the God
 of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and
 delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the
 king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve
 nor worship any god, except their own God.
 &nbsp; 29  Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and
 language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of
 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and
 their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other
 God that can deliver after this sort.
 &nbsp; 30  Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in
 the province of Babylon.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The strict observations that were made, <I>super visum corporis--on
 inspecting their bodies,</I> by the princes and governors, and all the 
 great men who were present upon this public occasion, and who could not 
 be supposed partial in favour of the confessors, contributed much to 
 the clearing of this miracle and the magnifying of the power and grace 
 of God in it. <I>That indeed a notable miracle has been done is 
 manifest, and we cannot deny it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:16">Acts iv. 16</A>.

 Let us now see what effect it had upon Nebuchadnezzar.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He gives glory to the God of Israel as a God able and ready to 
 protect his worshippers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 "<I>Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.</I> Let him 
 have the honour both of the faithful allegiance which his subjects bear 
 to him and the powerful protection he grants to them, neither of which 
 can be paralleled by any other nation and their gods." The king does 
 himself acknowledge and adore him, and thinks it is fit that he should 
 be acknowledged and adored by all. <I>Blessed be thee God of 
 Shadrach.</I> Note, God can extort confessions of his blessedness even 
 from those that have been ready to curse him to his face. 

 1. He gives him the glory of his power, that he was able to protect his
 worshippers against the most mighty and malign ant enemies: <I>There is 
 no other God that can deliver after this sort</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 no, not this golden image which he had set up. For this reason there 
 was no other god that obliged his worshippers to cleave to him only, 
 and to suffer death rather than worship any other, as the God of Israel 
 did, for they could not engage to bear them out in so doing, as he 
 could. If God can work such deliverance as no other can, he may demand 
 such obedience as no other may. 

 2. He gives him the glory of his goodness, that he was ready to do it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 <I>He has sent his angel and delivered his servants.</I> Bel could not 
 save his worshippers from being burnt at the mouth of the furnace, but 
 the God of Israel saved his from being burnt when they were cast into 
 the midst of the furnace because they refused to <I>worship any other 
 god.</I> By this Nebuchadnezzar was plainly given to understand that 
 all the great success which he had had, and should yet have, against 
 the people of Israel, which he gloried in, as he had therein 
 overpowered the God of Israel, was owing purely <I>to their sin:</I> if 
 the body of that nation had faithfully adhered to their own God and the 
 worship of him only, as these three men did, they would all have been 
 delivered out of his hand as these three men were. And this was a 
 necessary instruction for him at this time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He applauds the constancy of these three men in their religion, and 
 describes it to their honour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 Though he is not himself persuaded to own their God for his and to 
 worship him, because, if he do so, he knows he must worship him only 
 and renounce all others, and he calls him <I>the God of Shadrach,</I> 
 not <I>my</I> God, yet he commends them for cleaving to him, and <I>not 
 serving nor worshipping any other God but their own.</I> Note, There 
 are many who are not religious themselves, and yet will own that those 
 are clearly in the right that are religious and are stedfast in their 
 religion. Though they are not themselves persuaded to close with it, 
 they will commend those who, having closed with it, cleave to it. If 
 men have given up their names to that God who will alone be served, let 
 them keep to their principles, and serve him only, whatever it cost 
 them. Such a constancy in the true religion will turn to men's praise, 
 even among those that are without, when unsteadiness, treachery, and 
 double dealing, are what all men will cry shame on. He commends them 
 that they did this, 

 1. With a generous contempt of their lives, which they valued not, in
 comparison with the favour of God and the testimony of a good 
 conscience. The <I>yielded their</I> own <I>bodies</I> to be cast into 
 the fiery furnace rather than they would not only not forsake their 
 God, but not affront him, by once paying that homage to any other which 
 is due to him alone. Note, Those shall have their praise, if not of 
 men, yet of God, who prefer their souls before their bodies, and will 
 rather lose their lives than forsake their God. Those know not the 
 worth and value of religion who do not think it worth suffering for. 

 2. They did it with a glorious contradiction to their prince: They
 <I>changed the king's word,</I> that is, they were contrary to it, and 
 thereby put contempt upon both his precepts and threatenings, and made 
 him repent and revoke both. Note, Even kings themselves must own that, 
 when their commands are contrary to the commands of God, he is to be 
 obeyed and not they.

 (3.) They did it with a gracious confidence in their God. They
 <I>trusted in him</I> that he would stand by them in what they did, 
 that he would either bring them out of the fiery furnace back to their 
 place on earth or lead them through the fiery furnace forward to their 
 place in heaven; and in this confidence they became fearless of the 
 king's wrath and regardless of their own lives. Note, A stedfast faith 
 in God will produce a stedfast faithfulness to God. Now this honourable 
 testimony, thus publicly borne by the king himself to these servants of 
 God, we may well think, would have a good influence upon the rest of 
 the Jews that were, or should be, captives in Babylon. Their
 neighbours could not with any confidence urge them to do that, nor 
 could they for shame do that, which their brethren were so highly 
 applauded by the king himself for not doing. Nay, and what God did for 
 these his servants would help not only to keep the Jews close to their 
 religion while they were in captivity, but to cure them of their 
 inclination to idolatry, for which end they were sent into captivity; 
 and, when it had had that blessed effect upon them, they might be 
 assured that God would deliver them out of that furnace, as now he 
 delivered their brethren out of this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He issues a royal edict, strictly forbidding any to speak evil of 
 the God of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 We have reason to think that both the sins and the troubles of Israel 
 had given great occasion, though no just occasion, to the Chaldeans to 
 blaspheme the God of Israel, and, it is likely, Nebuchadnezzar himself 
 had encouraged it; but now, though he is no true convert, nor is 
 wrought upon to worship him, yet he resolves never to speak ill of him 
 again, nor to suffer others to do so: "<I>Whoever shall speak any thing 
 amiss,</I> any <I>error</I> (so some), or rather any reproach or 
 blasphemy, whoever shall speak with contempt of <I>the God of Shadrach, 
 Meshach, and Abednego,</I> they shall be counted the worst of 
 malefactors, and dealt with accordingly, they shall be <I>cut in 
 pieces,</I> as Agag was by the sword of Samuel, and their houses shall 
 be demolished and made a <I>dunghill.</I>" The miracle now wrought by 
 the power of this God in defence of his worshippers, publicly in the 
 sight of the thousands of Babylon, was a sufficient justification of 
 this edict. And it would contribute much to the ease of the Jews in 
 their captivity to be by this law screened from the fiery darts of 
 reproach and blasphemy, with which otherwise they would have been 
 continually annoyed. Note, It is a great mercy to the church, and a 
 good point gained, when its enemies though they have not their hearts 
 turned, yet have their mouths stopped and their tongues tied. If a 
 heathen prince laid such a restraint upon the proud lips of 
 blasphemers, much more should Christian princes do it; nay, in this 
 thing, one would think that men should be a law to themselves, and that 
 those who have so little love to God that they care not to speak well 
 of him, yet could never find in their hearts, for we are sure they 
 could never find cause, to <I>speak any thing amiss</I> of him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He not only reverses the attainder of these three men, but restores 
 them to their places in the government (<I>makes them to prosper,</I> 
 so the word is), and prefers them to greater and more advantageous 
 trusts than they had been in before: He <I>promoted them in the
 province</I> of Babylon, which was much to their honour and the comfort 
 of their brethren in captivity there. Note, It is the wisdom of princes 
 to prefer and employ men of stedfastness in religion; for those are 
 most likely to be faithful to them who are faithful to God, and it is 
 likely to be well with them when God's favourites are made theirs.</P>
