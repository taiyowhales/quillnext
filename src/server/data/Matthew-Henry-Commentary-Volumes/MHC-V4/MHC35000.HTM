 is a very foolish fancy of some of the Jewish rabbin that this prophet 
 was the son of the Shunamite woman that was at first miraculously 
 given, and afterwards raised to life, by Elisha

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+4:18-37">2 Kings iv.</A></A>),

 as they say also that the prophet Jonah was the son of the widow of
 Zarephath, which Elijah raised to life. It is a more probable 
 conjecture of their modern chronologers that he lived and prophesied in 
 the reign of king Manasseh, when wickedness abounded, and destruction 
 was hastening on, destruction by the Chaldeans, whom this prophet 
 mentions as the instruments of God's judgments; and Manasseh was 
 himself carried to Babylon, as an earnest of what should come 
 afterwards. In the apocryphal story of Bel and the Dragon mention is 
 made of Habakkuk the prophet in the land of Judah, who was carried 
 thence by an angel to Babylon, to feed Daniel in the den; those who 
 give credit to that story take pains to reconcile our prophet's living 
 before the captivity, and foretelling it, with that. Huetius thinks 
 that that was another of the same name, a prophet, this of the tribe of 
 Simeon, that of Levi; others that he lived so long as to the end of 
 that captivity, though he prophesied of it before it came. And some 
 have imagined that Habakkuk's feeding Daniel in the den is to be 
 understood mystically, that Daniel then <I>lived by faith,</I> as 
 Habakkuk had said <I>the just should do;</I> he was <I>fed</I> by that 
 word, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:4">Hab. ii. 4</A>.

 The prophecy of this book is a mixture of the prophet's addresses to
 God in the people's name and to the people in God's name; for it is the 
 office of the prophet to carry messages both ways. We have in it a 
 lively representation of the intercourse and communion between a 
 gracious God and a gracious soul. The whole refers particularly to the 
 invasion of the land of Judah by the Chaldeans, which brought spoil 
 upon the people of God, a just punishment of the spoil they had been 
 guilty of among themselves; but it is of general use, especially to 
 help us through that great temptation with which good men have in all 
 ages been exercised, arising from the power and prosperity of the 
 wicked and the sufferings of the righteous by it.</P>
