 The prophecy of this chapter bears date some time before those 
 prophecies in the chapters next foregoing, for they are not placed in 
 the exact order of time in which they were delivered. This is dated in 
 the first year of Nebuchadrezzar, that remarkable year when the sword 
 of the Lord began to be drawn and furbished. Here is,

 I. A review of the prophecies that had been delivered to Judah and
 Jerusalem for many years past, by Jeremiah himself and other prophets, 
 with the little regard given to them and the little success of them, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 II. A very express threatening of the destruction of Judah and
 Jerusalem, by the king of Babylon, for their contempt of God, and their
 continuance in sin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:8-11">ver. 8-11</A>),

 to which is annexed a promise of their deliverance out of their
 captivity in Babylon, after 70 years, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:12-14">ver. 12-14</A>.

 III. A prediction of the devastation of divers other nations about, by 
 Nebuchadrezzar, represented by a "cup of fury" put into their hands 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:15-28">ver. 15-28</A>),

 by a sword sent among them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:29-33">ver. 29-33</A>),

 and a desolation made among the shepherds and their flocks and pastures

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:34-38">ver. 34-38</A>);

 so that we have here judgment beginning at the house of God, but not
 ending there.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of
 Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of
 Judah, that <I>was</I> the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of
 Babylon;
 &nbsp; 2  The which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of
 Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,
 &nbsp; 3  From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of
 Judah, even unto this day, that <I>is</I> the three and twentieth
 year, the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath come unto me, and I have spoken
 unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye have not hearkened.
 &nbsp; 4  And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath sent unto you all his servants the
 prophets, rising early and sending <I>them;</I> but ye have not
 hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear.
 &nbsp; 5  They said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and
 from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever:
 &nbsp; 6  And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship
 them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands;
 and I will do you no hurt.
 &nbsp; 7  Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; that ye
 might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your
 own hurt.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a message from God concerning all the people of Judah 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 which Jeremiah delivered, in his name, unto all the people of Judah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Note, That which is of universal concern ought to be of universal
 cognizance. It is fit that the word which concerns all the people, as 
 the word of God does, the word of the gospel particularly, should be 
 divulged to all in general, and, as far as may be, addressed to each in 
 particular. Jeremiah had been sent to the <I>house of the king</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:1"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 1</A>),

 and he took courage to deliver his message to them, probably when they
 had all come up to Jerusalem to worship at one of the solemn feasts; 
 then he had them together, and it was to be hoped then, if ever, they 
 would be well disposed to hear counsel and receive instruction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This prophecy is dated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim and the first of 
 Nebuchadrezzar. It was in the latter end of Jehoiakim's third year that 
 Nebuchadrezzar began to reign by himself alone (having reigned some 
 time before in conjunction with his father), as appears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:1">Dan. i. 1</A>.

 But Jehoiakim's fourth year was begun before Nebuchadrezzar's first was
 completed. Now that that active, daring, martial prince began to set up 
 for the world's master, God, by his prophet, gives notice that he is 
 his servant, and intimates what work he intends to employ him in, that 
 his growing greatness, which was so formidable to the nations, might 
 not be construed as any reflection upon the power and providence of God 
 in the government of the world. Nebuchadrezzar should not bid so fair 
 for universal monarchy (I should have said universal tyranny) but that 
 God had purposes of his own to serve by him, in the execution of which 
 the world shall see the meaning of God's permitting and ordering a 
 thing that seemed such a reflection on his sovereignty and 
 goodness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now in this message we may observe the great pains that had been taken 
 with the people to bring them to repentance, which they are here put in 
 mind of, as an aggravation of their sin and a justification of God in 
 his proceedings against them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Jeremiah, for his part, had been a constant preacher among them 
 twenty-three years; he began in the thirteenth year of Josiah, who 
 reigned thirty-one years, so that he prophesied about eighteen or 
 nineteen years in his reign, then in the reign of Jehoahaz, and now 
 four years of Jehoiakim's reign. Note, God keeps an account, whether we 
 do or no, how long we have enjoyed the means of grace; and the longer 
 we have enjoyed them the heavier will our account be if we have not 
 improved them. <I>These three years</I> (these three and twenty years) 
 <I>have I come seeking fruit on this fig-tree.</I> All this while, 

 1. God had been constant in sending messages to them, as there was
 occasion for them: "From that time <I>to this very day the word of the 
 Lord has come into me,</I> for your use." Though they had the substance 
 of the warning sent them already in the books of Moses, yet, because 
 those were not duly regarded and applied, God sent to enforce them and 
 make them more particular, that they might be without excuse. Thus 
 God's Spirit was striving with them, as with the old world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:3">Gen. vi. 3</A>.

 2. Jeremiah had been faithful and industrious in delivering those 
 messages. He could appeal to themselves, as well as to God and his own 
 conscience, concerning this: <I>I have spoken to you, rising early and 
 speaking.</I> He had declared to them <I>the whole counsel of God;</I> 
 he had taken a great deal of care and pains to discharge his thrust in 
 such a manner as might be most likely to win and work upon them. What 
 men are solicitous about and intent upon they rise up early to 
 prosecute. It intimates that his head was so full of thoughts about it, 
 and his heart so intent upon doing good, that it broke his sleep, and 
 made him get up betimes to project which way he might take that would 
 be most likely to do them good. He rose early, both because he would 
 lose no time and because he would lay hold on and improve the best time 
 to work upon them, when, if ever, they were sober and sedate. Christ 
 came <I>early in the morning</I> to preach in the temple, and the 
 people as early to hear him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:38">Luke xxi. 38</A>.

 Morning lectures have their advantages. <I>My voice shalt thou hear in
 the morning.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Besides him, God had sent them other prophets, on the same errand, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Of the writing prophets Micah, Nahum, and Habakkuk, were a little 
 before him, and Zephaniah contemporary with him. But, besides those, 
 there were many other of God's <I>servants the prophets</I> who 
 preached awakening sermons, which were never published. And here God 
 himself is said to <I>rise early</I> and <I>send them,</I> intimating 
 how much his heart also was upon it, that this people should <I>turn 
 and live,</I> and not <I>go on and die,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:11">Ezek. xxxiii. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. All the messages sent them were to the purpose, and much to the 
 same purport, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 1. They all told them of their faults, <I>their evil way,</I> and the 
 <I>evil of their doings.</I> Those were not of God's sending who 
 flattered them as if there were nothing amiss among them. 

 2. They all reproved them particularly for their idolatry, as a sin 
 that was in a special manner provoking to God, their <I>going after 
 other gods, to serve them and to worship them,</I> gods that were 
 <I>the work of their own hands.</I> 

 3. They all called on them to repent of their sins and to reform their
 lives. This was the burden of every song, <I>Turn you now every one 
 from his evil way.</I> Note, Personal and particular reformation must 
 be insisted on as necessary to a national deliverance: <I>every one</I> 
 must <I>turn from his</I> own <I>evil way.</I> The street will not be 
 clean unless every one sweep before his own door. 

 4. They all assured them that, if they did so, it would certainly be
 the <I>lengthening out of their tranquillity.</I> The mercies they 
 enjoyed should be continued to them: "<I>You shall dwell in the 
 land,</I> dwell at ease, dwell in peace, in this good land, <I>which 
 the Lord has given you and your fathers.</I> Nothing but sin will turn 
 you out of it, and that shall not if you turn from it." The judgments 
 they feared should be prevented: <I>Provoke me not, and I will do you 
 no hurt.</I> Note, We should never receive from God the evil punishment 
 if we did not provoke him by the evil of sin. God deals fairly with us, 
 never corrects his children without cause, nor causes grief to us 
 unless we give offence to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Yet all was to no purpose. They were not wrought upon to take the 
 right and only method to turn away the wrath of God. Jeremiah was a 
 very lively affectionate preacher, yet <I>they hearkened not</I> to 
 him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 The other prophets dealt faithfully with them, but neither did they 
 <I>hearken to them,</I> nor <I>incline their ear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 That very particular sin which they were told, of all others, was most 
 offensive to God, and made them obnoxious to his justice, they wilfully 
 persisted in: You <I>provoke me with the works of your hands to your 
 own hurt.</I> Note, What is a provocation to God will prove, in the 
 end, hurt to ourselves, and we must bear the blame of it. <I>O Israel!
 thou hast destroyed thyself.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  Therefore thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts; Because ye have not
 heard my words,
 &nbsp; 9  Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north,
 saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my
 servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the
 inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about,
 and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and
 a hissing, and perpetual desolations.
 &nbsp; 10  Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the
 voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of
 the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the
 candle.
 &nbsp; 11  And this whole land shall be a desolation, <I>and</I> an
 astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon
 seventy years.
 &nbsp; 12  And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are
 accomplished, <I>that</I> I will punish the king of Babylon, and that
 nation, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, for their iniquity, and the land of the
 Chaldeans, and will make it perpetual desolations.
 &nbsp; 13  And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have
 pronounced against it, <I>even</I> all that is written in this book,
 which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations.
 &nbsp; 14  For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of
 them also: and I will recompense them according to their deeds,
 and according to the works of their own hands.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is the sentence grounded upon the foregoing charge: "<I>Because 
 you have not heard my words,</I> I must take another course with you," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Note, When men will not regard the judgments of God's mouth they may 
 expect to feel the judgments of his hands, to hear the rod, since they 
 would not hear the word; for the sinner must either be parted from his 
 sin or perish in it. Wrath comes without remedy against those only that 
 sin without repentance. It is not so much men's turning aside that 
 ruins them as their not returning.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The ruin of the land of Judah by the king of Babylon's armies is 
 here decreed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 God sent to them <I>his servants the prophets,</I> and they were not 
 heeded, and therefore God will send for <I>his servant the king of 
 Babylon,</I> whom they cannot mock, and despise, and persecute, as they 
 did his servants the prophets. Note, The messengers of God's wrath will 
 be sent against those that would not receive the messengers of his 
 mercy. One way or other God will be heeded, and will make men know that 
 <I>he is the Lord.</I> Nebuchadrezzar, though a stranger to the true 
 God, the God of Israel, nay, an enemy to him and afterwards a rival 
 with him, was yet, in the descent he made upon his country. <I>God's 
 servant,</I> accomplished his purpose, was employed by him, and was an 
 instrument in his hand for the correction of his people. He was really 
 serving God's designs when he thought he was serving his own ends. 
 Justly therefore does God here call himself <I>The Lord of hosts</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 for here is an instance of his sovereign dominion, not only over the 
 inhabitants, but over the armies of this earth, of which he makes what 
 use he pleases. He has them all at his command. The most potent and 
 absolute monarchs are his servants. Nebuchadrezzar, who is an 
 instrument of his wrath, is as truly his servant as Cyrus, who is an 
 instrument of his mercy. The land of Judah being to be made desolate, 
 God here musters his army that is to make it so, gathers it together, 
 takes <I>all the families of the north,</I> if there be occasion for 
 them, leads them on as their commander-in-chief, <I>brings them against 
 this land,</I> gives them success, not only against Judah and 
 Jerusalem, but against <I>all the nations round about,</I> that there 
 might be no dependence upon them as allies or assistants against that 
 threatening force. The utter destruction of this and all the 
 neighbouring lands is here described, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:9-11"><I>v.</I> 9-11</A>.

 It shall be total: <I>The whole land shall be a desolation,</I> not 
 only desolate, but a desolation itself; both city and country shall be 
 laid waste, and all the wealth of both be made a prey of. It shall be 
 lasting, even <I>perpetual desolations;</I> they shall continue so long 
 in ruins, and after long waiting there shall appear so little prospect 
 of relief, that every one shall call it perpetual. This desolation 
 shall be the ruin of their credit among their neighbours; it shall bury 
 their honour in the dust, shall <I>make them an astonishment and a 
 hissing;</I> every one will be amazed at them, and hiss them off the 
 stage of action with just disgrace for deserting a God who would have 
 been their protection for impostors who would certainly be their 
 destruction. It will likewise be the ruin of all their comfort among 
 themselves; it shall be a final period of all their joy: <I>I will take 
 from them the voice of mirth,</I> hang their harps on the willow-trees, 
 and put them out of tune for songs. <I>I will take from them the voice 
 of mirth;</I> they shall neither have cause for it nor hearts for it. 
 They would not hear the voice of God's word and therefore the voice of 
 mirth shall no more be heard among them. They shall be deprived of 
 food: <I>The sound of the mill-stones shall not be heard;</I> for, when 
 the enemy has seized their stores, the sound of the grinding must needs 
 be low, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:4">Eccl. xii. 4</A>.

 An end shall be put to all business; there shall not be seen <I>the
 light of a candle,</I> for there shall be no work to be done worth 
 candle-light. And, <I>lastly,</I> they shall be deprived of their
 liberty: <I>Those nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy 
 years.</I> The fixing of time during which the captivity should last 
 would be of great use, not only for the confirmation of the prophecy, 
 when the event (which in this particular could by no human sagacity be 
 foreseen) should exactly answer the prediction, but for the comfort of 
 the people of God in their calamity and the encouragement of faith and 
 prayer. Daniel, who was himself a prophet, had an eye to it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:2">Dan. ix. 2</A>.
 
 Nay, God himself had an eye to it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:22">2 Chron. xxxvi. 22</A>);

 for <I>therefore</I> he <I>stirred up the spirit of Cyrus,</I> that the
 word spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished. <I>Known 
 unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world,</I> which 
 appears by this, that, when he has thought fit, some of them have been 
 made known to his servants the prophets and by them to his church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The ruin of Babylon, at last, is here likewise foretold, as it had 
 been, long before, by Isaiah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:12-14"><I>v.</I> 12-14</A>.

 The destroyers must themselves be destroyed, and the rod thrown into 
 the fire, when the correcting work is done with it. This shall be done 
 when <I>seventy years are accomplished;</I> for the destruction of 
 Babylon must make way for the deliverance of the captives. It is a 
 great doubt when these <I>seventy years</I> commence; some date them 
 from the captivity in the fourth year of Jehoiakim and first of 
 Nebuchadrezzar, others from the captivity of Jehoiachin eight years 
 after. I rather incline to the former, because then these nations began 
 <I>to serve the king of Babylon,</I> and because usually God has taken 
 the earliest time from which to reckon the accomplishment of a promise 
 of mercy, as will appear in computing the 400 years' servitude in 
 Egypt. And, if so, eighteen or nineteen years of the seventy had run 
 out before Jerusalem and the temple were quite destroyed in the 
 eleventh year of Zedekiah. However that be, when the time, the set
 time, to favour Zion, has come, the king of Babylon must be visited, 
 and all the instances of his tyranny reckoned for; then that nation 
 shall be punished <I>for their iniquity,</I> as the other nations have 
 been punished for theirs. That land must then be a <I>perpetual 
 desolation,</I> such as they had made other lands; for the <I>Judge of 
 all the earth</I> will both <I>do right</I> and <I>avenge wrong,</I> as 
 King of nations and King of saints. Let proud conquerors and oppressors 
 be moderate in the use of their power and success, for it will come at 
 last to their own turn to suffer; their day will come to fall. In this 
 destruction of Babylon, which was to be brought about by the Medes and 
 Persians, reference shall be had, 

 1. To what God had said: <I>I will bring upon that land all my
 words;</I> for all the wealth and honour of Babylon shall be sacrificed 
 to the truth of the divine predictions, and all its power broken, 
 rather than one iota or tittle of God's word shall fall to the ground. 
 The same Jeremiah that prophesied the destruction of other nations by 
 the Chaldeans foretold also the destruction of the Chaldeans 
 themselves; and this must be brought upon them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 It is with reference to this very event that God says, I will 
 <I>confirm the word of my servant,</I> and <I>perform the counsel of my 
 messengers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:26">Isa. xliv. 26</A>.
 
 2. Two what they had done
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>I will recompense them according to their deeds,</I> by which they 
 transgressed the law of God, even then when they were made to serve his 
 purposes. They had made many nations to serve them, and trampled upon 
 them with the greatest insolence imaginable; but not that the measure 
 of their iniquity is full <I>many nations and great kings,</I> that are 
 in alliance with and come in to the assistance of Cyrus king of Persia, 
 shall <I>serve themselves of them</I> also, shall make themselves 
 masters of their country, enrich themselves with their spoils, and make 
 them the footstool by which to mount the throne of universal monarchy.
 They shall make use of them for servants and soldiers. <I>He that leads 
 into captivity shall go into captivity.</I></P>

 &nbsp; 19  Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes,
 and all his people;
 &nbsp; 20  And all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of
 Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and
 Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod,
 &nbsp; 21  Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon,
 &nbsp; 22  And all the kings of Tyrus, and all the kings of Zidon, and
 the kings of the isles which <I>are</I> beyond the sea,
 &nbsp; 23  Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all <I>that are</I> in the utmost
 corners,
 &nbsp; 24  And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the
 mingled people that dwell in the desert,
 &nbsp; 25  And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and
 all the kings of the Medes,
 &nbsp; 26  And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with
 another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which <I>are</I> upon the
 face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after
 them.
 &nbsp; 27  Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of
 hosts, the God of Israel; Drink ye, and be drunken, and spue, and
 fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send
 among you.
 &nbsp; 28  And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine
 hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 of hosts; Ye shall certainly drink.
 &nbsp; 29  For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called
 by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be
 unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants
 of the earth, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts.

 Under the similitude of a cup going round, which all the company must 
 drink of, is here represented the universal desolation that was now 
 coming upon that part of the world which Nebuchadrezzar, who just now 
 began to reign and act, was to be the instrument of, and which should 
 at length recoil upon his own country. The cup in the vision is to be a 
 sword in the accomplishment of it: so it is explained, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 It is <I>the sword that I will send among them,</I> the sword of war, 
 that should be irresistibly strong and implacably cruel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. As to the circumstances of this judgment, observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Whence this destroying sword should come--<I>from the hand of
 God.</I> It is the <I>sword of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+47:6"><I>ch.</I> xlvii. 6</A>),

 <I>bathed in heaven,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:5">Isa. xxxiv. 5</A>.

 Wicked men are made use of as his sword,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:13">Ps. xvii. 13</A>.

 It is <I>the wine-cup of his fury.</I> It is the just anger of God that
 sends this judgment. The nations have provoked him by their sins, and 
 they must fall under the tokens of his wrath. These are compared to
 some intoxicating liquor, which they shall be forced to drink of, as, 
 formerly, condemned malefactors were sometimes executed by being 
 compelled to drink poison. The wicked are said to <I>drink the wrath of 
 the Almighty,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:20,Re+14:10">Job xxi. 20; Rev. xiv. 10</A>.

 Their share of troubles in his world is represented by the dregs of a
 cup of red wine full of mixture,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+75:8">Ps. lxxv. 8</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+11:6">Ps. xi. 6</A>.

 The wrath of God in this world is but as a cup, in comparison of the
 full streams of it in the other world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. By whose hand it should be sent to them--by the hand of Jeremiah as
 the judge <I>set over the nations</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:10"><I>ch.</I> i. 10</A>),

 to pass his sentence upon them, and by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar as
 the executioner. What a much greater figure then does the poor prophet 
 make than what the potent prince makes, if we look upon their relation 
 to God, though in the eye of the world it was the reverse of it! 
 Jeremiah must <I>take the cup at God's hand,</I> and compel the nations 
 <I>to drink it.</I> He foretels no hurt to them but what God appoints 
 him to foretel; and what is foretold by a divine authority will 
 certainly be fulfilled by a divine power.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. On whom it should be sent--on all the nations within the verge of
 Israel's acquaintance and the lines of their communication. Jeremiah 
 took the cup, and <I>made all the nations to drink of it,</I> that is, 
 he prophesied concerning each of the nations here mentioned that they 
 should share in this great desolation that was coming. <I>Jerusalem and 
 the cities of Judah</I> are put first 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>);

 for <I>judgment begins at the house of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:17">1 Pet. iv. 17</A>),
 
 at the sanctuary, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+9:6">Ezek. ix. 6</A>.

 Whether Nebuchadrezzar had his eye principally upon Jerusalem and Judah 
 in this expedition or no does not appear; probably he had; for it was 
 as considerable as any of the nations here mentioned. However God had 
 his eye principally to them. And this part of the prophecy was already 
 begun to be accomplished; this is denoted by that melancholy 
 parenthesis (<I>as it is this day</I>), for in the fourth year of 
 Jehoiakim things had come into a very bad posture, and all the 
 foundations were out of course. <I>Pharaoh king of Egypt</I> comes 
 next, because the Jews trusted to that broken reed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);

 the remains of them fled to Egypt, and there Jeremiah particularly 
 foretold the destruction of that country,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+43:10,11"><I>ch.</I> xliii. 10, 11</A>.

 All the other nations that bordered upon Canaan must pledge Jerusalem
 in this bitter cup, this cup of trembling. The <I>mingled people,</I> 
 the Arabians (so some), some rovers of divers nations that lived by 
 rapine (so others); <I>the kings of the land of Uz,</I> joined to the 
 country of the Edomites. The Philistines had been vexatious to Israel, 
 but now their cities and their lords become a prey to this mighty 
 conqueror. Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Zidon, are places well known to 
 border upon Israel; the <I>Isles beyond,</I> or <I>beside, the sea,</I> 
 are supposed to be those parts of Ph&oelig;nicia and Syria that lay upon the 
 coast of the Mediterranean Sea. Dedan and the other countries mentioned 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>)

 seem to have lain upon the confines of Idumea and Arabia the desert.
 Those of Elam are the Persians, with whom the Medes are joined, now 
 looked upon as inconsiderable and yet afterwards able to make reprisals 
 upon Babylon for themselves and all their neighbours. The <I>kings of
 the north,</I> that lay nearer to Babylon, and others that lay at some 
 distance, will be sure to be seized on and made a prey of by the 
 victorious sword of Nebuchadrezzar. Nay, he shall push on his victories 
 with such incredible fury and success that all the kingdoms of the 
 world that were then and there known should become sacrifices to his 
 ambition. Thus Alexander is said to have conquered <I>the world,</I> 
 and the Roman empire is called <I>the world,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:1">Luke ii. 1</A>.

 Or it may be taken as reading the doom of <I>all the kingdoms</I> of
 the earth; one time or other, they shall feel the dreadful effects of 
 war. The world has been, and will be, a great cockpit, while men's
 lusts war as they do <I>in their members,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:1">Jam. iv. 1</A>.

 But, that the conquerors may see their fate with the conquered, it
 concludes, <I>The king of Sheshach shall drink after them,</I> that is, 
 the king of Babylon himself, who has given his neighbours all this 
 trouble and vexation, shall at length have it return upon his own head. 
 That by Sheshach is meant Babylon is plain from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:41"><I>ch.</I> li. 41</A>;

 but whether it was another name of the same city or the name of another
 city of the same kingdom is uncertain. Babylon's ruin was foretold, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.

 Upon this prophecy of its being the author of the ruin of so many 
 nations it is very fitly repeated here again.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. What should be the effect of it. The desolations which the sword 
 should make in all these kingdoms are represented by the consequences 
 of excessive drinking 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>They shall drink, and be moved, and be mad. They shall be drunken, 
 and spue, and fall and rise no more,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.
 
 Now this may serve,
 
 (1.) To make us loathe the sin of drunkenness, that the consequences of 
 it are made use of to set forth a most woeful and miserable condition. 
 Drunkenness deprives men, for the present, of the use of their reason, 
 makes them mad. It takes from them likewise that which, next to reason, 
 is the most valuable blessing, and that is health; it makes them sick, 
 and endangers the bones and the life. Men in drink often <I>fall and 
 rise no more;</I> it is a sin that is its own punishment. How 
 wretchedly are those intoxicated and besotted that suffer themselves at 
 any time to be intoxicated, especially to be by the frequent commission 
 of the sin besotted with wine or strong drink! 

 (2.) To make us dread the judgments of war. When God sends the sword 
 upon a nation, with warrant to make it desolate, it soon becomes like a 
 drunken man, filled with confusion at the alarms of war, put into a 
 hurry; its counsellors <I>mad,</I> and at their wits' end, staggering 
 in all the measures they take, all the motions they make, sick at heart 
 with continual vexation, <I>vomiting up the riches</I> they have 
 greedily <I>swallowed down</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:15">Job xx. 15</A>),

 <I>falling</I> down before the enemy, and as unable to get up again, or
 do any thing to help themselves, as a man <I>dead drunk is,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:16">Hab. ii. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The undoubted certainty of it, with the reason given for it, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:28,29"><I>v.</I> 28, 29</A>.

 They will <I>refuse to take the cup at thy hand;</I> not only they will 
 be loth that the judgment should come, but they will be loth to believe 
 that ever it will come; they will not give credit to the prediction of 
 so despicable a man as Jeremiah. But he must tell them that it is 
 <I>the word of the Lord of hosts,</I> he hath said it; and it is in 
 vain for them to struggle with Omnipotence: <I>You shall certainly 
 drink.</I> And he must give them this reason, It is a time of 
 visitation, it is a reckoning day, and Jerusalem has been called to an 
 account already: <I>I begin to bring evil on the city that is called by 
 my name;</I> its relation to me will not exempt it from punishment, and 
 <I>should you be utterly unpunished?</I> No; <I>If this be done in the 
 green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</I> If those who have some 
 good in them smart so severely for the evil that is found in them, can 
 those expect to escape who have worse evils, and no good, found among 
 them? If Jerusalem be punished for learning idolatry of the nations, 
 shall not the nations be punished, of whom they learned it? No doubt 
 they shall: <I>I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the 
 earth,</I> for they have helped to debauch the inhabitants of 
 Jerusalem.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Upon this whole matter we may observe, 

 1. That there is a God that judges in the earth, to whom all the
 nations of the earth are accountable, and by whose judgment they must 
 abide. 

 2. That God can easily bring to ruin the greatest nations, the most 
 numerous and powerful, and such as have been most secure. 

 3. That those who have been vexatious and mischievous to the people of
 God will be reckoned with for it at last. Many of these nations had in 
 their turns given disturbance to Israel, but now comes destruction on 
 them. The year of the redeemer will come, even the <I>year of
 recompenses</I> for the controversy of Zion. 

 4. That the <I>burden of the word of the Lord</I> will at last become 
 the burden of his judgments. Isaiah had prophesied long since against 
 most of these nations

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:1-27"><I>ch.</I> xiii.</A>,

 &c.) and now at length all his prophecies will have their complete
 fulfilling. 

 5. That those who are ambitious of power and dominion commonly become
 the troublers of the earth and the plagues of their generation.
 Nebuchadrezzar was so proud of his might that he had no sense of right.
 These are the men that turn the world upside down, and yet expect to be 
 admired and adored. Alexander thought himself a great prince when 
 others thought him no better than a great pirate. 

 6. That the greatest pomp and power in this world are of very uncertain 
 continuance. Before Nebuchadrezzar's greater force kings themselves 
 must yield and become captives.</P>

 ashes,</I> ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have, in these verses, a further description of those terrible 
 desolations which the king of Babylon with his armies should make in 
 all the countries and nations round about Jerusalem. In Jerusalem God 
 had erected his temple; there were his oracles and ordinances, which 
 the neighbouring nations should have attended to and might have 
 received benefit by; thither they should have applied for the knowledge 
 of God and their duty, and then they might have had reason to bless God 
 for their neighbourhood to Jerusalem; but they, instead of that, taking 
 all opportunities either to debauch or to disturb that holy city, when 
 God came to reckon with Jerusalem because it learned so much of the 
 <I>way of the nations,</I> he reckoned with the nations because they 
 learned so little of the way of Jerusalem.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 They will soon be aware of Nebuchadrezzar's making war upon them; but 
 the prophet is here directed to tell them that it is God himself that 
 makes war upon them, a God with whom there is no contending. 

 1. The war is here proclaimed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 <I>The Lord shall roar from on high;</I> not <I>from Mount Zion and 
 Jerusalem</I> (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:16,Am+1:2">Joel iii. 16, Amos i. 2</A>),

 but from <I>heaven,</I> from <I>his holy habitation</I> there; for now
 Jerusalem is one of the places against which he roars. <I>He shall 
 mightily roar upon his habitation</I> on earth from that above. He has 
 been long silent, and seemed not to take notice of the wickedness of 
 the nations; the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now <I>he 
 shall give a shout,</I> as the assailants in battle do, <I>against all 
 the inhabitants of the earth,</I> to whom it shall be a shout of 
 terror, and yet a shout of joy in heaven, as theirs that <I>tread the 
 grapes;</I> for, when God is reckoning with the proud enemies of his 
 kingdom among men, there is a <I>great voice of much people heard in 
 heaven, saying, Hallelujah,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:1">Rev. xix. 1</A>.

 He <I>roars as a lion</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:4,8">Amos iii. 4, 8</A>),

 as a lion that has <I>forsaken his covert</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>),

 and is going abroad to seek his prey, upon which he roars, that he may 
 the more easily seize it. 

 2. The manifesto is here published, showing the causes and reasons why 
 God proclaims this war

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 <I>The Lord has a controversy with the nations;</I> he has just cause 
 to contend with them, and he will take this way of pleading with them. 
 His quarrel with them is, in one word, for their wickedness, their 
 contempt of him, and his authority over them and kindness to them. 
 <I>He will give those that are wicked to the sword.</I> They have 
 provoked God to anger, and thence comes all this destruction; it is 
 <I>because of the fierce anger of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:37,38"><I>v.</I> 37 and again <I>v.</I> 38</A>),

 the <I>fierceness of the oppressor,</I> or (as it might better be read) 
 <I>the fierceness of the oppressing sword</I> (for the word is 
 feminine) is <I>because of his fierce anger;</I> and we are sure that 
 he is never angry without cause; but <I>who knows the power of his 
 anger?</I> 

 3. The alarm is here given and taken: <I>A noise will come even to the
 ends of the earth,</I> so loud shall it roar, so far shall it reach,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 The alarm is not given by sound of trumpet, or beat of drum, but by a 
 <I>whirlwind, a great whirlwind, storm,</I> or <I>tempest,</I> which 
 shall be <I>raised up from the coasts,</I> the remote coasts <I>of the 
 earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 The Chaldean army shall be like a hurricane raised in the north, but 
 thence carried on with incredible fierceness and swiftness, bearing 
 down all before it. It is like the whirlwind out of which God answered 
 Job, which was exceedingly terrible, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:1,38:1">Job xxxvii. 1; xxxviii. 1</A>.

 And, when the wrath of God thus roars like a lion from heaven, no
 marvel if it be echoed with shrieks from earth; for who can choose but 
 tremble when God thus speaks in displeasure? See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:10">Hosea xi. 10</A>.

 Now the shepherds shall <I>howl and cry,</I> the kings, and princes,
 and the great ones of the earth, the <I>principal of the flock.</I> 
 They used to be the most courageous and secure, but now their hearts 
 shall fail them; <I>they shall wallow themselves in the ashes,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 Seeing themselves utterly unable to make head against the enemy, and 
 seeing their country, which they have the charge of and a concern for, 
 inevitably ruined, they shall abandon themselves to sorrow. There shall 
 be <I>a voice of the cry of the shepherds,</I> and a <I>howling of the 
 principal of the flock shall be heard,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 Those are great calamities indeed that strike such a terror upon the 
 great men, and put them into this consternation. <I>The Lord hath 
 spoiled their pasture,</I> in which they fed their flock, and out of 
 which they fed themselves; the spoiling of that makes them cry-out 
 thus. Perhaps, carrying on the metaphor of a lion roaring, it alludes 
 to the great fright that shepherds are in when they hear a roaring lion 
 coming towards their flocks, and find they have <I>no way to flee</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>)

 for their own safety, neither can the <I>principal of their flock 
 escape.</I> The enemy will be so numerous, so furious, so sedulous, and 
 the extent of their armies so vast, that it will be impossible to avoid 
 falling into their hands. Note, As we cannot out-face, so we cannot 
 out-run, the judgments of God. This is that for which the shepherds 
 <I>howl and cry.</I> 
 
 4. The progress of this war is here described

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):

 <I>Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation;</I> as the cup 
 goes round, every nation shall have its share and take warning by the 
 calamities of another to repent and reform. Nay, as if this ere to be
 a little representation of the last and general judgment, it shall 
 reach <I>from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the 
 earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 The day of vengeance is in his heart, and now <I>his hand shall find 
 out all his enemies,</I> wherever they are, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:8">Ps. xxi. 8</A>.

 Note, When our neighbour's house is on fire it is time to be concerned
 for our own. When one nation is a seat of war every neighbouring
 nation should hear, and fear, and make its peace with God.

 5. The dismal consequences of this war are here foretold: <I>The days
 of slaughter and dispersions are accomplished,</I> that is, they are 
 fully come

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 the time fixed in the divine counsel for the slaughter of some and the 
 dispersion of the rest, which will make the nations completely 
 desolate. Multitudes shall fall by the sword of the merciless 
 Chaldeans, so that <I>the slain of the Lord</I> shall be every where 
 found: they are slain by commission from him, and are sacrificed to his 
 justice. The slain for sin are the <I>slain of the Lord.</I> To 
 complete the misery of their slaughter, <I>they shall not be 
 lamented</I> in particular, so general shall the matter of lamentation 
 be. Nay, they shall not <I>be gathered</I> up, nor <I>buried,</I> for 
 they shall have no friends left to bury them, and the enemies shall not 
 have so much humanity in them as to do it; and then they shall be <I>as 
 dung upon the earth,</I> so vile and noisome: and it is well if, as 
 dung manures the earth and makes it fruitful, so these horrid 
 spectacles, which lie as monuments of divine justice, might be a means 
 to awaken the inhabitants of the earth to <I>learn righteousness.</I> 
 The effect of this war will be the <I>desolation of the whole land</I> 
 that is the seat of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>),

 one land after another. But here are two expressions more that seem to 
 make the case in a particular manner piteous. 

 (1.) <I>You shall fall like a pleasant vessel,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 The most desirable persons among them, who most valued themselves and 
 were most valued, who were looked upon as <I>vessels of honour,</I> 
 shall fall by the sword. You shall fall as a Venice glass or a China 
 dish, which is soon broken all to pieces. Even the tender and delicate 
 shall share in the common calamity; the sword devours one as well as 
 another.

 (2.) Even <I>the peaceable habitations are cut down.</I> Those that 
 used to be quiet, and not molested, the habitations in which you have 
 long dwelt in peace, shall now be no longer such, but <I>cut down</I> 
 by the war. Or, Those who used to be quiet, and not molesting any of 
 their neighbours, those who lived in peace, easily, and gave no 
 provocation to any, even those shall not escape. This is one of the 
 direful effects of war, that even those who were most harmless and 
 inoffensive suffer hard things. Blessed be God, there is a
 <I>peaceable habitation</I> above for all the sons of peace, which is 
 out of the reach of fire and sword.</P>
