 History is the best expositor of prophecy; and therefore, for the 
 better understanding of the prophecies of this book which relate to the 
 destruction of Jerusalem and the kingdom of Judah, we are here 
 furnished with an account of that sad event. It is much he same with 
 the history we had 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:1-25:30">2 Kings xxiv. and xxv.</A>,

 and many of the particulars we had before in that book, but the matter
 is here repeated and put together, to give light to the book of the
 Lamentations, which follows next, and to serve as a key to it. That
 article in the close concerning the advancement of Jehoiachin in his 
 captivity, which happened after Jeremiah's time, gives colour to the 
 conjecture of those who suppose that this chapter was not written by 
 Jeremiah himself, but by some man divinely inspired among those in 
 captivity, for a constant memorandum to those who in Babylon preferred 
 Jerusalem above their chief joy. In this chapter we have,

 I. The bad reign of Zedekiah, very bad in regard both of sin and of
 punishment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. The besieging and taking of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:4-7">ver. 4-7</A>.
 
 III. The severe usage which Zedekiah and the princes met with, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:8-11">ver. 8-11</A>.

 IV. The destruction of the temple and the city, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:12-14">ver. 12-14</A>.

 V. The captivity of the people
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:15,16">ver. 15, 16</A>)

 and the numbers of those that were carried away into captivity,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:28-30">ver. 28-30</A>.

 VI. The carrying off of the plunder of the temple,

 blood,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Zedekiah <I>was</I> one and twenty years old when he began to
 reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's
 name <I>was</I> Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
 &nbsp; 2  And he did <I>that which was</I> evil in the eyes of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
 &nbsp; 3  For through the anger of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> it came to pass in
 Jerusalem and Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence,
 that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
 &nbsp; 4  And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the
 tenth month, in the tenth <I>day</I> of the month, <I>that</I>
 Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against
 Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and built forts against it
 round about.
 &nbsp; 5  So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king
 Zedekiah.
 &nbsp; 6  And in the fourth month, in the ninth <I>day</I> of the month, the
 famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the
 people of the land.
 &nbsp; 7  Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and
 went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate
 between the two walls, which <I>was</I> by the king's garden; (now the
 Chaldeans <I>were</I> by the city round about:) and they went by the
 way of the plain.
 &nbsp; 8  But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and
 overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was
 scattered from him.
 &nbsp; 9  Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of
 Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment
 upon him.
 &nbsp; 10  And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his
 eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.
 &nbsp; 11  Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of
 Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put
 him in prison till the day of his death.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This narrative begins no higher than the beginning of the reign of 
 Zedekiah, though there were two captivities before, one in the fourth 
 year of Jehoiakim, the other in the first of Jeconiah; but probably it 
 was drawn up by some of those that were carried away with Zedekiah, as 
 a reproach to themselves for imagining that they should not go into 
 captivity after their brethren, with which hopes they had long 
 flattered themselves. We have here, 

 1. God's just displeasure against Judah and Jerusalem for their sin,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 His anger was against them to such a degree that he determined to 
 <I>cast them out from his presence,</I> his favourable gracious 
 presence, as a father, when he is extremely angry with an undutiful 
 son, bids him get out of his presence, he expelled them from that good 
 land that had such tokens of his presence in providential bounty and 
 that holy city and temple that had such tokens of his presence in 
 covenant-grace and love. Note, Those that are banished from God's 
 ordinances have reason to complain that they are in some degree <I>cast 
 out of his presence;</I> yet none are cast out from God's gracious 
 presence but those that by sin have first thrown themselves out of it. 
 This fruit of sin we should therefore deprecate above any thing, as 
 David 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:11">Ps. li. 11</A>),
 
 <I>Cast me not away from thy presence.</I>

 2. Zedekiah's bad conduct and management, to which God left him, in
 displeasure against the people, and for which God punished him, in 
 displeasure against him. Zedekiah had arrived at years of discretion 
 when he came to the throne; he <I>was twenty-one years old</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>);
 
 he was none of the worst of the kings (we never read of his 
 idolatries), yet his character is that he <I>did evil in the eyes of 
 the Lord,</I> for he did not do the good he should have done. But that 
 evil deed of his which did in a special manner hasten this destruction 
 was his <I>rebelling against the king of Babylon,</I> which was both 
 his sin and his folly, and brought ruin upon his people, not only 
 meritoriously, but efficiently. God was greatly displeased with him for 
 his perfidious dealing with the king of Babylon (as we find,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:15">Ezek. xvii. 15</A>,

 &c.); and, because he was angry at Judah and Jerusalem, he put him into
 the hand of his own counsels, to do that foolish thing which proved 
 fatal to him and his kingdom. 

 3. The possession which the Chaldeans at length gained of Jerusalem,
 after eighteen months' siege. They sat down before it, and blocked it 
 up, in the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign, in the tenth month

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 and made themselves masters of it in the <I>eleventh year in the fourth 
 month,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 In remembrance of these two steps towards their ruin, while they were 
 in captivity, they kept <I>a fast in the fourth month, and a fast in 
 the tenth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:19">Zech. viii. 19</A>):

 that in the <I>fifth month</I> was in remembrance of the burning of the
 temple, and that in the <I>seventh</I> of the murder of Gedaliah. We 
 may easily imagine, or rather cannot imagine, what a sad time it was 
 with Jerusalem, during this year and half that it was besieged, when 
 all provisions were cut off from coming to them and they were ever and 
 anon alarmed by the attacks of the enemy, and, being obstinately 
 resolved to hold out to the last extremity, nothing remained but a 
 <I>certain fearful looking for of judgment.</I> That which disabled 
 them to hold out, and yet could not prevail with them to capitulate, 
 was the <I>famine in the city</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 there was <I>no bread for the people of the land,</I> so that the 
 soldiers could not make good their posts, but were rendered wholly 
 unserviceable; and then no wonder that <I>the city was broken up,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Walls, in such a case, will not hold out long without men, any more 
 than men without walls; nor will both together stand people in any 
 stead without God and his protection.

 4. The inglorious retreat of the king and his mighty men. They got out 
 of the city <I>by night</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>)

 and made the best of their way, I know not whither, nor perhaps they 
 themselves; but the king was overtaken by the pursuers <I>in the plains 
 of Jericho,</I> his guards were dispersed, and all his army was 
 <I>scattered from him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 His fright was not causeless, for there is no escaping the judgments of
 God; they will <I>come upon the sinner,</I> and will <I>overtake
 him,</I> let him flee where he will

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:15">Deut. xxviii. 15</A>),

 and these judgments particularly that are here executed were there
 threatened,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:52,53"><I>v.</I> 52, 53</A>,

 &c. 

 5. The sad doom passed upon Zedekiah by the king of Babylon, and
 immediately put in execution. He treated him as a rebel, <I>gave
 judgment upon him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 One cannot think of it without the utmost vexation and regret that a 
 king, a king of Judah, a king of the house of David, should be 
 arraigned as a criminal at the bar of this heathen king. But he 
 <I>humbled not himself before Jeremiah</I> the prophet; therefore God 
 thus humbled him. Pursuant to the sentence passed upon him by the
 haughty conqueror, <I>his sons were slain before his eyes,</I> and all 
 <I>the princes of Judah</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);

 then <I>his eyes were put out,</I> and he was <I>bound in chains,</I> 
 carried in triumph to Babylon; perhaps they made sport with him, as 
 they did with Samson when his eyes were put out; however, he was 
 condemned to perpetual imprisonment, wearing out the remainder of his 
 life (I cannot say his days, for he saw day no more) in darkness and 
 misery. He was kept in prison till <I>the day of his death,</I> but had 
 some honour done him at his funeral,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:5"><I>ch.</I> xxxiv. 5</A>.

 Jeremiah had often told him what it would come to, but he would not
 take warning when he might have prevented it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  Now in the fifth month, in the tenth <I>day</I> of the month,
 which <I>was</I> the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of
 Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, <I>which</I> served
 the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem,
 &nbsp; 13  And burned the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and the king's house; and
 all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great
 <I>men,</I> burned he with fire:
 &nbsp; 14  And all the army of the Chaldeans, that <I>were</I> with the
 captain of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round
 about.
 &nbsp; 15  Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away
 captive <I>certain</I> of the poor of the people, and the residue of
 the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away,
 that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.
 &nbsp; 16  But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left <I>certain</I> of
 the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.
 &nbsp; 17  Also the pillars of brass that <I>were</I> in the house of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and the bases, and the brasen sea that <I>was</I> in the house
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of
 them to Babylon.
 &nbsp; 18  The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and
 the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith
 they ministered, took they away.
 &nbsp; 19  And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the
 caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups;
 <I>that</I> which <I>was</I> of gold <I>in</I> gold, and <I>that</I> which <I>was</I> of
 silver <I>in</I> silver, took the captain of the guard away.
 &nbsp; 20  The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that
 <I>were</I> under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: the brass of all these vessels was without weight.
 &nbsp; 21  And <I>concerning</I> the pillars, the height of one pillar <I>was</I>
 eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it;
 and the thickness thereof <I>was</I> four fingers: <I>it was</I> hollow.
 &nbsp; 22  And a chapiter of brass <I>was</I> upon it; and the height of one
 chapiter <I>was</I> five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon
 the chapiters round about, all <I>of</I> brass. The second pillar also
 and the pomegranates <I>were</I> like unto these.
 &nbsp; 23  And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; <I>and</I>
 all the pomegranates upon the network <I>were</I> a hundred round
 about.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the woeful havoc that was made by the 
 Chaldean army, a month after the city was taken, under the command of 
 Nebuzaradan, who was <I>captain of the guard,</I> or general of the 
 army, in this action. In the margin he is called the <I>chief of the 
 slaughter-men,</I> or <I>executioners;</I> for soldiers are but 
 slaughter-men, and God employs them as executioners of his sentence 
 against a sinful people. Nebuzaradan was chief of those soldiers, but, 
 in the execution he did, we have reason to fear he had no eye to God, 
 but he served the king of Babylon and his own designs, now that he came 
 into Jerusalem, into the very bowels of it, as captain of the 
 slaughter-men there. And, 

 1. He laid the temple in ashes, having first plundered it of every
 thing that was valuable: He <I>burnt the house of the Lord,</I> that 
 holy and beautiful house, where their <I>fathers praised him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:11">Isa. lxiv. 11</A>.

 2. He burnt the royal palace, probably that which Solomon built after
 he had built the temple, which was, ever since, <I>the king's 
 house.</I>

 3. He burnt <I>all the houses of Jerusalem,</I> that is, all the houses
 of the great men, or those particularly; if any escaped, it was only 
 some sorry cottages for the poor of the land.

 4. He <I>broke down all the walls of Jerusalem,</I> to be revenged upon
 them for standing in the way of his army so long. Thus, of a defenced
 city, it was made a ruin,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:2">Isa. xxv. 2</A>.

 5. He <I>carried away many into captivity</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);

 he took away <I>certain of the poor of the people,</I> that is, of the 
 people in the city, for <I>the poor of the land</I> (the poor of the 
 country) he left for <I>vine-dressers and husbandmen.</I> He also 
 carried off <I>the residue of the people that remained in the city,</I> 
 that had escaped the sword and famine, and the deserters, such as he 
 thought fit, or rather such as God thought fit; for he had already 
 determined some for the <I>pestilence,</I> some for the <I>sword,</I> 
 some for <I>famine,</I> and some for <I>captivity,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:2"><I>ch.</I> xv. 2</A>.

 But, 

 6. Nothing is more particularly and largely related here than the
 carrying away of the appurtenances of the temple. All that were of 
 great value were carried away before, <I>the vessels of silver and 
 gold,</I> yet some of that sort remained, which were now carried away, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 But most of the temple-prey that was now seized was of brass, which, 
 being of less value, was carried off last. When the gold was gone, the 
 brass soon went after it, because the people repented not, according to 
 Jeremiah's prediction,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:19"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 19</A>,

 &c. When the walls of the city were demolished, the pillars of the
 temple were pulled down too, and both in token that God, who was the 
 strength and stay both of their civil and their ecclesiastical 
 government, had departed from them. No walls can protect those, nor 
 pillars sustain those, from whom God withdraws. These pillars of the 
 temple were not for support (for there was nothing built upon them), 
 but for ornament and significancy. They were called <I>Jachin--He will 
 establish;</I> and <I>Boaz--In him is strength;</I> so that the 
 breaking of these signified that God would no longer establish his 
 house nor be the strength of it. These pillars are here very 
 particularly described 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:21-23,1Ki+7:15"><I>v.</I> 21-23,
 from 1 Kings vii. 15</A>),

 that the extraordinary beauty and stateliness of them may affect us the 
 more with the demolishing of them. All the vessels that belonged to the 
 brazen altar were carried away; for the iniquity of Jerusalem, like 
 that of Eli's house, was not to be purged by sacrifice or offering, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:14">
 1 Sam. iii. 14</A>.
 
 It is said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 <I>The brass of all these vessels was without weight;</I> so it was in 
 the making of them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+7:47">1 Kings vii. 47</A>),

 <I>the weight of the brass was not</I> then <I>found out</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+4:18">2 Chron. iv. 18</A>),

 and so it was in the destroying of them. Those that made great spoil of
 them did not stand to weigh them, as purchasers do, for, whatever they 
 weighted, it was all their own.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>24  And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest,
 and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the
 door:
 &nbsp; 25  He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge
 of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the
 king's person, which were found in the city; and the principal
 scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and
 threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the
 midst of the city.
 &nbsp; 26  So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and
 brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.
 &nbsp; 27  And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in
 Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive
 out of his own land.
 &nbsp; 28  This <I>is</I> the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away
 captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and
 twenty:
 &nbsp; 29  In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away
 captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons:
 &nbsp; 30  In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar
 Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the
 Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons <I>were</I>
 four thousand and six hundred.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a very melancholy account, 

 1. Of the slaughter of some great men, in cold blood, at Riblah,
 seventy-two in number (according to the number of the elders of Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:24,25">Num. xi. 24, 25</A>),
 
 so they are computed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+25:18,19">2 Kings xxv. 18, 19</A>.

 We read there of five out of the temple, two out of the city, five out
 of the court, and sixty out of the country. The account here agrees
 with that, except in one article; there it is said that there were 
 five, here there were seven, of those that were <I>near the king,</I> 
 which Dr. Lightfoot reconciles thus, that he took away seven of those 
 that were near the king, but two of them were Jeremiah himself and 
 Ebed-melech, who were both discharged, as we have read before, so that 
 there were only five of them put to death, and so the number was 
 reduced to seventy-two, some of all ranks, for they had all corrupted 
 their way; and it is probable that such were made examples of as had 
 been most forward to excite and promote the rebellion against the king 
 of Babylon. <I>Seraiah the chief priest</I> is put first, whose sacred 
 character could not exempt him from this stroke; how should it, when he 
 himself had profaned it by sin? Seraiah the prince was <I>a quiet 
 prince</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:59"><I>ch.</I> li. 59</A>),

 but perhaps Seraiah the priest was not so, but unquiet and turbulent,
 by which he had made himself obnoxious to the king of Babylon. The 
 leaders of this people had caused them to err, and now they are in a 
 particular manner made monuments of divine justice. 

 2. Of the captivity of the rest. Come and see how <I>Judah was carried
 away captive out of his own land</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 and how it spued them out as it spued out the Canaanites that went 
 before them, which God had told them it would certainly do if they trod 
 in their steps and copied out their abominations, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:28">Lev. xviii. 28</A>.

 Now here is an account, 

 (1.) Of two captivities which we had an account of before, one in the 
 seventh year of Nebuchadnezzar (the same with that which is said to be 
 in his eighth year, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:12">2 Kings xxiv. 12</A>),

 another in his eighteenth year, the same with that which is said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>)

 to be in his nineteenth year. But the sums here are very small, in 
 comparison with what we find expressed concerning the former 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:14,16">2 Kings xxiv. 14, 16</A>),

 when there were 18,000 carried captive, whereas here they are said to
 be 3023; they are also small in comparison with what we may reasonably 
 suppose concerning the latter; for, when all the residue of the people 
 were carried away

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 one would think there should be more than 832 souls; therefore Dr.
 Lightfoot conjectures that, these accounts being joined to the story of 
 the putting to death of the great men at Riblah, all that are here said 
 to be carried away were <I>put to death</I> as rebels. 

 (2.) Of a third captivity, not mentioned before, which was in the 
 twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, four years after the destruction 
 of Jerusalem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):
 
 Then <I>Nebuzaradan</I> came, and <I>carried away</I> 745 Jews; it is 
 probable that this was done in revenge of the murder of Gedaliah, which 
 was another rebellion against the king of Babylon, and that those who 
 were now taken were aiders and abetters of Ishmael in that murder, and 
 were not only carried away, but put to death for it; yet this is 
 uncertain. If this be the sum total of the captives (<I>all the persons 
 were</I> 4600, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 we may see how strangely they were reduced from what they had been, and 
 may wonder as much how they came to be so numerous again as afterwards 
 we find them; for it should seem that, as at first in Egypt, so again 
 in Babylon, the Lord made them fruitful in the land of their 
 affliction, and the more they were oppressed the more they multiplied. 
 And the truth is, this people were often miracles both of judgment and 
 mercy.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>31  And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the
 captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in
 the five and twentieth <I>day</I> of the month, <I>that</I> Evil-merodach
 king of Babylon in the <I>first</I> year of his reign lifted up the
 head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of
 prison,
 &nbsp; 32  And spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the
 throne of the kings that <I>were</I> with him in Babylon,
 &nbsp; 33  And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat
 bread before him all the days of his life.
 &nbsp; 34  And <I>for</I> his diet, there was a continual diet given him of
 the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his
 death, all the days of his life.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This passage of story concerning the reviving which king Jehoiachin had 
 in his bondage we had likewise before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+25:27-30">2 Kings xxv. 27-30</A>),

 only there it is said to be done on <I>the twenty-seventh day of the
 twelfth month,</I> here <I>on the twenty-fifth;</I> but in a thing of 
 this nature two days make a very slight difference in the account. It 
 is probable that the orders were given for his release on the 
 twenty-fifth day, but that he was not presented to the king till the 
 twenty-seventh. We may observe in this story,

 1. That new lords make new laws. Nebuchadnezzar had long kept this
 unhappy prince in prison; and his son, though well-affected to the 
 prisoner, could not procure him any favour, not one smile, from his 
 father, any more than Jonathan could for David from his father; but, 
 when the old peevish man was dead, his son countenanced Jehoiachin and 
 made him a favourite. It is common for children to undo what their 
 fathers have done; it were well if it were always as much for the 
 better as this was. 

 2. That the world we live in is a changing world. Jehoiachin, in his
 beginning, fell from a throne into a prison, but here he is advanced 
 again to a throne of state

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),

 though not to a throne of power. As, before, the robes were changed 
 into prison-garments, so now they were converted into robes again. Such 
 chequer-work is this world; prosperity and adversity are set the one 
 over-against the other, that we may learn to <I>rejoice as though we 
 rejoiced not and weep as though we wept not.</I> 

 3. That, though the night of affliction be very long, yet we must not
 despair but that the day may dawn at last. Jehoiachin was thirty-seven 
 years a prisoner, in confinement, in contempt, ever since he was 
 eighteen years old, in which time we may suppose him so inured to 
 captivity that he had forgotten the sweets of liberty; or, rather, that 
 after so long an imprisonment it would be doubly welcome to him. Let 
 those whose afflictions have been lengthened out encourage themselves 
 with this instance; the vision will at the end speak comfortably, and 
 therefore wait for it. <I>Dum spiro spero--While there is life there is 
 hope. Non si male nunc, et olim sic erit--Though now we suffer, we 
 shall not always suffer.</I> 

 4. That god can make his people to find favour in the eyes of those
 that are their oppressors, and unaccountably turn their hearts to pity 
 them, according to that word

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:46">
 Ps. cvi. 46</A>),

 <I>He made them to be pitied of all those that carried them
 captives.</I> He can bring those that have spoken roughly to speak 
 kindly, and those to feed his people that have fed upon them. Those 
 therefore that are under oppression will find that it is not in vain to 
 hope and quietly to <I>wait for the salvation of the Lord. 
 Therefore</I> our times are in God's hand, because the hearts of all we 
 deal with are so. 

 5. And now, upon the whole matter, comparing the prophecy and the
 history of this book together, we may learn, in general,

 (1.) That it is no new thing for churches and persons highly dignified 
 to degenerate, and become very corrupt. 

 (2.) That iniquity tends to the ruin of those that harbour it; and, if 
 it be not repented of and forsaken, will certainly end in their ruin: 
 
 (3.) That external professions and privileges will not only not amount
 to an excuse for sin and an exemption from ruin, but will be a very 
 great aggravation of both. 

 (4.) That no word of God shall fall to the ground, but the event will 
 fully answer the prediction; and the unbelief of man shall not make 
 God's threatenings, any more than his promises, of no effect. The
 justice and truth of God are here written in bloody characters, for the 
 conviction or the confusion of all those that make a jest of his 
 threatenings. Let them <I>not be deceived, God is not mocked.</I></P>
