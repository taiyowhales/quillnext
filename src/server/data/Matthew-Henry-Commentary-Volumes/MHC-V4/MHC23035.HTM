 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As after a prediction of God's judgments upon the world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:1-23"><I>ch.</I> xxiv.</A>)
 follows a promise of great mercy to be had in store for his church

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:1-2"><I>ch.</I> xxv.</A>),

 so here after a black and dreadful scene of confusion in the foregoing
 chapter we have, in this, a bright and pleasant one, which, though it 
 foretel the flourishing estate of Hezekiah's kingdom in the latter part 
 of his reign, yet surely looks as far beyond that as the prophecy in 
 the foregoing chapter does beyond the destruction of the Edomites; both 
 were typical, and it concerns us most to look at those things which 
 they were typical of, the kingdom of Christ and the kingdom of heaven. 
 When the world, which lies in wickedness, shall be laid in ruins, and 
 the Jewish church, which persisted in infidelity, shall become a 
 desolation, then the gospel church shall be set up and made to 
 flourish. 

 I. The Gentiles shall be brought into it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:1,2,7">ver. 1, 2, 7</A>.

 II. The well-wishers to it, who were weak and timorous, shall be
 encouraged, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>.

 III. Miracles shall be wrought both on the souls and on the bodies of 
 men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:5,6">ver. 5, 6</A>.

 IV. The gospel church shall be conducted in the way of holiness, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:8,9">ver. 8, 9</A>.

 V. It shall be brought at last to endless joys, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:10">ver. 10</A>.

 Thus do we find more of Christ and heaven in this chapter than one 
 would have expected in the Old Testament.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them;
 and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.
 &nbsp; 2  It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and
 singing: the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the
 excellency of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>and</I> the excellency of our God.
 &nbsp; 3  Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.
 &nbsp; 4  Say to them <I>that are</I> of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear
 not: behold, your God will come <I>with</I> vengeance, <I>even</I> God
 <I>with</I> a recompence; he will come and save you.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The desert land blooming. In the foregoing chapter we had a populous 
 and fruitful country turned into a horrid wilderness; here we have in 
 lieu of that, a wilderness turned into a good land. When the land of 
 Judah was freed from the Assyrian army, those parts of the country that 
 had been made as a wilderness by the ravages and outrages they 
 committed began to recover themselves, and to look pleasantly again, 
 and to blossom as the rose. When the Gentile nations, that had been 
 long as a wilderness, bringing forth no fruit to God, received the 
 gospel, joy came with it to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+67:3,4,96:11,12">Ps. lxvii. 3, 4; xcvi. 11, 12</A>.

 When Christ was preached in Samaria there was <I>great joy in that
 city</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:8">Acts viii. 8</A>);

 those that sat in darkness saw a great and joyful light, and then they
 blossomed, that is, gave hopes of abundance of fruit; for that was it 
 which the preachers of the gospel aimed at

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:16">John xv. 16</A>),

 to <I>go and bring forth fruit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:13,Col+1:6">Rom. i. 13; Col. i. 6</A>.

 Though blossoms are not fruit, and often miscarry and come to nothing,
 yet they are in order to fruit. Converting grace makes the soul that 
 was <I>a wilderness to rejoice with joy and singing,</I> and to 
 <I>blossom abundantly.</I> This flourishing desert shall have all 
 <I>the glory of Lebanon</I> given to it, which consisted in the 
 strength and stateliness of its cedars, together with <I>the excellency 
 of Carmel and Sharon,</I> which consisted in corn and cattle. Whatever 
 is valuable in any institution is brought into the gospel. All the 
 beauty of the Jewish church was admitted into the Christian church, and 
 appeared in its perfection, as the apostle shows at large in his 
 epistle to the Hebrews. Whatever was excellent an desirable in the 
 Mosaic economy is translated into the evangelical institutes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The glory of God shining forth: <I>They shall see the glory of the 
 Lord.</I> God will manifest himself more than ever in his grace and 
 love to mankind (for that is his glory and excellency), and he shall 
 give them eyes to see it, and hearts to be duly affected with it. This 
 is that which will make the desert blossom. The more we see by faith of 
 the glory of the Lord and the excellency of our God the more joyful and 
 the more fruitful shall we be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The feeble and faint-hearted encouraged, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 God's prophets and ministers are in a special manner charged, by virtue
 of their office, to <I>strengthen the weak hands,</I> to comfort those 
 who could not yet recover the fright they had been put into by the 
 Assyrian army with an assurance that God would now return in mercy to 
 them. This is the design of the gospel, 

 1. To strengthen those that are weak and to confirm them--the weak
 hands, which are unable either to work or fight, and can hardly be 
 lifted up in prayer, and the feeble knees, which are unable either to 
 stand or walk and unfit for the race set before us. The gospel
 furnishes us with strengthening considerations, and shows us where 
 strength is laid up for us. Among true Christians there are many that 
 have weak hands and feeble knees, that are yet but babes in Christ; but 
 it is our duty to strengthen our brethren

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:32">Luke xxii. 32</A>),

 not only to bear with the weak, but to do what we can to confirm them,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:1,1Th+5:14">Rom. xv. 1; 1 Thess. v. 14</A>.

 It is our duty also to strengthen ourselves, to lift up <I>the hands
 which hang down</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:12">Heb. xii. 12</A>),

 improving the strength God has given us, and exerting it. 

 2. To animate those that are timorous and discouraged: <I>Say to those
 that are of a fearful heart,</I> because of their own weakness and the 
 strength of their enemies, that are <I>hasty</I> (so the word is), that 
 are for betaking themselves to flight upon the first alarm, and giving 
 up the cause, that say, in their haste, "We are cut off and undone"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:22">Ps. xxxi. 22</A>),

 there is enough in the gospel to silence these fears; it says to them,
 and let them say it to themselves and one to another, <I>Be strong, 
 fear not.</I> Fear is weakening; the more we strive against it the 
 stronger we are both for doing and suffering; and, for our 
 encouragement to strive, he that says to us, <I>Be strong</I> has laid 
 help for us upon one that is mighty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Assurance given of the approach of a Saviour: "<I>Your God will 
 come with vengeance.</I> God will appear for you against your enemies, 
 will recompense both their injuries and your losses." The Messiah will 
 come, in the fulness of time, to take vengeance on the powers of 
 darkness, to spoil them, and make a show of them openly, to recompense 
 those that mourn in Zion with abundant comforts. <I>He will come and 
 save us.</I> With the hopes of this the Old-Testament saints 
 strengthened their weak hands. He will come again at the end of time,
 will come in flaming fire, to recompense tribulation to those who have 
 troubled his people, and, to those who were troubled, rest, such a rest 
 as will be not only a final period to, but a full reward of, all their 
 troubles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+1:6,7">2 Thess. i. 6, 7</A>.

 Those whose <I>hearts tremble for the ark of God,</I> and who are under
 a concern for his church in the world, may silence their fears with 
 this, God will take the work into his own hands. Your God will come, 
 who pleads your cause and owns your interest, even God himself, who is 
 God alone.</P>

 the deaf shall be unstopped.
 &nbsp; 6  Then shall the lame <I>man</I> leap as a hart, and the tongue of
 the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and
 streams in the desert.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 "<I>Then,</I> when your God shall come, even Christ, to set up his 
 kingdom in the world, to which all the prophets bore witness, 
 especially towards the conclusion of their prophecies of the temporal 
 deliverances of the church, and this evangelical prophet 
 especially--then look for great things."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Wonders shall be wrought in the kingdoms both of nature and grace, 
 wonders of mercy wrought upon the children of men, sufficient to evince 
 that it is no less than a God that comes to us. 

 1. Wonders shall be wrought on men's bodies

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>):

 <I>The eyes of the blind shall be opened;</I> this was often done by
 our Lord Jesus when he was here upon earth, with a word's speaking, and 
 one he gave sight to that was <I>born</I> blind, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:27,12:22,20:30,Joh+9:6">Matt. ix. 27; xii. 22; xx. 30; John ix. 6</A>.

 By his power the ears of the deaf also were unstopped, with one word.
 <I>Ephphatha--Be opened,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:34">Mark vii. 34</A>.

 Many that were lame had the use of their limbs restored so perfectly
 that they could not only go, but <I>leap,</I> and with so much joy to 
 them that they could not forbear leaping for joy, as that impotent man, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:8">Acts iii. 8</A>.

 The dumb also were enabled to speak, and then no marvel that they were
 disposed to sing for joy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:32,33">Matt. ix. 32, 33</A>.

 These miracles Christ wrought to prove that he was sent of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:2">John iii. 2</A>),

 nay, working them by his own power and in his own name, he proved that
 he was God, the same who at first made man's mouth, the hearing ear, 
 and the seeing eye. When he would prove to John's disciples his divine 
 mission he did it by miracles of this kind, in which this scripture was 
 fulfilled. 

 2. Wonders, greater wonders, shall be wrought on men's souls. By the
 word and Spirit of Christ those that were spiritually blind were 
 enlightened

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:18">Acts xxvi. 18</A>),

 those that were deaf to the calls of God were made to hear them
 readily, so Lydia, whose heart <I>the Lord opened,</I> so <I>that she 
 attended,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:14">Acts xvi. 14</A>.

 Those that were impotent to every thing that is good by divine grace
 are made, not only able for it, but active in it, and run the way of 
 God's commandments. Those also that were dumb, and knew not how to 
 speak of God or to God, having their understandings opened to know him, 
 shall thereby have their lips opened to show forth his praise. The 
 tongue of the dumb shall sing for joy, the joy of God's salvation.
 Praise shall be perfected out of the mouth of babes and sucklings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The Spirit shall be poured out from on high. There shall be 
 <I>waters and streams,</I> rivers of living water; when our Saviour 
 spoke of these as the fulfilling of the scripture, and most probably of 
 this scripture, the evangelist tells us, <I>He spoke of the Spirit</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:38,39">John vii. 38, 39</A>),
 
 as does also this prophet
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:15"><I>ch.</I> xxxii. 15</A>);
 
 so here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),
 
 <I>in the wilderness,</I> where one would least expect it, <I>shall
 waters break out.</I> This was fulfilled when the <I>Holy Ghost fell 
 upon the Gentiles</I> that <I>heard the word</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:44">Acts x. 44</A>);

 then were the fountains of life opened, whence streams flowed, that
 watered the earth abundantly. These waters are said to <I>break 
 out,</I> which denotes a pleasing surprise to the Gentile world, such 
 as brought them, as it were, into a new world. The blessed effect of 
 this shall be that the <I>parched ground shall become a pool,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Those that laboured and were heavily laden, under the burden of guilt,
 and were scorched with the sense of divine wrath, found rest, and 
 refreshment, and abundant comforts in the gospel. In <I>the thirsty 
 land,</I> where no water was, nor ordinances 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:1">Ps. lxiii. 1</A>),

 there shall be <I>springs of water,</I> a gospel ministry, and by that
 the administration of all gospel ordinances in their purity and plenty, 
 which are <I>the river that makes glad the city of our God,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:4">Ps. xlvi. 4</A>.

 <I>In the habitation of dragons,</I> who chose to dwell in the parched
 scorched ground

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:9,13"><I>ch.</I> xxxiv. 9, 13</A>),

 these waters shall flow, and dispossess them, so that, <I>where each
 lay shall be grass with reeds and rushes,</I> great plenty of useful 
 productions. Thus it was when Christian churches were planted, and 
 flourished greatly, in the cities of the Gentiles, which, for many 
 ages, had been habitations of dragons, or devils rather, as Babylon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:2">Rev. xviii. 2</A>);

 when the property of the idols' temples was altered, and they were
 converted to the service of Christianity, then the habitations of 
 dragons became fruitful fields.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The way of religion and godliness shall be laid open: it is here 
 called <I>the way of holiness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>)

 the way both of holy worship and a holy conversation. Holiness is the 
 rectitude of the human nature and will, in conformity to the divine 
 nature and will. The way of holiness is that course of religious duties 
 in which men ought to walk and press forward, with an eye to the glory 
 of God and their own felicity in the enjoyment of him. "When our God 
 shall come to save us he shall chalk out to us this way by his gospel, 
 so as it had never been before described." 

 1. It shall be an appointed way; not a way of sufferance, but <I>a
 highway,</I> a way into which we are directed by a divine authority and 
 in which we are protected by a divine warrant. It is the King's
 highway, the King of Kings' highway, in which, though we may be 
 waylaid, we cannot be stopped. The <I>way of holiness</I> is the way of 
 God's commandments; it is (as highways usually are) the <I>good old 
 way,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:16">Jer. vi. 16</A>.

 2. It shall be an appropriated way, the way in which God will bring his
 own chosen to himself, but <I>the unclean shall not pass over it,</I> 
 either to defile it or to disturb those that walk in it. It is a way by 
 itself, distinguished from the way of the world, for it is a way of 
 separation from, and nonconformity to, this world. <I>It shall be for 
 those</I> whom the Lord has <I>set apart for himself</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:3">Ps. iv. 3</A>),

 shall be reserved for them: <I>The redeemed shall walk there,</I> and
 the satisfaction they take in these <I>ways of pleasantness</I> shall 
 be out of the reach of molestation from an evil world. <I>The unclean 
 shall not pass over it,</I> for it shall be a fair way; those that walk 
 in it are the <I>undefiled in the way,</I> who <I>escape the pollution 
 that is in the world.</I> 

 3. It shall be a straight way: <I>The wayfaring men,</I> who choose to
 travel in it, <I>though fools,</I> of weak capacity in other things, 
 shall have such plain directions from the word and Spirit of God in 
 this way that they <I>shall not err therein;</I> not that they shall be 
 infallible even in their own conduct, or that they shall in nothing 
 mistake, but they shall not be guilty of any fatal misconduct, shall 
 not so miss their way but that they shall recover it again, and get 
 well to their journey's end. Those that are in the narrow way, though 
 some may fall into one path and others into another, not all equally 
 right, but all meeting at last in the same end, shall yet never fall 
 into the broad way again; the Spirit of truth shall lead them into all 
 truth that is necessary for them. Note, The way to heaven is a plain
 way, and easy to hit. <I>God has chosen the foolish things of the 
 world,</I> and made them wise to salvation. <I>Knowledge is easy to him 
 that understands.</I> 

 4. It shall be a safe way: <I>No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous
 beast</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 none <I>to hurt or destroy.</I> Those that keep close to this way keep 
 out of the reach of Satan the roaring lion, that wicked one touches 
 them not. Those that walk in the way of holiness may proceed with a 
 holy security and serenity of mind, knowing that nothing can do them 
 any real hurt; they shall be quiet from the fear of evil. It was in
 Hezekiah's days, some time after the captivity of the ten tribes, that 
 God, being displeased with the colonies settled there, <I>sent lions 
 among them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:25">2 Kings xvii. 25</A>.

 But Judah keeps her integrity, and therefore <I>no lions shall be
 there.</I> Those that walk in the <I>way of holiness</I> must separate 
 themselves from the unclean and the ravenous, must <I>save themselves 
 from an untoward generation;</I> hoping that they themselves are of the 
 redeemed, let them walk <I>with the redeemed</I> who <I>shall walk 
 there.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The end of this way shall be everlasting joy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 This precious promise of peace now will end shortly in endless joys and
 rest for the soul. Here is good news for the citizens of Zion, rest to 
 the weary: <I>The ransomed of the Lord,</I> who therefore ought to 
 follow him wherever he goes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:4">Rev. xiv. 4</A>),

 <I>shall return and come to Zion,</I> 

 1. To serve and worship God in the church militant: they shall deliver
 themselves out of Babylon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:7">Zech. ii. 7</A>),

 shall <I>ask the way to Zion</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:5">Jer. l. 5</A>),
 
 and shall <I>find the way</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:12"><I>ch.</I> lii. 12</A>.

 God will open to them a door of escape out of their captivity, and it
 shall be an effectual door, though there be many adversaries. They 
 shall join themselves to the gospel church, that <I>Mount Zion,</I> 
 that <I>city of the living God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:22">Heb. xii. 22</A>.

 They shall come with songs of joy and praise for their deliverance out
 of Babylon, where they wept upon every <I>remembrance of Zion,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:1">Ps. cxxxvii. 1</A>.

 Those that by faith are made citizens of the gospel Zion may <I>go on
 their way rejoicing</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:39">Acts viii. 39</A>);

 they shall sing in the ways of the Lord, and be still praising him.
 They rejoice in Christ Jesus, and the sorrows and signs of their 
 convictions are made to flee away by the power of divine consolations. 
 Those that mourn are blessed, for they shall be comforted. 

 2. To see and enjoy God in the church triumphant; those that walk in
 <I>the way of holiness,</I> under guidance of their Redeemer, shall 
 come to Zion at last, to the heavenly Zion, shall come in a body, shall 
 all be presented together, <I>faultless, at the coming of Christ's 
 glory with exceeding joy</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:24,Re+7:17">Jude 24; Rev. vii. 17</A>);

 they shall come with songs. When God's people returned out of Babylon
 to Zion they came <I>weeping</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:4">Jer. l. 4</A>);

 but they shall come to heaven singing a new song, which no man can
 learn, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:3">Rev. xiv. 3</A>.

 When they shall <I>enter into the joy of their Lord</I> it shall be
 what the joys of this world never could be <I>everlasting joy,</I> 
 without mixture, interruption, or period. It shall not only fill their 
 hearts, to their own perfect and perpetual satisfaction, but it shall 
 be <I>upon their heads,</I> as an ornament of grace and a crown of 
 glory, as a garland worn in token of victory. Their joy shall be
 visible, and no longer a secret thing, as it is here in this world; it 
 shall be proclaimed, to the glory of God and their mutual 
 encouragement. They shall then obtain the joy and gladness which they 
 could never expect on this side heaven; <I>and sorrow and sighing shall 
 flee away</I> for ever, as the shadows of the night before the rising 
 sun. Thus these prophecies, which relate to the Assyrian invasion, 
 conclude, for the support of the people of God under that calamity, and 
 to direct their joy, in their deliverance from it, to something higher.
 Our joyful hopes and prospects of eternal life should swallow up both 
 all the sorrows and all the joys of this present time.</P>
