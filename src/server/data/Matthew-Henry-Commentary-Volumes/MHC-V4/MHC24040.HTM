 We have attended Jerusalem's funeral pile, and have taken our leave of 
 the captives that were carried to Babylon, not expecting to hear any 
 more of them in this book: perhaps we may in Ezekiel; and we must in
 this and the four following chapters observe the story of those few 
 Jews that were left to remain in the land after their brethren were 
 carried away, and it is a very melancholy story; for, though at first 
 there were some hopeful prospects of their well-doing, they soon 
 appeared as obstinate in sin as ever, unhumbled and unreformed, till, 
 all the rest of the judgments threatened in 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:1-68">Deut. xxviii.</A>

 being brought upon them, that which in the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:68">last verse</A>

 of that dreadful chapter completes the threatenings was accomplished,
 "The Lord shall bring thee into Egypt again." In this chapter we have, 
 
 I. A more particular account of Jeremiah's discharge and his settlement
 with Gedaliah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+40:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. The great resort of the Jews that remained scattered in the
 neighbouring countries to Gedaliah, who was made their governor under 
 the king of Babylon; and the good posture they were in for a while 
 under him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+40:7-12">ver.  7-12</A>.

 III. A treacherous design formed against Gedaliah, by Ishmael, which we 
 shall find executed in the next chapter,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The word that came to Jeremiah from the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, after that
 Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah,
 when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were
 carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried
 away captive unto Babylon.
 &nbsp; 2  And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto
 him, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place.
 &nbsp; 3  Now the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath brought <I>it,</I> and done according as he hath
 said: because ye have sinned against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and have not
 obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.
 &nbsp; 4  And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which
 <I>were</I> upon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me
 into Babylon, come; and I will look well unto thee: but if it
 seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold,
 all the land <I>is</I> before thee: whither it seemeth good and
 convenient for thee to go, thither go.
 &nbsp; 5  Now while he was not yet gone back, <I>he said,</I> Go back also
 to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king
 of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell
 with him among the people: or go wheresoever it seemeth
 convenient unto thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him
 victuals and a reward, and let him go.
 &nbsp; 6  Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah;
 and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The title of this part of the book, which begins the chapter, seems 
 misapplied (<I>The word which came to Jeremiah</I>), for here is 
 nothing of prophecy in this chapter, but it is to be referred to 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+42:7"><I>ch.</I> xlii. 7</A>,

 where we have a message that God sent by Jeremiah to the captains and
 the people that remained. The story between is only to introduce that 
 prophecy and show the occasion of it, that it may be the better 
 understood, and Jeremiah, being himself concerned in the story, was the 
 better able to give an account of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have Jeremiah's adhering, by the advice of 
 Nebuzar-adan, to Gedaliah. It should seem that Jeremiah was very 
 honourably fetched out of the court of the prison by the king of 
 Babylon's princes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+39:13"><I>ch.</I> xxxix. 13, 14</A>),

 but afterwards, being found among the people in the city, when orders
 were given to the inferior officers to bind all they found that were of 
 any fashion, in order to their being carried captives to Babylon, he, 
 through ignorance and mistake, was bound among the rest and hurried 
 away. Poor man! he seems to have been born to hardship and 
 abuse--<I>man of sorrows</I> indeed! But when the captives were brought 
 manacled to Ramah, not far off, where a council of war, or 
 court-martial, was held for giving orders concerning them, Jeremiah was 
 soon distinguished from the rest, and, by special order of the court, 
 was discharged. 

 1. The captain of the guard solemnly owns him to be a true prophet

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+40:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>):

 "<I>The Lord thy God,</I> whose messenger thou has been and in whose 
 name thou hast spoken, <I>has</I> by thee <I>pronounced this evil upon 
 this place;</I> they had fair warning given them of it, but they would 
 not take the warning, and <I>now the Lord hath brought it,</I> and, as 
 by thy mouth he said it, so by my hand <I>he hath done what he 
 said.</I>" He seems thus to justify what he had done, and to glory in 
 it, that he had been God's instrument to fulfil that which Jeremiah had 
 been his messenger to foretell; and upon that account it was indeed the 
 most glorious action he had ever done.  He tells all the people that 
 were now in chains before him <I>It is because you have sinned against 
 the Lord that this thing has come upon you.</I> The princes of Israel 
 would never be brought to acknowledge this, though it was as evident as 
 if it had been written with a sun-beam; but this heathen prince plainly 
 sees it, that a people that had been so favoured as they had been by 
 the divine goodness would never have been abandoned thus had they not 
 been very provoking. The people of Israel had been often told this from 
 the pulpit by their prophets, and they would not regard it; now they 
 are told it from the bench by the conqueror, whom they dare not 
 contradict and who will make them regard it. Note, Sooner or later men 
 shall be made sensible that their sin is the cause of all their 
 miseries. 

 2. He gives him free leave to dispose of himself as he thought fit. He
 <I>loosed him from his chains</I> a second time

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+40:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),
 
 invited him to come along with him to Babylon, not as a captive, but as 
 a friend, as a companion; and <I>I will set my eye upon thee</I> (so 
 the word is), not only, "<I>I will look well to thee,</I>" but "I will 
 show thee respect, will countenance thee, and will see that thou be 
 safe and well provided for." If he was not disposed to go to Babylon, 
 he might dwell where he pleased in his own country, for it was all now 
 at the disposal of the conquerors. He may go to Anathoth if he please, 
 and enjoy the field he has purchased there. A great change with this 
 good man! He that but lately was tossed from one prison to another may 
 now walk at liberty from one possession to another. 

 3. He advised him to go to Gedaliah and settle with him.  This
 Gedaliah, <I>made governor of the</I> land under <I>the king of 
 Babylon,</I> was an honest Jew, who (it is probably) betimes went over 
 with his friends to the Chaldeans, and approved himself so well that he 
 had this great trust put into his hands,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+40:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 <I>While</I> Jeremiah had <I>not yet gone back,</I> but stood 
 considering what he should do, Nebuzar-adan, perceiving him neither 
 inclined to go to Babylon nor determined whither to go, turned the 
 scale for him, and bade him by all means <I>go to Gedaliah.</I> Sudden 
 thoughts sometimes prove wise ones.  But when he gave this counsel he 
 did not design to bind him by it, nor will he take ill if he do not 
 follow it: <I>Go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee.</I> It is 
 friendly in such cases to give advice, but unfriendly to prescribe and 
 to be angry if our advice be not take.  Let Jeremiah steer what course 
 he pleases, Nebuzar-adan will agree to it, and believe he does for the 
 best. Nor does he only give him his liberty, and an approbation of the 
 measures he shall take, but provides for his support: He <I>gave him 
 victuals and a</I> present, either in clothes or money, <I>and</I> so 
 <I>let him go.</I> See how considerate <I>the captain of the guard</I> 
 was in his kindness to Jeremiah. He set him at liberty, but it was in a 
 country that was laid waste, and in which, as the posture of it now 
 was, he might have perished, though it was his own country, if he had 
 not been thus kindly furnished with necessaries. Jeremiah not only 
 accepted his kindness, but took his advice, and went to Gedaliah, to 
 Mizpah, <I>and dwelt with him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+40:6"><I>v.</I>  6</A>.

 Whether we may herein commend his prudence I know not; the event does 
 not commend it, for it did not prove at all to his comfort.  However, 
 we may commend his pious affection to the land of Israel, that unless 
 he were forced out of it, as Ezekiel, and Daniel, and other good men 
 were, he would not forsake it, but chose rather to dwell with the poor 
 in the holy land than with princes in an unholy one.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  Now when all the captains of the forces which <I>were</I> in the
 fields, <I>even</I> they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon
 had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had
 committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poor
 of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to
 Babylon;
 &nbsp; 8  Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of
 Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and
 Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the
 Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and
 their men.
 &nbsp; 9  And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto
 them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans:
 dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be
 well with you.
 &nbsp; 10  As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah to serve the
 Chaldeans, which will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine, and
 summer fruits, and oil, and put <I>them</I> in your vessels, and dwell
 in your cities that ye have taken.
 &nbsp; 11  Likewise when all the Jews that <I>were</I> in Moab, and among
 the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that <I>were</I> in all the countries,
 heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and
 that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of
 Shaphan;
 &nbsp; 12  Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they
 were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto
 Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.
 &nbsp; 13  Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of
 the forces that <I>were</I> in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,
 &nbsp; 14  And said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the
 king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to
 slay thee? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.
 &nbsp; 15  Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah
 secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael
 the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know <I>it:</I> wherefore
 should he slay thee, that all the Jews which are gathered unto
 thee should be scattered, and the remnant in Judah perish?
 &nbsp; 16  But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of
 Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest falsely
 of Ishmael.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have in these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A bright sky opening upon the remnant of the Jews that were left in 
 their own land, and a comfortable prospect given them of some peace and 
 quietness after the many years of trouble and terror with which they 
 had been afflicted. Jeremiah indeed had never in his prophecies spoken 
 of any such good days reserved for the Jews immediately after the 
 captivity; but Providence seemed to raise and encourage such an 
 expectation, and it would be to that miserable people as life from the 
 dead. Observe the particulars.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Gedaliah, one of themselves, is made <I>governor in the land,</I> by 
 <I>the king of Babylon,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+40:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 To show that he designed to make and keep them easy he did not give 
 this commission to one of the princes of Babylon, but to one of their 
 brethren, who, they might be sure, would seek their peace. He was 
 <I>the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan,</I> one of the princes. We 
 read of his father

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+26:24"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 24</A>)

 that he took Jeremiah's part against the people. He seems to have been
 a man of great wisdom and a mild temper, and under whose government the 
 few that were left might have been very happy. The king of Babylon had 
 a good opinion of him and reposed a confidence in him, for <I>to him he 
 committed all that were</I> left behind.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. There is great resort to him from all parts, and all those that were 
 now the Jews of the dispersion came and put themselves under his 
 government and protection. 

 (1.) The great men that had escaped the Chaldeans by force came and 
 quietly submitted to Gedaliah, for their own safety and common 
 preservation. Several are here named,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+40:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 <I>They came</I> with <I>their men,</I> their servants, their soldiers, 
 and so strengthened one another; and the king of Babylon had such a 
 good opinion of Gedaliah his delegate that he was not at all jealous of 
 the increase of their numbers, but rather pleased with it. 

 (2.) The poor men that had escaped by flight into the neighbouring 
 countries of Moab, Ammon, and Edom, were induced by the love they bore 
 to their own land to return to it again as soon as they heard that 
 Gedaliah was in authority there,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+40:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 Canaan itself would be an unsafe unpleasant country if there were no 
 government nor governors there, and those that loved it dearly would 
 not come back to it till they heard there were.  It would be a great 
 reviving to those that were dispersed to come together again, to those 
 that were dispersed into foreign countries to come together in their 
 own country, to those that were under strange kings to be under a 
 governor of their own nation. See here in wrath God remembered mercy, 
 and yet admitted some of them upon a further trial of their 
 obedience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The model of this new government is drawn up and settled by an 
 original contract, which Gedaliah confirmed with an oath, a solemn oath 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+40:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>He swore to them and to their men,</I> it is probably according to 
 the warrant and instructions he had received from the king of Babylon, 
 who empowered him to give them these assurances. 

 (1.) They must own the property of their lands to be in the Chaldeans. 
 "Come" (says Gedaliah), "<I>fear not to serve the Chaldeans.</I> Fear 
 not the sin of it." Though the divine law had forbidden them to make 
 leagues with the heathen, yet the divine sentence had obliged them to 
 yield to the king of Babylon. "Fear not the reproach of it, and the 
 disparagement it will be to your nation; it is what God has brought you 
 to, has bound you to, and it is no disgrace to any to comply with him.  
 Fear not the consequences of it, as if it would certainly make you and 
 yours miserable; no, you will find the king of Babylon not so hard a 
 landlord as you apprehend him to be; if you will but live peaceably, 
 peaceably you shall live; disturb not the government, and it will not 
 disturb you. <I>Serve the king of Babylon and it shall be well with 
 you.</I>" If they should make any difficulty of doing personal homage, 
 or should be apprehensive of danger when the Chaldeans should come 
 among them, Gedaliah, probably by instruction from the king of Babylon, 
 undertakes upon all occasions to act for them, and make their 
 application acceptable to the king

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+40:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "<I>As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to serve the 
 Chaldeans,</I> to do homage to them in the name of the whole body if 
 there be occasion, to receive orders, and to pay them their tribute 
 when the <I>come to us.</I>" All that passes between them and the 
 Chaldeans shall pass through his hand; and, if the Chaldeans put such a 
 confidence in him, surely his own countrymen may venture to do it. 
 Gedaliah is willing thus to give them the assurance of an oath that he 
 will do his part in protecting them, but, being apt to err (as many 
 good men are) on the charitable side, he did not require an oath from 
 them that they would be faithful to him, else the following mischief 
 might have been prevented. However, protection draws allegiance though 
 it be not sworn, and by joining in with Gedaliah they did, in effect, 
 consent to the terms of government, that they should <I>serve the king 
 of Babylon.</I> But, 

 (2.) Though they own the property of their lands to be in the 
 Chaldeans, yet, upon that condition, they shall have the free enjoyment 
 of them and all the profits of them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+40:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "<I>Gather you wine and summer fruits,</I> and take them for your own 
 use; <I>put them in your vessels,</I> to be laid up for winter-store, 
 as those do that live in a land of peace and hope to <I>eat the labour 
 of your hand,</I> nay, the labour of other people's hands, for you reap 
 what they sowed." Or perhaps they were the spontaneous products of that 
 fertile soil, for which none had laboured.  And accordingly we find 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+40:12"><I>v.</I>  12</A>)

 that they <I>gathered wine and summer fruits very much,</I> such as 
 were at present upon the ground, for their corn-harvest was over some 
 time before Jerusalem was taken. While Gedaliah was in care for the 
 public safety he left them to enjoy the advantages of the public 
 plenty, and, for aught that appears, demanded no tribute from them; for 
 he sought not his own profit, but the profit of many.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is a dark cloud gathering over this infant state, and 
 threatening a dreadful storm. How soon is this hopeful prospect 
 blasted! For when God begins in judgment he will make an end. It is 
 here intimated to us, 

 1. That <I>Baalis the king of the Ammonites</I> had a particular spite
 at Gedaliah, and was contriving to take him off, either out of malice 
 to the nation of the Jews, whose welfare he hated the thought of, or a 
 personal pique against Gedaliah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+40:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Some make Baalis to signify the queen-mother of the king of the 
 Ammonites, or queen-dowager, as if she were the first mover of the 
 bloody and treacherous design. One would have thought this little 
 remnant might be safe when the great king of Babylon protected it; and 
 ye it is ruined by the artifices of this petty prince or princess. 
 happy are those that have the King of kings of their side, who can take 
 <I>the wise in their own craftiness;</I> for the greatest earthly king 
 cannot with all his power secure us against fraud and treachery. 

 2.  That he employed <I>Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah,</I> as the
 instrument of his malice, instigated him to murder Gedaliah, and, that 
 he might have a fair opportunity to do it, directed him to go and enrol 
 himself among his subjects and promise him fealty.  Nothing could be 
 more barbarous than the design itself, nor more base than the method of 
 compassing it. How wretchedly is human nature corrupted and degenerated 
 (even in those that pretend to the best blood) when it is capable of 
 admitting the thought of such abominable wickedness! Ishmael was of the 
 seed royal, and would therefore be easily tempted to envy and hate one 
 that set up for a governor in Judah, who was not, as he was, of David's 
 line, though he had ever so much of David's spirit. 

 3. That Johanan, a brisk and active man, having got scent of this plot,
 informed Gedaliah of it, yet taking it for granted he could not but 
 know of it before, the proofs of the matter being so very plain: 
 <I>Dost thou certainly know?</I> surely thou dost,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+40:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 He gave him private intelligence of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+40:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 hoping he would then take the more notice of it. He proffered his 
 service to prevent it, by taking off Ishmael, whose very name was 
 ominous to all the seed of Isaac: <I>I will slay</I> him.  <I>Wherefore 
 should he slay thee?</I> Herein he showed more courage and zeal than 
 sense of justice; for, if it be lawful to kill for prevention, who then 
 can be safe, since malice always suspects the worst? 

 4. That Gedaliah, being a man of sincerity himself, would by no means
 give credit to the information given him of Ishmael's treachery.  He 
 said, <I>Thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.</I> Herein he discovered 
 more good humour than discretion, more of the innocency of the dove 
 than the wisdom of the serpent. Princes become uneasy to themselves and 
 all about them when they are jealous. Queen Elizabeth said that she 
 would believe no more evil of her people than a mother would believe of 
 her own children; yet many have been ruined by being over-confident of 
 the fidelity of those about them.</P>
