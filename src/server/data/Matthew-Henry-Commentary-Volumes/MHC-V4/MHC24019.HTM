 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The same melancholy theme is the subject of this chapter that was of 
 those foregoing--the approaching ruin of Judah and Jerusalem for their
 sins. This Jeremiah had often foretold; here he has particularly full 
 orders to foretel it again. 

 I. He must set their sins in order before them, as he had often done,
 especially their idolatry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:4,5">ver. 4, 5</A>.

 II. He must describe the particular judgments which were now coming
 apace upon them for these sins, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:6-9">ver. 6-9</A>.

 III. He must do this in the valley of Tophet, with great solemnity, and
 for some particular reasons, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:2,3">ver. 2, 3</A>.

 IV. He must summon a company of the elders together to be witnesses of
 this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:1">ver. 1</A>.

 V. He must confirm this, and endeavour to affect his hearers with it,
 by a sign, which was the breaking of an earthen bottle, signifying that 
 they should be dashed to pieces like a potter's vessel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:10-13">ver. 10-13</A>.

 VI. When he had done this in the valley of Tophet he ratified it in
 the court of the temple, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:14,15">ver. 14, 15</A>.

 Thus were all likely means tried to awaken this stupid senseless people 
 to repentance, that their ruin might be prevented; but all in vain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Go and get a potter's earthen bottle,
 and <I>take</I> of the ancients of the people, and of the ancients of
 the priests;
 &nbsp; 2  And go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, which <I>is</I>
 by the entry of the east gate, and proclaim there the words that
 I shall tell thee,
 &nbsp; 3  And say, Hear ye the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, O kings of Judah, and
 inhabitants of Jerusalem; Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, the God
 of Israel; Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, the which
 whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle.
 &nbsp; 4  Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place,
 and have burned incense in it unto other gods, whom neither they
 nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have
 filled this place with the blood of innocents;
 &nbsp; 5  They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their
 sons with fire <I>for</I> burnt offerings unto Baal, which I commanded
 not, nor spake <I>it,</I> neither came <I>it</I> into my mind:
 &nbsp; 6  Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that this
 place shall no more be called Tophet, nor The valley of the son
 of Hinnom, but The valley of slaughter.
 &nbsp; 7  And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in
 this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before
 their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives:
 and their carcases will I give to be meat for the fowls of the
 heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.
 &nbsp; 8  And I will make this city desolate, and a hissing; every one
 that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all
 the plagues thereof.
 &nbsp; 9  And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the
 flesh of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the flesh
 of his friend in the siege and straitness, wherewith their
 enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall straiten them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The corruption of man having made it necessary that <I>precept</I> 
 should be <I>upon precept, and line upon line</I> (so unapt are we to 
 receive, and so very apt to let slip, the things of God), the grace of 
 God has provided that there shall be, accordingly, <I>precept upon 
 precept, and line upon line,</I> that those who are irreclaimable may 
 be inexcusable. For this reason the prophet is here sent with a message 
 to the same purport with what he had often delivered, but with some 
 circumstances that might make it the more taken notice of, a thing 
 which ministers should study, for a little circumstance may sometimes 
 be a great advantage, and those that would win souls must be wise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He must take of the elders and chief men, both in church and state, to be his auditors and witnesses to what he said--<I>the ancients of the people and the ancients of the priests,</I> the most eminent men both in the magistracy and in the ministry,

 that they might be <I>faithful witnesses to record,</I> as those 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:2">Isa. viii. 2</A>.

 It is strange that these great men should be at the beck of a poor 
 prophet, and obey his summons to attend him out of the city, they know 
 not whither and they knew not why. But, though the generality of the 
 elders were disaffected to him, yet it is likely that there were some 
 few among them who looked upon him as a prophet of the Lord, and would 
 pay this respect to the heavenly vision. Note, Persons of rank and 
 figure have an opportunity of honouring God, by a diligent attendance 
 on the ministry of the word and other divine institutions; and they 
 ought to think it an honour, and no disparagement to themselves, yea, 
 though the circumstances be mean and despicable. It is certain that the 
 greatest of men is less than the least of the ordinances of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He must <I>go to the valley of the son of Hinnom,</I> and deliver 
 this message there; for <I>the word of the Lord</I> is not bound to any 
 one place; as good a sermon may be preached in the valley of Tophet as 
 in the gate of the temple. Christ preached on a mountain and out of a 
 ship. This valley lay partly on the south side of Jerusalem, but the 
 prophet's way to it was <I>by the entry on the east gate--the sun
 gate</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 so some render it, and suppose it to look not towards the sun-rising, 
 but the noon sun--<I>the potter's gate,</I> so some. This sermon must
 be preached in that place, in <I>the valley of the son of Hinnom,</I> 

 1. Because there they had been guilty of the vilest of their 
 idolatries, the sacrificing of their children to Moloch, a horrid piece 
 of impiety, which the sight of the place might serve to remind them of 
 and upbraid them with. 

 2. Because there they should feel the sorest of their calamities; there 
 the greatest slaughter should be made among them; and, it being the 
 common sink of the city, let them look upon it and see what a miserable 
 spectacle this magnificent city would be when it should be all like the 
 valley of Tophet. God bids him go thither, <I>and proclaim there the 
 words that I shall tell thee,</I> when thou comest thither; whereby it 
 appears (as Mr. Gataker well observed) that God's messages were 
 frequently not revealed to the prophets before the very instant of time 
 wherein they were to deliver them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He must give general notice of a general ruin now shortly coming 
 upon Judah and Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 He must, as those that make proclamation, begin with an <I>Oyes: Hear 
 you the word of the Lord,</I> though it be a terrible word, for you may 
 thank yourselves if it be so. Both rulers and ruled must attend to it,
 at their peril; the <I>kings of Judah,</I> the king and his sons, the 
 king and his princes and privy-counsellors, must hear the word of the 
 King of kings, for, high as they are, he is above them. The 
 <I>inhabitants of Jerusalem</I> also must hear what God has to say to 
 them. Both princes and people have contributed to the national guilt 
 and must concur in the national repentance, or they will both share in 
 the national ruin. Let them all know that <I>the Lord of hosts,</I> who 
 is therefore able to do what he threatens, though he is <I>the God of 
 Israel,</I> nay, because he is so, will therefore punish them in the 
 first place for their iniquities 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:2">Amos iii. 2</A>):

 <I>He will bring evil upon this place</I> (upon <I>Judah and
 Jerusalem</I>) so surprising, and so dreadful, that <I>whosoever 
 hears</I> it, <I>his ears shall tingle;</I> whosoever hears the 
 prediction of it, hears the report and representation of it, it shall 
 make such an impression of terror upon him that he shall still think he 
 hears it sounding in his ears and shall not be able to get it out of 
 his mind. The ruin of Eli's house is thus described

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:11">1 Sam. iii. 11</A>),
 
 and of Jerusalem,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:12">2 Kings xxi. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He must plainly tell them what their sins were for which God had 
 this controversy with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 They are charged with apostasy from God (<I>They have forsaken me</I>) 
 and abuse of the privileges of the visible church, and which they had 
 been dignified--<I>They have estranged this place.</I> Jerusalem (the 
 holy city), the temple (the holy house), which was designed for the
 honour of God and the support of his kingdom among men, they had 
 alienated from those purposes, and (as some render the word) <I>they 
 had strangely abused.</I> They had so polluted both with their 
 wickedness that God had disowned both, and abandoned them to ruin. He 
 charges them with an affection for and the adoration of false 
 <I>gods,</I> such as <I>neither they nor their fathers have known,</I> 
 such as never had recommended themselves to their belief and esteem by 
 any acts of power or goodness done for them or their ancestors, as that 
 God had abundantly done whom they forsook; yet they took them at a 
 venture for their gods; nay, being fond of change and novelty, they 
 liked them the better for their being upstarts, and new fashions in 
 religion were as grateful to their fancies as in other things. They 
 also stand charged with murder, wilful murder, from malice prepense: 
 <I>They have filled this place with the blood of innocents.</I> It was 
 Manasseh's sin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:4">2 Kings xxiv. 4</A>),

 <I>which the Lord would not pardon.</I> Nay, as if idolatry and murder,
 committed separately, were not bad enough and affront enough to God and 
 man, they have put them together, have consolidated them into one 
 complicated crime, that of burning their children in the fire to Baal

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 which was the most insolent defiance to all the laws both of natural 
 and revealed religion that ever mankind was guilty of; and by it they 
 openly declared that they loved their new gods better than ever they 
 loved the true God, though they were such cruel task-masters that they 
 required human sacrifices (inhuman I should call them), which the Lord 
 Jehovah, whose all lives and souls are, never demanded from his 
 worshippers; he never <I>spoke</I> of such a thing, nor <I>came it into 
 his mind.</I> See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:31"><I>ch.</I> vii. 31</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He must endeavour to affect them with the greatness of the 
 desolation that was coming upon them. He must tell them (as he had done 
 before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:32"><I>ch.</I> vii. 32</A>)

 that this <I>valley of the son of Hinnom</I> shall acquire a new name,
 <I>the valley of slaughter</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),
 
 for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>)

 multitudes shall <I>fall</I> there <I>by the sword,</I> when either 
 they sally out upon the besiegers and are repulsed or attempt to make 
 their escape and are seized: <I>They</I> shall <I>fall before their 
 enemies,</I> who not only endeavour to make themselves masters of their 
 houses and estates, but have such an implacable enmity to them that 
 they <I>seek their lives;</I> they thirst after their blood, and, when 
 they are dead, will not allow a cartel for the burying of the slain, 
 but <I>their carcases</I> shall <I>be meat for the fowls of the heaven 
 and beasts of the earth.</I> What a dismal place will the valley of 
 Tophet be then! And as for those that remain within the city, and will
 not capitulate with the besiegers, they shall perish for want of food, 
 when first they have eaten <I>the flesh of their sons and 
 daughters,</I> and dearest <I>friends,</I> through the <I>straitness 
 wherewith their enemies shall straiten them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 This was threatened in the law as an instance of the extremity to which 
 the judgments of God should reduce them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:29,De+28:53">Lev. xxvi. 29, Deut. xxviii. 53</A>)

 and was accomplished, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:10">Lam. iv. 10</A>.

 And, <I>lastly,</I> the whole <I>city</I> shall be <I>desolate,</I> the 
 houses laid in ashes, the inhabitants slain or taken prisoners; there 
 shall be no resort to it, nor any thing in it but what looks rueful and 
 horrid; so that <I>every one that passes by shall be astonished</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),
 
 as he had said before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:16"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 16</A>.

 That place which holiness had made <I>the joy of the whole earth</I>
 sin had made the reproach and shame of the whole earth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. He must assure them that all their attempts to prevent and avoid 
 this ruin, so long as they continued impenitent and unreformed, would 
 be fruitless and vain 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem</I> (of the 
 princes and senators of Judah and Jerusalem) <I>in this place,</I> in 
 the royal palace, which lay on the south side of the city, not far from 
 the place where the prophet now stood. Note, There is no fleeing from 
 God's justice but by fleeing to his mercy. Those that will not make
 good God's counsel, by humbling themselves under his mighty hand, shall 
 find that God will make void their counsel and blast their projects, 
 which they think ever so well concerted for their own preservation. 
 There is <I>no counsel</I> or strength <I>against the Lord.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men
 that go with thee,
 &nbsp; 11  And shalt say unto them, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts; Even
 so will I break this people and this city, as <I>one</I> breaketh a
 potter's vessel, that cannot be made whole again: and they shall
 bury <I>them</I> in Tophet, till <I>there be</I> no place to bury.
 &nbsp; 12  Thus will I do unto this place, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and to the
 inhabitants thereof, and <I>even</I> make this city as Tophet:
 &nbsp; 13  And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of
 Judah, shall be defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all
 the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the
 host of heaven, and have poured out drink offerings unto other
 gods.
 &nbsp; 14  Then came Jeremiah from Tophet, whither the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had sent
 him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s house;
 and said to all the people,
 &nbsp; 15  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I
 will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil
 that I have pronounced against it, because they have hardened
 their necks, that they might not hear my words.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The message of wrath delivered in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:1-9">foregoing verses</A>

 is here enforced, that it might gain credit, two ways:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. By a visible sign. The prophet was to take along with him an 
 <I>earthen bottle</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 and, when he had delivered his message, he was to <I>break the 
 bottle</I> to pieces 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 and the same that were auditors of the sermon must be spectators of the 
 sign. He had compared this people, in the chapter before, to the 
 potter's clay, which is easily marred in the making. But some might 
 say, "It is past that with us; we have been made and hardened long 
 since." "And what though you be," says he, "the potter's vessel is as 
 soon broken in the hand of any man as the vessel while it is soft clay 
 is marred in the potter's hand, and its case is, in this respect, much 
 worse, that the vessel while it is soft clay, though it be marred, may 
 be moulded again, but, after it is hardened, when it is broken it can 
 never be pieced again." Perhaps what they see will affect them more 
 than what they only hear talk of; that is the intention of sacramental 
 signs, and teaching by symbols was anciently used. In the explication 
 of this sign he must inculcate what he had before said, with a further 
 reference to the place where this was done, in the valley of Tophet. 

 1. As the bottle was easily, irresistibly, and irrecoverably broken by
 the Chaldean army,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 They depended much upon the firmness of their constitution, and the 
 fixedness of their courage, which they thought hardened them like a 
 vessel of brass; but the prophet shows that all that did but harden 
 them like a vessel of earth, which, though hard, is brittle and sooner 
 broken than that which is not so hard. Though they were made vessels of 
 honour, still they were vessels of earth, and so they shall be made to 
 know if they dishonour God and themselves, and serve not the purposes 
 for which they were made. It is God himself, who made them, that 
 resolves to unmake them: <I>I will break this people and this city,</I> 
 dash them in pieces like <I>a potter's vessel;</I> the doom of the 
 heathen 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:9,Re+2:27">Ps. ii. 9, Rev. ii. 27</A>),
 
 but now Jerusalem's doom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:14">Isa. xxx. 14</A>.
 
 <I>A potter's vessel,</I> when once broken, <I>cannot be made whole 
 again, cannot be cured,</I> so the word is. The ruin of Jerusalem shall 
 be an utter ruin; no hand can repair it but his that broke it; and if 
 they return to him, though he has torn, he will heal.

 2. This was done in Tophet, to signify two things:--

 (1.) That Tophet should be the receptacle of the slain: <I>They shall 
 bury in Tophet till there be no place to bury</I> any more there; they 
 shall jostle for room to lay their dead, and a very little room will 
 then serve those who, while they lived, <I>laid house to house and 
 field to field.</I> Those that would be <I>placed alone in the midst of 
 the earth</I> while they were above ground, and obliged all about them 
 to keep their distance, must lie with the multitude when they are 
 underground, for there are innumerable before them. 

 (2.) That Tophet should be a resemblance of the whole city

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>I will make this city as Tophet.</I> As they had filled the valley 
 of Tophet with the slain which they sacrificed to their idols, so God 
 will fill the whole city with the slain that shall fall as sacrifices 
 to the justice of God. We read 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:10">2 Kings xxiii. 10</A>)

 of Josiah's defiling Tophet, because it had been abused to idolatry,
 which he did (as should seem,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)

 by <I>filling it with the bones of men;</I> and, whatever it was 
 before, thenceforward it was looked upon as a detestable place. Dead
 carcases, and other filth of the city, were carried thither, and a fire 
 was continually kept there for the burning of it. This was the posture 
 of that valley when Jeremiah was sent thither to prophesy; and so 
 execrable a place was it looked upon to be that, in the language of our 
 Saviour's time, hell was called, in allusion to it, <I>Gehenna, the 
 valley of Hinnom.</I> "Now" (says God) "since that blessed reformation, 
 when Tophet was defiled, did not proceed as it ought to have done, nor 
 prove a thorough reformation, but though the idols in Tophet were 
 abolished and made odious those in Jerusalem remained, therefore will I 
 do with the city as Josiah did by Tophet, fill it with the bodies of 
 men, and make it a heap of rubbish." Even <I>the houses of Jerusalem, 
 and</I> those <I>of the kings of Judah,</I> the royal palaces not 
 excepted, <I>shall be defiled as the place of Tophet</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 and for the same reason, because of the idolatries that have been 
 committed there; since they will not defile them by a reformation, God 
 will defile them by a destruction, <I>because</I> upon the <I>roofs of 
 their houses they have burnt incense unto the host of heaven.</I> The 
 flat roofs of their houses were sometimes used by devout people as 
 convenient places for prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:9">Acts x. 9</A>),

 and by idolaters they were used as high places, on which they
 sacrificed to strange gods, especially to <I>the host of heaven,</I> 
 the sun, moon, and stars, that there they might be so much nearer to 
 them and have a clearer and fuller view of them. We read of those that 
 <I>worshipped the host of heaven upon the house-tops</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:5">Zeph. i. 5</A>),

 and of <I>altars on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:12">2 Kings xxiii. 12</A>.

 This sin upon the house-tops brought a curse into the house, which 
 consumed it, and made it a dunghill like Tophet.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. By a solemn recognition and ratification of what he had said <I>in 
 the court of the Lord's house,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 The prophet returned from Tophet to the temple, which stood upon the 
 hill over that valley, and there confirmed, and probably repeated, what 
 he had said in the valley of Tophet, for the benefit of those who had 
 not heard it; what he had said he would stand to. Here, as often 
 before, he both assures them of judgments coming upon them and assigns 
 the cause of them, which was their sin. Both these are here put
 together in a little compass, with a reference to all that had gone 
 before. 

 1. The accomplishment of the prophecies is here the judgment
 threatened. The people flattered themselves with a conceit that God 
 would be better than his word, that the threatening was but to frighten 
 them and keep them in awe a little; but the prophet tells them that 
 they deceive themselves if they think so: <I>For thus saith the Lord of 
 hosts,</I> who is able to make his words good, <I>I will bring upon 
 this city, and upon all her towns,</I> all the smaller cities that 
 belong to Jerusalem the metropolis, <I>all the evil that I have 
 pronounced against it.</I> Note, Whatever men may think to the 
 contrary, the executions of Providence will fully answer the 
 predictions of the word, and God will appear as terrible against sin 
 and sinners as the scripture makes him; nor shall the unbelief of men 
 make either his promises or his threatenings of no effect or of less 
 effect than they were thought to be of. 

 2. The contempt of the prophecies is here the sin charged upon them, as 
 the procuring cause of this judgment. It is <I>because they have 
 hardened their necks,</I> and would not bow and bend them to the yoke 
 of God's commands, would <I>not hear my words,</I> that is, would not 
 heed them and yield obedience to them. Note, The obstinacy of sinners 
 in their sinful ways is altogether their own fault; if their necks are 
 hardened, it is their own act and deed, they have hardened them; if 
 they are deaf to the word of God, it is because they have stopped their 
 own ears. We have need therefore to pray that God, by his grace, would 
 deliver us <I>from hardness of heart and contempt of his word and 
 commandments.</I></P>
