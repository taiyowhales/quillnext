 and oppression, fraudulent and violent practices 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+2:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>),

 dealing barbarously, even with women and children, and other harmless
 people,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their
 beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is
 in the power of their hand.
 &nbsp; 2 And they covet fields, and take <I>them</I> by violence; and
 houses, and take <I>them</I> away: so they oppress a man and his
 house, even a man and his heritage.
 &nbsp; 3 Therefore thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Behold, against this family do
 I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks;
 neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time <I>is</I> evil.
 &nbsp; 4 In that day shall <I>one</I> take up a parable against you, and
 lament with a doleful lamentation, <I>and</I> say, We be utterly
 spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he
 removed <I>it</I> from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.
 &nbsp; 5 Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot
 in the congregation of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The injustice of man contriving the evil of sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+2:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 God was coming forth against this people to destroy them, and here he 
 shows what was the ground of his controversy with them; it is that 
 which is often mentioned as a sin that hastens the ruin of nations and
 families as much as any, the sin of oppression. Let us see the steps of 
 it. 

 1. They eagerly desire that which is not their own--that is the
 <I>root of bitterness,</I> the root of all evil,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 They <I>covet fields and houses,</I> as Ahab did Naboth's vineyard. "Oh 
 that such a one's field and house were mine! It lies convenient for me, 
 and I would manage it better than he does; it is fitter for me than for 
 him." 

 2. They set their wits on work to invent ways of accomplishing their
 desire 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 they devise iniquity with a great deal of cursed art and policy; they 
 plot how to do it effectually, and yet so as not to expose themselves, 
 or bring themselves into danger, or under reproach, by it. This is
 called <I>working evil!</I> they are working it in their heads, in 
 their families, and are as intent upon it, and with as much pleasure, 
 as if they were doing it, and are as confident of their success (so 
 wisely do they think they have laid the scheme) as if it were assuredly 
 done. Note, It is bad to do mischief upon a sudden thought, but much
 worse to devise it, to do it with design and deliberation; when the 
 craft and subtlety of the old serpent appear with his poison and venom, 
 it is wickedness in perfection. They devised it <I>upon their beds,</I> 
 when they should have been asleep; care to compass a mischievous design 
 held their eyes waking. <I>Upon their beds,</I> where they should have 
 been remembering God, and meditating upon him, where they should have 
 been <I>communing with their own hearts</I> and examining them, they 
 were <I>devising iniquity.</I> It is of great consequence to improve 
 and employ the hours of our retirement and solitude in a proper manner.
 
 3. They employ their power in executing what they have designed and
 contrived; they practise the iniquity they have devised, <I>because it 
 is in the power of their hand;</I> they find that they can compass it 
 by the help of their wealth, and the authority and interest they have, 
 and that none dare control them, or call them to an account for it; and 
 this, they think, will justify them and bear them out in it. Note, It 
 is the mistake of many to think that as they can do they may do; 
 whereas no power is given for destruction, but all for edification. 

 4. They are industrious and very expeditious in accomplishing the
 iniquity they have devised; when they have settled the matter in their 
 thoughts, in their beds, they lose no time, but as soon as the 
 <I>morning is light</I> they practice it; they are up early in the 
 prosecution of their designs, and what ill their hand finds to do they 
 do it <I>with all their might,</I> which shames our slothfulness and 
 dilatoriness in doing good, and should shame us out of them. In the 
 service of God, and our generation, let it never be said that we left 
 that to be done to-morrow which we could do to-day. 

 5. They stick at nothing to compass their designs; what they
 <I>covet</I> they <I>take away,</I> if they can, and,

 (1.) They care not what wrong they do, though it be ever so gross and 
 open; they take away men's fields by violence, not only by fraud, and 
 underhand practices and colour of law, but by force and with a high 
 hand. 

 (2.) They care not to whom they do wrong nor how far the iniquity 
 extends which they devise: They <I>oppress a man and his house;</I> 
 they rob and ruin those that have numerous families to maintain, and 
 are not concerned though they send them and their wives and children a 
 begging. They <I>oppress a man and his heritage;</I> they take away 
 from men that which they have an unquestionable title to, having 
 received it from their ancestors, and which they have but in trust, to 
 transmit it to their posterity; but those oppressors care not how many 
 they impoverish, so they may but enrich themselves. Note, If 
 covetousness reigns in the heart, commonly all compassion is banished 
 from it; and if any man <I>love this world,</I> as the <I>love of the 
 Father,</I> so the love of his neighbour <I>is not in him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The justice of God contriving the evil of punishment for this sin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Therefore thus saith the Lord,</I> the righteous God, that judges 
 between man and man, and is an avenger on those that do wrong, 
 <I>Behold, against this family do I devise an evil,</I> that is, 
 against the whole kingdom, the <I>house of Israel,</I> and particularly 
 those families in it that were cruel and oppressive. They unjustly 
 devise evil against their brethren, and God will justly devise evil 
 against them. Infinite Wisdom will so contrive the punishment of their 
 sin that it shall be very sure, and such as cannot be avoided, very 
 severe, and such as they cannot bear, very signal and remarkable, and 
 such as shall be universally observed to answer to the sin. The more 
 there appears of a wicked wit in the sin the more there shall appear of 
 a holy wisdom and fitness in the punishment; for the Lord will be 
 <I>known by the judgments he executes;</I> he will be owned by them. 

 1. He finds them very secure, and confident that they shall in some
 way or other escape the judgment, or, though they fall under it, shall 
 soon throw it off and get clear of it, and therefore he tells them, It 
 is <I>an evil from which they shall not remove their neck.</I> They 
 were children of <I>Belial,</I> that would not endure the easy yoke of 
 God's righteous commands, but <I>broke those bonds</I> asunder, and 
 <I>cast away those cords from them;</I> and therefore God will lay upon 
 them the heavy yoke of his righteous judgments, and they shall not be 
 able to withdraw their necks from that; those that will not be 
 overruled shall be overcome. 

 2. He finds them very proud and stately, and therefore he tells them
 that they shall not go haughtily, with <I>stretched-forth necks and 
 wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:16">Isa. iii. 16</A>);

 for <I>this time is evil,</I> and the events of it are very humbling
 and mortifying, and such as will bring down the stoutest spirit. 

 3. He finds them very merry and jovial, and therefore tells them their
 note shall be changed, their laughter shall be turned into mourning and 
 their joy into heaviness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>In that day,</I> when God comes to punish you for your oppression, 
 <I>shall one take up a parable against you,</I> and <I>lament with a 
 doleful lamentation,</I> with <I>a lamentation of lamentations</I> (so 
 the word is), a most lamentable lamentation, as a song of songs is a 
 most pleasing song. Their enemies shall insult over them, and make a 
 jest of their griefs, for they shall <I>take up a parable against 
 them.</I> Their friends shall mourn over them, and lay to heart their 
 calamities, and this shall be the general cry, "<I>We are utterly 
 spoiled;</I> we are all undone." Note, Those that were most haughty and 
 secure in their prosperity are commonly most dejected and most ready to 
 despair in their adversity. 

 4. He finds them very rich in houses and lands, which they have gained
 by oppression, and therefore tells them that they shall be stripped of 
 all.

 (1.) They shall, in their despair, give it all up; they shall say, 
 <I>We are utterly spoiled; he has changed the portion of my people,</I> 
 so that it is now no longer theirs, but it is in the possession and 
 occupation of their enemies: <I>How has he removed it from me!</I> How 
 suddenly, how powerfully! What is unjustly got by us will not long 
 continue with us; the righteous God will remove it. <I>Turning away</I> 
 from us in wrath, he <I>has divided our fields,</I> and given them into 
 the hands of strangers. Woe to those from whom God turns away. The 
 margin reads it, "<I>Instead of restoring, he has divided our 
 fields;</I> instead of putting us again in the possession of our 
 estates, he has confirmed those in the possession of them that have 
 taken them from us." Note, It is just with God that those who have 
 dealt fraudulently and violently with others should themselves be dealt 
 fraudulently and violently with. 

 (2.) God shall ratify what they say in their despair 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>);

 so it shall be: <I>Thou shalt have none to cast a cord by lot in the 
 congregation of the Lord,</I> none to divide inheritances, because 
 there shall be no inheritances to divide, no courts to try titles to 
 lands, or determine controversies about them, or cast lots upon them, 
 as in Joshua's time, for all shall be in the enemies' hand. This land, 
 which should be taken from them, they had not only an unquestionable 
 title to, but a very comfortable enjoyment of, for it was <I>in the 
 congregation of the Lord,</I> or rather the congregation of the Lord 
 was in it; it was God's land; it was a holy land, and therefore it was 
 the more grievous to them to be turned out of it. Note, Those are to be 
 considered the sorest calamities which cut us off from the congregation 
 of the Lord, or cut us short in the enjoyment of the privileges of 
 it.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here are two sins charged upon the people of Israel, and judgments 
 denounced against them for each, such judgments as exactly answer the 
 sin--persecuting God's prophets and oppressing God's poor.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Persecuting God's prophets, suppressing and silencing them, is a sin 
 that provokes God as much as anything, for it not only spits in the 
 face of his authority over us, but spurns at the bowels of his mercy to 
 us; for his sending prophets to us is a sure and valuable token of his 
 goodwill. Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What the obstruction and opposition were which this people gave to 
 God's prophets: They <I>said to those that prophesy, Prophesy ye 
 not,</I> as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:10">Isa. xxx. 10</A>.

 They <I>said to the seers, "See not;</I> do not trouble us with
 accounts of what you have seen, nor bring us any such frightful 
 messages." They must either not prophesy at all or prophesy only what 
 is pleasing. The word for <I>prophesying</I> here signifies 
 <I>dropping,</I> for the words of the prophets dropped from heaven as 
 the dew. Note, Those that hate to be reformed hate to be reproved, and 
 do all they can to silence faithful ministers. Amos was forbidden to 
 prophesy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:10">Amos vii. 10</A>,

 &c. <I>Therefore</I> persecutors stop their breath, because they have
 no other way to stop their mouths; for, if they live, they will preach 
 and torment those that dwell on the earth, as the <I>two witnesses</I> 
 did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:10">Rev. xi. 10</A>.

 Some read it, <I>Prophesy not; let these prophesy.</I> Let not those 
 prophesy that tell us of our faults, and threaten us, but <I>let those 
 prophesy</I> that will flatter us in our sins, and cry peace to us. 
 They will not say that they will have no ministers at all, but they 
 will have such as will say just what they would have them and go their 
 way. This they are charged with 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 that when they silenced and frowned upon the true prophets they 
 countenanced and encouraged pretenders, and set them up, and made an 
 interest for them, to confront God's faithful prophets: <I>If a man 
 walk in the spirit of falsehood,</I> pretend to have the Spirit of God, 
 while really it is a spirit of error, a spirit of delusion, and he 
 himself knows that he has no commission, no instruction, from God, yet, 
 if he says, <I>I will prophesy unto thee of wine and strong drink,</I> 
 if he will but assure them that they shall have wine and strong drink 
 enough, that they need not fear the judgments of war and famine which 
 the other prophets threatened them with, that they shall always have 
 plenty of the delights of sense and never know the want of them, and if 
 he will but tell them that it is lawful for them to drink as much as 
 they please of their wine and strong drink, and they need not scruple 
 being drunk, that they <I>shall have peace though they go on and add 
 drunkenness to thirst,</I> such a prophet as this is a man after their 
 own heart, who will tell them that there is neither sin nor danger in 
 the wicked course of life they lead: <I>He shall even be the prophet of 
 this people;</I> such a man they would have to be their prophet, that 
 will not only associate with them in their rioting and revellings, but 
 will pretend to consecrate their sensualities by his prophecies and so 
 harden them in their security and sensuality. Note, It is not strange 
 if people that are vicious and debauched covet to have ministers that 
 are altogether such as themselves, for they are willing to believe God 
 is so too, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:21">Ps. l. 21</A>.

 But how are sacred things profaned when they are prostituted to such
 base purposes, when prophecy itself shall be pressed into the services 
 of a lewd and profane crew! But thus that servant who said, <I>My Lord 
 delays his coming,</I> by the spirit of falsehood, <I>smote his fellow 
 servants</I> and <I>ate and drank with the drunken.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How they are here expostulated with upon this matter 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "<I>O thou that art named the house of Jacob,</I> does it become thee 
 to say and do thus? Wilt thou silence those that prophesy, and forbid 
 them to speak in God's name?" Note, It is an honour and privilege to be 
 <I>named of the house of Jacob.</I> Thou art <I>called a Jew,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:17">Rom. ii. 17</A>.

 But, when those who are called by that worthy name degenerate, they
 commonly prove the worst of men themselves and the worst enemies to 
 God's prophets. The Jews who were <I>named of the house of Jacob</I>
 were the most violent persecutors of the first preachers of the gospel. 
 Upon this the prophet here argues with these oppressors of the word of 
 God, and shows them,

 (1.) What an affront they hereby put upon God, the God of the holy 
 prophets: "<I>Is the Lord's Spirit straitened?</I> In silencing the 
 Lord's prophets you do what you can to silence his Spirit too; but do 
 you think you can do it? Can you make the Spirit of God your prisoner 
 and your servant? Will you prescribe to him what he shall say, and
 forbid him to say what is displeasing to you? If you silence the 
 prophets, yet cannot the Spirit of the Lord find out other ways to 
 reach your consciences? Can your unbelief frustrate the divine 
 counsels?" 

 (2.) What a scandal it was to their profession as Jews: "You are 
 <I>named the house of Jacob,</I> and this is your honour; but <I>are 
 these his doings?</I> Are these the doings of your father Jacob? Do
 you herein tread in his steps? No; if you were indeed his children you 
 would do his works; but now you seek to kill and silence <I>a man that 
 tells you the truth,</I> in God's name; <I>this did not Abraham</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:39,40">John viii. 39, 40</A>);

 this did not Jacob." Or, "<I>Are these God's doings?</I> Are these the
 doings that will please him? Are these the doings of his people? No, 
 you know they are not, however some may be so strangely blinded and 
 bigoted as to kill God's ministers and think that therein they <I>do 
 him service,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:2">John xvi. 2</A>.

 (3.) Let them consider how unreasonable and absurd the thing was in 
 itself: <I>Do not my words do good to those that walk uprightly?</I> 
 Yes; certainly they do; it is an appeal to the experiences of the 
 <I>generation of the upright: "Call now if there be any of them that 
 will answer you, and to which of the saints will you turn?</I> Turn to 
 which you will, and you will find they all agree in this, that the word 
 of God <I>does good to those that walk uprightly;</I> and will you then 
 oppose that which does good, so much good as good preaching does?
 Herein you wrong God, who owns the words of the prophets to be his 
 words (they are <I>my words</I>) and who by them aims and designs to do 
 good to mankind 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:68">Ps. cxix. 68</A>);

 and will you hinder the great benefactor from doing good? Will you put
 the light of the world under a bushel: You might as well say to the 
 sun, Shine not, as <I>say to the seers, See not.</I> Herein you wrong 
 the souls of men, and deprive them of the benefit designed them by the 
 word of God." Note, Those are enemies not only to God, but to the 
 world, they are enemies to their country, that silence good ministers, 
 and obstruct the means of knowledge and grace; for it is certainly for 
 the public common good of states and kingdoms that religion should be 
 encouraged. God's words do good to those <I>that walk uprightly.</I> It 
 is the character of good people that they <I>walk uprightly</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+15:2">Ps. xv. 2</A>);

 and it is their comfort that the words of God are good and do good to
 them; they find comfort in them. God's words are good words to good
 people, and speak comfortably to them. But those that opposed the words 
 of God, and silenced the prophets, pleaded, in justification of 
 themselves, that God's words were unprofitable and unpleasant to them, 
 and did them no good, nor prophesied any good concerning them, but 
 evil, as Ahab complained of Micaiah, in answer to which the prophet 
 here tells them that it was their own fault; they might thank 
 themselves. They might find it of good use to them if they were but 
 disposed to make a good use of it; if they would but walk uprightly, as 
 they should, and so qualify themselves for comfort, the word of God 
 would speak comfortably to them. <I>Do that which is good, and thou 
 shalt have praise for the same.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What they are threatened with for this sin; God also will choose 
 their delusions, and, 

 (1.) They shall be deprived of the benefit of a
 faithful ministry. Since they say, <I>Prophesy not,</I> God will take 
 them at their word, and <I>they shall not prophesy to them;</I> their 
 sin shall be their punishment. If men will silence God's ministers, it 
 is just with God to silence them, as he did Ezekiel, and to say, They 
 shall <I>no more be reprovers</I> and monitors to them. Let the 
 physician no longer attend the patient that will not be healed, for he 
 will not be ruled. They <I>shall not prophesy to them,</I> and then 
 they will not take shame. As it is the work of magistrates, so it is 
 also of ministers, to put men to shame when they do amiss 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:7">Judg. xviii. 7</A>),
 
 that, being made ashamed of their folly, they may not return again to
 it; but, when God gives men up to be impudent and shameless in sin, he 
 says to his prophets, <I>They are joined to idols; let them alone.</I> 
 
 (2.) They shall be given up to the blind guidance of an unfaithful
 ministry. We may understand 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>

 as a threatening: <I>If a man be found walking in the spirit of 
 falsehood,</I> having such a lying spirit as was in the mouth of Ahab's 
 prophets, that will strengthen their hands in their wicked ways, he 
 <I>shall be the prophet of this people,</I> that is, God will leave 
 them to themselves to hearken to such; since they will be deceived, let 
 them be deceived; since they will not admit the <I>truth in the love of 
 it,</I> God will send them <I>strong delusions to believe a lie,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:10,11">2 Thess. ii. 10, 11</A>.

 They shall have prophets that will prophesy to them for <I>wine and
 strong drink</I> (so some read it), that will give you a cast of their 
 office to your mind for a bottle of wine of a flagon of ale, will 
 soothe sinners in their sins if they will but feed them with the 
 gratifications of their lusts; to have such prophets, and to be ridden 
 by them, is as sad a judgment as any people can be under and as bad a 
 preface of ruin approaching as it is to a particular person to be under 
 the influence of a debauched conscience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Oppressing God's poor is another sin they are charged with, as 
 before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+2:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>),

 for it is a sin doubly hateful and provoking to God. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How the sin is described, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+2:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 When they contemned God's prophets and opposed them they broke out into 
 all other wickedness; what bonds will hold those that have no reverence 
 for God's word? Those who formerly rose up against the enemies of the 
 nation, in defence of their country and therein behaved themselves 
 bravely, now of late <I>rose up as enemies of the nation,</I> and, 
 instead of defending it, destroyed it, and did it more mischief (as 
 usually such vipers in the bowels of a state do) than a foreign enemy 
 could do. They made a prey of men, women, and children,

 (1.) Of men, that were travelling on the way, that <I>pass by securely 
 as men averse from war,</I> that were far from any bad designs, but 
 went peaceably about their lawful occasions; those they set upon, as if 
 they had been dangerous obnoxious people, and <I>pulled off the robe 
 with the garment from them,</I> that is, they stripped them both of the 
 upper and the inner garment, took away <I>their cloak,</I> and would 
 have <I>their coat also;</I> thus barbarously did they use those that 
 were quiet in the land, who, being harmless, were fearless, and so the 
 more easily make a prey of. 

 (2.) Of women, whose sex should have been their protection 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):
 
 <I>The women of my people have you cast out from their pleasant houses. 
 They devoured widows' houses</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:14">Matt. xxiii. 14</A>),

 and so turned them out of the possession of them, because they were
 pleasant houses, and such as they had a mind for. It was inhuman to 
 deal thus barbarously with women; but that which especially aggravated 
 it was that they were the women of <I>God's people,</I> whom they knew 
 to be under his protection.

 (3.) Of children, whose age entitles them to a tender usage: <I>From 
 their children have you taken away my glory for ever.</I> It was the 
 glory of the Israelites' children that they were free, but they 
 enslaved them--that they were born in God's house, and had a right to 
 the privileges of it, but they sold them to strangers, sent them into 
 idolatrous countries, where they were deprived for ever of that glory; 
 at least the oppressors designed their captivity should be perpetual.
 Note, The righteous God will certainly reckon for injuries done to the 
 widows and fatherless, who, being helpless and friendless, cannot 
 otherwise expect to be righted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What the sentence is that is passed upon them for it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):
 
 "<I>Arise ye, and depart;</I> prepare to quit this land, for you shall 
 be forced out of it, as you have forced the women and children of my
 people out of their possessions; it is not, it shall not, be your rest, 
 as it was intended that Canaan should be, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:11">Ps. xcv. 11</A>.

 You shall have neither contentment nor continuance in it, <I>because it
 is polluted</I> by your wickedness." Sin is defiling to a land, and 
 sinners cannot expect to rest in a land which they have polluted, but 
 is will spew them out, as this land spewed out the Canaanites of old 
 when they had polluted it with their abominations,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:27,28">Lev. xviii. 27, 28</A>.

 "Nay, you shall not only be obliged to depart out of this land, but 
 <I>it shall destroy you even with a sore destruction;</I> you shall 
 either be turned out of it or (which is all one) you shall be ruined in 
 it." We may apply this to our state in this present world; it is 
 polluted; there is a great deal of <I>corruption in the world, through 
 lust,</I> and therefore we should <I>arise, and depart out of it,</I> 
 keep at a distance from the corruption that is in it, and <I>keep 
 ourselves unspotted</I> from it. It <I>is not our rest;</I> it was 
 never intended to be so; it was designed for our passage, but not for 
 our portion--our inn, but not our home. Here <I>we have no continuing
 city;</I> let us therefore <I>arise and depart;</I> let us sit loose to 
 it and live above it, and think of leaving it and seek a continuing 
 city above.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 After threatenings of wrath, the chapter here concludes, as is usual in 
 the prophets, with promises of mercy, which were in part fulfilled when 
 the Jews returned out of Babylon, and had their full accomplishment in 
 the kingdom of the Messiah. Their grievances shall be all redressed. 

 1. Whereas they were dispersed, they shall be brought together again,
 and shall jointly receive the tokens of God's favour to them, and shall 
 have communion with each other and comfort in each other

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 "<I>I will surely assemble, O Jacob! all of thee,</I> all that belong 
 to thee, all that are <I>named of the house of Jacob</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>)

 that are now expelled your country, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 I will bring you together again, and not one of you shall be lost, not
 one of you shall be missing. <I>I will surely gather the remnant of 
 Israel,</I> that remnant that is designed and reserved for salvation; 
 they shall be brought to incorporate in one body. <I>I will put them 
 together as the sheep of Bozrah.</I>" Sheep are inoffensive and 
 sociable creatures; they shall be <I>as the flock in the midst of their 
 fold,</I> where they are safe under the shepherd's eye and care; and 
 <I>they shall make great noise</I> (as numerous flocks and herds do, 
 with their bleating and lowing) <I>by reason of the multitude of 
 men</I> (for the sheep are <I>men,</I> as the prophet explains this 
 comparison, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:31">Ezek. xxxiv. 31</A>),

 not by reason of their strifes and contentions, but by reason of their
 great numbers. This was accomplished when Christ by his gospel gathered 
 together in one <I>all the children of God that were scattered 
 abroad,</I> and united both Jews and Gentiles in one fold, and under 
 one Shepherd, when all the complaint was that the <I>place was too 
 strait</I> for them--that was <I>the noise, by reason of their 
 multitude</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:19,20">Isa. xlix. 19, 20</A>),

 when there were some added to the church from all parts of the world,
 and all men were drawn to Christ by the attractive power of his cross,
 which shall be done yet more and more, and perfectly done, when he
 shall send forth his angels to <I>gather in his elect from the four
 winds.</I> 

 2. Whereas God had seemed to desert them, and cast them off, now he
 will own them, and head them, and help them through all the 
 difficulties that are in the way of their return and deliverance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>the breaker has come up before them,</I> to break down all 
 opposition, and clear the road for them; and under his guidance <I>they 
 have broken up, and have passed through the gate,</I> the door of 
 escape out of their captivity, and have <I>gone out by it</I> with 
 courage and resolution, having Omnipotence for their van-guard.
 <I>Their King shall pass before them,</I> to head them in the way, even 
 Jehovah (he was their king) <I>on the head of them,</I> as he was on 
 the head of the armies of Israel when they followed the pillar of cloud 
 and fire through the wilderness and when he appeared to Joshua as 
 <I>captain of the Lord's host.</I> Christ is the church's King; he is 
 Jehovah; he heads them, passes before them, brings them out of the land 
 of their captivity, brings them into the land of their rest. He is the 
 <I>breaker,</I> that broke through them, that rent the veil, and opened 
 the kingdom of heaven to all believers. The learned bishop Pearson 
 applies it to the resurrection of Christ, by which he obtained the 
 power and became the pattern of our resurrection. <I>The breaker has 
 gone up before us</I> out of the grave, and has carried away its gates, 
 as Samson did Gaza's, bar and all, and by that breach we go out. The 
 learned Dr. Pocock mentions, as the sense which some of the ancient
 Jews give of it, that the breaker is Elias, and their <I>King</I> the 
 <I>Messiah,</I> the Son of David; and he thinks we may apply it to 
 Christ and his forerunner <I>John the Baptist.</I> John was the 
 breaker; he broke the ice, prepared the way of the Lord by the baptism 
 of repentance; in him the gospel began; from his time <I>the kingdom of 
 heaven suffered violence;</I> and so the Christian church is 
 introduced, with <I>Messiah the Prince</I> before it, on the head of 
 it, going forth <I>conquering and to conquer.</I></P>
