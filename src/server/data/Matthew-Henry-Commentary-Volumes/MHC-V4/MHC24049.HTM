 The cup of trembling still goes round, and the nations must all drink 
 of it, according to the instructions given to Jeremiah,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Hath Israel no
 sons? hath he no heir? why <I>then</I> doth their king inherit Gad,
 and his people dwell in his cities?
 &nbsp; 2  Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that I will
 cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and
 it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned
 with fire: then shall Israel be heir unto them that were his
 heirs, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 3  Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of
 Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by
 the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, <I>and</I> his
 priests and his princes together.
 &nbsp; 4  Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O
 backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, <I>saying,</I>
 Who shall come unto me?
 &nbsp; 5  Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> of
 hosts, from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be driven
 out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that
 wandereth.
 &nbsp; 6  And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the
 children of Ammon, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The Ammonites were next, both in kindred and neighbourhood, to the 
 Moabites, and therefore are next set to the bar. Their country joined 
 to that of the two tribes and a half, on the other side Jordan, and was 
 but a bad neighbour; however, being a neighbour, they shall have a 
 share in these circular predictions. 

 1. An action is here brought, in God's name, against the Ammonites, for
 an illegal encroachment upon the rightful possessions of the tribe of 
 Gad, that lay next them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 A writ of enquiry is brought to discover what title they had to those 
 territories, which, upon the carrying away of the Gileadites, by the 
 king of Assyria

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:29,1Ch+5:26">2 Kings xv. 29, 1 Chron. v. 26</A>),

 were left almost dispeopled, at least unguarded, and an easy prey to
 the next invader. "What! Does it escheat <I>ob defectum
 sanguinis--for what of an heir? Hath Israel no sons? Hath he no
 heir?</I> Are there no Gadites left, to whom the right of inheritance 
 belongs? Or, if there were not, are there no Israelites, none left of 
 Judah, that are nearer akin to them than you are?" <I>Why then does 
 their king,</I> as if he were entitled to the forfeited estates, or 
 Milcom, their idol, as if he had the right to dispose of it to his 
 worshippers, <I>inherit Gad, and his people dwell in the cities</I> 
 which fell by lot to that tribe of God's people. Nay, there were sons 
 and heirs of their own body, <I>en ventre de sa mere</I>--<I>in their 
 mother's womb,</I> and the Ammonites, to prevent their claim, most 
 barbarously murdered them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+1:13">Amos i. 13</A>):

 <I>They ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they might
 enlarge their border,</I> that, having seized it, none might rise up
 hereafter to recover it from them. Thus <I>they magnified themselves
 against their border</I> and boasted it was their own, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+2:8">Zeph. ii. 8</A>.
 
 Note, Though among men might often prevails against right, yet that
 might shall be controlled by the Almighty, who <I>sits in the throne, 
 judging right;</I> and those will find themselves mistaken who think 
 every thing their own which they can lay their hands on, or which none 
 yet appears to lay claim to. As there is justice owing to owners, so 
 also to their heirs, when they are dead, whom it is a great sin to 
 defraud, though they either know not their right or know not how to 
 come at it. This shall be reckoned for particularly, when injuries of
 this kind are done to God's people. 

 2. Judgment is here given against them for this violence.

 (1.) Terrors shall come upon them: God <I>will cause an alarm of war to
 be heard,</I> even <I>in Rabbah,</I> their capital city and a very
 strong one, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 <I>The Lord God of hosts,</I> who has all armies at his command,
 <I>will bring a fear upon them from all that be about them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 Note, God has many ways to terrify those who have been a terror to his
 people.

 (2.) Their cities shall be laid in ruins: <I>Rabbah,</I> the
 mother-city, <I>shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters,</I> the 
 other cities that have a dependence upon her, and receive law from her 
 as daughters, <I>shall be burnt with fire;</I> so that the inhabitants 
 shall be forced to quit them, and they shall <I>cry,</I> and <I>gird 
 themselves with sackcloth,</I> as having lost all they had, and not 
 knowing whither to betake themselves.

 (3.) Their country, which they were so proud of, shall be wasted

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):
 
 <I>Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys,</I> and <I>trustest in thy 
 treasures, O backsliding daughter?</I> They are charged with 
 backsliding or turning away from God and from his worship, for they 
 were the posterity of righteous Lot. It is true, they had never been so 
 in covenant with God as Israel was; yet all idolaters may be called
 <I>backsliders,</I> for the worship of the true God was prior to that 
 of false gods. <I>They were untoward and refractory</I> (so some read 
 it); and, when they had forsaken their God, <I>they gloried in their 
 valleys,</I> particularly one that was called <I>the flowing 
 valley,</I> because it flowed with all good things. These they had 
 violently taken away from Israel, and gloried in it when they had done
 so. They gloried in the strength of their valleys, so surrounded with 
 mountains that they were inaccessible, gloried in the products of them, 
 gloried <I>in the treasures</I> they got together out of them, 
 <I>saying, Who shall come unto me?</I> While they bathed themselves in 
 the pleasures of their country, they flattered themselves with a 
 conceit that they should never be disturbed in the enjoyment of them: 
 <I>To-morrow shall be as this day;</I> therefore they set God and his 
 judgments at defiance; they are proud, voluptuous, and secure; but 
 wherefore dost thou do so: Note, Those who backslide and turn away from 
 God have little reason either to take complacency or to put confidence 
 in any worldly enjoyments whatsoever, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:1">Hos. ix. 1</A>.

 (4.) Their people, from the least to the greatest, shall be forced out
 of the country. Some shall flee to seek for shelter, others shall be 
 carried into captivity, so that their land shall be quite evacuated: 
 <I>Their king and his princes,</I> nay, and Milcom, their god, <I>and 
 his priests, shall go into captivity</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 <I>and every man shall be driven out right forth,</I> shall take the 
 next way, and make the best of it in his flight 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 forgetting the <I>valleys, the flowing valleys,</I> which now fail 
 them. And, to complete their misery, <I>none shall gather up him that 
 wanders,</I> none shall open their doors to them, as Jael to Sisera, to 
 entertain them; and those that flee shall be so much in care to secure 
 themselves that they shall not take notice of others, no, not of those 
 that are nearest to them, that wander, and are at a loss which way to 
 go, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+47:3"><I>ch.</I> xlvii. 3</A>.

 (5.) Then the country of the Ammonites shall fall into the hands of the
 remaining Israelites 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>Then shall Israel be heir to those that were his heirs,</I> shall 
 possess himself of their land who had possessed themselves of his, by 
 way of reprisal. Note, The equity of divine Providence is to be 
 acknowledged when the losses of the injured are recompensed out of the 
 unjust gains of the injurious. Though the enemies of God's Israel may 
 make a prey of them for a while, the tables will shortly be turned. 

 3. Yet there is a prospect given them of mercy hereafter

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 as before to Moab. The day will come when <I>the captivity of the 
 children of Ammon will</I> be <I>brought again;</I> for so it is in 
 human affairs: the wheel goes round.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  Concerning Edom, thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts; <I>Is</I> wisdom no
 more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their
 wisdom vanished?
 &nbsp; 8  Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I
 will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time <I>that</I> I will
 visit him.
 &nbsp; 9  If grape-gatherers come to thee, would they not leave <I>some</I>
 gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they
 have enough.
 &nbsp; 10  But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret
 places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is
 spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he <I>is</I> not.
 &nbsp; 11  Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve <I>them</I> alive;
 and let thy widows trust in me.
 &nbsp; 12  For thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Behold, they whose judgment <I>was</I>
 not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and <I>art</I> thou he
 <I>that</I> shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go
 unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink <I>of it.</I>
 &nbsp; 13  For I have sworn by myself, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that Bozrah
 shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and
 all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.
 &nbsp; 14  I have heard a rumour from the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and an ambassador is
 sent unto the heathen, <I>saying,</I> Gather ye together, and come
 against her, and rise up to the battle.
 &nbsp; 15  For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, <I>and</I>
 despised among men.
 &nbsp; 16  Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, <I>and</I> the pride of
 thine heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that
 holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy
 nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence,
 saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 17  Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it
 shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.
 &nbsp; 18  As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour
 <I>cities</I> thereof, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, no man shall abide there,
 neither shall a son of man dwell in it.
 &nbsp; 19  Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of
 Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly
 make him run away from her: and who <I>is</I> a chosen <I>man, that</I> I
 may appoint over her? for who <I>is</I> like me? and who will appoint
 me the time? and who <I>is</I> that shepherd that will stand before
 me?
 &nbsp; 20  Therefore hear the counsel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that he hath taken
 against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the
 inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall draw
 them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate with
 them.
 &nbsp; 21  The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry
 the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea.
 &nbsp; 22  Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread
 his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the
 mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The Edomites come next to receive their doom from God, by the mouth of 
 Jeremiah: they also were old enemies to the Israel of God; but their
 day will come to be reckoned with, and it is now at hand, and is 
 foretold, not only for warning to them, but for comfort to the Israel
 of God, whose afflictions were very much aggravated by their triumphs 
 over them and joy in their calamity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:7">Ps. cxxxvii. 7</A>.

 Many of the expressions used in this prophecy <I>concerning Edom</I>
 are borrowed from the prophecy of Obadiah, which is <I>concerning 
 Edom;</I> for, all the prophets being inspired by one and the same 
 Spirit, there must needs be a wonderful harmony and agreement in their 
 predictions. Now here it is foretold,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That the country of Edom should be all wasted and made desolate, 
 that <I>the calamity of Esau</I> should be <I>brought upon him,</I> the 
 calamity he has deserved, and God has long designed him, for his old 
 sins, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 The time is at hand when God <I>will visit him,</I> and call him to an 
 account, and then they shall <I>flee</I> from the sword, <I>turn 
 back</I> from the battle, and <I>dwell deep</I> in some close caverns, 
 where they shall hide themselves. All they have shall be carried off by 
 the conqueror; whereas <I>grape-gatherers</I> will <I>leave some 
 gleanings,</I> and even <I>thieves</I> know when <I>they have 
 enough</I> and <I>will destroy</I> no further, those that destroy them 
 shall never be satiated, 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>);

 they shall make <I>Esau</I> quite <I>bare,</I> shall strip the Edomites 
 of all they have, shall find out ways and means to come at their most 
 hidden treasure, shall discover even the <I>secret places</I> where 
 they thought to secure their wealth, and rifle them, so that they shall 
 none of them save their wealth, no, nor save themselves nor their 
 children, that might be concealed in a little room: <I>He shall not be 
 able to hide himself,</I> and <I>his seed</I> too <I>is spoiled. His 
 brethren</I> the Moabites, <I>and his neighbours</I> the Philistines, 
 whom he might have expected succours from, or at least shelter with, 
 are spoiled as well as he and disabled to do him any service. <I>And he 
 is not,</I> or <I>there is not he, there is none to him, none left 
 him,</I> that may say what follows 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 <I>Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive.</I> When 
 they are flying, or dying, there shall be none left, no relation, no 
 friend, no, not so much as any parish officers to take care of their 
 wives and children that they leave behind. Edom is not, he is cut off 
 and gone; nor is there any to say, <I>Leave me thy orphans.</I> If the 
 master of a family be cut off, or forced away, it is some comfort if he 
 have a friend to leave his family with, whom he can confide in; but 
 they shall have none such, for they shall all be involved in the same 
 calamity. The Chaldee makes these to be the words of God to his
 people, distinguishing them from the Edomites in this calamity; and 
 they read it, "<I>But you, O house of Israel! you shall not leave your 
 orphans; I will secure them, and let your widows rest on my word.</I> 
 Whatever becomes of the widows and fatherless of the Edomites, I will 
 take care of yours." Note, it is an unspeakable comfort to the people 
 of God, when they are dying, that they may leave their surviving 
 relations with God, may, in faith, commit them to him and encourage 
 them to trust in him; and, though they cannot promise themselves great 
 things in the world for them, yet they may hope that he will preserve 
 them alive, always, provided that they trust in him. Let the Edomites, 
 for their part, count upon no other than to be made <I>a desolation</I> 
 and <I>a reproach;</I> for the decree has gone forth; God hath <I>sworn 
 it by himself</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 that their <I>cities shall be wasted,</I> nay, they <I>shall be 
 perpetual wastes,</I> they shall be made mean and despicable; they had 
 made a mighty figure, but God will make <I>them small among the 
 heathen;</I> and those that despised God's people shall themselves be 
 <I>despised among men</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:15,Ob+1:2"><I>v.</I> 15, Obad. 2</A>),

 nay, they shall be made monstrous, and even a prodigy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>Edom shall be</I> such a <I>desolation</I> that every one who goes 
 by <I>shall be astonished;</I> nay, worse yet, they shall be made a 
 terror; Edom shall be made like Sodom and Gomorrah, none shall care for 
 coming near the ruins of it, <I>no man shall abide there</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),
 
 such a frightful place shall it be made.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That the instruments of this destruction should be very resolute 
 and formidable. They have their commission from God; he summons them 
 into this service 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>I have heard a rumour,</I> or report, <I>from the Lord,</I> heard it 
 by the prophecy of Obadiah, heard it by a whisper to myself, that <I>an 
 ambassador,</I> or herald, or messenger, <I>is sent to the</I> 
 Gentiles, who are to lay Edom waste, <I>saying, Gather you 
 together,</I> muster all the forces you can, <I>and come against 
 her;</I> for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>)

 this is <I>the counsel that he hath taken against Edom.</I> The matter 
 is settled, the decree has gone forth, and there is no resisting it. 
 God has determined that Edom shall be laid waste, and then he that is 
 to be employed in wasting it shall come swiftly and strongly. 
 Nebuchadnezzar is he or whom it is here foretold, 

 1. That he <I>shall come up like a lion,</I> with fierceness and fury,
 like a lion enraged by <I>the swelling of Jordan</I> overflowing his 
 banks, which forces him out of his covert by the water-side into the 
 higher grounds,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.
 
 He shall come roaring, come to devour all that come in his way. He
 shall <I>come against the habitation of the strong,</I> the forts and 
 castles; and I <I>will cause him to come suddenly into the land</I> (so 
 the next words might well be read), so as to find them unprovided with 
 necessaries for a defence; for I will look out <I>a chosen man to 
 appoint over her,</I> to do this execution, a man fit for the purpose, 
 one chosen out of the people; for when God has work to do he will find 
 out the fittest instruments to be employed in doing it: "<I>Who is like 
 me</I> for choosing the instruments, and spiriting them for the work?
 And <I>who will appoint me the time?</I> Who will challenge me, and fix 
 a time and place to meet me? Who will join issue with me in battle?
 And, when I send a lion into the flock, <I>who is that shepherd</I> 
 that can, or dare, stand before me, or against me, to oppose that lion, 
 and think to rescue any of the flock?" Note, When God has work to do of 
 any kind he will soon find those that are able to engage in it, and all 
 the world cannot find those that are able to engage against it. Nay, if 
 God will have Edom destroyed, and their peopled dislodged, there needs 
 not a lion, a fierce lion to do it: <I>Even the least of the flock 
 shall draw them out</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>);

 the meanest servant in Nebuchadnezzar's retinue, the weakest of all 
 that follow his camp, shall <I>draw them out</I> for the slaughter, 
 shall force them to flee, or to surrender, and <I>make their 
 habitations desolate with them.</I> God can bring to pass the greatest 
 works by instruments least likely. When the Chaldean army comes
 against the Edomites all hands shall be employed and the poorest 
 soldier in it shall have a pluck at them. 

 2. Nebuchadnezzar shall come, not only like a lion, the king of
 beasts, but like an eagle, the king of birds

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>He shall fly as the eagle</I> upon his prey, so swiftly, so 
 strongly, shall clap his wings upon Bozrah, to secure it for himself 
 (as before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:40"><I>ch.</I> xlviii. 40</A>),

 and immediately <I>the hearts of the mighty men</I> shall fail them,
 for they shall see he is an enemy that it is in vain to struggle

 III. That the Edomites' confidences should all fail them in the day of 
 their distress. 

 1. They trusted to their wisdom, but that shall stand them in no stead.
 This is the first thing fastened upon in this prophecy against Edom,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 That nation used to be famous for wisdom, and their statesmen were 
 thought to excel in politics; and yet now they shall take such wrong 
 measures in all their counsels, and be so baffled in all their designs, 
 that people shall ask, with wonder, What is the matter with the 
 Edomites? <I>Is wisdom no more in Teman?</I> Have the wise men of the 
 east country 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:30">1 Kings iv. 30</A>)

 become fools? Are those at <I>their wits' end</I> that were thought to
 have the monopoly of prudence? <I>Has counsel perished from the 
 understanding men?</I> It is so, when God is designing the ruin of a 
 people; for whom he will destroy he infatuates. See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:20">Job xii. 20</A>.

 <I>Has their wisdom vanished? Is it tired?</I> (so some); <I>is it worn
 out?</I> (so others); <I>has it become useless?</I> so others. Yes, it 
 will do them no service when God comes forth to contend with them.

 2. They trusted to their strength, but neither shall that avail them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 They had been a terror to all their neighbours; every body feared them 
 and truckled to them, and this made them proud and conceited of 
 themselves and their own strength, and very secure; because no 
 neighbouring nation durst meddle with them, they thought no nation in 
 the world durst. Their country was much of it mountainous, having many 
 passes which they thought themselves able to make good against any 
 invader; but this terribleness of theirs deceived them, and so did 
 their imaginary inaccessibleness; they did not prove so strong as they 
 were formidable, nor so safe as they were secure. High as they are,
 God will bring them down; for, as <I>there is no wisdom,</I> so there 
 is no might <I>against the Lord,</I> See these expressions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:3,4,8">Obad. 3, 4, 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That their destruction should be inevitable and very remarkable. 

 1. God hath determined it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 he hath said it; nay 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 he hath <I>sworn it,</I> that <I>the Edomites shall not go 
 unpunished,</I> but that they shall <I>drink the cup of trembling,</I> 
 which is put into the hands of all their neighbours; even those 
 <I>whose judgment,</I> or doom, <I>was not to drink of the cup,</I> who 
 had not so well deserved it as they had done, nations that had not been 
 such enemies to Israel as they had been, or Israel itself, that was 
 God's peculiar people, and among whom there were many, very many, who 
 kept his ordinances, upon which account they might have expected an 
 exemption; and yet they had been made to drink of the bitter cup; and 
 shall the Edomites think to pass it? No; they shall <I>surely drink of 
 it.</I> Note, When God punishes the less guilty it is folly for the 
 more guilty to promise themselves impunity; and when judgment begins at 
 God's house it will reach the strangers. 

 2. All the world shall take notice of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>The earth is moved,</I> and all the nations are put into a concern, 
 <I>at the noise of their fall;</I> the news of it shall make them 
 tremble. <I>The noise of the outcry is heard to the Red Sea,</I> which 
 flowed upon the coasts of Edom. So loud shall be the shouts of the 
 conquerors and the shrieks of the conquered, and such a mighty noise 
 shall the news of this destruction of Idumea make in the nations, that 
 is shall be heard among the ships that lie in the Red Sea to take in 
 lading 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+9:26">1 Kings ix. 26</A>),

 and then they shall carry the news of it to the remotest shore. Note,
 The fall of those who have affected to make a noise with their pomp and 
 power will make so much the greater noise.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>23  Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for
 they have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; <I>there is</I>
 sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.
 &nbsp; 24  Damascus is waxed feeble, <I>and</I> turneth herself to flee, and
 fear hath seized on <I>her:</I> anguish and sorrows have taken her, as
 a woman in travail.
 &nbsp; 25  How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!
 &nbsp; 26  Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all
 the men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of
 hosts.
 &nbsp; 27  And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it
 shall consume the palaces of Benhadad.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The kingdom of Syria lay north of Canaan, as that of Edom lay south, 
 and thither we must now remove and take a view of the approaching fate 
 of that kingdom, which had been often vexatious to the Israel of God.
 Damascus was the metropolis of that kingdom, and the ruin of the whole 
 is supposed in the ruin of that: yet Hamath and Arpad, two other 
 considerable cities, are names 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 and <I>the palaces of Ben-hadad,</I> which he built, are particularly 
 marked for ruin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>;
 
 see also 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+1:4">Amos i. 4</A>.

 Some think Ben-hadad (the son of Hadad, either their idol, or one of 
 their ancient kings, whence the rest descended) was a common name of 
 the kings of Syria, as Pharaoh of the kings of Egypt. Now observe
 concerning the judgment of Damascus, 

 1. It begins with a terrible fright and faint-heartedness. They
 <I>hear evil tidings,</I> that the king of Babylon, with all his force, 
 is coming against them, and <I>they are confounded;</I> they know not 
 what measures to take for their own safety, their souls are melted, 
 <I>they are faint-hearted,</I> they have no spirit left them, they are 
 like <I>the troubled sea, that cannot be quiet</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:20">Isa. lvii. 20</A>),

 or like men <I>in a storm</I> at sea

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:26">Ps. xvii. 26</A>);

 or the sorrow that begins in the city shall go to the sea-coast,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 See how easily God can dispirit those nations that have been most 
 celebrated for valour. <I>Damascus</I> now <I>waxes feeble</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 a city that thought she could look the most formidable enemy in the 
 face now <I>turns herself to flee,</I> and owns it is to no more 
 purpose to think of contending with her fate than for <I>a woman in</I> 
 labour to contend with her pains, which she cannot escape, but must 
 yield to. It was a <I>city of praise</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 not praise to God, but to herself, a city much commended and admired by 
 all strangers that visited it. It was a <I>city of joy,</I> where there 
 was an affluence and confluence of all the delights of the sons of men, 
 and abundance of mirth in the enjoyment of them. We read it (though 
 there is no necessity for this) <I>the city of my joy,</I> which the 
 prophet himself had sometimes visited with pleasure. Or it may be the 
 speech of the king lamenting the ruin of <I>the city of</I> his 
 <I>joy.</I> But now it is all overwhelmed with fear and grief. Note, 
 Those deceive themselves who place their happiness in carnal joys; for 
 God in his providence can soon cast a damp upon them and put an end to 
 them. He can soon make a <I>city of praise</I> to be a reproach and a 
 <I>city of joy</I> to be a terror to itself.

 2. It ends with a terrible fall and fire.

 (1.) The inhabitants are slain
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 The <I>young men,</I> who should fight the enemy and defend the city, 
 <I>shall fall</I> by the sword <I>in her streets; and all the men of 
 war,</I> mighty men, expert in war, and engaged in the service of their 
 country, <I>shall be cut off.</I> 
 
 (2.) The city is laid in ashes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 The <I>fire</I> is <I>kindled</I> by the besiegers <I>in the wall,</I> 
 but it shall devour all before it, <I>the palaces of Ben-hadad</I> 
 particularly, where so much mischief had formerly been hatched against 
 God's Israel, for which it is now thus visited.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>28  Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor,
 which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east.
 &nbsp; 29  Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they
 shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels,
 and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear <I>is</I> on
 every side.
 &nbsp; 30  Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of
 Hazor, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath
 taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against
 you.
 &nbsp; 31  Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth
 without care, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, which have neither gates nor bars,
 <I>which</I> dwell alone.
 &nbsp; 32  And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of
 their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them
 <I>that are</I> in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity
 from all sides thereof, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 33  And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, <I>and</I> a
 desolation for ever: there shall no man abide there, nor <I>any</I>
 son of man dwell in it.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These verses foretell the desolation that Nebuchadnezzar and his forces 
 should make among the people of Kedar (who descended from Kedar the son 
 of Ishmael, and inhabited a part of Arabia the Stony), and of the
 kingdoms, the petty principalities, of Hazor, that joined to them, who 
 perhaps were originally Canaanites, of the kingdom of Hazor, in the 
 north of Canaan, which had Jabin for its king, but, being driven 
 thence, settled in the deserts of Arabia and associated themselves with 
 the Kedarenes. Concerning this people we may here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What was their present state and posture? They dwelt in <I>tents</I> 
 and had no walls, but <I>curtains</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 no fortified cities; they had <I>neither gates nor bars,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.
 
 They were shepherds, and had no treasures, but stock upon land, no 
 money, but flocks and camels. They had no soldiers among them, for
 they were in no fear of invaders, no merchants, for they <I>dwelt 
 alone,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 Those of other nations neither came among them nor traded with them; 
 but they lived within themselves, content with the products and 
 pleasures of their own country. This was their manner of living, very 
 different from that of the nations that were round about them. And, 

 1. They were very rich; though they had not trade, no treasures, yet
 they are here said to be a <I>wealthy nation</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),

 because they had a sufficiency to answer all the occasions of human 
 life and they were content with it. Note, Those are truly rich who have 
 enough to supply their necessities, and know when they have enough. We 
 need not go to the treasures of kings and provinces, or to the cash of 
 merchants, to look for wealthy people; they may be found among 
 shepherds <I>that dwell in tents.</I> 

 2. They were very easy: <I>They dwelt without care.</I> Their wealth
 was such as nobody envied them, or, if any did, they might come 
 peaceably and enjoy the like; and therefore they feared nobody. Note, 
 Those that live innocently and honestly may live very securely, though 
 they have <I>neither gates nor bars.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The design of the king of Babylon against them and the descent he 
 make upon them: <I>He has taken counsel against you and has conceived a 
 purpose against you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 That proud man resolves it shall never be said that he, who had 
 conquered so many strong cities, will leave those unconquered <I>that 
 dwell in tents.</I> It was strange that that eagle should stoop to 
 catch these flies, that so great a prince should play at such small 
 game; but all is fish that comes to the ambitious covetous man's net. 
 Note, It will not always secure men from suffering wrong to be able to 
 say that they have done no wrong; not to have given offence will not be 
 a defence against such men as Nebuchadnezzar. Yet, how unrighteous 
 soever he was in doing it, God was righteous in directing it. These 
 people had lived inoffensively among their neighbours, as many do, who 
 yet, like them, are guilty before God; and it was to punish them for 
 their offences against him that God said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 <I>Arise, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east.</I> They will 
 do it to gratify their own covetousness and ambition, but God orders it 
 for the correcting of an unthankful people, and for warning to a 
 careless world to expect trouble when they seem to be most safe. God
 says to the Chaldeans 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 "<I>Arise, get up to the wealthy nation that dwells without care;</I> 
 go and give them an alarm, that none may imagine <I>their mountain 
 stands so strong that it cannot be moved.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The great amazement that this put them into, and the great 
 desolation hereby made among them: <I>They shall cry unto them;</I> 
 those on the borders shall send the alarm into all parts of the 
 country, which shall be put into the utmost confusion by it; they shall 
 cry, "<I>Fear is on every side</I>--We are surrounded by the enemy." the
 very terror of which shall drive them all to their feet and they shall 
 none of them have any heart to make resistance. The enemy shall 
 <I>proclaim fear upon them,</I> or <I>against them, on every side.</I> 
 They need not strike a stroke; they shall shout them out of their 
 tents, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 Upon the first alarm, they shall <I>flee, get far off,</I> and <I>dwell 
 deep</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 as the Edomites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 And it will be found that this <I>fear on every side</I> is not 
 groundless, for <I>their calamity</I> shall be <I>brought from all 
 sides thereof,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 No marvel there are <I>fears on every side</I> when there are foes on 
 every side. The issue will be, 

 1. What they have will be a prey to the Chaldeans; they shall <I>take
 to themselves their curtains and vessels;</I> though they are but plain 
 and coarse, and they have better of their own, yet they shall take them 
 for spite, and spoil for spoiling sake. <I>They shall carry away their 
 tents and their flocks,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 <I>Their camels</I> shall be a booty to those that came for nothing 
 else, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 2. It is not said that any of them shall be slain, for they attempt not 
 to make any resistance and their tents and flocks are accepted as a 
 ransom for their lives; but they shall be dislodged and dispersed; 
 though now they dwell <I>in the utmost corners,</I> out of the way, and 
 therefore they think out of the reach, of danger (by this character 
 those people were distinguished,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:23,25,26"><I>ch.</I> ix. 26, 25, 23</A>),

 yet they shall be <I>scattered</I> thence <I>into all winds,</I> into
 all parts of the world. Note, Privacy and obscurity are not always a 
 protection and security. Many that affect to be strangers to the world 
 may yet by unthought-of providences be forced into it; and those that 
 live most retired may have the same lot with those that thrust 
 themselves forth and lie most exposed. 

 3. Their country shall lie uninhabited; for, lying remote and out of
 all high roads, and having neither cities nor lands inviting to 
 strangers, none shall care to succeed them, so that <I>Hazor shall be a 
 desolation for ever,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 If busy men be displaced, many strive to get into their placed, because 
 they lived great; but here are easy quiet men displaced, and <I>no 
 man</I> cared to <I>abide</I> where they did, because they lived 
 meanly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>34  The word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> that came to Jeremiah the prophet
 against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of
 Judah, saying,
 &nbsp; 35  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow
 of Elam, the chief of their might.
 &nbsp; 36  And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four
 quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds;
 and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall
 not come.
 &nbsp; 37  For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies,
 and before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon
 them, <I>even</I> my fierce anger, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and I will send the
 sword after them, till I have consumed them:
 &nbsp; 38  And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from
 thence the king and the princes, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 39  But it shall come to pass in the latter days, <I>that</I> I will
 bring again the captivity of Elam, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This prophecy is dated in the beginning of Zedekiah's reign; it is 
 probable that the other prophecies against the Gentiles, going before, 
 were at the same time. The Elamites were the Persians, descended from 
 Elam the son of Shem 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:22">Gen. x. 22</A>);

 yet some think it was only that part of Persia which lay nearest to the
 Jews which was called <I>Elymais,</I> and adjoined to Media-Elam, 
 which, say they, had acted against God's Israel, <I>bore the quiver</I> 
 in an expedition against them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:6">Isa. xxii. 6</A>),

 and therefore must be reckoned with among the rest. It is here
 foretold, in general, that God will <I>bring evil upon them, even</I> 
 his <I>fierce anger,</I> and that is evil enough, it has <I>all evil in 
 it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 In particular, 

 1. Their forces shall be disabled, and rendered incapable of doing them
 any service. The Elamites were famous archers, but, <I>Behold, I will 
 break the bow of Elam</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>),

 will ruin their artillery, and then <I>the chief of their might</I> is 
 gone. God often orders it so that that which we most trust to first 
 fails us, and that which was <I>the chief of our might</I> proves the 
 least of our help. 

 2. Their people shall be dispersed. There shall come enemies against
 them from all parts of the world, and they shall all carry some of them 
 away captive into their respective countries; while others shall flee, 
 some one way and some another, to shift for themselves, so that 
 <I>there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not 
 come,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 <I>The four winds</I> shall be brought upon them; the storm shall come 
 sometimes from one point and sometimes from another, to toss and hurry 
 them several ways. We know not from what point the wind of trouble may 
 blow; but, if God encompass us with his favour, we are safe, and may be 
 easy, which way soever the storm comes. Fear shall drive them into 
 other countries; they shall <I>be dismayed before their enemies;</I> 
 but, as if that were not enough, <I>I will send the sword after 
 them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 Note, God can make his judgments follow those that think by flight to 
 escape them and to get out of the reach of them. <I>Evil pursues
 sinners.</I> 

 3. Their princes shall be destroyed and the government quite changed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>):

 <I>I will set my throne in Elam.</I> The throne of Nebuchadnezzar shall 
 be set there, or the throne of Cyrus, who began his conquests with 
 Elymais. Or it may be meant of the throne on which God sits for 
 judgment; he will make them know that he reigns, that he <I>judges in 
 the earth,</I> that <I>kings and princes</I> are accountable to him, 
 and that high as they are he is above them. The king of Elam was famous 
 of old, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:1">Gen. xiv. 1</A>.

 Chedorlaomer was king of Elam, and a mighty man he was in his day; the
 nations about him served him; his successors, we may suppose, made a 
 great figure; but the king of Elam is no more to God than another man.
 When God <I>sets his throne in Elam</I> he <I>will destroy thence the 
 king and the princes</I> that are, and set up whom he pleases. 

 4. Yet the destruction of Elam shall not be perpetual

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>):

 <I>In the latter days I will bring again the captivity of Elam.</I> 
 When Cyrus had destroyed Babylon, brought the empire into the hands of 
 the Persians, the Elamites no doubt returned in triumph out of all the 
 countries whither they were scattered, and settled again in their own 
 country. But this promise was to have its full and principal
 accomplishment in the days of the Messiah, when we find Elamites 
 particularly among those who, when the Holy Ghost was given, heard 
 spoken <I>in their own tongues the wonderful works of God</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:9,11">Acts ii. 9, 11</A>),

 and that is the most desirable return of the captivity. <I>If the Son
 make you free, then you shall be free indeed.</I></P>
