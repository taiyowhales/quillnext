 In this chapter we have, 

 I. The appropriating of the east gate of the temple to the prince, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. A reproof sent to the house of Israel for their former profanations
 of God's sanctuary, with a charge to them to be more strict for the 
 future, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:4-9">ver. 4-9</A>.

 III. The degrading of those Levites that had formerly been guilty of
 idolatry and the establishing of the priesthood in the family of Zadok,
 which had kept their integrity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:10-16">ver. 10-16</A>.

 IV. Divers laws and ordinances concerning the priests,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward
 sanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it <I>was</I> shut.
 &nbsp; 2  Then said the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall
 not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be
 shut.
 &nbsp; 3  <I>It is</I> for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat
 bread before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; he shall enter by the way of the porch of
 <I>that</I> gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet is here brought to review what he had before once surveyed; 
 for, though we have often looked into the things of God, they will yet 
 bear to be looked over again, such a copiousness there is in them. The 
 lessons we have learned we should still repeat to ourselves. Every time 
 we review the sacred fabric of holy things, which we have in the 
 scriptures, we shall still find something new which we did not before 
 take notice of. The prophet is brought a third time to the east gate, 
 and finds it shut, which intimates that the rest of the gates were open 
 at all times to the worshippers. But such an account is given of this 
 gate's being shut as puts honour, 

 1. Upon the God of Israel. It is for the honour of him that the gate of
 the inner court, at which his glory entered when he took possession of 
 the house, was ever after kept shut, and no man was allowed to enter in 
 by it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The difference ever after made between this and the other gates, that 
 this was shut when the others were open, was intended both to 
 perpetuate the remembrance of the solemn entrance of the glory of the 
 Lord into the house (which it would remain a traditional evidence of 
 the truth of) and also to possess the minds of people with a reverence 
 for the Divine Majesty, and with very awful thoughts of his 
 transcendent glory, which was designed in God's charge to Moses at the 
 bush, <I>Put off thy shoe from off thy foot.</I> God will have a way by 
 himself. 
 
 2. Upon the prince of Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 It is an honour to him that though he may not enter in by this gate, 
 for no man may, yet, 

 (1.) He shall <I>sit in this gate</I> to <I>eat</I> his share of the 
 peace-offerings, that sacred food, <I>before the Lord.</I> 

 (2.) He shall <I>enter by the way of the porch of that gate,</I> by 
 some little door or wicket, either in the gate or adjoining to it, 
 which is called the <I>say of the porch.</I> This as to signify that 
 God puts some of his glory upon magistrates, upon the princes of his 
 people, for he has said, <I>You are gods.</I> Some by the prince here 
 understand the high priests, or the sagan or second priest; and that he 
 only was allowed to enter by this gate, for he was God's 
 representative. Christ is the high priest of our profession, who 
 entered himself into the holy place, and <I>opened the kingdom of 
 heaven to all believers.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the
 house: and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> filled
 the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and I fell upon my face.
 &nbsp; 5  And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold
 with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto
 thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and
 all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house,
 with every going forth of the sanctuary.
 &nbsp; 6  And thou shalt say to the rebellious, <I>even</I> to the house of
 Israel, Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; O ye house of Israel, let it
 suffice you of all your abominations,
 &nbsp; 7  In that ye have brought <I>into my sanctuary</I> strangers,
 uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my
 sanctuary, to pollute it, <I>even</I> my house, when ye offer my
 bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant
 because of all your abominations.
 &nbsp; 8  And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye
 have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.
 &nbsp; 9  Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart,
 nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any
 stranger that <I>is</I> among the children of Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is much to the same purport with what we had in the beginning of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:1-31"><I>ch.</I> xliii.</A>

 As the prophet must look again upon what he had before seen, so he must
 be told again what he had before heard. Here, as before, he sees the 
 house <I>filled with the glory of the Lord,</I> which strikes an awe 
 upon him, so that he falls prostrate at the sight, the humblest posture 
 of adoration and the expression of a holy awe: <I>I fell upon my 
 face,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Note, The more we see of the glory of God the more low we shall lie in 
 our own eyes. Now here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God charges the prophet to take a very particular notice of all he 
 saw, and all that was said to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>Behold with thy eyes</I> what is <I>shown</I> thee, particularly 
 the <I>entering in of the house</I> and <I>every going forth</I> of it, 
 all the inlets and all the outlets of the sanctuary;" those he must 
 take special notice of. Note, In acquainting ourselves with divine
 things we must not aim so much at an abstract speculation of the things 
 themselves as at finding the plain appointed way of converse and 
 communion with those things, that we may <I>go in and out and find 
 pasture.</I> 

 2. <I>Hear with thy ears all that I say unto thee</I> about <I>the 
 laws</I> and <I>ordinances </I>of <I>the house,</I> which he was to 
 instruct the people in. Note, Those who are appointed to be teachers 
 have need to be very diligent careful learners, that they may neither 
 forget any of the things they are entrusted with nor mistake concerning 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He sends him upon an errand to the people, <I>to the rebellious, 
 even to the house of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 It is sad to think that the house of Israel should deserve this 
 character from him who perfectly knew them, that a people in covenant 
 with God should be rebellious against him. Who are his subjects if the 
 house of Israel be rebels? But it is an instance of God's rich mercy 
 that, though they had been <I>rebellious,</I> yet, being the <I>house 
 of Israel,</I> he does not cast them off, but sends an ambassador to 
 them, to invite and encourage them to return to their allegiance, which 
 he would not have done if he had been pleased to kill them. The whole 
 race of mankind has fallen under the character here given of the house 
 of Israel; but our Lord Jesus, when he ascended on high, received gifts 
 for men, <I>yea, even for the rebellious also, that,</I> as here, 
 <I>the Lord God might dwell among them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:18">Ps. lxviii. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He must tell them of their faults, must show them their rebellions, 
 must show the house of Jacob their sins. Note, Those that are sent to 
 comfort God's people must first convince them, and so prepare them for 
 comfort. <I>Let it suffice you of all your abominations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 Note, It is time for those that have continued long in sin to reckon it 
 long enough, and too long, and to begin to think of taking up in time, 
 and leaving off their evil courses. "<I>Let the time past of your lives 
 suffice,</I> for by this time, surely, you have surfeited upon your 
 abominations and have become sick of them," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:3">1 Pet. iv. 3</A>.

 That which is here charged upon them is,

 (1.) That they had admitted those to the privileges of the sanctuary
 that were not entitled to them; whereas God had said, <I>The stranger 
 that comes nigh shall be put to death,</I> they had not only connived 
 at the intrusion of strangers into the sanctuary, but had themselves 
 introduced them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>You brought in strangers uncircumcised in flesh,</I> and therefore 
 under a legal incapacity to enter into the sanctuary, which was a 
 <I>breaking of the covenant</I> of circumcision, throwing down the 
 hedge of their peculiarity, and laying themselves in common with the 
 rest of the world. Yet if these strangers had been devout and good, 
 though they were not circumcised, the crime would not have been so 
 great; but they were <I>uncircumcised in heart</I> too, unhumbled, 
 unreformed, and strangers indeed to God and all goodness. When they 
 came to offer sacrifice they brought these with them to feast with them 
 upon the sacrifice, because they were fond of their company, and this 
 was one of their abominations, wherewith they <I>polluted God's 
 sanctuary;</I> it was <I>giving that which was holy unto dogs,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:6">Matt. vii. 6</A>.

 Note, The admission of those who are openly wicked and profane to
 special ordinances is a polluting of God's sanctuary and a great 
 provocation to him.

 (2.) That they had employed those in the service of the sanctuary who 
 were not fit for it. Though none but priests and Levites were to 
 minister in the sanctuary, yet we may suppose that all who were priests 
 and Levites did not immediately attend there, but chosen men of them, 
 who were best qualified, who were most wise, serious, and 
 conscientious, and most likely to keep the charge of the holy things 
 carefully; but, in making this choice, they had not regard to merit and 
 qualification for the work: "<I>You have set keepers of my charge in my 
 sanctuary for yourselves,</I> such as you had some favour or affection 
 for, such as you either had got, or hoped to get, money by, or such as 
 would comply with your humours and would dispense with the laws of the 
 sanctuary to please you; <I>thus you have not kept the charge of my 
 holy things.</I>" Note, Those who have the choice of the keepers of the 
 holy things, if, to serve some secular selfish purpose, they choose 
 such as are unfit and unfaithful, will justly have it laid at their 
 door, that they have betrayed the holy things by lodging them in bad 
 hands.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He must tell them their duty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>No stranger shall enter into my sanctuary</I> till he has first 
 submitted to the laws of it." But, lest any should think that this 
 excluded the penitent believing Gentiles from the church, the stranger 
 here is described to be one that is <I>uncircumcised in heart,</I> not 
 in sincerity consenting to the covenant, nor putting away the filth of 
 the flesh; whereas the believing Gentiles were <I>circumcised with the 
 circumcision made without hands,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:11">Col. ii. 11</A>.

 This circumcision of the heart, in the <I>spirit, not in the
 letter,</I> was what the unbelieving Jews were strangers to and 
 unconcerned about, while yet they were zealous to keep out of the 
 sanctuary uncircumcised Gentiles, witness their rage against Paul when 
 they did but suspect him to have brought <I>Greeks into the temple,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:28">Acts xxi. 28</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel
 went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols;
 they shall even bear their iniquity.
 &nbsp; 11  Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, <I>having</I> charge
 at the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they
 shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people,
 and they shall stand before them to minister unto them.
 &nbsp; 12  Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and
 caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have
 I lifted up mine hand against them, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, and they
 shall bear their iniquity.
 &nbsp; 13  And they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a
 priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the
 most holy <I>place:</I> but they shall bear their shame, and their
 abominations which they have committed.
 &nbsp; 14  But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for
 all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.
 &nbsp; 15  But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept
 the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went
 astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me,
 and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the
 blood, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>:
 &nbsp; 16  They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near
 to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The Master of the house, being about to set up house again, takes 
 account of his servants the priests, and sees who are fit to be turned 
 out of their places and who to be kept in, and takes a course with them 
 accordingly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Those who have been treacherous are degraded and put lower those 
 Levites--or priests who were carried down the stream of the apostasy of
 Israel formerly, who <I>went astray from God after their idols</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 who had complied with the idolatrous kings of Israel or Judah, who 
 <I>ministered to them before their idols</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 bowed with them in the house of Rimmon, or set up altars for them, as 
 Urijah did for Ahaz, and so <I>caused the house of Israel to fall into 
 iniquity,</I> led them to sin and hardened them in sin; for, if the 
 priests go astray, many will follow <I>their pernicious ways.</I> 
 Perhaps in Babylon some of the Jewish priests had complied with the 
 idolaters of the place, to the great scandal of their religion. Now 
 these priests who had thus prevaricated were justly put under the mark 
 of God's displeasure; or, if they were dead (as it is probable that 
 they were, if the crime were committed before the captivity), the 
 iniquity was visited upon their children. Or perhaps it was the whole 
 family of Abiathar that had been guilty of this trespass, which was now 
 called to account for it. And, 

 1. They are sentenced to be deprived, in part, of their office, and
 from the dignity of priests are put down into the condition or ordinary 
 Levites. God has <I>lifted up his hand against them,</I> has said it, 
 and sworn it, that <I>they shall bear their iniquity</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 assuredly they shall suffer for it, shall suffer disgrace for it; 
 <I>they shall bear their shame</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 for though they have (we charitably hope) repented of it, <I>yet they 
 shall not come near to do the office of a priest,</I> that is, those 
 parts of the office that were peculiar to them, they shall not come 
 near to <I>any of the holy things</I> within the sanctuary, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 Note, those who have robbed God of his honour will justly be deprived 
 of their honour. And it is really a great punishment to be forbidden
 to come near to God; and justly might those who have once gone away 
 from him be rejected as unworthy ever to come near to him and put at an 
 everlasting distance.

 2. Yet there is a mixture of mercy in this sentence. God deals not in 
 severity, as he might have done, with those who had dealt treacherously 
 with him, but mitigates the sentence,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:11,14"><I>v.</I> 11, 14</A>.

 They are deprived but in part, <I>ab officio--of their office,</I> and, 
 it should seem, not at all <I>&agrave; beneficio--of their 
 emoluments.</I> They shall help to <I>slay the sacrifice,</I> which the 
 Levites were permitted to do, and which in this temple was done, not at 
 the altar, but <I>at the tables,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:29"><I>ch.</I> xl. 29</A>.

 They shall be porters <I>at the gates of the house,</I> and they shall
 be <I>keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service 
 thereof.</I> Note, Those who may not be fit to be employed in one kind 
 of service may yet be fit to be employed in another; and even those who 
 have offended may yet be made use of, and not quite thrown aside, much 
 less thrown away.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Those who have been faithful are honoured and established, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 These are remarkably distinguished from the other: "<I>But the sons of 
 Zadok,</I> who kept their integrity in a time of general apostasy, who 
 <I>went not astray</I> when others did, <I>they shall come near to me, 
 shall come near to my table.</I>" Note, God will put marks of honour 
 upon those who give proofs of their fidelity and constancy to him in 
 shaking trying times, and will employ those in his service who have 
 kept close to his service when others deserted it and drew back. And
 it ought to be reckoned a true and great reward of stability in duty to 
 be established in it. If we keep close to God, God will keep us close 
 to him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  And it shall come to pass, <I>that</I> when they enter in at the
 gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen
 garments; and no wool shall come upon them, whiles they minister
 in the gates of the inner court, and within.
 &nbsp; 18  They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall
 have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird
 <I>themselves</I> with any thing that causeth sweat.
 &nbsp; 19  And when they go forth into the utter court, <I>even</I> into the
 utter court to the people, they shall put off their garments
 wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and
 they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the
 people with their garments.
 &nbsp; 20  Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks
 to grow long; they shall only poll their heads.
 &nbsp; 21  Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into
 the inner court.
 &nbsp; 22  Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her
 that is put away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the
 house of Israel, or a widow that had a priest before.
 &nbsp; 23  And they shall teach my people <I>the difference</I> between the
 holy and profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean
 and the clean.
 &nbsp; 24  And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; <I>and</I> they
 shall judge it according to my judgments: and they shall keep my
 laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies; and they shall
 hallow my sabbaths.
 &nbsp; 25  And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves:
 but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for
 brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile
 themselves.
 &nbsp; 26  And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven
 days.
 &nbsp; 27  And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the
 inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin
 offering, saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 28  And it shall be unto them for an inheritance: I <I>am</I> their
 inheritance: and ye shall give them no possession in Israel: I
 <I>am</I> their possession.
 &nbsp; 29  They shall eat the meat offering, and the sin offering, and
 the trespass offering; and every dedicated thing in Israel shall
 be theirs.
 &nbsp; 30  And the first of all the firstfruits of all <I>things,</I> and
 every oblation of all, of every <I>sort</I> of your oblations, shall
 be the priest's: ye shall also give unto the priest the first of
 your dough, that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine
 house.
 &nbsp; 31  The priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of
 itself, or torn, whether it be fowl or beast.

 God's priests must be <I>regulars,</I> not <I>seculars;</I> and 
 therefore here are rules laid down for them to govern themselves by and 
 due encouragement given them to live up to those rules. Directions are 
 here given,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Concerning their clothes; they must wear <I>linen garments</I> when 
 they <I>went in to minister</I> or do any service in the inner court, 
 or in the sanctuary, and nothing that was <I>woollen,</I> because it 
 would <I>cause sweat,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.

 They must dress themselves cool, that they might go the more readily 
 about their work; and they had the more need to do so because they were 
 to attend the altars, which had constant fires upon them. And they must 
 dress themselves clean and sweet, and avoid every thing that was sweaty 
 and filthy, to signify the purity of mind with which the service of God 
 is to be attended to. Sweat came in with sin and was part of the
 curse. <I>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.</I> Clothes 
 came in with sin, coats of skins did; and therefore the priests must 
 use as little and as light clothing as possible, and not such as caused 
 sweat. When they had finished their service they must change their 
 clothes again, and lay up their linen garments in the chambers 
 appointed for that purpose, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>,
 
 as before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+42:14"><I>ch.</I> xlii. 14</A>.

 They must not go among the people with their holy garments on, lest
 they should imagine themselves sanctified by the touch of them; or, 
 <I>They shall sanctify the people,</I> that is (as it is explained,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+42:14"><I>ch.</I> xlii. 14</A>),

 they shall <I>approach to those things which are for the people,</I> in
 their ordinary <I>garments.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Concerning their hair; in that they must avoid extremes on both 
 hands 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>They must not shave their heads,</I> in imitation of the Gentile 
 priests, and as the priests of the Romish church do; nor, on the other 
 hand, must they <I>suffer their locks to grow long,</I> as the 
 <I>beaux,</I> or that they might be thought Nazarites, when really they 
 were not; but they must be grave and modest, must <I>poll their 
 heads</I> and keep their hair short. If a <I>man,</I> especially a 
 minister, wear <I>long hair,</I> it is not becoming 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:14">1 Cor. xi. 14</A>);

 it is effeminate.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Concerning their diet; they must be sure to <I>drink no wine</I> 
 when they went in to minister, lest they should rink to excess, should 
 drink and forget the law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 <I>It is not for kings to drink wine,</I> more than will do them good, 
 much less for priests. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+10:9,Pr+31:4,5">Lev. x. 9; Prov. xxxi. 4, 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Concerning their marriages,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Here they must consult the credit of their office, and not marry one 
 that had been <I>divorced,</I> that was at least under the suspicion of 
 immodesty, nor a <I>widow,</I> unless she were a priest's widow, that 
 had been accustomed to the usages of the priests' families. Others may 
 do that which ministers may not do, but must deny themselves in, in 
 honour of their character. Their wives as well as themselves must be of 
 good report.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Concerning their preaching and church-government. 

 1. It was part of their business to teach the people; and herein they
 must approve themselves both skilful and faithful

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>They shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the 
 profane,</I> between good and evil, lawful and unlawful, that they may 
 neither scruple what is lawful nor venture upon what is unlawful, that 
 they may not pollute what is holy nor pollute themselves with what is 
 profane. Ministers must take pains to cause <I>people to discern 
 between the clean and the unclean,</I> that they may not confound the 
 distinctions between right and wrong, nor mistake concerning them, so 
 as to <I>put darkness for light and light for darkness,</I> but may 
 have a good judgment of discretion concerning their own actions. 

 2. It was part of their business to judge upon appeals made to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:8,9">Deut. xvii. 8, 9</A>);

 and <I>in controversy they shall stand in judgment,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 They shall have the honesty to stand up for what is right, and, when 
 they have passed a right judgment, shall have the courage to stand to 
 it and stand by it. They must judge, not according to their own
 fancies, or inclinations, or secular interests, but <I>according to my 
 judgments;</I> that must be their rule and standard. Note, Ministers 
 must decide controversies according to the word of God, <I>to the law 
 and to the testimony. Sit liber judex--Let the judge be unbiased.</I> 
 Their business is to keep courts in God's name, to preside in the 
 congregations of his people. And herein they must go to the
 statute-book: They shall <I>keep my statutes in all my assemblies.</I> 
 God calls the assemblies of his people <I>his</I> assemblies, because 
 they are held in his name, to his glory. Ministers are the masters of 
 those assemblies, are to preside in them, and in all their acts must 
 keep close to God's laws. Another part of their work, as church 
 governors, is to <I>hallow God's sabbaths,</I> to do the public work of 
 that day with a becoming care and reverence, as the work of a holy day 
 should be done, and to see that God's people also sanctify that day and 
 do nothing to pollute it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Concerning their mourning for dead relations; the rule here agrees 
 with the law of Moses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+21:1,11">Lev. xxi. 1, 11</A>.

 A priest shall not come near any <I>dead body</I> (for they must be 
 purified <I>from dead works</I>) except of his next relations, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 
 Decent expressions of a pious sorrow for dear relations, when they are 
 removed by death, are not disagreeable to the character of a minister. 
 Yet by this approach to the dead body of a relation they contracted a 
 ceremonial pollution, from which they must be cleansed by a 
 <I>sin-offering</I> before they went in again to minister, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>.
 
 Note, Though sorrow for the dead is very allowable and commendable, yet 
 there is danger of sinning in it, either by excess or dissimulation; 
 and those tears have too often need to be <I>wept over again.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. Concerning their maintenance; they must live upon the altar at 
 which they served, and live comfortably 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 "<I>You shall give them no possession in Israel,</I> no lands or 
 tenements, lest they should be entangled with the affairs of this 
 life;" for God has said, <I>I am their inheritance,</I> and they need 
 no other in reserve; <I>I am their possession,</I> and they need no 
 other in hand. Some land was allowed them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+48:10"><I>ch.</I> xlviii. 10</A>),

 but their principal subsistence was by their office. What God
 appropriated to himself they were the receivers of, for their own 
 proper use and behoof; they lived upon the holy things, and so God 
 himself was the portion both of their inheritance and of their cup. 
 Note, Those who have God for their inheritance and their possession may 
 be content with a little, and ought not to covet a great deal of the 
 possessions and inheritances of this earth. If we have God, we have 
 <I>all;</I> and therefore may well reckon that we have enough.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What the priests were to have from the people, for their maintenance 
 and encouragement. 

 (1.) They must have the flesh of many of the offerings, the 
 <I>sin-offering and trespass-offering,</I> which would supply them and 
 their families with flesh-meat, and the <I>meat-offerings,</I> which 
 would supply them with bread. What we offer to God will redound to our 
 own advantage. 

 (2.) They must have every dedicated devoted thing in Israel, which was 
 in many cases to be turned into money and given to the priest. This is 
 explained,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 
 <I>Every oblation</I> or free-will offering (which in times of 
 reformation and devotion would be many and considerable) <I>of all, of 
 every sort of your oblations, shall be the priest's.</I> We have the 
 law concerning them 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+27:1-34">Lev. xxvii</A>.

 (3.) They were to have <I>the first of the dough</I> when it was going
 to the oven, as well as the first of their fruits when they were going 
 to the barn. God, who is the first, must have the first; and, if it 
 belong to him, his priests must have it. We may <I>then</I> comfortably 
 enjoy what we have, when a share of it has been first set apart for 
 works of piety and charity. To this the apostle's rule bears some 
 analogy, to <I>begin the week</I> with laying by for pious uses, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+16:2">1 Cor. xvi. 2</A>.

 The priests being so well provided for, it would be inexcusable in them
 if they (contrary to the law which every Israelite is bound by) should 
 <I>eat that which is torn or which died of itself,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.
 
 Those that were in want of necessary food might perhaps expect to be 
 dispensed with in such a case. Poverty has its temptations, but the 
 priests were so well provided for that they could have no pretence for 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What the people might expect from the priest for their recompence.
 Those that are kind to a prophet, to a priest, shall have a prophet's, 
 a priest's reward: <I>That he may cause the blessing to rest in thy 
 house</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 that God may cause it by commanding it, that the priest may cause it by 
 praying for it; and it was part of the priest's work to <I>bless the 
 people in the name of the Lord,</I> not only their congregations, but 
 their families. Note, It is all in all to the comfort of any house to 
 have the blessing of God upon it and to have the blessing to rest in 
 it, to dwell where we dwell and to attend the entail of it upon those 
 that shall come after us. And the way to have the blessing of God abide 
 upon our estates is to honour God with them, and to give him and his 
 ministers, him and his poor, their share out of them. God blesses, he 
 surely blesses, the habitation of those who are thus just, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:33">Prov. iii. 33</A>.
 
 And ministers, by instructing and praying for the families that are 
 kind to them, should do their part towards causing the blessing to rest 
 there. <I>Peace be to this house.</I></P>
