 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter goes on with that pathetic pleading prayer which the 
 church offered up to God in the latter part of the foregoing chapter. 
 They had argued from their covenant-relation to God and his interest 
 and concern in them; now here, 

 I. They pray that God would appear in some remarkable and surprising
 manner for them against his and their enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. They plead what God had formerly done, and was always ready to do,
 for his people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>.

 III. They confess themselves to be sinful and unworthy of God's favour,
 and that they had deserved the judgments they were now under, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>.
 
 IV. They refer themselves to the mercy of God as a Father, and submit
 themselves to his sovereignty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:8">ver. 8</A>.

 V. They represent the very deplorable condition they were in, and
 earnestly pray for the pardon of sin and the turning away of God's 
 anger, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:9-12">ver.  9-12</A>.

 And this was not only intended for the use of the captive Jews, but may 
 serve for direction to the church in other times of distress, what to 
 ask of God and how to plead with him.  Are God's people at any time in 
 affliction, in great affliction? Let them pray, let them thus pray.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest
 come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence,
 &nbsp; 2  As <I>when</I> the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the
 waters to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries,
 <I>that</I> the nations may tremble at thy presence!
 &nbsp; 3  When thou didst terrible things <I>which</I> we looked not for,
 thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence.
 &nbsp; 4  For since the beginning of the world <I>men</I> have not heard,
 nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God,
 beside thee, <I>what</I> he hath prepared for him that waiteth for
 him.
 &nbsp; 5  Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness,
 <I>those that</I> remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth;
 for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be
 saved.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. The petition is that God would appear wonderfully for them now, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:1,2"><I>v.</I>  1, 2</A>.

 Their case was represented in the close of the foregoing chapter as
 very sad and very hard, and in this case it was time to cry, "Help, 
 Lord; O that God would manifest his zeal and his strength!" They had 
 prayed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:15"><I>ch.</I> lxiii. 15</A>)

 that God would <I>look down from heaven;</I> here they pray that he
 would come down to deliver them, as he had said, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:8">Exod. iii. 8</A>.

 1. They desire that God would in his providence manifest himself both
 to them and for them. When God works some extraordinary deliverance for 
 his people he is said to <I>shine forth,</I> to show himself strong; 
 so, here, they pray that he would <I>rend the heavens and come 
 down,</I> as when he delivered David he is said to <I>bow the heavens, 
 and come down</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:9">Ps. xviii. 9</A>),

 to display his power, and justice, and goodness, in an extraordinary
 manner, so that all may take notice of them and acknowledge them. This 
 God's people desire and pray for, that they themselves having the 
 satisfaction of seeing him though his way be in the sea, others may be 
 made to see him when his way is in the clouds.  This is applicable to 
 the second coming of Christ, when <I>the Lord himself shall descend 
 from heaven with a shout. Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly.</I>

 2. They desire that he would vanquish all opposition and that it might 
 be made to give way before him: <I>That the mountains might flow down 
 at thy presence,</I> that the fire of thy wrath may burn so fiercely 
 against thy enemies as even to dissolve the rockiest mountains and melt 
 them down before it, as metal in the furnace, which is made liquid and 
 cast into what shape the operator pleases; so <I>the melting fire 
 burns,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Let things be put into a ferment, in order to a glorious revolution in
 favour of the church: <I>As the fire causes the waters to boil.</I> 
 There is an allusion here, some think, to the <I>volcanoes,</I> or 
 burning mountains, which sometimes send forth such sulphureous streams 
 as make the adjacent rivers and seas to boil, which, perhaps, are left 
 as sensible intimations of the power of God's wrath and warning--pieces 
 of the final conflagration. 

 3. They desire that this may tend very much to the glory and honour of
 God, <I>may make his name known,</I> not only to his friends (they knew 
 it before, and trusted in his power), but to his adversaries likewise, 
 that they may know it and <I>tremble at his presence,</I> and may say, 
 with the men of Bethshemesh, <I>Who is able to stand before this holy 
 Lord God? Who knows the power of his anger?</I> Note, Sooner or later 
 God will make his name known to his adversaries and force those to 
 <I>tremble at his presence</I> that would not come and worship in his 
 presence. God's name, if it be not a stronghold for us, into which we 
 may run and be safe, will be a strong-hold against us, out of the reach 
 of which we cannot run and be safe. The day will come when nations 
 shall be made to tremble at the presence of God, though they be ever so 
 numerous and strong.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The plea is that God had appeared wonderfully for his people 
 formerly; and <I>thou hast,</I> therefore <I>thou wilt,</I> is good 
 arguing at the throne of grace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:17">Ps.  x. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They plead what he had done for his people Israel in particular when 
 he brought them out of Egypt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 He then <I>did terrible things</I> in the plagues of Egypt, <I>which
 they looked not for;</I> they despaired of deliverance, so far were 
 they from any thought of being delivered with such a high hand and 
 outstretched arm. Then he came down upon Mount Sinai in such terror as 
 made that and the adjacent mountains to <I>flow down at his 
 presence,</I> to <I>skip like rams</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+114:4">Ps.  cxiv. 4</A>),

 to tremble, so that they were scattered and the perpetual hills were
 made to bow, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:6">Hab.  iii. 6</A>.

 In the many great salvations God wrought for that people he did
 <I>terrible things which they looked not for,</I> made great men, that
 seemed as stately and strong as mountains, to fall before him, and
 great opposition to give way. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:4,5,Ps+68:7,8">Judg. v. 4, 5; Ps.  lxviii. 7, 8</A>.

 Some refer this to the defeat of Sennacherib's powerful army, which was
 as surprising an instance of the divine power as the melting down of 
 rocks and mountains would be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They plead what God had been used to do, and had declared his 
 gracious purpose to do, for his people in general. The provision he has 
 made for the safety and happiness of his people, even of all those that 
 seek him, and serve him, and trust in him, is very rich and very ready, 
 so that they need not fear being either disappointed of it, for it is 
 sure, or disappointed in it, for it is sufficient.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) It is very rich, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Men have not heard nor seen what God has <I>prepared for those that
 wait for him.</I> Observe the character of God's people; they are such 
 as wait for him in the way of duty, wait for the salvation he has 
 promised and designed for them. Observe where the happiness of this 
 people is bound up; it is <I>what God has prepared for them,</I> what 
 he has designed for them in his counsel and is in his providence and 
 grace preparing for them and preparing them for, what he has 
 <I>done</I> or <I>will</I> do, so it may be read. Some of the Jewish 
 doctors have understood this of the blessings reserved for the days of 
 the Messiah, and to them the apostle applies these words; and others 
 extend them to the glories of the world to come. It is all that 
 goodness which God has <I>laid up for those that fear him, and wrought 
 for those that trust in him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:19">Ps. xxxi. 19</A>.

 Of this it is here said that <I>since the beginning of the world,</I>
 in the most prying and inquisitive ages of it, men have not, either by 
 hearing or seeing, the two learning senses, come to the full knowledge 
 of it. None have seen, nor heard, nor can understand, but God himself, 
 what the provision is that is made for the present and future felicity 
 of holy souls. For,

 [1.] Much of it was concealed in former ages; they knew it not, because 
 the <I>unsearchable riches of Christ</I> were <I>hidden in God,</I> 
 were <I>hidden from the wise and prudent;</I> but in latter ages they 
 were revealed by the gospel; so the apostle applies this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:9">1 Cor. ii. 9</A>),
 
 for it follows
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 <I>But God has revealed them unto us by his Spirit;</I> compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:25,Eph+3:9">Rom. xvi. 25, 26, with Eph. iii. 9</A>.

 That which men had not heard <I>since the beginning of the world</I>
 they should hear before the end of it, and at the end of it should see, 
 when the veil shall be rent to introduce the glory that is yet to be 
 revealed.  God himself knew what he had in store for believers, but 
 none knew besides him.

 [2.] It cannot be fully comprehended by the human understanding, no, 
 not when it is revealed; it is spiritual, and refined from those ideas 
 which our minds are most apt to receive in this world of sense; it is 
 very great, and will far outdo the utmost of our expectations.  Even 
 the present peace of believers, much more their future bliss, is such 
 as surpasses all conception and expression, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:7">Phil.  iv. 7</A>.

 None can comprehend it but God himself, whose understanding is
 infinite. Some give another reading of these words, referring the 
 transcendency, not so much to the work itself as to the author of it: 
 <I>Neither has the eye seen a god besides thee, who doth so</I> (or has 
 done or can do so) <I>for him that waits for him.</I> We must infer 
 from God's works of wonderous grace, as well as from his works of 
 wondrous power, from the kind things, as well as from the great things, 
 he does, that there is <I>no god like him,</I> nor any among the sons 
 of the mighty to be compared with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It is very ready 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>Thou meetest him that rejoices and works righteousness,</I> meetest 
 him with that good which thou hast prepared for him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 and dost not forget <I>those that remember thee in thy ways.</I>" See 
 here what communion there is between a gracious God and a gracious 
 soul.

 [1.] What God expects from us, in order to our having communion with 
 him. <I>First,</I> We must make conscience of doing our duty in every 
 thing, we must <I>work righteousness,</I> must do that which is good 
 and which the Lord our God requires of us, and must do it well. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> We must be cheerful in doing our duty, we must 
 <I>rejoice and work righteousness,</I> must delight ourselves in God 
 and in his law, must be cheerful in his service and sing at our work. 
 God loves a cheerful giver, a cheerful worshipper. We must <I>serve the 
 Lord with gladness.  Thirdly,</I> We must conform ourselves to all the 
 methods of his providence concerning us and be suitably affected with 
 them, must <I>remember him in his ways,</I> in all the ways wherein he 
 walks, whether he walks towards us or walks contrary to us. We must 
 mind him and make mention of him with thanksgiving when his ways are 
 ways of mercy (<I>in a day of prosperity be joyful</I>), with patience 
 and submission when he contends with us. <I>In the way of thy judgments 
 we have waited for thee;</I> for <I>in a day of adversity</I> we must 
 <I>consider.</I> 

 [2.] We are here told what we may expect from God if we thus attend him 
 in the way of duty: <I>Thou meetest him.</I> This intimates the 
 friendship, fellowship, and familiarity to which God admits his people; 
 he meets them, to converse with them, to manifest himself to them, and 
 to receive their addresses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:24.29:43">Exod. xx. 24; xxix. 43</A>.

 It likewise intimates his freeness and forwardness in doing them good;
 he will <I>anticipate them with the blessings of his goodness,</I> will 
 <I>rejoice to do good</I> to those that <I>rejoice in working 
 righteousness,</I> and wait to be gracious to those that <I>wait for 
 him.</I> He meets his penitent people with a pardon, as the father of 
 the prodigal met his returning son, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:20">Luke xv. 20</A>.

 He meets his praying people with an answer of peace, while they are yet
 speaking,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:24"><I>ch.</I> lxv. 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They plead the unchangeableness of God's favour and the stability of 
 his promise, notwithstanding the sins of his people and his displeasure 
 against them for their sins: "<I>Behold, thou hast</I> many a time 
 <I>been wroth with us because we have sinned,</I> and we have been 
 under the tokens of thy wrath; <I>but in those,</I> those ways of 
 thine, the ways of mercy in which we have <I>remembered thee, in those 
 is continuance,</I>" or "<I>in those thou art ever</I>" (his mercy 
 endures for ever), "<I>and</I> therefore <I>we shall</I> at last <I>be 
 saved,</I> though thou art wroth, and we have sinned." This agrees with 
 the tenour of God's covenant, that, if we <I>forsake the law,</I> he 
 will <I>visit our transgression with a rod,</I> but <I>his loving 
 kindness</I> he <I>will not utterly take away, his covenant he will not 
 break</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:30">Ps. lxxxix. 30</A>,

 &c.), and by this his people have been many a time saved from ruin when
 they were just upon the brink of it; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:38">Ps.  lxxviii. 38</A>.

 And by this continuance of the covenant we hope to be saved, for its
 being an everlasting covenant is all our salvation. Though God has been 
 angry with us for our sins, and justly, yet his anger has endured but 
 for a moment and has been soon over; but <I>in his favour is life,</I> 
 because <I>in it is continuance;</I> in the ways of his favour he 
 proceeds and perseveres, and on that we depend for our salvation, see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:7,8"><I>ch.</I> liv. 7, 8</A>.

 It is well for us that our hopes of salvation are built not upon any
 merit or sufficiency of our own (for in that there is no certainty, 
 even Adam in innocency did not abide), but upon God's mercies and 
 promises, for <I>in those,</I> we are sure, <I>is continuance.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  But we are all as an unclean <I>thing,</I> and all our

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As we have the Lamentations of Jeremiah, so here we have the 
 Lamentations of Isaiah; the subject of both is the same--the destruction
 of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans and the sin of Israel that brought that 
 destruction--only with this difference, Isaiah sees it at a distance and
 laments it by the Spirit of prophecy, Jeremiah saw it accomplished. In 
 these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The people of God in their affliction confess and bewail their sins, 
 thereby justifying God in their afflictions, owning themselves unworthy 
 of his mercy, and thereby both improving their troubles and preparing 
 for deliverance. Now that they were under divine rebukes for sin they 
 had nothing to trust to but the mere mercy of God and the continuance 
 of that; for among themselves there is none to help, none to uphold, 
 none to stand in the gap and make intercession, for they are all 
 polluted with sin and therefore unworthy to intercede, all careless and 
 remiss in duty and therefore unable and unfit to intercede.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. There was a general corruption of manners among them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>We are all as an unclean thing,</I> or as an unclean <I>person,</I> 
 as one overspread with a leprosy, who was to be shut out of the camp. 
 The body of the people were like one under a ceremonial pollution, who 
 was not admitted into the courts of the tabernacle, or like one 
 labouring under some loathsome disease, from the crown of the head to 
 the sole of the foot <I>nothing but wounds and bruises,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:6"><I>ch.</I> i. 6</A>.

 We have all by sin become not only obnoxious to God's justice, but
 odious to his holiness; for sin is that <I>abominable thing which the 
 Lord hates,</I> and cannot endure to look upon. <I>Even all our 
 righteousnesses are as filthy rags.</I> 

 (1.) "The best of our persons are so; we are all so corrupt and 
 polluted that even those among us who pass for righteous men, in 
 comparison with what our fathers were who <I>rejoiced and wrought 
 righteousness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 are but as filthy rags, fit to be case to the dunghill. <I>The best of 
 them is as a brier.</I>"

 (2.) "The best of our performances are so. There is not only a general 
 corruption of manners, but a general defection in the exercises of 
 devotion too; those which pass for the <I>sacrifices of 
 righteousness,</I> when they come to be enquired into, are <I>the torn, 
 and the lame, and the sick,</I> and therefore are provoking to God, as 
 nauseous as filthy rags." Our performances, though they be ever so 
 plausible, if we depend upon them as our righteousness and think to 
 merit by them at God's hand, are as filthy rags--rags, and will not 
 cover us--filthy rags, and will but defile us. True penitents cast away 
 their idols as filthy rags

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:22"><I>ch.</I> xxx. 22</A>),

 odious in their sight; here they acknowledge even their righteousness
 to be so in God's sight if he should deal with them in strict justice. 
 Our best duties are so defective, and so far short of the rule, that 
 they are as rags, and so full of sin and corruption cleaving to them 
 that they are as filthy rags. When we would do good evil is present 
 with us; and the iniquity of our holy things would be our ruin if we 
 were under the law.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. There was a general coldness of devotion among them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The measure was filled by the abounding iniquity of the people, and
 nothing was done to empty it.

 (1.) Prayer was in a manner neglected: "<I>There is none that calls on 
 thy name,</I> none that seeks to thee for grace to reform us and take 
 away sin, or for mercy to relieve us and take away the judgments which 
 our sins have brought upon us." <I>Therefore</I> people are so bad, 
 because they do not pray; compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:3,4">Ps. xiv. 3, 4</A>,

 <I>They have altogether become filthy, for they call not upon the
 Lord.</I> It bodes ill to a people when prayer is restrained among 
 them.

 (2.) It was very negligently performed. If there was here and there one 
 that called on God's name, it was with a great deal of indifferency: 
 <I>There is none that stirs up himself to take hold of God.</I> Note,

 [1.] To pray is to <I>take hold of God,</I> by faith to take hold of 
 the promises and the declarations God has made of his good-will to us 
 and to plead them with him,--to take hold of him as of one who is about 
 to depart from us, earnestly begging of him not to leave us, or of one 
 that has departed, soliciting his return,--to take hold of him as he 
 that wrestles takes hold of him he wrestles with; for the seed of Jacob 
 wrestle with him and so prevail. But when we <I>take hold of God</I> it 
 is as the boatman with his hook takes hold on the shore, as if he would 
 pull the shore to him, but really it is to pull himself to the shore; 
 so we pray, not to bring God to our mind, but to bring ourselves to 
 him. 

 [2.] Those that would take hold of God in prayer so as to prevail with 
 him must stir up themselves to do it; all that is within us must be 
 employed in the duty (and all little enough), our thoughts fixed and 
 our affections flaming. In order hereunto all that is within us must be 
 engaged and summoned into the service; we must <I>stir up the gift that 
 is in us</I> by an actual consideration of the importance of the work 
 that is before us and a close application of mind to it; but how can we 
 expect that God should come to us in ways of mercy when there are none 
 that do this, when those that profess to be intercessors are mere 
 triflers?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They acknowledge their afflictions to be the fruit and product of 
 their own sins and God's wrath. 

 1. They brought their troubles upon themselves by their own folly:
 "<I>We are all as an unclean thing, and</I> therefore <I>we do all fade 
 away as a leaf</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 we not only wither and lose our beauty, but we fall and drop off" (so 
 the word signifies) "as leaves in autumn; our profession of religion 
 withers, and we grow dry and sapless; our prosperity withers and comes 
 to nothing; we fall to the ground, as despicable and contemptible; and 
 then <I>our iniquities like the wind have taken us away</I> and hurried 
 us into captivity, as the winds in autumn blow off, and then blow away, 
 the faded withered leaves," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:3,4">Ps. i. 3, 4</A>.

 Sinners are blasted, and then carried away, by the malignant and 
 violent wind of their own iniquity; it withers them and then ruins 
 them.

 2. God brought their troubles upon them by his wrath

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Thou hast hidden thy face from us;</I> hast been displeased with us 
 and refused to afford us any succour. When they made themselves <I>as 
 an unclean thing</I> no wonder that God turned his face away from them, 
 as loathing them. Yet this was not all: <I>Thou hast consumed us 
 because of our iniquities.</I> This is the same complaint with that 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:7,8">Ps. xc. 7, 8</A>),

 <I>We are consumed by thy anger;</I> thou hast <I>melted us,</I> so the
 word is. God had put them in the furnace, not to consume them as dross, 
 but to melt them as gold, that they might be refined and new-cast.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They claim relation to God as their God, and humbly plead it with 
 him, and in consideration of it cheerfully refer themselves to him 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:8"><I>v.</I>  8</A>):

 "<I>But now, O Lord! thou art our Father:</I> though we have conducted 
 ourselves very undutifully and ungratefully towards thee, yet still we 
 have owned thee as our Father; and, though thou hast corrected us, yet 
 thou hast not cast us off. Foolish and careless as we are, poor and 
 despised and trampled upon as we are by our enemies, yet still <I>thou 
 art our Father;</I> to thee therefore we return in our repentance, as 
 the prodigal arose and came to his father; to thee we address ourselves 
 by prayer; from whom should we expect relief and succour but from our 
 Father? It is the wrath of a Father that we are under, who will be 
 reconciled and not <I>keep his anger for ever.</I>" God is their 
 Father, 

 1. By creation; he gave them their being, formed them into a people,
 shaped them as he pleased: "<I>We are the clay and thou our potter,</I> 
 therefore we will not quarrel with thee, however thou art pleased to 
 deal with us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:6">Jer. xviii. 6</A>.

 Nay, therefore we will hope that thou wilt deal well with us, that thou
 who madest us wilt new-make us, new-form us, though we have unmade and 
 deformed ourselves: <I>We are all as an unclean thing,</I> but <I>we 
 are all the work of thy hands,</I> therefore do away our uncleanness, 
 that we may be fit for thy use, the use we were made for. We are the 
 <I>work of thy hands,</I> therefore <I>forsake us not,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+138:8">Ps. cxxxviii. 8</A>.

 2. By covenant; this is pleaded

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>Behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy people,</I> all the 
 people thou hast in the world, that make open profession of thy name. 
 We are called <I>thy people,</I> our neighbours look upon us as such, 
 and therefore what we suffer reflects upon thee, and the relief that 
 our case requires is expected from thee. <I>We are thy people;</I> and 
 <I>should not a people seek unto their God?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:19"><I>ch.</I> viii. 19</A>.

 <I>We are thine; save us,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:94">Ps. cxix. 94</A>.

 Note, When we are under providential rebukes from God it is good to
 keep fast hold of our covenant-relation to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. They are importunate with God for the turning away of his anger and 
 the pardoning of their sins 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>Be not wroth very sore, O Lord!</I> though we have deserved that 
 thou shouldst, <I>neither remember iniquity for ever</I> against us." 
 They do not expressly pray for the removal of the judgment they were 
 under; as to that, they refer themselves to God. But, 

 1. They pray that God would be reconciled to them, and then they can be
 easy whether the affliction be continued or removed: "<I>Be not wroth 
 to extremity,</I> but let thy anger be mitigated by the clemency and 
 compassion of a father." They do not say, <I>Lord, rebuke us not,</I> 
 for that may be necessary, but <I>Not in thy anger, not in thy hot 
 displeasure.</I> It is but <I>in a little wrath</I> that God <I>hides 
 his face.</I> 

 2. They pray that they may not be dealt with according to the desert of 
 their sin: <I>Neither remember iniquity for ever.</I> Such is the evil 
 of sin that it deserves to be remembered for ever; and this is that 
 which they deprecate, that consequence of sin, which is for ever. Those 
 make it to appear that they are truly humbled under the hand of God who 
 are more afraid of the terror of God's wrath, and the fatal 
 consequences of their own sin, than of any judgment whatsoever, looking 
 upon these as the sting of death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. They lodge in the court of heaven a very melancholy representation, 
 or memorial, of the lamentable condition they were in and the ruins 
 they were groaning under. 
 
 1. Their own houses were in ruins,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 The cities of Judah were destroyed by the Chaldeans and the inhabitants
 of them were carried away, so that there was none to repair them or 
 take any notice of them, which would in a few years make them look like 
 perfect deserts: <I>Thy holy cities are a wilderness.</I> The cities of 
 Judah are called <I>holy cities,</I> for the people were unto God a 
 kingdom of priests. The cities had synagogues in them, in which God was 
 served; and therefore they lamented the ruins of them, and insisted 
 upon this in pleading with God for them, not so much that they were 
 stately cities, rich or ancient ones, but that they were holy cities, 
 cities in which God's name was known, professed, and called upon.  
 "These cities are a wilderness; the beauty of them is sullied; they are 
 neither inhabited nor visited, as formerly. <I>They have burnt up all 
 the synagogues of God in the land,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:8">Ps. lxxiv. 8</A>.

 Nor was it only the smaller cities that were thus left as a wilderness
 unfrequented, but even "<I>Zion is a wilderness;</I> the city of David 
 itself lies in ruins; Jerusalem, that was <I>beautiful for 
 situation</I> and <I>the joy of the whole earth,</I> is now deformed, 
 and has become the scorn and scandal of the whole earth; that noble 
 city is a desolation, a heap of rubbish." See what devastations sin 
 brings upon a people; and an external profession of sanctity will be no 
 fence against them; <I>holy cities,</I> if they become wicked cities, 
 will be soonest of all turned into a wilderness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:2">Amos iii. 2</A>.
 
 2. God's house was in ruins,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 This they lament most of all, that <I>the temple was burnt with
 fire;</I> but, as soon as it was built, they were told what their sin 
 would bring it to. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+7:21">2 Chron. vii. 21</A>,

 <I>This house, which is high, shall be an astonishment.</I> Observe how
 pathetically they bewail the ruins of the temple.

 (1.) It was <I>their holy and beautiful house;</I> it was a most 
 sumptuous building, but the holiness of it was in their eye the 
 greatest beauty of it, and consequently the profanation of it was the 
 saddest part of its desolation and that which grieved them most, that 
 the sacred services which used to be performed there were discontinued.  
 
 (2.) It was the place <I>where their fathers praised God</I> with their 
 sacrifices and songs; what a pity is it that that should lie in ashes 
 which had been for so many ages the glory of their nation! It 
 aggravated their present disuse of the songs of Zion that their fathers 
 had so often praised God with them. They interest God in the cause when 
 they plead that it was the house where <I>he had been praised,</I> and 
 put him in mind too of his covenant with their fathers by taking notice 
 of their fathers' praising him. 

 (3.) With it <I>all their pleasant things were laid waste,</I> all 
 their desires and delights, all those things which were employed by 
 them in the service of God, which they had a great delight in; not only 
 the furniture of the temple, the altars and table, but especially the 
 sabbaths and new moons, and all their religious feasts, which they used 
 to keep with gladness, their ministers and solemn assemblies, these 
 were all a desolation. Note, God's people reckon their sacred things 
 their most delectable things; rob them of holy ordinances and the means 
 of grace, and you <I>lay waste all their pleasant things.</I> What have 
 they more? Observe here how God and his people have their interest 
 twisted and interchanged; when they speak of the cities for their own 
 habitation they call them <I>thy holy cities,</I> for to God they were 
 dedicated; when they speak of the temple wherein God dwelt they call it 
 <I>our beautiful</I> house and its furniture <I>our pleasant 
 things,</I> for they had heartily espoused it and all the interests of 
 it. If thus we interest God in all our concerns by devoting them to his 
 service, and interest ourselves in all his concerns by laying them near 
 our hearts, we may with satisfaction leave both with him, for he will 
 perfect both.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. They conclude with an affectionate expostulation, humbly arguing 
 with God concerning their present desolations 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 "<I>Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things?</I> Or, <I>Canst thou 
 contain thyself at these things?</I> Canst thou see thy temple ruined 
 and not resent it, not revenge it? Has the jealous God forgotten to be 
 jealous? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:22">Ps.  lxxiv. 22</A>,

 <I>Arise, O God! plead thy own cause.</I> Lord, thou art insulted, thou
 art blasphemed; and <I>wilt thou hold thy peace</I> and take no notice 
 of it?  Shall the highest affronts that can be done to Heaven pass 
 unrebuked?" When we are abused we hold our peace, because vengeance 
 does not belong to us, and because we have a God to refer our cause to. 
 When God is injured in his honour it may justly be expected that he 
 should speak in the vindication of it; his people prescribe not to him 
 what he shall say, but their prayer is (as here) 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:1">Ps. lxxxiii. 1</A>,

 <I>Keep not thou silence, O God!</I> and 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+109:1">Ps. cix. 1</A>,

 "<I>Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise!</I> Speak for the
 conviction of thy enemies, speak for the comfort and relief of thy 
 people; for <I>wilt thou afflict us very grievously,</I> or <I>afflict 
 us for ever?</I>" It is a sore affliction to good people to see God's 
 sanctuary laid waste and nothing done towards the raising of it out of 
 its ruins. But God has said that he <I>will not contend for ever,</I> 
 and therefore his people may depend upon it that their afflictions 
 shall be neither to extremity nor to eternity, but <I>light</I> and 
 <I>for a moment.</I></P>
