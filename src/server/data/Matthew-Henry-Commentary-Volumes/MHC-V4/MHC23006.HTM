 Hitherto, it should seem, Isaiah had prophesied as a candidate, having 
 only a virtual and tacit commission; but here we have him (if I may so 
 speak) solemnly ordained and set apart to the prophetic office by a 
 more express or explicit commission, as his work grew more upon his 
 hands: or perhaps, having seen little success of his ministry, he began
 to think of giving it up; and therefore God saw fit to renew his 
 commission here in this chapter, in such a manner as might excite and 
 encourage his zeal and industry in the execution of it, though he 
 seemed to labour in vain. In this chapter we have, 

 I. A very awful vision which Isaiah saw of the glory of God
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>),
 
 the terror it put him into 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:5">ver. 5</A>), 

 and the relief given him against that terror by an assurance of the 
 pardon of his sins, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>.

 II. A very awful commission which Isaiah received to go as a prophet,
 in God's name

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:8">ver. 8</A>),

 by his preaching to harden the impenitent in sin and ripen them for
 ruin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:9-12">ver. 9-12</A>)

 yet with a reservation of mercy for a remnant,

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:13">ver. 13</A>).

 And it was as to an evangelical prophet that these things were shown
 him and said to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting
 upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the
 temple.
 &nbsp; 2  Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with
 twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet,
 and with twain he did fly.
 &nbsp; 3  And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, <I>is</I>
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts: the whole earth <I>is</I> full of his glory.
 &nbsp; 4  And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that
 cried, and the house was filled with smoke.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The vision which Isaiah saw when he was, as is said of Samuel,
 <I>established to be a prophet of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:20">1 Sam. iii. 20</A>),

 was intended,

 1. To confirm his faith, that he might himself be abundantly satisfied
 of the truth of those things which should afterwards be made known to 
 him. This God opened the communications of himself to him; but such 
 visions needed not to be afterwards repeated upon every revelation. 
 Thus God appeared at first as a God of glory to Abraham 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:2">Acts vii. 2</A>),

 and to Moses,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:2">Exod. iii. 2</A>.

 Ezekiel's prophecies and St. John's, begin with visions of the divine
 glory. 

 2. To work upon his affections, that he might be possessed with such a
 reverence of God as would both quicken him and fix him to his service. 
 Those who are to teach others the knowledge of God ought to be well 
 acquainted with him themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The vision is dated, for the greater certainty of it. It was <I>in the 
 year that king Uzziah died,</I> who had reigned, for the most part, as 
 prosperously and well as any of the kings of Judah, and reigned very 
 long, above fifty years. About the time that he died, Isaiah saw this 
 vision of God upon a throne; for when the breath of princes goes forth, 
 and they return to their earth, this is our comfort, that <I>the Lord 
 shall reign for ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+146:3,4,10">Ps. cxlvi. 3, 4, 10</A>.

 Israel's king dies, but Israel's God still lives. From the mortality of
 great and good men we should take occasion to look up with an eye of 
 faith to the King eternal, immortal. King Uzziah died under a cloud, 
 for he was shut up as a leper till the day of his death. As the lives 
 of princes have their periods, so their glory is often eclipsed; but, 
 as God is everliving, so his glory is everlasting. King Uzziah dies in 
 an hospital, but the King of kings still sits upon his throne.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 What the prophet here saw is revealed to us, that we, mixing faith with 
 that revelation, may in it, as in a glass, behold the glory of the 
 Lord; let us turn aside therefore, and see this great sight with humble 
 reverence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. See God upon his throne, and that throne <I>high and lifted up,</I> 
 not only above other thrones, as it transcends them, but over other 
 thrones, as it rules and commands them. Isaiah saw not 
 <I>Jehovah</I>--the essence of God (no man has seen that, or can see
 it), but <I>Adonai</I>--his dominion. He saw the Lord Jesus; so this
 vision is explained 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:41">John xii. 41</A>,

 that Isaiah now saw Christ's glory and spoke of him, which is an
 incontestable proof of the divinity of our Saviour. He it is who when, 
 after his resurrection, he sat down on the right hand of God, did but 
 sit down where he was before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:5">John xvii. 5</A>.

 See the rest of the Eternal Mind: Isaiah <I>saw the Lord sitting,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+29:10">Ps. xxix. 10</A>.

 See the sovereignty of the Eternal Monarch: he sits <I>upon a
 throne</I>--a throne of glory, before which we must worship,--a throne 
 of government, under which we must be subject,--and a throne of grace, 
 to which we may come boldly. This throne is high, and lifted up above 
 all competition and contradiction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. See his temple, his church on earth, filled with the manifestations 
 of his glory. His throne being erected at the door of the temple (as 
 princes sat in judgment at the gates), <I>his train,</I> the skirts of 
 his robes, <I>filled the temple,</I> the whole world (for it is all 
 God's temple, and, as the heaven is his throne, so the earth is his 
 footstool), or rather the church, which is filled enriched, and 
 beautified with the tokens of God's special presence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. See the bright and blessed attendants on his throne, in and by 
 whom his glory is celebrated and his government served 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>Above the throne,</I> as it were hovering about it, or nigh to the
 throne, bowing before it, with an eye to it, <I>the seraphim stood,</I> 
 the holy angels, who are called <I>seraphim-burners;</I> for he 
 <I>makes his ministers a flaming fire,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:4">Ps. civ. 4</A>.

 They burn in love to God, and zeal for his glory and against sin, and
 he makes use of them as instruments of his wrath when he is a consuming 
 fire to his enemies. Whether they were only two or four, or (as I
 rather think) an <I>innumerable company of angels,</I> that Isaiah saw, 
 is uncertain; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:10">Dan. vii. 10</A>.

 Note, It is the glory of the angels that they are seraphim, have heat
 proportionable to their light, have abundance, not only of divine 
 knowledge, but of holy love. Special notice is taken of their wings 
 (and of no other part of their appearance), because of the use they 
 made of them, which is designed for instruction to us. They had <I>each 
 of them six wings,</I> not stretched upwards (as those whom Ezekiel 
 saw,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:11"><I>ch.</I> i. 11</A>),
 
 but, 

 1. Four were made use of for a covering, as the wings of a fowl,
 sitting, are; with the two upper wings, next to the head, they covered 
 their faces, and with the two lowest wings they covered their feet, or 
 lower parts. This bespeaks their great humility and reverence in their 
 attendance upon God, for he is greatly feared in <I>the assembly of 
 those saints,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:7">Ps. lxxxix. 7</A>.

 They not only cover their feet, those members of the body which are
 less honourable 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:23">1 Cor. xii. 23</A>),

 but even their faces. Though angel's faces, doubtless, are much fairer
 than those of the children of men

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:15">Acts vi. 15</A>),

 yet in the presence of God, they cover them, because they cannot bear
 the dazzling lustre of the divine glory, and because, being conscious 
 of an infinite distance from the divine perfection, they are ashamed to 
 show their faces before the holy God, who <I>charges even his angels 
 with folly</I> if they should offer to vie with him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:18">Job iv. 18</A>.

 If angels be thus reverent in their attendance on God, with what godly
 fear should we approach his throne! Else we do not the will of God as
 the angels do it. Yet Moses, when he went into the mount with God, took 
 the veil from off his face. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:18">2 Cor. iii. 18</A>.

 2. Two were made use of for flight; when they are sent on God's errands
 they fly swiftly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:21">Dan. ix. 21</A>),

 more swiftly with their own wings than if they flew on the wings of the
 wind. This teaches us to do the work of God with cheerfulness and 
 expedition. Do angels come upon the wing from heaven to earth, to 
 minister for our good, and shall not we soar upon the wing from earth 
 to heaven, to share with them in their glory?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:36">Luke xx. 36</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Hear the anthem, or song of praise, which the angels sing to the
 honour of him that sits on the throne, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How this song was sung. With zeal and fervency--<I>they cried</I>
 aloud; and with unanimity--<I>they cried to another,</I> or one with
 another; they sang alternately, but in concert, and without the least 
 jarring voice to interrupt the harmony.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What the song was; it is the same with that which is sung by the 
 four living creatures, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:8">Rev. iv. 8</A>.

 Note, Praising God always was, and will be to eternity, the work of
 heaven, and the constant employment of blessed spirits above,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:4">Ps. lxxxiv. 4</A>.

 Note further, The church above is the same in its praises; there is no
 change of times or notes there. Two things the seraphim here give God 
 the praise of:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) His infinite perfections in himself. Here is one of his most
 glorious titles praised: he is <I>the Lord of hosts,</I> of their 
 hosts, of all hosts; and one of his most glorious attributes, his 
 holiness, without which his being the Lord of hosts (or, as it is in 
 the parallel place, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:8">Rev. iv. 8</A>,

 <I>the Lord God Almighty</I>) could not be so much as it is the matter
 of our joy and praise; for power, without purity to guide it, would be 
 a terror to mankind. None of all the divine attributes is so celebrated 
 in scripture as this is. God's power was spoken twice

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:11">Ps. lxii. 11</A>),

 but his holiness thrice, <I>Holy, holy, holy.</I> This bespeaks,

 [1.] The zeal and fervency of the angels in praising God; they even 
 want words to express themselves, and therefore repeat the same again. 
 
 [2.] The particular pleasure they take in contemplating the holiness of 
 God; this is a subject they love to dwell upon, to harp upon, and are 
 loth to leave. 

 [3.] The superlative excellency of God's holiness, above that of the 
 purest creatures. He is holy, thrice holy, infinitely holy, originally, 
 perfectly, and eternally so. 

 [4.] It may refer to the three person in the Godhead, Holy Father, Holy 
 Son, and Holy Spirit (for it follows, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>,

 <I>Who will go for us?</I>) or perhaps to <I>that which was, and is,
 and is to come;</I> for that title of God's honour is added to this 
 song,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:8">Rev. iv. 8</A>.

 Some make the angels here to applaud the equity of that sentence which
 God was now about to pronounce upon the Jewish nation. Herein he was, 
 and is, and will be, holy; his ways are equal.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The manifestation of these to the children of men: <I>The earth is 
 full of his glory,</I> the glory of his power and purity; for he is 
 holy in all his works, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:17">Ps. cxlv. 17</A>.

 The Jews thought the glory of God should be confined to their land; but
 it is here intimated that in the gospel times (which are pointed to in 
 this chapter) the glory of God should fill all the earth, the glory of 
 his holiness, which is indeed the glory of all his other attributes; 
 this then <I>filled the temple</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 but, in the latter days, the earth shall be full of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Observe the marks and tokens of terror with which the temple was 
 filled, upon this vision of the divine glory, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 1. The house was <I>shaken;</I> not only the door, but even <I>the
 posts of the door,</I> which were firmly fixed, <I>moved at the voice 
 of him that cried,</I> at the voice of God, who called to judgment 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:4">Ps. l. 4</A>),

 at the voice of the angel, who praised him. There are voices in heaven
 sufficient to drown all the noises of the many waters in this lower 
 world,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+93:3,4">Ps. xciii. 3, 4</A>.

 This violent concussion of the temple was an indication of God's wrath
 and displeasure against the people for their sins; it was an earnest of 
 the destruction of it and the city by the Babylonians first, and 
 afterwards by the Romans; and it was designed to strike an awe upon us. 
 Shall walls and posts tremble before God, and shall we not tremble?

 2. The house was <I>darkened;</I> it was <I>filled with smoke,</I>
 which was as a <I>cloud spread</I> upon <I>the face of his throne</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+26:9">Job xxvi. 9</A>);

 we cannot take a full view of it, nor order our speech concerning it,
 by reason of darkness. In the temple above there will be no smoke, but 
 everything will be seen clearly. There God dwells in light; here he 
 <I>makes darkness his pavilion,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+6:1">2 Chron. vi. 1</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  Then said I, Woe <I>is</I> me! for I am undone; because I <I>am</I> a
 man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of
 unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of
 hosts.
 &nbsp; 6  Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in
 his hand, <I>which</I> he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:
 &nbsp; 7  And he laid <I>it</I> upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath
 touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin
 purged.
 &nbsp; 8  Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I
 send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here <I>am</I> I; send me.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Our curiosity would lead us to enquire further concerning the seraphim, 
 their songs and their services; but here we leave them, and must attend 
 to what passed between God and his prophet. <I>Secret things belong not 
 to us,</I> the secret things of the world of angels, but things 
 revealed to and by the prophets, which concern the administration of 
 God's kingdom among men. Now here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The consternation that the prophet was put into by the vision which 
 he saw of the glory of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Then said I, Woe is me!</I> I should have said, "Blessed art thou,
 who hast been thus highly favoured, highly honoured, and dignified, for 
 a time, with the privilege of those glorious beings that <I>always 
 behold the face of our Father.</I> Blessed were those eyes which saw 
 the Lord sitting on his throne, and those ears which heard the angels' 
 praises." And, one would think, he should have said, "Happy am I, for 
 ever happy; nothing now shall trouble me, nothing make me blush or 
 tremble;" but, on the contrary, he cries out, "<I>Woe is me! for I am 
 undone.</I> Alas for me! I am a gone man; <I>I shall surely die</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:22,Jdg+6:22">Judges xiii. 22; vi. 22</A>);

 I am silenced; I am struck dumb, struck dead." Thus Daniel, when he
 heard the words of the angel, <I>became dumb,</I> and there was <I>no 
 strength, no breath, left in him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:15,17">Dan. x. 15, 17</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What the prophet reflected upon in himself which terrified him: 
 "<I>I am undone</I> if God deal with me in strict justice, for I have 
 made myself obnoxious to his displeasure, <I>because I am a man of 
 unclean lips.</I>" Some think he refers particularly to some rash word 
 he had spoken, or to his sinful silence in not reproving sin with the 
 boldness and freedom that were necessary--a sin which God's ministers
 have too much cause to charge themselves with, and to blush at the 
 remembrance of. But it may be taken more generally; <I>I am a 
 sinner;</I> particularly, <I>I have offended in word;</I> and who is 
 there that hath not? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:2">Jam. iii. 2</A>.

 We all have reason to bewail it before the Lord,

 (1.) That we are of unclean lips ourselves; our lips are not 
 consecrated to God; he had not had the <I>first-fruits of our lips</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:15">Heb. xiii. 15</A>),

 and therefore they are counted common and unclean, <I>uncircumcised
 lips,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:30">Exod. vi. 30</A>.

 Nay, they have been polluted with sin. We have spoken the language of
 an unclean heart, that evil communication which corrupts good manners, 
 and whereby many have been defiled. We are unworthy and unmeet to take 
 God's name into our lips. With what a pure lip did the angels praise
 God! "But," says the prophet, "I cannot praise him so, for <I>I am a 
 man of unclean lips.</I>" The best men in the world have reason to be 
 ashamed of themselves, and the best of their services, when they come 
 into comparison with the holy angels. The angels had celebrated the 
 purity and holiness of God; and therefore the prophet, when he reflects 
 upon sin, calls it <I>uncleanness;</I> for the sinfulness of sin is its 
 contrariety to the holy nature of God, and upon that account especially 
 it should appear both hateful and frightful to us. The impurity of our 
 lips ought to be the grief of our souls, for by our words we shall be 
 justified or condemned.

 (2.) That we dwell among those who are so too. We have reason to
 lament not only that we ourselves are polluted, but that the nature and 
 race of mankind are so; the disease is hereditary and epidemic, which 
 is so far from lessening our guilt that it should rather increase our 
 grief, especially considering that we have not done what we might have 
 done for the cleansing of the pollution of other people's lips; nay, we 
 have rather learned their way and spoken their language, as Joseph in 
 Egypt learned the courtier's oath, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:16">Gen. xlii. 16</A>.

 "<I>I dwell in the midst of a people</I> who by their impudent sinnings
 are pulling down desolating judgments upon the land, which I, who am a 
 sinner too, may justly expect to be involved in."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What gave occasion for these sad reflections at this time: <I>My 
 eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts.</I> He saw God's 
 sovereignty to be incontestable--he is the King; and his power
 irresistible--he is the Lord of hosts. These are comfortable truths to
 God's people, and yet they ought to strike an awe upon us. Note, A 
 believing sight of God's glorious majesty should affect us all with 
 reverence and godly fear. We have reason to be abased in the sense of 
 that infinite distance that there is between us and God, and our own 
 sinfulness and vileness before him, and to be afraid of his 
 displeasure. We are undone if there be not a Mediator between us and 
 this holy God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+6:20">1 Sam. vi. 20</A>.

 Isaiah was thus humbled, to prepare him for the honour he was now to be
 called to as a prophet. Note, Those are fittest to be employed for God 
 who are low in their own eyes and are made deeply sensible of their own 
 weakness and unworthiness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The silencing of the prophet's fears by the good words, and 
 comfortable words, with which the angel answered him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 One of the seraphim immediately flew to him, to purify him, and so to
 pacify him. Note, God has strong consolations ready for holy mourners. 
 Those that humble themselves in penitential shame and fear shall soon 
 be encouraged and exalted; those that are struck down with the visions 
 of God's glory shall soon be raised up again with the visits of his 
 grace; he that tears will heal. Note, further, Angels are ministering 
 spirits for the good of the saints, for their spiritual good. Here was 
 one of the seraphim dismissed, for a time, from attending on the throne 
 of God's glory, to be a messenger of his grace to a good man; and so 
 well pleased was he with the office that he came flying to him. To our 
 Lord Jesus himself, in his agony, there <I>appeared an angel from 
 heaven, strengthening him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:43">Luke xxii. 43</A>.

 Here is,

 1. A comfortable sign given to the prophet of the purging away of his
 sin. The seraph <I>brought a live coal from the altar,</I> and touched 
 his lips with it, not to hurt them, but to heal them--not to cauterize, 
 but to cleanse them; for there were purifications by fire, as well as 
 by water, and the filth of Jerusalem was purged by the <I>spirit of 
 burning,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+4:4"><I>ch.</I> iv. 4</A>.

 The blessed Spirit works as fire, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:11">Matt. iii. 11</A>.

 The seraph, being himself kindled with a divine fire, put life into the
 prophet, to make him also zealously affected; for the way to purge the 
 lips from the uncleanness of sin is to fire the soul with the love of 
 God. This live coal was taken from off the altar, either the altar of 
 incense or that of burnt-offerings, for they had both of them fire 
 burning on them continually. Nothing is powerful to cleanse and comfort 
 the soul but what is taken from Christ's satisfaction and the 
 intercession he ever lives to make in the virtue of that satisfaction. 
 It must be a coal from his altar that must put life into us and be our 
 peace; it will not be done with strange fire.

 2. An explication of this sign: "<I>Lo, this has touched thy lips,</I>
 to assure thee of this, that <I>thy iniquity is taken away and thy sin 
 purged.</I> The guilt of thy sin is removed by pardoning mercy, the 
 guilt of thy tongue-sins. Thy corrupt disposition to sin is removed by 
 renewing grace; and therefore nothing can hinder thee from being 
 accepted with God as a worshipper, in concert with the holy angels, or 
 from being employed for God as a messenger to the children of men." 
 Those only who are thus purged from an evil conscience are prepared 
 <I>to serve the living God,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:14">Heb. ix. 14</A>.

 The taking away of sin is necessary to our speaking with confidence and
 comfort either to God in prayer or from God in preaching; nor are any 
 so fit to display to others the riches and power of gospel-grace as 
 those who have themselves tasted the sweetness and felt the influence 
 of that grace; and those shall have their sin taken away who complain 
 of it as a burden and see themselves in danger of being undone by 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The renewing of the prophet's mission, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Here is a communication between God and Isaiah about this matter. Those
 that would assist others in their correspondence with God must not 
 themselves be strangers to it; for how can we expect that God should 
 speak by us if we never heard him speaking to us, or that we should be 
 accepted as the mouth of others to God if we never spoke to him 
 heartily for ourselves? Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The counsel of God concerning Isaiah's mission. God is here brought 
 in, after the manner of men, deliberating and advising with himself: 
 <I>Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?</I> God needs not either 
 to be counselled by others or to consult with himself; he knows what he 
 will do, but thus he would show us that there is a counsel in his whole 
 will, and teach us to consider our ways, and particularly that the 
 sending forth of ministers is a work not to be done but upon mature 
 deliberation. Observe,

 (1.) Who it is that is consulting. It is the Lord God in his glory, 
 whom he saw upon the throne high and lifted up. It puts an honour upon
 the ministry that, when God would send a prophet to speak in his name, 
 he appeared in all the glories of the upper world. Ministers are the 
 ambassadors of the King of kings; how mean soever they are, he who 
 sends them is great; it is God in three persons (Who will go for us? as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:26">Gen. i. 26</A>,

 <I>Let us make man</I>), Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. They all concur,
 as in the creating, so in the redeeming and governing of man. Ministers 
 are ordained in the same name into which all Christians are baptized.

 (2.) What the consultation is: <I>Whom shall I send? And who will 
 go?</I> Some think this refers to the particular message of wrath 
 against Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 "Who will be willing to go on such a melancholy errand, on which they
 will go in the bitterness of their souls?"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:14">Ezek. iii. 14</A>.

 But I rather take it more largely for all those messages which the
 prophet was entrusted to deliver, in God's name, to that people, in 
 which that hardening work was by no means the primary intention, but a 
 secondary effect of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:16">2 Cor. ii. 16</A>.

 <I>Whom shall I send?</I> intimating that the business was such as
 required a choice and well-accomplished messenger, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:19">Jer. xlix. 19</A>.

 God now appeared, attended with holy angels, and yet asks, <I>Whom
 shall I send?</I> For he would send them a <I>prophet from among their 
 brethren,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:17">Heb. ii. 17</A>.
 
 Note,

 [1.] It is the unspeakable favour of God to us that he is pleased to 
 send us his mind by men like ourselves, whose terror shall not make us 
 afraid, and who are themselves concerned in the messages they bring. 
 Those who are workers together with God are sinners and sufferers 
 together with us. 

 [2.] It is a rare thing to find one who is fit to go for God, and carry 
 his messages to the children of men: <I>Whom shall I send?</I> Who is 
 sufficient? Such a degree of courage for God and concern for the souls 
 of men as is necessary to make a man faithful, and withal such an 
 insight into the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven as is necessary to 
 make a man skilful, are seldom to be met with. Such an interpreter of 
 the mind of God is one of a thousand, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:23">Job xxxiii. 23</A>.

 [3.] None are allowed to go for God but those who are sent by him; he 
 will own none but those whom he appoints, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:15">Rom. x. 15</A>.

 It is Christ's work to put men into the ministry,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:12">1 Tim. i. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The consent of Isaiah to it: <I>Then said I, Here am I; send me.</I> 
 He was to go on a melancholy errand; the office seemed to go a begging, 
 and every body declined it, and yet Isaiah offered himself to the 
 service. It is an honour to be singular in appearing for God, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:7">Judges v. 7</A>.

 We must not say, "I would go if I thought I should have success;" but,
 "I will go, and leave the success to God. Here am I; send me." Isaiah 
 had been himself in a melancholy frame 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 full of doubts and fears; but now that he had the assurance of the
 pardon of his sin the clouds were blown over, and he was fit for 
 service and forward to it. What he says denotes,

 (1.) His readiness: "Here am I, a volunteer, not pressed into the 
 service." <I>Behold me;</I> so the word is. God says to us, <I>Behold 
 me</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:1"><I>ch.</I> lxv. 1</A>),

 and, <I>Here I am</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:9"><I>ch.</I> lviii. 9</A>),

 even before we call; let us say so to him when he does call.

 (2.) His resolution; "<I>Here I am,</I> ready to encounter the greatest
 difficulties. <I>I have set my face as a flint.</I>" Compare this with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:4-7"><I>ch.</I> l. 4-7</A>.

 (3.) His referring himself to God: "Send me whither thou wilt; make
 what use thou pleasest of me. Send me, that is, Lord, give me
 commission and full instruction; send me, and then, no doubt, thou wilt 
 stand by me." It is a great comfort to those whom God sends that they 
 go for God, and may therefore speak in his name, as having authority, 
 and be assured that he will bear them out.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God takes Isaiah at his word, and here sends him on a strange errand--to
 foretel the ruin of his people and even to ripen them for that ruin--to
 preach that which, by their abuse of it, would be to them a savour of 
 death unto death. And this was to be a type and figure of the state of 
 the Jewish church in the days of the Messiah, when they should 
 obstinately reject the gospel, and should thereupon be rejected of God. 
 These verses are quoted in part, or referred to, six times, in the New
 Testament, which intimates that in gospel time these spiritual 
 judgments would be most frequently inflicted; and though they make the 
 least noise, and come not with observation, yet they are of all 
 judgments the most dreadful. Isaiah is here given to understand these 
 four things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That the generality of the people to whom he was sent would turn a 
 deaf ear to his preaching, and wilfully shut their eyes against all the 
 discoveries of the mind and will of God which he had to make to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>Go, and tell this people,</I> this foolish wretched people, tell
 them their own, tell them how stupid and sottish they are." Isaiah must 
 preach to them, and they will <I>hear</I> him indeed, but that is all; 
 they will not heed him; they will no <I>understand</I> him; they will 
 not take any pains, nor use that application of mind which is necessary 
 to the understanding of him; they are prejudiced against that which is 
 the true intent and meaning of what he says, and therefore they will 
 not understand him, or pretend they do not. They <I>see indeed</I>
 (for the vision is made plain on tables, so that he who runs may read 
 it); <I>but they perceive not</I> their own concern in it; it is to 
 them as a tale that is told. Note, There are many who hear the sound of 
 God's word, but do not feel the power of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That, forasmuch as they would not be made better by his ministry, 
 they should be made worse by it; those that were wilfully blind should 
 be judicially blinded 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "They will not understand or perceive thee, and therefore thou shalt be
 instrumental to <I>make their heart fat,</I> senseless, and sensual, 
 and so to <I>make their ears</I> yet more <I>heavy,</I> and to <I>shut 
 their eyes</I> the closer; so that, at length, their recovery and 
 repentance will become utterly impossible; they shall no more <I>see 
 with their eyes</I> the danger they are in, the ruin they are upon the 
 brink of, nor the way of escape from it; they shall no more <I>hear 
 with their ears</I> the warnings and instructions that are given them, 
 nor <I>understand with their heart</I> the things that belong to their 
 peace, so as to be converted from the error of their ways, and thus 
 <I>be healed.</I>" Note,

 (1.) The conversion of sinners is the healing of them. 

 (2.) A right understanding is necessary to conversion. 

 (3.) God sometimes, in a way of righteous judgment, gives men up to 
 blindness of mind and strong delusions, because they would not 
 <I>receive the truth in the love of it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:10-12">2 Thess. ii. 10-12</A>.

 <I>He that is filthy let him be filthy still.</I>

 (4.) Even the word of God oftentimes proves a means of hardening 
 sinners. The evangelical prophet himself makes the heart of this people 
 fat, not only as he foretels it, passing this sentence upon them in 
 God's name, and seals them under it, but as his preaching had a 
 tendency to it, rocking some asleep in security (to whom it was a 
 lovely song), and making others more outrageous, to whom it was such a 
 reproach that they were not able to bear it. Some looked upon the word 
 as a privilege, and their convictions were smothered by it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:4">Jer. vii. 4</A>);
 
 others looked upon it as a provocation, and their corruptions were
 exasperated by it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That the consequence of this would be their <I>utter ruin,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 The prophet had nothing to object against the justice of this sentence,
 nor does he refuse to go upon such an errand, but asks, "<I>Lord, how 
 long?</I>" (an abrupt question): "Shall it always be thus? Must I and 
 other prophets always labour in vain among them, and will things never 
 be better?" Or, (as should seem by the answer) "Lord, what will it come 
 to at last? What will be in the end hereof?" In answer to this he is 
 told that it should issue in the final destruction of the Jewish church 
 and nation. "When the word of God, especially the word of the gospel, 
 had been thus abused by them, they shall be unchurched, and 
 consequently undone. Their cities shall be uninhabited, and their 
 country houses too; the land shall be untilled, <I>desolate with 
 desolation</I> (as it is in the margin), the people who should 
 replenish the houses and cultivate the ground being all cut off by 
 sword, famine, or pestilence, and those who escape with their lives 
 being removed far away into captivity, so that there shall be a great 
 and general forsaking in the midst of the land; that populous country 
 shall become desert, and that glory of all lands shall be abandoned." 
 Note, Spiritual judgments often bring temporal judgments along with 
 them upon persons and places. This was in part fulfilled in the 
 destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans, when the land, being left 
 desolate, enjoyed her sabbaths seventy years; but, the foregoing 
 predictions being so expressly applied in the New Testament to the Jews 
 in our Saviour's time, doubtless this points at the final destruction 
 of that people by the Romans, in which it had a complete 
 accomplishment, and the effects of it that people and that land remain 
 under to this day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That yet a remnant should be reserved to be the monuments of mercy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 There was a remnant reserved in the last destruction of the Jewish
 nation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:5">Rom. xi. 5</A>,

 <I>At this present time there is a remnant</I>); for so it was written
 here: <I>But in it shall be a tenth,</I> a certain number, but a very 
 small number in comparison with the multitude that shall perish in 
 their unbelief. It is that which, under the law, was God's proportion; 
 they shall be consecrated to God as the tithes were, and shall be for 
 his service and honour. Concerning this tithe, this saved remnant, we 
 are here told,

 (1.) That they shall return

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:13,10:21"><I>ch.</I> vi. 13; x. 21</A>),

 shall return from sin to God and duty, shall return out of captivity to
 their own land. God will turn them, and they shall be turned. 

 (2.) That they shall be eaten, that is, shall be accepted of God as the 
 tithe was, which was meat in God's house, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:10">Mal. iii. 10</A>.

 The saving of this remnant shall be meat to the faith and hope of those
 that wish well to God's kingdom.

 (3.) That they shall be like a timber-tree in winter, which has life, 
 though it has no leaves: <I>As a teil-tree and as an oak, whose 
 substance is in them even when they cast their leaves,</I> so this 
 remnant, though they may be stripped of their outward prosperity and 
 share with others in common calamities, shall yet recover themselves, 
 as a tree in the spring, and flourish again; though they fall, they 
 shall not be utterly cast down. <I>There is hope of a tree, though it 
 be cut down, that it will sprout again,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+14:7">Job xiv. 7</A>.

 (4.) That this distinguished remnant shall be the stay and support of 
 the public interests. <I>The holy seed</I> in the soul is the substance 
 of the man; a principle of grace reigning in the heart will keep life 
 there; he that is <I>born of God</I> has <I>his seed remaining in 
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:9">1 John iii. 9</A>.

 So the holy seed in the land is the substance of the land, keeps it
 from being quite dissolved, <I>and bears up the pillars of it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+75:3">Ps. lxxv. 3</A>.
 
 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:9"><I>ch.</I> i. 9</A>.

 Some read the foregoing clause with this, thus: <I>As the support at
 Shallecheth is in the elms and the oaks, so the holy seed is the 
 substance thereof;</I> as the trees that grow on either side of the 
 causeway (the raised way, or terrace-walk, that leads from the king's 
 palace to the temple, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:5">1 Kings x. 5</A>,
 
 at the gate of Shallecheth,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+26:16">1 Chron. xxvi. 16</A>)

 support the causeway by keeping up the earth, which would otherwise be
 crumbling away, so the small residue of religious, serious, praying 
 people, are the support of the state, and help to keep things together 
 and save them from going to decay. Some make the holy seed to be 
 Christ. The Jewish nation was <I>therefore</I> saved from utter ruin 
 because <I>out of it, as concerning the flesh, Christ</I> was to come,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:5">Rom. ix. 5</A>.

 <I>Destroy it not, for that blessing is in it</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:8"><I>ch.</I> lxv. 8</A>);

 and when that blessing had come, it was soon destroyed. Now the
 consideration of this is designed for the support of the prophet in his 
 work. Though far the greater part should perish in their unbelief, yet 
 to some his word should be a savour of life unto life. Ministers do not 
 wholly lose their labour if they be but instrumental to save one poor 
 soul.</P>
