 In this chapter we have particular directions given for the 
 distribution of the land, of which we had the metes and bounds assigned 
 in the foregoing chapter. 

 I. The portions of the twelve tribes, seven to the north of the
 sanctuary 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+48:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>)
 
 and five to the south, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+48:23-29">ver. 23-29</A>.

 II. The allotment of land for the sanctuary, and the priests 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+48:8-11">ver. 8-11</A>),
 
 for the Levites 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+48:12-14">ver. 12-14</A>),
 
 for the city 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+48:15-20">ver. 15-20</A>),
 
 and for the prince, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+48:21,22">ver. 21, 22</A>.
 
 Much of this we had before,

 III. A plan of the city, its gates, and the new name given to it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+48:30-35">ver. 30-35</A>),

 which seals up, and concludes, the vision and prophecy of this 
 book.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now these <I>are</I> the names of the tribes. From the north end
 to the coast of the way of Hethlon, as one goeth to Hamath,
 Hazar-enan, the border of Damascus northward, to the coast of
 Hamath; for these are his sides east <I>and</I> west; a <I>portion for</I>
 Dan.
 &nbsp; 2  And by the border of Dan, from the east side unto the west
 side, a <I>portion for</I> Asher.
 &nbsp; 3  And by the border of Asher, from the east side even unto the
 west side, a <I>portion for</I> Naphtali.
 &nbsp; 4  And by the border of Naphtali, from the east side unto the
 west side, a <I>portion for</I> Manasseh.
 &nbsp; 5  And by the border of Manasseh, from the east side unto the
 west side, a <I>portion for</I> Ephraim.
 &nbsp; 6  And by the border of Ephraim, from the east side even unto
 the west side, a <I>portion for</I> Reuben.
 &nbsp; 7  And by the border of Reuben, from the east side unto the west
 side, a <I>portion for</I> Judah.
 &nbsp; 8  And by the border of Judah, from the east side unto the west
 side, shall be the offering which ye shall offer of five and
 twenty thousand <I>reeds in</I> breadth, and <I>in</I> length as one of the
 <I>other</I> parts, from the east side unto the west side: and the
 sanctuary shall be in the midst of it.
 &nbsp; 9  The oblation that ye shall offer unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>shall be</I> of
 five and twenty thousand in length, and of ten thousand in
 breadth.
 &nbsp; 10  And for them, <I>even</I> for the priests, shall be <I>this</I> holy
 oblation; toward the north five and twenty thousand <I>in length,</I>
 and toward the west ten thousand in breadth, and toward the east
 ten thousand in breadth, and toward the south five and twenty
 thousand in length: and the sanctuary of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall be in the
 midst thereof.
 &nbsp; 11  <I>It shall be</I> for the priests that are sanctified of the
 sons of Zadok; which have kept my charge, which went not astray
 when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went
 astray.
 &nbsp; 12  And <I>this</I> oblation of the land that is offered shall be
 unto them a thing most holy by the border of the Levites.
 &nbsp; 13  And over against the border of the priests the Levites
 <I>shall have</I> five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand
 in breadth: all the length <I>shall be</I> five and twenty thousand,
 and the breadth ten thousand.
 &nbsp; 14  And they shall not sell of it, neither exchange, nor
 alienate the first-fruits of the land: for <I>it is</I> holy unto the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 15  And the five thousand, that are left in the breadth over
 against the five and twenty thousand, shall be a profane <I>place</I>
 for the city, for dwelling, and for suburbs: and the city shall
 be in the midst thereof.
 &nbsp; 16  And these <I>shall be</I> the measures thereof; the north side
 four thousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand
 and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five
 hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred.
 &nbsp; 17  And the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two
 hundred and fifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty,
 and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west
 two hundred and fifty.
 &nbsp; 18  And the residue in length over against the oblation of the
 holy <I>portion shall be</I> ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand
 westward: and it shall be over against the oblation of the holy
 <I>portion;</I> and the increase thereof shall be for food unto them
 that serve the city.
 &nbsp; 19  And they that serve the city shall serve it out of all the
 tribes of Israel.
 &nbsp; 20  All the oblation <I>shall be</I> five and twenty thousand by five
 and twenty thousand: ye shall offer the holy oblation four-square,
 with the possession of the city.
 &nbsp; 21  And the residue <I>shall be</I> for the prince, on the one side
 and on the other of the holy oblation, and of the possession of
 the city, over against the five and twenty thousand of the
 oblation toward the east border, and westward over against the
 five and twenty thousand toward the west border, over against the
 portions for the prince: and it shall be the holy oblation; and
 the sanctuary of the house <I>shall be</I> in the midst thereof.
 &nbsp; 22  Moreover from the possession of the Levites, and from the
 possession of the city, <I>being</I> in the midst <I>of that</I> which is
 the prince's, between the border of Judah and the border of
 Benjamin, shall be for the prince.
 &nbsp; 23  As for the rest of the tribes, from the east side unto the
 west side, Benjamin <I>shall have</I> a <I>portion.</I>
 &nbsp; 24  And by the border of Benjamin, from the east side unto the
 west side, Simeon <I>shall have</I> a <I>portion.</I>
 &nbsp; 25  And by the border of Simeon, from the east side unto the
 west side, Issachar a <I>portion.</I>
 &nbsp; 26  And by the border of Issachar, from the east side unto the
 west side, Zebulun a <I>portion.</I>
 &nbsp; 27  And by the border of Zebulun, from the east side unto the
 west side, Gad a <I>portion.</I>
 &nbsp; 28  And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the
 border shall be even from Tamar <I>unto</I> the waters of strife <I>in</I>
 Kadesh, <I>and</I> to the river toward the great sea.
 &nbsp; 29  This <I>is</I> the land which ye shall divide by lot unto the
 tribes of Israel for inheritance, and these <I>are</I> their portions,
 saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 30  And these <I>are</I> the goings out of the city on the north
 side, four thousand and five hundred measures.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a very short and ready way taken for the dividing of the 
 land among the twelve tribes, not so tedious and so far about as the 
 way that was taken in Joshua's time; for in the distribution of 
 spiritual and heavenly blessings there is not that danger of murmuring 
 and quarrelling that there is in the participation of the temporal 
 blessings. When God gave to the labourers every one his penny those 
 that were uneasy at it were soon put to silence with, <I>May I not do 
 what I will with my own?</I> And such is the equal distribution here 
 among the tribes. In this distribution of the land we may observe, 

 1. That it differs very much from the division of it in Joshua's time,
 and agrees not with the order of their birth, nor with that of their 
 blessing by Jacob or Moses. Simeon here is not <I>divided</I> in Jacob, 
 nor is Zebulun a <I>haven of ships,</I> a plain intimation that it is 
 not so much to be understood literally as spiritually, though the 
 mystery of it is very much hidden from us. In gospel times old things 
 have passed away; <I>behold, all things have become new.</I> The Israel 
 of God is cast into a new method. 

 2. That the tribe of Dan, which was last provided for in the first 
 division of Canaan

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+19:40">Josh. xix. 40</A>),

 is first provided for here,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+48:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Thus in the gospel the last shall be first, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:30">Matt. xix. 30</A>.

 God, in the dispensation of his grace, does not follow the same method
 that he does in the disposals of his providence. But Dan had now his
 portion thereabouts where he had only one city before, northward, on 
 the border of Damascus, and furthest of all from the sanctuary, because 
 that tribe had revolted to idolatry.

 3. That all the ten tribes that were carried away by the king of
 Assyria, as well as the two tribes that were long afterwards carried to 
 Babylon, have their allotment in this visionary land, which some think 
 had its accomplishment in the particular persons and families of those 
 tribes who returned with Judah and Benjamin, of which we find many 
 instances in Ezra and Nehemiah; and it is probable that there were 
 returns of many more afterwards at several times, which are not 
 recorded; and the Jews having Galilee, and other parts, that had been 
 the possessions of the ten tribes, put into their hands, in common with 
 them, they enjoyed them. Grotius says, If the ten tribes had repented
 and returned to God, as the <I>chief fathers of Judah and Benjamin did, 
 and the priests and Levites</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:5">Ezra i. 5</A>),

 they would have fared as those two tribes did, but they forfeited the
 benefit of this glorious prophecy by sin. However, we believe it has
 its designed accomplishment in the establishment and enlargement of the 
 gospel church, and the happy settlement of all those who are Israelites 
 indeed in the sure and sweet enjoyment of the privileges of the new 
 covenant, in which there is enough for all and enough for each.

 4. That every tribe in this visionary distribution had its particular
 lot assigned it by a divine appointment; for it was never the intention 
 of the gospel to pluck up the hedge of property and lay all in common; 
 it was in a way of charity, not of legal right, that the first 
 Christians had all things common 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:44">Acts ii. 44</A>),

 and many precepts of the gospel suppose that every man should know his
 own. We must not only acknowledge, but acquiesce in, the hand of God 
 appointing us our lot, and be well pleased with it, believing it 
 fittest for us. <I>He shall choose our inheritance for us,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+47:4">Ps. xlvii. 4</A>.

 5. That the tribes lay contiguous. By <I>the border</I> of one tribe
 was <I>the portion</I> of another, all in a row, in exact order, so 
 that, like stones in an arch, they fixed, and strengthened, and wedged 
 in one another. <I>Behold how good and how pleasant a thing it is for 
 brethren</I> thus <I>to dwell together!</I> It was a figure of the 
 communion of churches and saints under the gospel-government; thus, 
 though they are many, yet they are one, and should hold together in 
 holy love and mutual assistance. 

 6. That the lot of Reuben, which before lay at a distance beyond
 Jordan, now lies next to Judah, and next but one to the sanctuary; for 
 the scandal he lay under, for which he was told <I>he should not 
 excel,</I> began by this time to wear off. What has turned to the
 reproach of any person or people ought not to be remembered for ever, 
 but should at length be kindly forgotten. 

 7. That the sanctuary was <I>in the midst</I> of them. There were seven
 tribes to the north of it and the Levites, the prince's, and the city's 
 portion, with that of five tribes more, to the south of it; so that it 
 was, as it ought to be, <I>in the heart of the kingdom,</I> that it 
 might diffuse its benign influences to the whole, and might be the 
 centre of their unity. The tribes that lay most remote from each other
 would meet there in a mutual acquaintance and fellowship. Those of the
 same parish or congregation, though dispersed, and having no occasion 
 otherwise to know each other, yet by meeting statedly to worship God 
 together should have their hearts knit to each other in holy love. 

 8. That where the sanctuary was the priests were: <I>For them, even
 for the priests, shall this holy oblation be,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+48:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 As, on the one hand, this denotes honour and comfort to ministers, that 
 what is given for their support and maintenance is reckoned <I>a holy 
 oblation to the Lord,</I> so it intimates their duty, which is that, 
 since they are appointed and maintained for the service of the 
 sanctuary, they ought to <I>attend continually to this very thing,</I> 
 to reside on their cures. Those that live upon the altar must serve at 
 the altar, not take the wages to themselves and devolve the work upon 
 others; but how can they serve the altar, his altar they live upon, if 
 they do not live near it? 

 9. Those priests had the priests' share of these lands that had
 approved themselves faithful to God in times of trial

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+48:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>It shall be for the sons of Zadok,</I> who, it seems, had signalized 
 themselves in some critical juncture, and <I>went not astray</I> when 
 the <I>children of Israel,</I> and the other Levites, went astray. God 
 will put honour upon those who keep their integrity in times of general 
 apostasy, and he has special favours in reserve for them. Those are 
 swimming upwards, and so they will find at last, that are swimming 
 against the stream.

 10. The land which was appropriated to the ministers of the sanctuary
 might by no means be alienated. It was in the nature of the 
 <I>first-fruits of the land,</I> and was therefore <I>holy to the 
 Lord;</I> and, though the priests and Levites had both the use of it 
 and the inheritance of it to them and their heirs, yet they might not 
 <I>sell it nor exchange it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+48:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 It is sacrilege to convert that to other uses which is dedicated to 
 God. 

 11. The land allotted for the city and its suburbs is called a
 <I>profane place</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+48:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 or <I>common;</I> not but that the city was a holy city above other 
 cities, for the Lord was there, but, in comparison with the sanctuary, 
 it was a profane place. Yet it is too often true in the worst sense 
 that great cities, even those which, like this, have the sanctuary near 
 them, are profane places, and it ought to be deeply lamented. It was 
 the complaint of old, <I>From Jerusalem has profaneness gone forth into 
 all the land,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:15">Jer. xxiii. 15</A>.

 12. The city is made to be exactly square, and the suburbs extending
 themselves equally on all sides, as the Levites' cities did in the 
 first division of the land

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+48:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>),
 
 which, never being literally fulfilled in any city, intimates that it 
 is to be understood spiritually of the beauty and stability of the 
 gospel church, that <I>city of the living God,</I> which is formed 
 according to the wisdom and counsel of God, and is made firm and 
 immovable by his promise. 

 13. Whereas, before, the inhabitants of Jerusalem were principally of
 Judah and Benjamin, in whose tribe it lay, now the head city lies not 
 in the particular lot of any of the tribes, but <I>those that serve the 
 city,</I> and bear office in it, <I>shall serve it out of all the 
 tribes of Israel,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+48:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 The most eminent men must be picked out of all the tribes of Israel for 
 the service of the city, because many eyes were upon it, and there was 
 great resort to it from all parts of the nation and from other nations.
 Those that live in the city are said to serve the city, for, wherever 
 we are, we must study to be serviceable to the place, some way or 
 other, according as our capacity is. They must not come out of the 
 tribes of Israel to the city to take their ease, and enjoy their 
 pleasures, but to serve the city, to do all the good they can there, 
 and in so doing they would have a good influence upon the country too.
 
 14. Care was taken that those who applied themselves to public business
 in the city, as well as in the sanctuary, should have an honourable 
 comfortable maintenance; lands are appointed, <I>the increase</I> 
 whereof <I>shall be food unto those that serve the city,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+48:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Who goes a warfare at his own charges? Magistrates, that attend the 
 service of the state, as well as ministers, that attend the service of 
 the church, should have all due encouragement and support in so doing; 
 and <I>for this cause pay we tribute also.</I> 

 15. The prince had a lot for himself, suited to the dignity of his high
 station

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+48:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>);

 we took an account of it before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:1-25"><I>ch.</I> xlv.</A>

 He was seated near the sanctuary, where the testimony of Israel was,
 and near the city, where the <I>thrones of judgment</I> were, that he 
 might be a protection to both and might see the that duty of both was 
 carefully and faithfully done; and herein he was a minister of God for 
 good to the whole community. Christ is the church's prince, that 
 defends it on every side, and creates a defense; nay, he is himself a 
 defence upon all its glory and encompasses it with his favour. 

 16. As Judah had his lot next the sanctuary on one side, so Benjamin
 had, of all the tribes, his lot nearest to it on the other side, which 
 honour was reserved for those who adhered to the house of David and the 
 temple at Jerusalem when the other ten tribes went astray from both. It 
 is enough if treachery and apostasy, upon repentance, he pardoned, but 
 constancy and fidelity shall be rewarded and preferred.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a further account of the city that should be built for the 
 metropolis of this glorious land, and to be the receptacle of those who 
 would come from all parts to worship in the sanctuary adjoining. It is 
 nowhere called Jerusalem, nor is the land which we have had such a 
 particular account of the dividing of any where called the land of 
 Canaan; for the old names are forgotten, to intimate that the <I>old 
 things are done away, behold all things have become new.</I> Now, 
 concerning this city, observe here, 

 1. The measures of its out-lets, and the grounds belonging to it, for 
 its several conveniences; each way its appurtenances extended 4500 
 <I>measures</I> 18,000 in all,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+48:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.
 
 But what these measures were is uncertain. It is never said, in all 
 this chapter, whether so many <I>reeds</I> (as our translation 
 determines by inserting that word, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+48:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>,

 each reed containing six cubits and span,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:5"><I>ch.</I> xl. 5</A>,

 and why should the measurer appear with the measuring reed in his hand
 of that length if he did not measure with <I>that,</I> except where it 
 is expressly said he measured by cubits?) or whether, as others think, 
 it is so many cubits, because those are mentioned

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+45:2,47:3"><I>ch.</I> xlv. 2 and <I>ch.</I> xlvii. 3</A>.

 Yet that makes me incline rather to think that where cubits are not
 mentioned must be intended so many lengths of the measuring reed. But 
 those who understand it of so many cubits are not agreed whether it be 
 meant of the common cubit, which was half a yard, or the geometrical 
 cubit, which, for better expedition, is supposed to be mostly used in 
 surveying lands, which, some say, contained six cubits, others about 
 three cubits and a half, so making 1000 cubits the same with 1000 
 paces, that is, an English mile. But our being left at this uncertainty 
 is an intimation that these things are to be understood spiritually, 
 and that what is principally meant is that there is an exact and just 
 proportion observed by Infinite Wisdom in modelling the gospel church, 
 which though now we cannot discern we shall when we come to heaven.

 2. The number of its gates. It had twelve gates in all, three on each
 side, which was very agreeable when it lay four square; and these 
 twelve gates were inscribed to the twelve tribes. Because the city was 
 to be served <I>out of all the tribes of Israel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+48:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>)

 it was fit that each tribe should have its gate; and, Levi being here 
 taken in, to keep to the number twelve Ephraim and Manasseh are made 
 one in Joseph, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+48:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 On the north side were the gates of Reuben, Judah, and Levi 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+48:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),
 
 on the east the gates of Joseph, Benjamin, and Dan 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+48:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),

 on the south the gates of Simeon, Issachar, and Zebulun 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+48:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 and on the west the gates of Gad, Asher, and Naphtali, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+48:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 Conformable to this, in St. John's vision, the new Jerusalem (for so 
 the holy city is called there, though not here) has <I>twelve 
 gates,</I> three on a side, and on them are written <I>the names of the 
 twelve tribes of the children of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:12,13">Rev. xxi. 12, 13</A>.

 Note, Into the church of Christ, both militant and triumphant, there is 
 a free access by faith for all that come of every tribe, from every 
 quarter. Christ has <I>opened the kingdom of heaven for all
 believers.</I> Whoever will may come and <I>take of the water of 
 life,</I> of the tree of life, <I>freely.</I> 

 3. The name given to this city: <I>From that day,</I> when it shall be
 newly-erected according to this model, the name of it shall be, not, as 
 before, <I>Jerusalem--The vision of peace,</I> but which is the 
 original of that, and more than equivalent to it, <I>Jehovah 
 Shammah--The Lord is there,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+48:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 This intimated, 

 (1.) That the captives, after their return, should have manifest tokens 
 of God's presence with them and his residence among them, both in his 
 ordinances and his providences. They shall have no occasion to ask, as 
 their fathers did, <I>Is the Lord among us, or is he not?</I> for they 
 shall see and say that he is with them of a truth. And then, though
 their troubles were many and threatening, they were like the bush which 
 burned but was not consumed, because <I>the Lord was there.</I> But 
 when God departed from their temple, when he said, <I>Migremus 
 hinc--Let us go hence,</I> their house was soon <I>left unto them 
 desolate.</I> Being no longer his, it was not much longer theirs. 

 (2.) That the gospel-church should likewise have the presence of God in 
 it, though not in the <I>Shechinah,</I> as of old, yet in a token of it 
 no less sure, that of his Spirit. Where the gospel is faithfully 
 preached, gospel ordinances are duly administered, and God is 
 worshipped in the name of Jesus Christ only, it may truly be said, 
 <I>The Lord is there;</I> for faithful is he that has said, and he will 
 be as good as his word, <I>Lo, I am with you always even unto the end 
 of the world. The Lord is there</I> in his church, to rule and govern
 it, to protect and defend it, and graciously to accept and own his 
 sincere worshippers, and to be <I>nigh unto them in all that they call 
 upon him for.</I> This should engage us to keep close to the communion 
 of saints, for <I>the Lord is there;</I> and then whither shall we go 
 to better ourselves? Nay, it is true of every good Christian; he dwells 
 in God, and God in him; whatever soul has in it a living principle of 
 grace, it may be truly said, <I>The Lord is There.</I>

 (3.) That the glory and happiness of heaven should consist chiefly in 
 this, that <I>the Lord is there.</I> St. John's representation of that 
 blessed state does indeed far exceed this in many respects. That is all 
 gold, and pearls, and precious stones; it is much larger than this, and 
 much brighter, for it <I>needs not the light of the sun.</I> But, in 
 making the presence of God the principal matter of its bliss, they both 
 agree. There the happiness of the glorified saints is made to be that
 <I>God himself shall be with them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:3">Rev. xxi. 3</A>),

 that <I>he who sits on the throne shall dwell among them,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:15">Rev. vii. 15</A>.

 And here it is made to crown the bliss of this holy city that <I>the 
 Lord is there.</I> Let us therefore give all diligence to make sure to 
 ourselves a place in that city, that we may be <I>for ever with the 
 Lord.</I></P>
