 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 After the exceedingly great and precious promises of gospel grace, 
 typified by temporal deliverances, which we had in the foregoing 
 chapter, we have here, 

 I. A solemn charge given to us all to make conscience of our duty, as
 we hope to have the benefit of those promises, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. Great encouragement given to strangers that were willing to come
 under the bonds of the covenant, assuring them of the blessings of the 
 covenant, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:3-8">ver. 3-8</A>.

 III. A high charge drawn up against the watchmen of Israel, that were
 careless and unfaithful in the discharge of their duty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:9-12">ver. 9-12</A>),

 which seems to be the beginning of a new sermon, by way of reproof and
 threatening, which is continued in the following chapters. And the
 word of God was intended for conviction, as well as for comfort and
 instruction in righteousness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my
 salvation <I>is</I> near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.
 &nbsp; 2  Blessed <I>is</I> the man <I>that</I> doeth this, and the son of man
 <I>that</I> layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting
 it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The scope of these verses is to show that when God is coming towards us
 in a way of mercy we must go forth to meet him in a way of duty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God here tells us what are his intentions of mercy to us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):
 
 <I>My salvation is near to come</I>--the great salvation wrought out by
 Jesus Christ (for that was the salvation of which the <I>prophets 
 enquired and searched diligently,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:10">1 Pet. i. 10</A>),

 typified by the salvation of the Jews from Sennacherib or out of
 Babylon. Observe,

 1. The gospel salvation is the salvation of the Lord. It was contrived
 and brought about by him; he glories in it as his. 

 2. In that salvation God's righteousness is revealed, which is so much 
 the beauty of the gospel that St. Paul makes this the ground of his 
 glorying in it. 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:17">Rom. i. 17</A>),

 <I>because therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to
 faith.</I> The law revealed that righteousness of God by which all 
 sinners stand condemned, but the gospel reveals that by which all 
 believers stand acquitted.

 3. The Old-Testament saints saw this salvation coming, and drawing near
 to them, long before it came; and they had notice by the prophets of 
 its approach. As Daniel understood by Jeremiah's books the approach of 
 the redemption out of Babylon, at the end of seventy years, so others 
 understood by Daniel's books the approach of our redemption by Christ 
 at the end of seventy weeks of years.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He tells us what are his expectations of duty from us, in 
 consideration thereof. Say not, "We see the salvation near, and 
 therefore we may live as we list, for there is no danger now of missing 
 it or coming short of it;" that is turning the grace of God into 
 wantonness. But, on the contrary, when the salvation is near double 
 your guard against sin. Note, The fuller assurances God gives us of the 
 performance of his promises the stronger obligations he lays us under 
 to obedience. The salvation here spoken of has now come; yet, there 
 being still a further salvation in view, the apostle presses duty upon 
 us Christians with the same argument. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:11">Rom. iii. 11</A>,

 <I>Now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.</I> That which is
 here required to qualify and prepare us for the approaching salvation 
 is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That we be honest and just in all our dealings: <I>Keep you judgment 
 and do justice.</I> Walk by rule, and make conscience of what you say 
 and do, that you do no wrong to any. Render to all their dues exactly, 
 and, in exacting what is due to you, keep up a court of equity in your 
 own bosom, to moderate the rigours of the law. Be ruled by that golden 
 rule, "Do as you would be done by." Magistrates must administer justice 
 wisely and faithfully. This is required to evidence the sincerity of 
 our faith and repentance, and to open the way of mercy. <I>Repent for 
 the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</I> God is true to us; let us be so 
 to one another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That we religiously observe the sabbath day, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 We are not just if we rob God of his time. Sabbath-sanctification is 
 here put for all the duties of the first table, the fruits of our love 
 to God, as justice and judgment are put for all those of the second 
 table, the fruits of our love to our neighbour. Observe,

 (1.) The duty required, which is to <I>keep the sabbath,</I> to keep it 
 as a talent we are to trade with, as a treasure we are entrusted with. 
 "Keep it holy; keep it safe; keep it with care and caution; keep it 
 from polluting it. Allow neither yourselves nor others either to 
 violate the holy rest or omit the holy work of that day." If this be 
 intended primarily for the Jews in Babylon, it was fit that they should 
 be particularly put in mind of this, because when, by reason of their 
 distance from the temple, they could not observe the other institutions 
 of their law, yet they might distinguish themselves from the heathen by 
 putting a difference between God's day and other days. But it being 
 required more generally of man, and <I>the son of man,</I> it intimates 
 that sabbath-sanctification should be a duty in gospel times, when the 
 bounds of the church should be enlarged and other rites and ceremonies 
 abolished. Observe, Those that would keep the sabbath from polluting it 
 must put on resolution, must not only do this, but lay hold on it, for 
 sabbath time is precious, but is very apt to slip away if we take not 
 great care; and therefore we must lay hold on it and keep our hold, 
 must do it and persevere in it. 

 (2.) The encouragement we have to do this duty: <I>Blessed is he that 
 doeth it.</I> The way to have the blessing of God upon our employments 
 all the week is to make conscience, and make a business, of 
 sabbath-sanctification; and in doing so we shall be the better 
 qualified to do judgment and justice. The more godliness the more
 honesty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:2">1 Tim. ii. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That we have nothing to do with sin: <I>Blessed is the man</I> that 
 <I>keeps his hand from doing evil,</I> any wrong to his neighbour, in 
 body, goods, or good name--or, more generally, any thing that is
 displeasing to God and hurtful to his own soul. Note, The best
 evidence of our having kept the sabbath well will be a care to keep a 
 good conscience all the week. By this it will appear that we have been 
 in the mount with God if our faces shine in a holy conversation before 
 men.</P>

 Yet will I gather <I>others</I> to him, beside those that are gathered
 unto him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet is here, in God's name, encouraging those that were hearty 
 in joining themselves to God and yet laboured under great 
 discouragements. 

 1. Some were discouraged because they were not of the seed of Abraham.
 They had <I>joined themselves to the Lord,</I> and bound their souls 
 with a bond to be his for ever (this is the root and life of religion, 
 to break off from the world and the flesh, and devote ourselves 
 entirely to the service and honour of God); but they questioned whether 
 God would accept them, because they were of <I>the sons of the 
 stranger,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 They were Gentiles, strangers to the commonwealth of Israel and aliens
 from the covenants of promise, and therefore feared they had no part 
 nor lot in the matter. They said, "<I>The Lord has utterly separated me 
 from his people,</I> and will not own me as one of them, nor admit me 
 to their privileges." It was often said that there should be <I>one law 
 for the stranger and for him that was born in the land</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:49">Exod. xii. 49</A>),
 
 and yet they came to this melancholy conclusion. Note, Unbelief often
 suggests things to the discouragement of good people which are directly 
 contrary to what God himself has said, things which he has expressly 
 guarded against. Let not the <I>sons of the stranger</I> therefore say 
 thus, for they have no reason to say it. Note, Ministers must have 
 answers ready for the disquieting fears and jealousies of weak 
 Christians, which, how unreasonable soever, they must take notice of.

 2. Others were discouraged because they were not fathers in Israel. The 
 eunuch said, <I>Behold, I am a dry tree.</I> So he looked upon himself, 
 and it was his grief; so others looked upon him, and it was his 
 reproach. He was thought to be of no use because he had no children, 
 nor was ever likely to have any. This was then the more grievous 
 because eunuchs were not admitted to be priests 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+21:20">Lev. xxi. 20</A>),

 nor to <I>enter into the congregation</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:1">Deut. xxiii. 1</A>),

 and because the promise of a numerous posterity was the particular
 blessing of Israel and the more valuable because from among them the 
 Messiah was to come. Yet God would not have the eunuchs to make the
 worst of their case, nor to think that they should be excluded from the 
 gospel church, and from being spiritual priests, because they were shut 
 out from the congregation of Israel and the Levitical priesthood; no, 
 as the taking down of the partition wall, contained in ordinances, 
 admitted the Gentiles, so it let in likewise those that had been kept 
 out by ceremonial pollutions. Yet, by the reply here given to this 
 suggestion, it should seem the chief thing which the eunuch laments in 
 his case is his being written childless.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now suitable encouragements are given to each of these.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To those who have no children of their own, who, though they had the 
 honour to be the children of the church and the covenant themselves, 
 yet had none to whom they might transmit that honour, none to receive 
 the sign of circumcision and the privileges secured by that sign. Now 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What a good character they have, though they lie under this ignominy 
 and affliction; and those only are entitled to the following comforts 
 who in some measure answer to these characters. 

 (1.) They <I>keep God's sabbaths</I> as he has appointed them to be 
 kept. In the primitive times, if a Christian were asked, "Hast thou 
 kept holy the Lord's day?" He would readily answer, "I am a Christian, 
 and dare not do otherwise." 

 (2.) In their whole conversation they <I>choose those things that 
 please God.</I> They do that which is good; they do it with a sincere 
 design to please God in it; they do it of choice, and with delight. If 
 sometimes, through infirmity, they come short in doing that which 
 pleases God, yet they choose it, they endeavour after it, and aim at 
 it. Note, Whatever is God's pleasure should without dispute be our 
 choice. 

 (3.) They <I>take hold of his covenant,</I> and that is a thing that 
 pleases God as much as any thing. The covenant of grace is proposed and 
 proffered to us in the gospel; to take hold of it is to consent to it, 
 to accept the offer and come up to the terms, deliberately and 
 sincerely to take God to be to us a God and to give up ourselves to him 
 to be to him a people. Taking hold of the covenant denotes an entire 
 and resolute consent to it, taking hold as those that are afraid of 
 coming short, catching at it as a good bargain, and as those that are 
 resolved never to let it go, for it is our life: and we take hold of it 
 as a criminal took hold of the horns of the altar to which he fled for 
 refuge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What a great deal of comfort they may have if they answer to this 
 character, though they are not built up into families 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Unto them will I give a better place and name.</I> It is supposed
 that there is a place and a name, which we have from sons and 
 daughters, that is valuable and desirable. It is a pleasing notion we 
 have that we live in our children when we are dead. But there is a 
 better place, and a better name, which those have that are in covenant 
 with God, and it is sufficient to counterbalance the want of the 
 former. A place and a name denote rest and reputation; a place to live 
 comfortably in themselves, and a name to live creditably with among 
 their neighbours; they shall be happy, and may be easy both at home and 
 abroad. Though they have not children to be the music of their house, 
 or arrows in their quiver, to keep them in countenance when they speak 
 with their enemies in the gate, yet they shall have a place and a name 
 more than equivalent. For,

 (1.) God will give it to them, will give it to them by promise; he will 
 himself be both their habitation and their glory, their place and their 
 name. 

 (2.) He will give it to them in his house, and within his walls; there 
 they shall have a place, shall be planted so as to take root 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:13">Ps. xcii. 13</A>),
 
 shall <I>dwell all the days of their life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:4">Ps. xxvii. 4</A>.

 They shall be at home in communion with God, as Anna, that <I>departed
 not from the temple night nor day.</I> There they shall have a name. A 
 name for the good things with God and good people is a name <I>better 
 than that of sons and daughters.</I> Our relation to God, our interest 
 in Christ, our title to the blessings of the covenant, and our hopes of 
 eternal life, are things that give us in God's house a blessed place 
 and a blessed name.

 (3.) It shall be <I>an everlasting name, that shall never</I> be 
 extinct, shall never <I>be cut off;</I> like the place and name of 
 angels, who <I>therefore</I> marry not, because they die not. Spiritual 
 blessings are unspeakably better than those of sons and daughters; for 
 children are a certain care and may prove the greatest grief and shame 
 of a man's life, but the blessings we partake of in God's house are a 
 sure and constant joy and honour, comforts which cannot be 
 embittered.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. To those that are themselves the children of strangers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is here promised that they shall now be welcome to the church, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 When God's Israel come out of Babylon, let them bring as many of their
 neighbours along with them as they can persuade to come, and God will 
 find room enough for them all in his house. And here, (as before) we 
 may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Upon what terms they shall be welcome. Let them know that God's 
 Israel, when they come out of Babylon, will not be plagued, as they 
 were when they came out of Egypt, with a mixed multitude, that went 
 with them, but were not cordially for them; no, the sons of the 
 strangers shall have a place and a name in God's house provided, 

 [1.] That they forsake other gods, all rivals and pretenders 
 whatsoever, and <I>join themselves to the Lord,</I> so as to become 
 <I>one spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:17">1 Cor. vi. 17</A>.

 [2.] That they join themselves to him as subjects to their prince and 
 soldiers to their general, by an oath of fidelity and obedience, <I>to 
 serve him,</I> not occasionally, as one would serve a turn, but to be 
 constantly his servants, entirely subject to his command, and devoted 
 to his interest.

 [3.] That they join themselves to him as friends to his honour and the 
 interests of his kingdom in the world, <I>to love the name of the 
 Lord,</I> to be well pleased with all the discoveries he has made of 
 himself and all the memorials they make of him. Observe, Serving him 
 and loving him go together; for those that love him truly will serve 
 him faithfully, and that obedience is most acceptable to him, as well 
 as most pleasant to us, which flows from a principle of love, for then 
 <I>his commandments are not grievous,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:3">1 John v. 3</A>.

 [4.] That they keep the sabbath from polluting it; for the stranger 
 that is within thy gates is particularly required to do that.

 [5.] That they take hold of the covenant, that is, that they come under 
 the bonds of it, and put in for the benefits of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) To what privileges they shall be welcome, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Three things are here promised them, in their coming to God:--

 [1.] Assistance: "<I>I will bring them to my holy mountain,</I> not 
 only bid them welcome when they come, but incline them to come, will 
 show them the way, and lead them in it." David himself prays that God 
 by his light and truth would bring them to his <I>holy hill,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+43:3">Ps. xliii. 3</A>.

 And the sons of the stranger shall be under the same guidance. The
 church is God's holy hill, on which he hath set his King, and, in 
 bringing them to Zion Hill, he brings them to be subjects to Zion's 
 King, as well as worshippers in Zion's holy temple.

 [2.] Acceptance: "<I>Their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall 
 be accepted on my altar,</I> and be never the less acceptable for being 
 theirs, though they are sons of the stranger." The prayers and praises 
 (those spiritual sacrifices) of devout Gentiles shall be as pleasing to 
 God as those of the pious Jews, and no difference shall be made between 
 them; for, though they are Gentiles by birth, yet through grace they 
 shall be looked upon as the believing seed of faithful Abraham and the 
 praying seed of wrestling Jacob, for in Christ Jesus there is neither 
 Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision.

 [3.] Comfort. They shall not only be accepted, but they themselves 
 shall have the pleasure of it: <I>I will make them joyful in my house 
 of prayer.</I> They shall have grace, not only to serve God, but to 
 serve him cheerfully and with gladness, and that shall make the service 
 the more acceptable to him; for, when we sing in the ways of the Lord, 
 then great is the glory of our God. They shall go away and <I>eat their 
 bread with joy,</I> because <I>God now accepts their works,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:7">Eccl. ix. 7</A>.

 Nay, though they came mourning to the house of prayer, they shall go
 away rejoicing, for they shall there find such ease, by casting their 
 cares and burdens upon God, and referring themselves to him, that, like 
 Hannah, they shall go away and their countenance shall be no more sad. 
 Many a sorrowful spirit has been made joyful in the house of 
 prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It is here promised that multitudes of the Gentiles shall come to 
 the church, not only that the few who come dropping in shall be made 
 welcome, but that great numbers shall come in, and the door be thrown 
 open to them: <I>My house shall be called a house of prayer for all 
 people.</I> The temple was then God's house, and to that Christ applies 
 these words 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:13">Matt. xxi. 13</A>),

 but with an eye to it as a type of the gospel church,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:8,9">Heb. ix. 8, 9</A>.

 For Christ calls it <I>his house,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:6">Heb. iii. 6</A>.

 Now concerning this house it is promised,

 (1.) That it shall not be a house of sacrifice, but a house of prayer. 
 The religious meetings of God's people shall be meetings for prayer, in 
 which they shall join together, as a token of their united faith and 
 mutual love. 

 (2.) That it shall be a house of prayer, not for the people of the Jews 
 only, but for all people. This was fulfilled when Peter was made, not 
 only to perceive it himself, but to tell it to the world, that <I>in 
 every nation he that fears God and works righteousness is accepted of 
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:35">Acts x. 35</A>.

 It had been declared again and again that <I>the stranger that comes
 nigh shall be put to death,</I> but Gentiles shall now be looked upon 
 no longer as strangers and foreigners, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:19">Eph. ii. 19</A>.

 And it appears by Solomon's prayer, at the dedication of the temple,
 both that it was primarily intended for a house of prayer and that 
 strangers should be welcome to it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:30,41,43">1 Kings viii. 30, 41, 43</A>.

 And it is intimated here

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>)

 that when the Gentiles are called in they shall be incorporated into
 one body with the Jews, that (as Christ says,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:16">John x. 16</A>)
 
 there may be <I>one fold and one Shepherd;</I> for,

 [1.] God will <I>gather the outcasts of Israel.</I> Many of the Jews 
 that had by their unbelief cast themselves out shall by faith be 
 brought in again, <I>a remnant according to the election of grace,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:5">Rom. xi. 5</A>.
 
 Christ came to the <I>lost sheep of the house of Israel</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:24">Matt. xv. 24</A>),

 to <I>gather their outcasts</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:2">Ps. cxlvii. 2</A>),

 to <I>restore their preserved</I>

 [2.] He will gather others also to him, besides his own outcasts that 
 are gathered to him. Or, though some of the Gentiles have come over now 
 and then into the church, that shall not serve (as some may think) to 
 answer the extent of these promises; no, there are still more and more 
 to be brought in: "<I>I will gather others to him besides these;</I> 
 these are but the first-fruits in comparison with the harvest that 
 shall be gathered for Christ in the nations of the earth, when the 
 fulness of the Gentiles shall come in." Note, The church is a growing 
 body: when some are gathered to it we may still hope there shall be 
 more, till the mystical body be completed. <I>Other sheep I 
 have.</I></P>

 From words of comfort the prophet here, by a very sudden change of his 
 style, passes to words of reproof and conviction, and goes on in that 
 strain, for the most part, in the three following chapters; and 
 therefore some here begin a new sermon. He had assured the people that 
 in due time God would deliver them out of captivity, which was designed 
 for the comfort of those that should live when God would do this. Now 
 here he shows what their sins and provocations were, for which God 
 would send them into captivity, and this was designed for the 
 conviction of those that lived in his own time, nearly a hundred years 
 before the captivity, who were now filling up the measure of the 
 nation's sin, and to justify God in what he brought upon them. God will 
 lay them waste by the fierceness of their enemies, for the falseness of 
 their friends.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Desolating judgments are here summoned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 The sheep of God's pasture are now to be made the sheep of his
 slaughter, to fall as victims to his justice, and therefore <I>the 
 beasts of the field and the forest</I> are called to come and devour.
 They are beasts of prey, and do it from their own ravenous disposition; 
 but God permits them to do it, nay, he employs them as his servants in 
 doing it, the ministers of his justice, though they mean not so, 
 neither does their heart think so. If this refers primarily to the 
 descent made upon them by the Babylonians, and their devouring them, 
 yet it may look further, to the destruction of Jerusalem and the Jewish 
 nation by the Romans, after these outcasts of them (mentioned

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>)

 were gathered in to the Christian church. The Roman armies came upon
 them as beasts of the forest to devour them, and they quite <I>took 
 away their place and nation.</I> Note, When God has bloody work to do 
 he has beasts of prey within call, to be employed in doing it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The reason of these judgments is here given. The shepherds, who 
 should have been the watchmen of the flock, to discover the approaches 
 of the beasts of prey, to keep them off, and protect the sheep, were 
 treacherous and careless, minded not their business, nor made any 
 conscience of the trust reposed in them, and so the sheep became an 
 easy prey to the wild beasts. Now this may refer to the false prophets 
 that lived in Isaiah's, Jeremiah's, and Ezekiel's time (who flattered 
 the people in their wicked ways, and told them they should have peace 
 though they went on) and to the priests that bore rule by their means. 
 Or it may refer to the wicked princes, the sons of Josiah, that <I>did 
 evil in the sight of the Lord,</I> and other wicked magistrates under
 them, who betrayed their trust, were vicious and profane, and, instead 
 of making up the breach at which the judgments of God were breaking in 
 upon them, made it wider, and augmented the fierce anger of the Lord 
 instead of doing any thing to turn it away. They should have kept 
 judgment and justice 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),
 
 but they abandoned both, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:1">Jer. v. 1</A>.

 Or it may refer to those who were the nation's watchmen in our
 Saviour's time, the chief priests and the scribes, who should have 
 discerned the signs of the times and have given notice to the people of 
 the approach of the Messiah, but who, instead of that, opposed him, and 
 did all they could to keep people from coming to the knowledge of him 
 and to prejudice them against him. It is a very sad character that is 
 here given of these watchmen. <I>Woe unto thee, O land!</I> when thy 
 guides are such.

 1. They had no sense or knowledge of their business. They were 
 wretchedly ignorant of their work, and very unfit to teach, being so 
 ill-taught themselves: <I>His watchmen are blind,</I> and therefore 
 utterly unfit to be watchmen. If the seers see not, who shall see for 
 us? <I>If the light that is in us be darkness, how great is that 
 darkness!</I> Christ describes the Pharisees to be <I>blind leaders of 
 the blind,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:14">Matt. xv. 14</A>.

 The beasts of the field come to devour, and the watchmen are blind, and
 are not aware of them. <I>They are all ignorant</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),
 
 <I>shepherds that cannot understand</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),
 
 that know not what is to be done about the sheep, nor can <I>feed them
 with understanding,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:15">Jer. iii. 15</A>.

 2. What little knowledge they had they made no use of it; no one was 
 the better for it. As they were blind watchmen, that could not discern 
 the danger, so they were <I>dumb dogs,</I> that would not give warning 
 of it. And why are the dogs set to guard the sheep if they cannot bark
 to waken the shepherd and frighten the wolf? Such were these; those 
 that had the charge of souls never reproved men for their faults, nor 
 told them what would be in the end thereof, never gave them notice of 
 the judgments of God that were breaking in upon them. They barked at 
 God's prophets, and bit them too, and worried the sheep, but made no 
 opposition to the wolf or thief. 

 3. They were very lazy, and would take no pains. They loved their
 ease, and hated business, were always <I>sleeping, lying down</I> and 
 <I>loving to slumber.</I> They were not overcome and overpowered by 
 sleep, as the disciples, through grief and fatigue, but they lay down 
 on purpose to invite sleep, and said, <I>Soul, take thy ease. Yet a 
 little sleep.</I> It is bad with a people when their shepherds slumber 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+3:18">Nah. iii. 18</A>),

 and it is well for God's people that their shepherd, the keeper of
 Israel, neither slumbers nor sleeps.

 4. They were very covetous and eager after the world--<I>greedy dogs 
 that can never have enough.</I> If they had ever so much, they would 
 think it too little. They so love silver as never to be satisfied with
 silver, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:10">Eccl. v. 10</A>.

 All their enquiry is what they shall get, not what they shall do. Let
 them have the wages, and they care not whether the work be done or no; 
 they feed not the flock, but fleece it. They are every one looking to 
 his <I>own way,</I> minding his own private interests, and have no 
 regard at all to the public welfare. It was St. Paul's complaint of
 the watchmen in his time

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:21">Phil. ii. 21</A>),

 <I>All seek their own, not the things that are Jesus Christ's.</I>
 Every one is for propagating his own opinion, advancing his own party, 
 raising his own family, and having every thing to his own mind, while 
 the common concerns of the public are wretchedly neglected and 
 postponed. They look <I>every one to his gain from his quarter,</I> 
 from his end or part of the work. They are for fain from every quarter
 (<I>Rem rem quocunque modo rem--Money, money, by fair means or by foul 
 we must have money</I>), but especially from their own quarter, where 
 they will be sure to take care that they lose nothing, nor miss any 
 thing that is to be got. If any one put not into their mouths they not 
 only will do him no service, but they <I>prepare war against him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+3:5">Mic. iii. 5</A>.

 5. They were perfect epicures, given to their pleasures, never so much
 in their element as in their drunken revels 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>Come</I> (say they), <I>I will fetch wine</I> (they have that at
 command; their cellars are better furnished than their closets) <I>and 
 we will fill ourselves,</I> or be drunk, <I>with strong drink.</I> They 
 were often drunk, not overseen (as we say) or overtaken in drink, but 
 designedly. The watchmen did thus invite and encourage one another to
 drink to excess, or they courted the people to sit and drink with them, 
 and so confirmed those in their wicked ways, and hardened their hearts, 
 whom they should have reproved. How could they think it any harm to be 
 drunk when the watchmen themselves joined with them and led them to it!

 6. They were very secure and confident of the continuance of their
 prosperity and ease; they said, "<I>To-morrow shall be as this day and 
 much more abundant;</I> we shall have as much to spend upon our lusts 
 to-morrow as we have to-day." They had no thought at all of their own 
 frailty and mortality, though they were shortening their days and 
 hastening their deaths by their excesses. They had no dread of the
 judgments of God, though they were daily provoking him and making 
 themselves liable to his wrath and curse. They never considered the 
 uncertainty of all the delights and enjoyments of sense, how they 
 perish in the using and pass away with the lusts of them. They resolved 
 to continue in this wicked course, whatever their consciences said to 
 the contrary, to be as merry to-morrow as they are to-day. <I>But boast 
 not thyself of to-morrow</I> when perhaps <I>this night thy soul shall 
 be required of thee.</I></P>
