 This chapter is concerning Tyre, an ancient wealthy city, situated upon
 the sea, and for many ages one of the most celebrated cities for trade
 and merchandise in those parts of the world. The lot of the tribe of
 Asher bordered upon it. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+19:29">Joshua xix. 29</A>,

 where it is called "the strong city Tyre." We seldom find it a
 dangerous enemy to Israel, but sometimes their faithful ally, as in the 
 reigns of David and Solomon; for trading cities maintain their 
 grandeur, not by the conquest of their neighbours, but by commerce with 
 them. In this chapter is foretold,

 I. The lamentable desolation of Tyre, which was performed by
 Nebuchadnezzar and the Chaldean army, about the time that they 
 destroyed Jerusalem; and a hard task they had of it, as appears 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:18">Ezek. xxix. 18</A>,

 where they are said to have "served a hard service against Tyre," and
 yet to have no wages,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:1-14">ver. 1-14</A>.

 II. The restoration of Tyre after seventy years, and the return of the
 Tyrians out of their captivity to their trade again,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is
 laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in: from the
 land of Chittim it is revealed to them.
 &nbsp; 2  Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants
 of Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.
 &nbsp; 3  And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the
 river, <I>is</I> her revenue; and she is a mart of nations.
 &nbsp; 4  Be thou ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea hath spoken, <I>even</I> the
 strength of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth
 children, neither do I nourish up young men, <I>nor</I> bring up
 virgins.
 &nbsp; 5  As at the report concerning Egypt, <I>so</I> shall they be sorely
 pained at the report of Tyre.
 &nbsp; 6  Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle.
 &nbsp; 7  <I>Is</I> this your joyous <I>city,</I> whose antiquity <I>is</I> of ancient
 days? her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn.
 &nbsp; 8  Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning
 <I>city,</I> whose merchants <I>are</I> princes, whose traffickers <I>are</I>
 the honourable of the earth?
 &nbsp; 9  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the pride of all
 glory, <I>and</I> to bring into contempt all the honourable of the
 earth.
 &nbsp; 10  Pass through thy land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish:
 <I>there is</I> no more strength.
 &nbsp; 11  He stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook the
 kingdoms: the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath given a commandment against the merchant
 <I>city,</I> to destroy the strong holds thereof.
 &nbsp; 12  And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed
 virgin, daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to Chittim; there
 also shalt thou have no rest.
 &nbsp; 13  Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not,
 <I>till</I> the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the
 wilderness: they set up the towers thereof, they raised up the
 palaces thereof; <I>and</I> he brought it to ruin.
 &nbsp; 14  Howl, ye ships of Tarshish: for your strength is laid waste.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Tyre being a sea-port town, this prophecy of its overthrow fitly begins 
 and ends with, <I>Howl, you ships of Tarshish;</I> for all its 
 business, wealth, and honour, depended upon its shipping; if that be 
 ruined, they will be all undone. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Tyre flourishing. This is taken notice of that her fall may appear 
 the more dismal. 

 1. <I>The merchants of Zidon,</I> who traded at sea, had at first
 <I>replenished her,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Zidon was the more ancient city, situated upon the same sea-cost, a few 
 leagues more to the north, and Tyre was at first only a colony of that; 
 but the daughter had outgrown the mother, and become much more 
 considerable. It may be a mortification to great cities to think how 
 they were at first replenished. 

 2. Egypt had helped very much to raise her,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Sihor was the river of Egypt: by that river, and the ocean into which 
 it ran, the Egyptians traded with Tyre; and the harvest of that river 
 was her revenue. The riches of the sea, and the gains by goods exported 
 and imported, are as much the harvest to trading towns as that of hay 
 and corn is to the country; and sometimes <I>the harvest of the 
 river</I> proves a better revenue than the harvest of the land. Or it
 may be meant of all the products of the Egyptian soil, which the men of 
 Tyre traded in, and which were the harvest of the river Nile, owing 
 themselves to the overflowing of that river. 

 3. She had become the mart of the nations, the great emporium of that
 part of the world. Some of every known nation might be found there,
 especially at certain times of the year, when there was a general 
 rendezvous of merchants. This is enlarged upon by another prophet,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:2,3">Ezek. xxvii. 2, 3</A>,

 &c. See how the hand of the diligent, by the blessing of God upon it,
 makes rich. Tyre became rich and great by industry, though she had no 
 other ploughs going than those that plough the waters. 

 4. She was a <I>joyous city,</I> noted for mirth and jollity,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Those that were so disposed might find there all manner of sports and 
 diversions, all the delights of the sons and daughters of men, balls, 
 and plays, and operas, and every thing of that kind that a man had a 
 fancy to. This made them secure and proud, and they despised the 
 country people, who neither knew nor relished any joys of that nature.
 This also made them very loth to believe and consider what warnings God 
 gave them by his servants; they were too merry to mind them. Her 
 <I>antiquity</I> likewise was <I>of ancient days,</I> and she was proud 
 of that, and that helped to make her secure; as if because she had been 
 a city time out of mind, and her antiquity had been of ancient days, 
 therefore she must continue a city time without end, and her 
 continuance must be to the days of eternity.

 5. She was <I>a crowning city</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 that crowned herself. Such were the power and pomp of her magistrates 
 that they crowned those who had dependence on her and dealings with 
 her. It is explained in the following words: <I>Her merchants are 
 princes,</I> and live like princes for the ease and state they take; 
 and <I>her traffickers,</I> whatever country they go to, <I>are the 
 honourable of the earth,</I> who are respected by all. How slightly 
 soever some now speak of tradesmen, it seems formerly, and among the 
 wisest nations, there were merchants, and traders, and men of business, 
 that were the honourable of the earth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is Tyre falling. It does not appear that she brought trouble 
 upon herself by provoking her neighbours with her quarrels, but rather 
 by tempting them with her wealth; but, if it was this that induced 
 Nebuchadnezzar to fall upon Tyre, he was disappointed; for after it had 
 stood out a siege of thirteen years, and could hold out no longer, the 
 inhabitants got away by sea, with their families and goods, to other 
 places where they had an interest, and left Nebuchadnezzar nothing but 
 the bare city. See a history of Tyre in Sir Walter Raleigh's History
 of the World, <I>lib.</I> 2. <I>cap.</I> 7. <I>sect.</I> 3, 43.
 <I>page.</I> 283, which will give much light to this prophecy and that
 in Ezekiel concerning Tyre.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. See how the destruction of Tyre is here foretold. 

 (1.) The haven shall be no convenient harbour for the reception of the
 ships of Tarshish, but all <I>laid waste</I>

 (1.), so that there shall be no house, no dock for the ships to ride
 in, no inns, or public houses for the seamen, no entering into the 
 port. Perhaps it was choked with sand or blocked up by the enemy. Or, 
 Tyre being destroyed and laid waste, the ships that used to come from 
 Tarshish and Chittim into that port shall now no more enter in; for 
 <I>it is revealed</I> or made known <I>to them,</I> they have received 
 the dismal news, that Tyre is destroyed and laid waste; so that there 
 is now no more business for them there. See how it is in this world; 
 those that are spoiled by their enemies are commonly slighted by their 
 old friends.

 (2.) The inhabitants are struck with astonishment. Tyre was an island.
 The inhabitants of it, who had made a mighty noise and bustle in the 
 world, and revelled with loud huzzas, shall now be still and silent

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);
 
 they shall sit down as mourners, so overwhelmed with grief that they 
 shall not be able to express it. Their proud boasts of themselves, and 
 defiances of their neighbours, shall be silenced. God can soon quiet 
 those, and strike them dumb, that are the noisy busy people of the 
 world. Be still; for God will do his work 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:10,Zec+2:13">Ps. xlvi. 10; Zech. ii. 13</A>),

 and you cannot resist him.

 (3.) The neighbours are amazed, blush, and are in pain for them:
 <I>Zidon is ashamed</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 by whom Tyre was at first replenished; for the rolling waves of the sea 
 brought to Zidon this news from Tyre; and there <I>the strength of the 
 sea,</I> a high spring-tide, proclaimed saying, "<I>I travail not, nor 
 bring forth children</I> now, as I have done. I do not now, as I used 
 to do, bring ship-loads of young people to Tyre, to be bred up there in 
 trade and business," which was the thing that had made Tyre so rich and 
 populous. Or the sea, that used to be loaded with fleets of ships
 about Tyre, shall not be as desolate as a sorrowful widow that is 
 bereaved of all her children, and has none about her to nourish and 
 bring up. Egypt indeed was a much larger and more considerable kingdom 
 than Tyre was; and yet Tyre had so large a correspondence, upon the 
 account of trade, that all the nations about shall be as much in pain, 
 upon the report of the ruin of that one city, as they would have been, 
 and not long after were, upon the report of the ruin of all Egypt, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Or, as some read it, <I>When the report shall reach to the Egyptians 
 they shall be sorely pained to hear it of Tyre,</I> both because of the 
 loss of their trade with that city and because it was a threatening 
 step towards their own ruin; when their neighbour's house was on fire 
 their own was in danger. 

 (4.) The merchants, as many as could, should transmit their effects to
 other places, and abandon Tyre, where they had raised their estates, 
 and thought they had made them sure

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):
 
 "<I>You</I> that have long been <I>inhabitants of this isle</I>" (for 
 it lay off in the sea about half a mile from the continent); "It is 
 time to howl now, for you must pass over to Tarshish. The best course 
 you can take is to make the best of your way to Tarshish, to the sea" 
 (to Taressus, a city in Spain; so some), "or to some other of your 
 plantations." Those that think their mountain stands strong, and cannot 
 be moved, will find that here they have no continuing city. <I>The 
 mountains shall depart and the hills be removed.</I> 

 (5.) Those that could not make their escape must expect no other than
 to be carried into captivity; for it was the way of conquerors, in 
 those times, to take those they conquered to be bondmen in their own 
 country, and send of their own to be freemen in theirs

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn;</I> they shall be 
 hurried away on foot into captivity, and many a weary step they shall 
 take towards their own misery. Those that have lived in the greatest 
 pomp and splendour know not what hardships they may be reduced to 
 before they die. 

 (6.) Many of those that attempted to escape should be pursued and fall
 into the hands of the enemy. Tyre shall <I>pass through her land as a 
 river</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 running down, one company after another, into the ocean or abyss of 
 misery. Or, though they hasten away as a river, with the greatest 
 swiftness, hoping to outrun the danger, yet <I>there is no more 
 strength;</I> they are quickly tired, and cannot get forward, but fall 
 an easy prey into the hands of the enemy. And, as Tyre has no more 
 strength, so her sister Zidon has no more comfort 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 "<I>Thou shalt no more rejoice, O oppressed virgin, daughter of 
 Zidon,</I> that art now ready to be overpowered by the victorious 
 Chaldeans! Thy turn is next; therefore <I>arise; pass over to 
 Chittim;</I> flee to Greece, to Italy, any where to shift for thy own 
 safety; yet <I>there also shalt thou have no rest;</I> thy enemies 
 shall disturb thee, and thy own fears shall disquiet thee, where thou 
 hopedst to find some repose." Note, We deceive ourselves if we promise 
 ourselves rest any where in this world. Those that are uneasy in one
 place will be so in another; and, when God's judgments pursue sinners, 
 they will overtake them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. But whence shall all this trouble come?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) God will be the author of it; it is a <I>destruction from the
 Almighty.</I> It will be asked 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 "<I>Who has taken this counsel against Tyre?</I> Who has contrived it? 
 Who has resolved it? Who can find in his heart to lay such a stately 
 lovely city in ruins? And how is it possible that its ruin should be 
 effected?" To this it will be answered, 

 [1.] God has designed it, who is infinitely wise and just, and never 
 did, nor ever will do, any wrong to any of his creatures

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>).

 <I>The Lord of hosts,</I> that has all things at his disposal and gives 
 not account of any of his matters, he <I>has purposed it.</I> It shall 
 be done according to the counsel of his will; and that which he aims at 
 herein is <I>to stain the pride of all glory,</I> to pollute it, 
 profane it, and throw it to be trodden upon; <I>and to bring into 
 contempt</I> and make despicable <I>all the honourable ones of the 
 earth,</I> that they may not admire themselves and be admired by others 
 as usual. God did not bring those calamities upon Tyre in a way of 
 sovereignty, to show an arbitrary and irresistible power; but he did it 
 to punish the Tyrians for their pride. Many other sins, no doubt, 
 reigned among them--idolatry, sensuality, and oppression; but the sin 
 of pride is fastened upon as that which was the particular ground of 
 God's controversy with Tyre; for he resists the proud. All the world 
 observing and being surprised at the desolation of Tyre, we have here 
 an exposition of it. God tells the world what he meant by it.
 <I>First,</I> He designed to convince men of the vanity and uncertainty 
 of all earthly glory, to show them what a withering, fading, perishing 
 thing it is even when it seems most substantial. It were well if men 
 would be thoroughly taught this lesson, though it were at the expense 
 of so great a destruction. Are men's learning and wealth, their pomp 
 and power, their interest in, and influence upon, all about them, their 
 glory? Are their stately houses, rich furniture, and splendid 
 appearances, their glory? Look up on the ruins of Tyre, and see all 
 this glory stained, and sullied, and buried in the dust. The honourable 
 ones of heaven will be for ever such; but see the grandees of Tyre, 
 some fled into banishment, others forced into captivity, and all 
 impoverished, and you will conclude that the honourable of the earth, 
 even the most honourable, know not how soon they may be brought into 
 contempt. <I>Secondly,</I> He designed hereby to prevent their being 
 proud of that glory, their being puffed up, and confident of the 
 continuance of it. Let the ruin of Tyre be a warning to all places and 
 persons to take heed of pride; for it proclaims to all the world that 
 he who exalts himself shall be abased. 

 [2.] God will do it, who has all power in his hand and can do it 
 effectually

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>He stretched out his hand over the sea.</I> He has done so many a 
 time, witness the dividing of the Red Sea and the drowning of Pharaoh 
 in it. He has often shaken the kingdoms that were most secure; and he 
 has now given commandment concerning this merchant-city, to destroy the 
 strongholds thereof. As its beauty shall not intercede for it, but that 
 shall be stained, so its strength shall not protect it, but that shall 
 be broken. If any think it strange that a city so well fortified, and 
 that has so many powerful allies, should be so totally ruined, let them 
 know that it is the Lord of hosts that has given a commandment to 
 destroy the strongholds thereof: and who can gainsay his orders or 
 hinder the execution of them?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The Chaldeans shall be the instruments of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Behold the land of the Chaldeans;</I> how easily they and their land 
 were destroyed by the Assyrians. Though their own hands <I>founded it, 
 set up the towers</I> of Babylon, and <I>raised up its palaces,</I> yet 
 the Assyrians brought it to ruin, whence the Tyrians might infer that 
 as easily as the old Chaldeans were subdued by the Assyrians so easily 
 shall Tyre be vanquished by those new Chaldeans. Babel was built by the 
 Assyrians for <I>those that dwelt in the wilderness.</I> It may be 
 rendered <I>for the ships</I> (the Assyrians founded it for ships and 
 shipmen that traffic upon those vast rivers Tigris and Euphrates to the 
 Persian and Indian seas), <I>for men of the desert,</I> for Babylon is 
 called the <I>desert of the sea,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:1"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 1</A>.

 Thus Tyrus was built upon the sea for the like purpose. But the
 Assyrians (says Dr. Lightfoot) brought that to ruin, now lately, in
 Hezekiah's time, and so shall Tyre hereafter be brought to ruin by 
 Nebuchadnezzar. If we looked more upon the falling and withering of 
 others, we should not be so confident as we commonly are of the 
 continuance of our own flourishing and standing.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be
 forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king: after
 the end of seventy years shall Tyre sing as a harlot.
 &nbsp; 16  Take a harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been
 forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest
 be remembered.
 &nbsp; 17  And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years,
 that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will visit Tyre, and she shall turn to her hire,
 and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The time fixed for the continuance of the desolations of Tyre, which 
 were not to be perpetual desolations: <I>Tyre shall be forgotten 
 seventy years,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 So long it shall lie neglected and buried in obscurity. It was 
 destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar much about the time that Jerusalem was, and 
 lay as long as it did in its ruins. See the folly of that proud 
 ambitious conqueror. What the richer, what the stronger, was he for 
 making himself master of Tyre, when all the inhabitants were driven out 
 of it and he had none of his own subjects to spare for the replenishing 
 and fortifying of it? It is surprising to see what pleasure men could 
 take in destroying cities and making <I>their memorial perish with 
 them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:6">Ps. ix. 6</A>.

 He trampled on the pride of Tyre, and therein served God's purpose; but
 with greater pride, for which God soon after humbled him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A prophecy of the restoration of Tyre to its glory again: <I>After 
 the end of seventy years, according to the years of one king,</I> or 
 one dynasty or family of kings, that of Nebuchadnezzar; when that 
 expired, the desolations of Tyre came to an end. And we may presume 
 that Cyrus at the same time when he released the Jews, and encouraged 
 them to rebuild Jerusalem, released the Tyrians also, and encouraged 
 them to rebuild Tyre. Thus the prosperity and adversity of places, as 
 well as persons, are <I>set the one over against the other,</I> that 
 the most glorious cities may not be secure nor the most ruinous 
 despair. It is foretold, 

 1. That God's providence shall gain smile upon this ruined city

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>The Lord will visit Tyre</I> in mercy; for, though he contend, he 
 will not contend for ever. It is not said, Her old acquaintance shall 
 visit her, the colonies she has planted, and the trading cities she has 
 had correspondence with (they have forgotten her); but, The Lord shall 
 visit her by some unthought-of turn; he shall cause his indignation 
 towards her to cease, and then things will run of course in their 
 former channel. 

 2. That she shall use her best endeavours to recover her trade again.
 She shall sing as a harlot, that has been some time under correction 
 for her lewdness; but, when she is set at liberty (so violent is the 
 bent of corruption), she will use her old arts of temptation. The 
 Tyrians having returned from their captivity, and those that remained 
 recovering new spirits thereupon, they shall contrive how to force a 
 trade, shall procure the best choice of goods, under-sell their 
 neighbours, and be obliging to all customers; as a harlot that has been 
 forgotten, when she comes to be spoken of again, recommends herself to 
 company by singing and playing, <I>takes a harp, goes about the 
 city,</I> perhaps in the night, serenading, <I>makes sweet melody, and 
 sings many songs.</I> These are innocent and allowable diversions, if 
 soberly, and moderately, and modestly used; but those that value 
 themselves upon their virtue should not be over-fond of them, nor 
 ambitious to excel in them, because, whatever they are now, anciently 
 they were some of the baits with which harlots used to entice fools.
 Tyre shall now by degrees come to be the mart of nations again; she 
 shall <I>return to her hire,</I> to her traffic, <I>and shall commit 
 fornication</I> (that is, she shall have dealings in trade, for the 
 prophet carries on the similitude of a harlot) <I>with all the kingdoms 
 of the world</I> that she had formerly traded with in her prosperity.
 The love of worldly wealth is a spiritual whoredom, and therefore 
 covetous people are called <I>adulterers and adulteresses</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:4">James iv. 4</A>),

 and covetousness is spiritual idolatry. 

 3. That, having recovered her trade again, she shall make a better use
 of it than she had done formerly; and this good she should get by her 
 calamities

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>Her merchandise, and her hire, shall be holiness to the Lord.</I> 
 The trade of Tyre, and all the gains of her trade, shall be devoted to 
 God and to his honour and employed in his service. It shall not be 
 treasured and hoarded up, as formerly, to be the matter of their pride 
 and the support of their carnal confidence; but it shall be laid out in 
 acts of piety and charity. What they can spare from the maintenance of 
 themselves and their families <I>shall be for those that dwell before 
 the Lord,</I> for the priests, the Lord's ministers, that attend in his 
 temple at Jerusalem; not to maintain them in pomp and grandeur, but 
 that they and theirs may <I>eat sufficiently,</I> may have food 
 convenient for them, with as little as may be of that care which would 
 divert them from their ministration, and that they may have, not rich 
 and fine clothing, but <I>durable clothing,</I> that which is strong 
 and lasting, <I>clothing for old men</I> (so some read it), as if the 
 priests, though they were young, must wear such plain grave clothing as 
 old men used to wear. Now, 

 (1.) This supposes that religion should be set up in New Tyre, that
 they should come to the knowledge of the true God and into communion 
 with the Israel of God. Perhaps their being fellow-captives with the 
 Jews in Babylon (who had prophets with them there) disposed them to 
 join with them in their worship there, and turned them from idols, as 
 it cured the Jews of their idolatry: and when they were released with 
 them, and as they had reason to believe for their sakes, when they were 
 settled again in Tyre, they would send gifts and offerings to the 
 temple, and presents to the priests. We find men of Tyre then dwelling 
 in the land of Judah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:16">Neh. xiii. 16</A>.

 Tyre and Sidon were better disposed to religion in Christ's time than
 the cities of Israel; for, if Christ had gone among them, <I>they would 
 have repented,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:21">Matt. xi. 21</A>.
 
 And we meet with Christians at Tyre

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:3,4">Acts xxi. 3, 4</A>),

 and, many years after, did Christianity flourish there. Some of the
 rabbin refer this prophecy of the conversion of Tyre to the days of the 
 Messiah.

 (2.) It directs those that have estates to make use of them in the
 service of God and religion, and to reckon that best laid up which is 
 so laid out. Both the merchandise of the tradesmen and the hire of the 
 day-labourers shall be devoted to God. Both the merchandise (the 
 employment we follow) and the hire (the gain of our employments) must 
 <I>be holiness to the Lord,</I> alluding to the motto engraven on the 
 frontlet of the high priest

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+39:30">Exod. xxxix. 30</A>),

 and to the separation of the tithe under the law,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+27:30">Lev. xxvii. 30</A>.

 See a promise like this referring to gospel times, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:20,21">Zech. xiv. 20, 21</A>.

 We must first give up ourselves to be holiness to the Lord before what 
 we do, or have, or get, can be so. When we abide with God in our
 particular callings, and do common actions after a godly sort--when we 
 abound in works of piety and charity, are liberal in relieving the 
 poor, and supporting the ministry, and encouraging the gospel--then our 
 merchandise and our hire are holiness to the Lord, if we sincerely look 
 at his glory in them. And our wealth need not be treasured and laid up
 on earth; for it is treasured and laid up in heaven, in <I>bags that 
 wax not old,</I>
