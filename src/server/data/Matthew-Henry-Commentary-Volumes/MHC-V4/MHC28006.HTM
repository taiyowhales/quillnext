 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The closing words of the foregoing chapter gave us some hopes that God
 and his Israel, notwithstanding their sins and his wrath, might yet be
 happily brought together again, that they would seek him and he would
 be found of them; now this chapter carries that matter further, and
 some join the beginning of this chapter with the end of that, "They
 will seek me early," saying, "Come and let us return." But God doth
 again complain of the wickedness of this people; for, though some did
 repent and reform, the greater part continued obstinate. Observe,

 I. Their resolution to return to God, and the comforts wherewith they
 encourage themselves in their return,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. The instability of many of them in their professions and promises
 of repentance, and the severe course which God therefore took with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:4,5">ver. 4, 5</A>.

 III. The covenant God made with them, and his expectations from them
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:6">ver. 6</A>);

 their violation of that covenant and frustrating those expectations,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:7-11">ver. 7-11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Come, and let us return unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: for he hath torn, and
 he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.
 &nbsp; 2  After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will
 raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.
 &nbsp; 3  Then shall we know, <I>if</I> we follow on to know the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: his
 going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us
 as the rain, as the latter <I>and</I> former rain unto the earth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These may be taken either as the words of the prophet to the people, 
 calling them to repentance, or as the words of the people to one 
 another, exciting and encouraging one another to <I>seek the Lord,</I> 
 and to humble themselves before him, in hopes of finding mercy with 
 him. God had said, <I>In their affliction they will seek me;</I> now 
 the prophet, and the good people his friends, would strike while the 
 iron was hot, and set in with the convictions their neighbours seemed 
 to be under. Note, Those who are disposed to turn to God themselves 
 should do all they can to excite, and engage, and encourage others to 
 return to him. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What it is they engage to do: "<I>Come, and let us return to the 
 Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Let us go no more to the Assyrian, nor send to king Jareb; we have had 
 enough of that. But let us <I>return to the Lord,</I> return to the 
 worship of him from our idolatries, and to our hope in him from all our 
 confidences in the creature." Note, It is the great concern of those 
 who have revolted from God to return to him. And those who have gone 
 from him by consent, and in a body, drawing one another to sin, should 
 by consent, and in a body, return to him, which will be for his glory 
 and their mutual edification.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What inducements and encouragements to do this they fasten upon, to 
 stir up one another with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The experience they had had of his displeasure: "Let us return to 
 him, for <I>he has torn, he has smitten.</I> We have been torn, and it 
 was he that tore us; we have been smitten, and it was he that smote us. 
 <I>Therefore</I> let us return to him, because it is for our revolts 
 from him that he has torn and smitten us in anger, and we cannot expect 
 that he should be reconciled to us till we return to him; and for this 
 end he has afflicted us thus, that we might be wrought upon to return 
 to him. His hand will be stretched out still against us if the people 
 <I>turn not to him that smites them,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:12,13">Isa. ix. 12, 13</A>.

 Note, The consideration of the judgments of God upon us and our land,
 especially when they are tearing judgments, should awaken us to return 
 to God by repentance, and prayer, and reformation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The expectation they had of his favour: "He that has torn will 
 <I>heal us,</I> he that has smitten will <I>bind us up,</I>" as the 
 skilful surgeon with a tender hand binds up the broken bone or bleeding 
 wound. Note, The same providence of God that afflicts his people 
 relieves them, and the same Spirit of God that convinces the saints 
 comforts them; that which is first <I>a Spirit of bondage</I> is 
 afterwards <I>a Spirit of adoption.</I> This is an acknowledgement of 
 the power of God (he can heal though we be ever so ill torn), and of 
 his mercy (he will do it); nay, <I>therefore</I> he has torn that he 
 may heal. Some think this points particularly to the return of the Jews 
 out of Babylon, when they sought the Lord, and joined themselves to 
 him, in the prospect of his gracious return to them in a way of mercy. 
 Note, It will be of great use to us, both for our support under our 
 afflictions and for our encouragement in our repentance, to keep up 
 good thoughts of God and of his purposes and designs concerning us. Now 
 this favour of God which they are here in expectation of is described 
 in several instances:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They promise themselves that their deliverance out of their 
 troubles should be to them as <I>life from the dead</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>After two days he will revive us</I> (that is, in a short time, in 
 a day or two), <I>and the third day,</I> when it is expected that the 
 dead body should putrefy and corrupt, and be buried <I>out of our 
 sight,</I> then will he <I>raise us up,</I> and <I>we shall live in his 
 sight,</I> we shall see his face with comfort and it shall be reviving 
 to us. Though he <I>forsake</I> for <I>a small moment,</I> he will 
 <I>gather</I> with <I>everlasting kindness.</I>" Note, The people of 
 God may not only be torn and smitten, but left for dead, and may lie so 
 a great while; but they shall not always lie so, nor shall they long 
 lie so; God will in a little time revive them; and the assurance given 
 them of this should engage them to return and adhere to him. But this 
 seems to have a further reference to the resurrection of Jesus Christ; 
 and the time limited is expressed by <I>two days</I> and the <I>third 
 day,</I> that it may be a type and figure of Christ's rising the 
 <I>third day,</I> which he is said to do <I>according to the 
 scriptures,</I> according to this scripture; for all the prophets 
 testified of <I>the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should 
 follow.</I> Let us see and admire the wisdom and goodness of God, in 
 ordering the prophet's words so that when he foretold the deliverance 
 of the church out of her troubles he should at the same time point out 
 our salvation by Christ, which other salvations were both figures and 
 fruits of; and, though they might not be aware of this mystery in the 
 words, yet now that they are fulfilled in the letter of them in the 
 resurrection of Christ it is a confirmation to our faith that <I>this 
 is he that should come,</I> and we are to <I>look for no other.</I> And 
 it is every way suitable that a prophecy of Christ's rising should be 
 thus expressed, "He will raise <I>us</I> up, and <I>we</I> shall live," 
 for Christ rose as the first-fruits, and we revive with him, we live 
 through him; he rose for our justification, and all believers are said 
 to be <I>risen with Christ.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:19">Isa. xxvi. 19</A>.

 And it would serve for a comfort to the church then, and an assurance
 that God would raise them out of their low estate, for in his fulness 
 of time he would raise his Son from the grave, who would be the life 
 and glory of his people Israel. Note, A regard by faith to a rising 
 Christ is a great support to a suffering Christian, and gives abundant 
 encouragement to a repenting returning sinner; for he has said, 
 <I>Because I live, you shall live also.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That then they shall improve in the knowledge of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):
 
 <I>Then shall we know, if we follow on to know, the Lord. Then,</I> 
 when God returns in mercy to his people and designs favour for them, he 
 will, as a pledge and fruit of his favour, give them more of the 
 knowledge of himself; the earth shall be <I>full of that knowledge,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:9">Isa. xi. 9</A>.
 
 <I>Knowledge shall be increased,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+12:4">Dan. xii. 4</A>.

 <I>All shall know God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:34">Jer. xxxi. 34</A>.

 <I>We shall know, we shall follow to know, the Lord,</I> (so the words
 are); and it may be taken as the fruit of Christ's resurrection, and 
 the life we live in God's sight by him, that we shall have not only 
 greater means of knowledge, but grace to improve in knowledge by those 
 means. Note, When God designs mercy for a people he gives them <I>a 
 heart to know him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+24:7">Jer. xxiv. 7</A>.

 Those that have <I>risen with Christ</I> have the spirit of wisdom and
 revelation given them. And if we understand our living in his sight, as 
 the Chaldee paraphrast does, of the day of the resurrection of the 
 dead, it fitly follows, <I>We shall know, we shall follow to know, the 
 Lord;</I> for in that day we shall see him be perfected, and yet be 
 eternally increasing. Or, taking it as we read it, <I>If we follow on 
 to know,</I> we have here,

 [1.] A precious blessing promised: <I>Then shall we know,</I> shall 
 <I>know the Lord,</I> then when <I>we return to God;</I> those that 
 come to God shall be brought into an acquaintance with him. When we are 
 designed to <I>live in his sight,</I> then he gives us to know him; for 
 this is <I>life eternal to know God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:3">John xvii. 3</A>.

 [2.] The way and means of obtaining this blessing. We must <I>follow on 
 to know</I> him. We must value and esteem the knowledge of God as the 
 best knowledge, we must <I>cry after it,</I> and <I>dig for it</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:3,4">Prov. ii. 3, 4</A>),

 must <I>seek and intermeddle with all wisdom</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:1">Prov. xviii. 1</A>),

 and must proceed in our enquiries after this knowledge and our 
 endeavours to improve in it. And, if we do the prescribed duty, we
 have reason to expect the promised mercy, that we shall know more and 
 more of God, and be at last perfect in this knowledge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) That then they shall abound in divine consolations: <I>His going 
 forth is prepared as the morning,</I> that is, the returns of his 
 favour, which he had withdrawn from us when he went and <I>returned to 
 his place.</I> His out-goings again are prepared and secured to us as 
 firmly as the return of the morning after a dark night, and we expect 
 it, as those do that <I>wait for the morning</I> after a long night, 
 and are sure that it will come at the time appointed and will not fail; 
 and the light of his countenance will be both welcome to us and growing 
 upon us, unto the perfect day, as the light of the morning is. <I>He 
 shall come to us,</I> and be welcome to us, <I>as the rain, as the 
 latter and former rain unto the earth,</I> which refreshes it and makes 
 it fruitful. Now this looks further than their deliverance out of 
 captivity, and, no doubt, was to have its full accomplishment in 
 Christ, and the grace of the gospel. The Old-Testament saints 
 <I>followed on to know him,</I> earnestly looked for redemption in 
 Jerusalem; and at length the out-goings of divine grace in him, in his 
 going forth to visit this world, were 

 [1.] As the morning to this earth when it is dark for he went forth as 
 the <I>sun of righteousness,</I> and in him <I>the day-spring from on 
 high visited us. His going forth was prepared as the morning,</I> for 
 he came in the fulness of time; John Baptist was his fore-runner, nay, 
 he was himself the <I>bright and morning star.</I>

 [2.] As the rain to this earth when it is <I>dry. He shall come down as 
 the rain upon the mown grass,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:6">Ps. lxxii. 6</A>.

 In him showers of blessings descend upon this world, which <I>give seed
 to the sower and bread to the eater,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:10">Isa. lv. 10</A>.

 And the favour of God in Christ is what is said of the king's favour,
 <I>like the cloud of the latter rain,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+16:15">Prov. xvi. 15</A>.

 The grace of God in Christ is both the <I>latter and the former 
 rain,</I> for by it the good work of our fruit-bearing is both begun 
 and carried on.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I
 do unto thee? for your goodness <I>is</I> as a morning cloud, and as
 the early dew it goeth away.
 &nbsp; 5  Therefore have I hewed <I>them</I> by the prophets; I have slain
 them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments <I>are as</I> the
 light <I>that</I> goeth forth.
 &nbsp; 6  For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of
 God more than burnt offerings.
 &nbsp; 7  But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have
 they dealt treacherously against me.
 &nbsp; 8  Gilead <I>is</I> a city of them that work iniquity, <I>and is</I>
 polluted with blood.
 &nbsp; 9  And as troops of robbers wait for a man, <I>so</I> the company of
 priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.
 &nbsp; 10  I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel: there
 <I>is</I> the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.
 &nbsp; 11  Also, O Judah, he hath set a harvest for thee, when I
 returned the captivity of my people.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two things, two evil things, both Judah and Ephraim are here charged 
 with, and justly accused of:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That they were not firm to their own convictions, but were unsteady, 
 <I>unstable as water,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 <I>O Ephraim! what shall I do unto thee? O Judah! what shall I do unto 
 thee?</I> This is a strange expression. Can Infinite Wisdom be at a 
 loss what to do? Can it be nonplussed, or put upon taking new measures? 
 By no means; but God speaks after the manner of men, to show how absurd 
 and unreasonable they were, and how just his proceedings against them 
 were. Let them not complain of him as harsh and severe in tearing them, 
 and smiting them, as he has done; for what else should he do? What 
 other course could he take with them? God had tried various methods 
 with them (<I>What could have been done more to his vineyard than he 
 had done?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:4">Isa. v. 4</A>),

 and very loth he was to let things go to extremity; he reasons with
 himself (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:9"><I>ch.</I> xi. 9</A>),

 <I>How shall I give thee up, Ephraim?</I> God would have done them
 good, but they were not qualified for it: "<I>What shall I do unto 
 thee?</I> What else can I do but cast thee off, when I cannot in honour 
 save thee?" Note, God never destroys sinners till he sees there is no 
 other way with them. See here, 

 1. What their conduct was towards God: <I>Their goodness,</I> or
 <I>kindness,</I> was <I>as the morning cloud.</I> Some understand it of 
 their kindness to themselves and their own souls, in their repentance; 
 it is indeed mercy to ourselves to repent of our sins, but they soon 
 retracted that kindness to themselves, undid it again, and wronged 
 their own souls as much as ever. But it is rather to be taken for their 
 piety and religion; what good appeared in them sometimes, it soon 
 vanished and disappeared again, <I>as the morning cloud and the early 
 dew.</I> Such was the goodness of Israel in Jehu's time, and of Judah 
 in Hezekiah's and Josiah's time; it was soon gone. In time of drought 
 the <I>morning-cloud</I> promises rain, and the <I>early dew</I> is 
 some present refreshment to the earth; but the cloud is dispersed (and 
 hypocrites are compared to <I>clouds without water,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:12">Jude 12</A>)

 and the dew does not soak into the ground, but is drawn back again into
 the air, and the earth is parched still. What shall he do with them? 
 Shall he accept their goodness? No, for it <I>passes away;</I> and 
 <I>factum non dicitur quod non perseverat--that which does not continue 
 can scarcely be said to be done.</I> Note, That goodness will never be 
 either pleasing to God or profitable to ourselves which is as the 
 morning cloud and the early dew. When men promise fair and do not 
 perform, when they begin well in religion and do not hold on, when they 
 leave their first love and their first works, or, though they do not 
 quite cast off religion, are yet unsteady, uneven, and inconstant in 
 it, then is their <I>goodness as the morning cloud and the early 
 dew.</I>

 2. What course God had taken with them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):
 
 "<I>Therefore,</I> because they were so rough and ill-shapen, <I>I have 
 hewn them by the prophets,</I> as timber or stone is hewn for use; <I>I 
 have slain them by the words of my mouth.</I>" What the prophets did 
 was done by the word of God in their mouths, which never returned void.
 By it they thought themselves slain, were ready to say that the 
 prophets killed them, or cut them to the heart when they dealt 
 faithfully with them. 

 (1.) The prophets hewed them by convictions of sin, endeavouring to cut 
 off their transgressions from them. They were uneven in religion 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 therefore God hewed them. The hearts of sinners are not only as stone, 
 but as rough stone, which requires a great deal of pains to bring it 
 into shape, or as knotty timber, that is not squared without a great 
 deal of difficulty; ministers' work is to hew them, and God by the 
 minister hews them, <I>for with the froward will he show himself 
 froward.</I> And there are those whom ministers must rebuke sharply; 
 every word should cut, and though the chips fly in the face of the 
 workman, though the reproved fly in the face of the reprover and reckon 
 him an enemy because he tells the truth, yet he goes on with his work.

 (2.) They slew them by the denunciations of wrath, foretelling that
 they should be slain, as Ezekiel is said to destroy the city when he 
 prophesied of the destruction of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:3">Ezek. xliii. 3</A>.

 And God accomplished that which was foretold: "<I>I have slain them</I>
 by my judgments, according to the words of my mouth." Note, The word of 
 God will be the death either of the sin or of the sinner, a savour 
 either of life unto life or of death unto death. Some read it, "<I>I 
 have hewn the prophets, and slain them by the words of my mouth,</I> 
 that is, I have employed them in laborious service for the people's 
 good, which has wasted their strength; they have spent themselves, and 
 hews away all their spirits, in their work, and in hazardous service, 
 which has cost many of them their lives." Note, Ministers are the tools 
 which God makes use of in working upon people; and, though with many 
 they labour in vain, yet God will reckon for the wearing out of his 
 tools.

 (3.) God was hereby justified in the severest proceedings against them 
 afterwards. His prophets had taken a great deal of pains with them, had 
 admonished them of their sin and warned them of their danger, but the 
 means used had not the desired effect; some good impressions perhaps 
 were made for the present, but they wore off, and passed away as the 
 morning cloud, and now they cannot charge God with severity if he bring 
 upon them the miseries threatened. The prophet turns to him and 
 acknowledges, <I>Thy judgments are as the light that goes forth,</I> 
 evidently just and righteous. Note, Though sinners be not reclaimed by 
 the pains that ministers take with them, yet thereby God will be 
 <I>justified when he speaks and clear when he judges.</I> See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:17-19">Matt. xi. 17-19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That they were not faithful to God's covenant with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.
 
 Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What the covenant was that God made with them, and upon what terms 
 they should obtain his favour and be accepted of him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>I desired mercy and not sacrifice</I> (that is, rather than 
 sacrifice), and insisted upon <I>the knowledge of God more than</I> 
 upon <I>burnt-offerings. Mercy</I> here is the same word which in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>

 is rendered <I>goodness--chesed--piety, sanctity;</I> it is put for all
 practical religion; it is the same with <I>charity</I> in the New 
 Testament, the reigning love of God and our neighbour, and this 
 accompanied with and flowing from the <I>knowledge of God,</I> as he 
 has revealed himself in his word, a firm belief that he is, and is the 
 <I>rewarder of those that diligently seek him,</I> a good affection to 
 divine things guided by a good judgment, which cannot but produce a 
 very good conversation; this is that which God by his covenant 
 requires, and <I>not sacrifice and offering.</I> This is fully 
 explained, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:22,23">Jer. vii. 22, 23</A>.

 <I>I spoke not to your fathers concerning burnt-offerings</I> (that was
 the smallest of the matters I spoke to them of, and on which the least 
 stress was laid), but <I>this I said, Obey my voice,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:6-8">Mic. vi. 6-8</A>.

 To love God and our neighbour is <I>better than all burnt offering and
 sacrifice,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:33,Ps+51:16,17">Mark xii. 33; Ps. li. 16, 17</A>.

 Not but that sacrifice and offering were required, and to be paid, and
 had their use, and, when they were accompanied with mercy and the 
 knowledge of God, were acceptable to him, but, without them, God 
 regarded them not, he despised them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:10,11">Isa. i. 10, 11</A>.

 Perhaps this is mentioned here to show a difference between the God
 whom they deserted and the gods whom they went over to. The true God 
 aimed at nothing but that they should be good men, and live good lives 
 for their own good, and the ceremony of honouring him with sacrifices 
 was one of the smallest matters of his law; whereas the false gods 
 required that only; let their priests and altars be regaled with 
 sacrifices and offerings, and the people might live as they listed. 
 What fools were those then that left a God who aimed at giving his 
 worshippers a new nature, for gods who aimed at nothing but making 
 themselves a new name! It is mentioned likewise to show that God's 
 controversy with them was not for the omission of sacrifices (<I>I will 
 not reprove thee for them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:8">Ps. l. 8</A>),

 but because there was no <I>justice, nor mercy,</I> nor <I>knowledge of
 God,</I> among them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:1"><I>ch.</I> iv. 1</A>),

 and to teach us all that the <I>power of godliness</I> is the main
 thing God looks at and requires, and without it the <I>form of 
 godliness</I> is of no avail. Serious piety in the heart and life is
 the <I>one thing needful,</I> and, separate from that, the performances 
 of devotion, though ever so plausible, ever so costly, are of no 
 account. Our Saviour quotes this to show that moral duties are to be 
 preferred before rituals whenever they come in competition, and to 
 justify himself in <I>eating with publicans and sinners,</I> because it 
 was in mercy to the souls of men, and in healing on the sabbath day, 
 because it was in mercy to the bodies of men, to which the ceremony of 
 singularity in eating and the sabbath-rest must give way, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:13,12:7">Matt. ix. 13; xii. 7</A>.</P>

 2. How little they had regarded this covenant, though it was so well 
 ordered in all things, though they, and not God, would be the gainers 
 by it. See here what came of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) In general, they broke with God, and proved unfaithful; there were
 <I>good things committed</I> to them to keep, the jewels of mercy and 
 piety, and the knowledge of God, in the cabinet of sacrifice and 
 burnt-offering, but they betrayed their trust, kept the cabinet, but 
 pawned the jewels for the gratification of a base lust, and this is 
 that for which God has justly a quarrel with them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>They, like men, have transgressed the covenant,</I> that covenant 
 which God made with them; they have broken the conditions of it, and so 
 forfeited the benefit of it. By casting off mercy and the knowledge of 
 God, and other instances of disobedience,

 [1.] They had contracted the guilt of perjury and covenant-breaking; 
 they were like men that transgress a covenant by which they had 
 solemnly bound themselves, which is a thing that all the world cries 
 out shame on; men that have done so deserve not again to be valued, or 
 trusted, or dealt with. "<I>There,</I> in that thing, <I>they have 
 dealt treacherously against me;</I> they have been perfidious, base, 
 and false children, in whom is no faith, though I depended upon their 
 being <I>children that would not lie.</I>"

 [2.] In this they had but acted like themselves, <I>like men,</I> who 
 are generally false and fickle, and in whose nature (their corrupt 
 nature) it is to deal treacherously; <I>all men are liars,</I> and they 
 are like the rest of that degenerate race, <I>all gone aside,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:2,3">Ps. xiv. 2, 3</A>.

 They have <I>transgressed the covenant</I> like <I>men</I> (like the
 Gentiles that transgressed the covenant of nature), like <I>mean 
 men</I> (the word here used is sometimes put for <I>men of low 
 degree</I>); they have dealt deceitfully, like base men that have no 
 sense of honour.

 [3.] Herein they trod in the steps of our first parents: <I>They, like 
 Adam, have transgressed the covenant</I> (so it might very well be 
 read); as he transgressed the covenant of innocency, so they 
 transgressed the covenant of grace, so treacherously, so foolishly; 
 <I>there</I> in paradise he violated his engagements to God, and there 
 in Canaan, another paradise, they violated their engagements. And by
 their treacherous dealing they, like Adam, have ruined themselves and 
 theirs. Note, Sin is so much the worse the more there is in it of the 
 <I>similitude of Adam's transgression,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:14">Rom. v. 14</A>.

 [4.] Low thoughts of God and of his authority and favour were at the 
 bottom of all this; for so some read it: <I>They have transgressed the 
 covenant, as of a man,</I> as if it had been but the covenant of a man, 
 that stood upon even ground with them, as if the commands of the 
 covenant were but like those of a man like themselves, and the kindness 
 conveyed by it no more valuable than that of a man. There is something 
 sacred and binding in <I>a man's covenant</I> (as the apostle shows,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:15">Gal. iii. 15</A>),

 but much more in the covenant of God, which yet they made small account
 of; and <I>there</I> in that covenant they <I>dealt treacherously,</I> 
 promised fair, but performed nothing. Dealing treacherously with God is 
 here called dealing treacherously against him, for it is both an 
 affront and an opposition. Deserters are traitors, and will be so 
 treated; the revolting heart is a rebellious heart.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Some particular instances of their treachery are here given: 
 <I>There they dealt treacherously,</I> that is, in the places hereafter 
 named 

 [1.] Look on the other side Jordan, to the country which lay most 
 exposed to the insults of the neighbouring nations, and where therefore 
 the people were concerned to keep themselves under the divine 
 protection, and yet there you will find the most daring provocations of 
 the divine Majesty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Gilead, which lay in the lot of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh, was 
 <I>a city of the workers of iniquity.</I> Wickedness was the trade that 
 was driven there; the country was called <I>Gilead,</I> but it was all 
 called a <I>city,</I> because they were all as it were incorporated in 
 one society of rebels against God. Or (as most think) Ramoth Gilead is
 the city here meant, one of the three cities of refuge on the other 
 side Jordan, and a Levites' city; the inhabitants of it, though of the 
 sacred tribe, were <I>workers of iniquity,</I> contrived it, and 
 practised it. Note, It is bad indeed when a Levites' city is <I>a city
 of those that work iniquity,</I> when those that are to preach good 
 doctrine live bad lives. Particularly it is <I>polluted with blood,</I> 
 as if that were a sin which the wicked Levites were in a special manner 
 guilty of. In popish countries the clergy are observed to be the most 
 bloody persecutors. Or, as it was a <I>city of refuge,</I> by abusing 
 the power it had to judge of murders it became <I>polluted with 
 blood.</I> They would, for a bribe, protect those that were guilty of 
 wilful murder, whom they ought to have put to death, and would deliver 
 those to the avenger of blood who were guilty but of chance-medley, if 
 they were poor and had nothing to give them; and both these ways they 
 were <I>polluted with blood.</I> Note, Blood defiles the land where it 
 is shed, and where no inquisition is made or no vengeance taken for it. 
 See how the best institutions, that are ever so well designed to keep 
 the balance even between justice and mercy, are capable of being abused 
 and perverted to the manifest prejudice and violation of both.

 [2.] Look among those whose business it was to minister in holy things, 
 and they were as bad as the worst and as vile as the vilest 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):
 
 <I>The company of priests</I> are so, not here and there one that is 
 the scandal of his order, but the whole order and body of them, the 
 <I>priests</I> go all one way <I>by consent, with one shoulder</I> (as 
 the word is), one and all; and they make one another worse, more 
 daring, and fierce, and impudent, in sin, more crafty and more cruel. A 
 <I>company of priests</I> will say and do that in conspiracy which none 
 of them would dare to say or do singly. The <I>companies of priests</I> 
 were as <I>troops of robbers,</I> as <I>banditti,</I> or gangs of 
 highwaymen, that cut men's throats to get their money. <I>First,</I> 
 They were cruel and blood-thirsty. They <I>murder</I> those that they 
 have a pique against, or that stand in their way; nothing less will 
 satisfy them. <I>Secondly,</I> They were cunning. They <I>laid wait</I> 
 for men, that they might have a fair opportunity to compass their 
 mischievous malicious designs; thus the company of priests laid wait 
 for Christ to take him, saying, <I>Not on the feast-day. Thirdly,</I> 
 They were concurring as one man: <I>They murder in the way;</I> in the 
 highway, where travellers should be safe, there <I>they murder by 
 consent,</I> aiding and abetting one another in it. See how unanimous 
 wicked people are in doing mischief; and should not good people be so 
 then in doing good? <I>They murder in the way to Shechem</I> (so the 
 margin reads it, as a proper name) such as were going to Jerusalem (for 
 that way Shechem lay) to worship. Or <I>in the way to Shechem</I> (some 
 think) means in the same manner that their father Levi, with Simeon his 
 brother, murdered the Shechemites 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+34:1-31">Gen. xxxiv.</A>),

 by fraud and deceit; and some understand it of their destroying the
 souls of men by drawing them to sin. <I>Fourthly,</I> They did it with 
 contrivance: <I>They commit lewdness;</I> the word signifies such 
 wickedness as is committed with deliberation, and of malice prepense, 
 as we say. The more there is of device and design in sin the worse it 
 is.

 [3.] Look into the body of the people, take a view of the whole house 
 of Israel, and they are all alike 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel,</I> and, though 
 it be ever so artfully managed, God discovers it, and will discover it 
 to them; and who can deny that which God himself says that he has seen?
 <I>There is the whoredom of Ephraim,</I> both corporal and spiritual 
 whoredom; there it is too plain to be denied. Note, The sin of sinners, 
 especially sinners of the house of Israel, has enough in it to make 
 them tremble, for it is a horrible thing, it is amazing, and it is 
 threatening, enough to make them blush, for Israel is thereby defiled 
 and rendered odious in the sight of God.

 [4.] Look into Judah, and you find them sharing with Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):
 
 <I>Also, O Judah! he has set a harvest for thee;</I> thou must be 
 reckoned with as well as Ephraim; thou art ripe for destruction too, 
 and the time, even the set time, of thy destruction is hastening on, 
 when thou that hast <I>ploughed iniquity,</I> and <I>sown 
 wickedness,</I> shalt <I>reap the same.</I> The general judgment is 
 compared to <I>a harvest</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:39">Matt. xiii. 39</A>),
 
 so are particular judgments,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:13,Re+14:15">Joel iii. 13; Rev. xiv. 15</A>.

 I have appointed a time to call thee to account, even <I>when I 
 returned the captivity of my people,</I> that is, when those captives 
 of Judah which were taken by the men of Israel were restored, in 
 obedience to the command of God sent them by Oded the prophet, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:8-15">2 Chron. xxviii. 8-15</A>.

 When God spared them that time he <I>set them a harvest,</I> that is,
 he designed to reckon with them another time for all together. Note,
 Preservations from present judgments, if a good use be not made of 
 them, are but reservations for greater judgments.</P>
