 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE</FONT> book of Ezekiel left the affairs of Jerusalem 
 under a doleful aspect, all in ruins, but with a joyful prospect of all 
 in glory again. This of Daniel fitly follows. Ezekiel told us what was 
 seen, and what was foreseen, by him in the former years of the 
 captivity: Daniel tells us what was seen, and foreseen, in the latter
 years of the captivity. When God employs different hands, yet it is 
 about the same work. And it was a comfort to the poor captives that 
 they had first one prophet among them and then another, to show them 
 <I>how long,</I> and a sign that God had not quite cast them off. Let 
 us enquire, 

 I. Concerning this prophet His Hebrew name was <I>Daniel,</I> which 
 signifies the <I>judgment of God;</I> his Chaldean name was 
 <I>Belteshazzar.</I> He was of the tribe of Judah, and, as it should 
 seem, of the royal family. He was betimes eminent for wisdom and piety. 
 Ezekiel, his contemporary, but much his senior, speaks of him as an 
 oracle when thus he upbraids the king of Tyre with his conceitedness of 
 himself: <I>Thou art wiser then Daniel,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:3">Ezek. xxxviii. 3</A>.

 He is likewise there celebrated for success in prayer, when Noah, 
 Daniel, and Job are reckoned as three men that had the greatest 
 interest in heaven of any, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:14">Ezek. xiv. 14</A>.

 He began betimes to be famous, and continued long so. Some of the 
 Jewish rabbin are loth to acknowledge him to be a prophet of the higher 
 form, and therefore rank his book among the <I>Hagiographa,</I> not 
 among the prophecies, and would not have their disciples pay much 
 regard to it. One reason they pretend is because he did not live such a 
 mean mortified life as Jeremiah and some other of the prophets did, but 
 lived like a prince, and was a prime-minister of state; whereas we find 
 him persecuted as other prophets were

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:1-28"><I>ch.</I> vi.</A>),
 
 and mortifying himself as other prophets did, when he <I>ate no
 pleasant bread</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:3"><I>ch.</I> x. 3</A>),

 and fainting sick when he was under the power of the Spirit of
 prophecy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:27"><I>ch.</I> viii. 27</A>.

 Another reason they pretend is because he wrote his book in a heathen
 country, and <I>there</I> had his visions, and not in the land of 
 Israel; but, for the same reason, Ezekiel also must be expunged out of 
 the roll of prophets. But the true reason is that he speaks so plainly 
 of the time of the Messiah's coming that the Jews cannot avoid the 
 conviction of it and therefore do not care to hear of it. But Josephus 
 calls him one of the <I>greatest</I> of <I>the prophets,</I> nay, the 
 angel Gabriel calls him a <I>man greatly beloved.</I> He lived long an 
 active life in the courts and councils of some of the greatest monarchs 
 the world ever had, Nebuchadnezzar, Cyrus, Darius; for we mistake of we 
 confine the privilege of an intercourse with heaven to speculative men, 
 or those that spend their time in contemplation; no, who was more 
 intimately acquainted with the mind of God than Daniel, a courtier, a 
 statesman, and a man of business? The Spirit, as the wind, blows where 
 it lists. And, if those that have much to do in the world plead that
 as an excuse for the infrequency and slightness of their converse with 
 God, Daniel will condemn them. Some have thought that he returned to 
 Jerusalem, and was one of the masters of the Greek synagogue; but 
 nothing of that appears in scripture; it is therefore generally 
 concluded that he died in Persia at Susan, where he lived to be very 
 old. 

 II. Concerning this book. The first six chapters of it are historical,
 and are plain and easy; the last six are prophetical, and in them are 
 many things dark, and hard to be understood, which yet would be more 
 intelligible if we had a more complete history of the nations, and 
 especially the Jewish nation, from Daniel's time to the coming of the 
 Messiah. Our Saviour intimates the difficulty of apprehending the sense 
 of Daniel's prophecies when, speaking of them, he says, <I>Let him that 
 readeth understand,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:15">Matt. xxiv. 15</A>.

 The first chapter, and the first three verses of the second chapter, 
 are in Hebrew; thence to the eighth chapter is in the Chaldee dialect; 
 and thence to the end is in Hebrew. Mr. Broughton observes that, as
 the Chaldeans were kind to Daniel, and gave cups of cold water to him 
 when he requested it, rather than the king's wine, God would not have 
 them lose their reward, but made that language which they taught him to 
 have honour in his writings through all the world, unto this day. 
 Daniel, according to his computation, continues the holy story from the 
 first surprising of Jerusalem by the Chaldean Babel, when he himself 
 was carried away captive, until the last destruction of it by Rome, the 
 mystical Babel, for so far forward his predictions look,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:27"><I>ch.</I> ix. 27</A>.

 The fables of Susannah, and of Bel and the Dragon, in both which Daniel
 is made a party, are apocryphal stories, which we think we have no 
 reason to give any credit to, they being never found in the Hebrew or 
 Chaldee, but only in the Greek, nor ever admitted by the Jewish church. 
 There are some both of the histories and of the prophecies of this book 
 that bear date in the latter end of the Chaldean monarchy, and others 
 of both that are dated in the beginning of the Persian monarchy. But 
 both Nebuchadnezzar's dream, which Daniel interpreted, and his own 
 visions, point at the Grecian and Roman monarchies, and very 
 particularly at the Jews' troubles under Antiochus, which it would be 
 of great use to them to prepare for; as his fixing the very time for 
 the coming of the Messiah was of use to all those that waited for the 
 consolation of Israel, and is to us, for the confirming of our belief, 
 That this is he who should come, and we are to look for no other.</P>
