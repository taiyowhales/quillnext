 The prophet had observed to us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:4"><I>ch.</I> viii. 4</A>)

 that when he was in vision at Jerusalem he saw the same appearance of
 the glory of God there that he had seen by the river Chebar; now, in
 this chapter, he gives us some account of the appearance there, as far
 as was requisite for the clearing up of two further indications of the
 approaching destruction of Jerusalem, which God here gave the
 prophet:--

 I. The scattering of the coals of fire upon the city, which were taken
 from between the cherubim, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 II. The removal of the glory of God from the temple, and its being upon
 the wing to be gone, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:8-22">ver. 8-22</A>.

 When God goes out from a people all judgments break in upon them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above
 the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a
 sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.
 &nbsp; 2  And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in
 between the wheels, <I>even</I> under the cherub, and fill thine hand
 with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter <I>them</I>
 over the city. And he went in in my sight.
 &nbsp; 3  Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when
 the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.
 &nbsp; 4  Then the glory of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> went up from the cherub, <I>and
 stood</I> over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled
 with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s glory.
 &nbsp; 5  And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard <I>even</I> to the
 outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh.
 &nbsp; 6  And it came to pass, <I>that</I> when he had commanded the man
 clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels,
 from between the cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the
 wheels.
 &nbsp; 7  And <I>one</I> cherub stretched forth his hand from between the
 cherubims unto the fire that <I>was</I> between the cherubims, and
 took <I>thereof,</I> and put <I>it</I> into the hands of <I>him that was</I>
 clothed with linen: who took <I>it,</I> and went out.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 To inspire us with a holy awe and dread of God, and to fill us with his 
 fear, we may observe, in this part of the vision which the prophet 
 had,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The glorious appearance of his majesty. Something of the invisible 
 world is here in the visible, some faint representations of its 
 brightness and beauty, some shadows, but such as are no more to be 
 compared with the truth and substance than a picture with the life; yet 
 here is enough to oblige us all to the utmost reverence in our thoughts 
 of God and approaches to him, if we will but admit the impressions this 
 discovery of him will make. 

 1. He is here <I>in the firmament above the head of the cherubim,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 He manifests his glory in the upper world, where purity and brightness 
 are both in perfection; and the vast expanse of the firmament aims to 
 speak the God that dwells there infinite. It is <I>the firmament of his 
 power</I> and of his prospect too; for thence <I>he beholds</I> all 
 <I>the children of men.</I> The divine nature infinitely transcends the 
 angelic nature, and God is <I>above the head of the cherubim,</I> in 
 respect not only of his dignity above them, but of his dominion over 
 them. Cherubim have great power, and wisdom, and influence, but they
 are all subject to God and Christ. 

 2. He is here upon the throne, or that which had <I>the appearance of 
 the likeness of a throne</I> (for God's glory and government infinitely 
 transcend all the brightest ideas our minds can either form or receive 
 concerning them); and it was <I>as it were a sapphire-stone,</I> pure 
 and sparkling; such a throne has God <I>prepared in the heavens,</I> 
 far exceeding the thrones of any earthly potentates. 

 3. He is here attended with a glorious train of holy angels. When God
 came into his temple <I>the cherubim stood on the right side of the 
 house</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 as the prince's life-guard, attending the gate of his palace. Christ 
 has angels at command. The orders given to all the angels of God are, 
 to <I>worship him.</I> Some observe that they <I>stood on the right 
 side of the house,</I> that is, the south side, because on the north 
 side the image of jealousy was, and other instances of idolatry, from 
 which they would place themselves at as great a distance as might be. 

 4. The appearance of his glory is veiled with a cloud, and yet out of
 that cloud darts forth a dazzling lustre; in <I>the house</I> and 
 <I>inner court</I> there was <I>a cloud</I> and darkness, which filled 
 them, and yet either the outer court, or the same court after some 
 time, <I>was full of the brightness of the Lord's glory,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.
 
 There was a darting forth of light and brightness; but if any over 
 curious eye pried into it, it would find itself lost in a cloud. His 
 righteousness is conspicuous <I>as the great mountains,</I> and the 
 brightness of it <I>fills the court;</I> but <I>his judgments are a 
 great deep,</I> which we cannot fathom, <I>a cloud</I> which we cannot 
 see through. <I>The brightness</I> discovers enough to awe and direct 
 our consciences, but the <I>cloud</I> forbids us to expect the 
 gratifying of our curiosity; for <I>we cannot order our speech by 
 reasons of darkness.</I> Thus 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:4">Hab. iii. 4</A>)

 <I>he had rays coming out of his hand, and yet there was the hiding of
 his power.</I> Nothing is more clear than that God <I>is,</I> nothing 
 more dark than <I>what</I> he is. God <I>covers himself with light,</I> 
 and yet, as to us, <I>makes darkness his pavilion.</I> God took 
 possession of the tabernacle and the temple in a cloud, which was 
 always the symbol of his presence. In the temple above there will be no 
 cloud, but we shall see <I>face to face.</I>

 5. The cherubim, made a dreadful sound with their wings,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The vibration of them, as of the strings of musical instruments, made a 
 curious melody; bees, and other winged insects, make a noise with their 
 wings. Probably this intimated their preparing to remove, by stretching 
 forth and lifting up their wings, which made this noise as it were to 
 give warning of it. This noise is said to be <I>as the voice of the 
 almighty God when he speaks,</I> as the thunder, which is called <I>the 
 voice of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+29:3">Ps. xxix. 3</A>),

 or <I>as the voice of the Lord</I> when he spoke to Israel on Mount
 Sinai; and <I>therefore</I> he then gave the law with abundance of 
 terror, to signify with what terror he would reckon for the violation 
 of it, which he was now about to do. This noise of their wings <I>was
 heard even to the outer court,</I> the court of the people; for the 
 Lord's voice, in his judgments, <I>cries in the city,</I> which those 
 may hear that do not, as Ezekiel, see the visions of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The terrible directions of his wrath. This vision has a further 
 tendency than merely to set forth the divine grandeur; further orders 
 are to be given for the destruction of Jerusalem. The greatest 
 devastations are made by fire and sword. For a general slaughter of the 
 inhabitants of Jerusalem orders were given in the foregoing chapter; 
 now here we have a command to lay the city in ashes, by <I>scattering 
 coals of fire</I> upon it, which in the vision were fetched <I>from 
 between the cherubim.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. For the issuing out of orders to do this <I>the glory of the 
 Lord</I> was lifted <I>up from the cherub</I> (as in the chapter before 
 for the giving of orders there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 <I>and stood</I> upon <I>the threshold of the house,</I> in imitation 
 of the courts of judgement, which they kept in the gates of their 
 cities. The people would not hear the oracles which God had delivered 
 to them from his holy temple, and therefore they shall thence be made 
 to hear their doom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>The man clothed in linen</I> who had marked those that were to be 
 preserved is to be employed in this service; for <I>the same Jesus</I> 
 that is the protector and Saviour of those that believe, having <I>all 
 judgement committed to him,</I> that of condemnation as well as that of 
 absolution, will <I>come in a flaming fire to take vengeance on those 
 that obey not his gospel.</I> He that sits on the throne calls <I>to 
 the man clothed in linen</I> to <I>go in between the wheels, and fill 
 his hand with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them 
 over the city.</I> This intimates, 

 (1.) That the burning of the city and temple by the Chaldeans was a 
 consumption determined, and that therein they executed God's counsel, 
 did what he designed before should be done. 

 (2.) That the fire of divine wrath, which kindles judgement upon a 
 people, is just and holy, for it is fire fetched <I>from between the 
 cherubim.</I> The fire on God's altar, where atonement was made, had 
 been slighted, to avenge which fire is here fetched from heaven, like 
 that by which Nadab and Abihu were killed for offering strange fire. If 
 a city, or town, or house, be burnt, whether by design or accident, if 
 we trace it in its original, we shall find that the <I>coals</I> which 
 kindled the <I>fire</I> came from <I>between the wheels;</I> for there 
 is not any evil of that kind in the city, but the Lord has done it. 
 
 (3.) That Jesus Christ acts by commission from the Father, for from him
 he <I>receives authority to execute judgement, because he is the Son of 
 man.</I> Christ came to <I>send fire on the earth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:49">Luke xii. 49</A>)

 and in the great day will speak this world into ashes. By fire from his
 hand, the earth, and all the works that are therein, will be burnt 
 up.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. This <I>man clothed with linen</I> readily attended to this service; 
 though, being <I>clothed with linen,</I> he was very unfit to go among 
 the burning <I>coals,</I> yet, being called, he said, <I>Lo, I 
 come;</I> this commandment he had received of his Father, and he 
 complied with it; the prophet saw him go in, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 <I>He went in, and stood beside the wheels,</I> expecting to be 
 furnished there with the coals he was to scatter; for what Christ was 
 to give he first received, whether for mercy or judgement. He was 
 directed to take fire, but he staid till he had it given him, to show 
 how slow he is to execute judgement, and how long-suffering to 
 us-ward.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. One of the cherubim reached him a handful of fire from the midst of 
 the living creatures. The prophet, when he first saw this vision, 
 observed that there were <I>burning coals of fire,</I> and 
 <I>lamps,</I> that <I>went up and down among the living creatures</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:13"><I>ch.</I> i. 13</A>);

 thence this fire was taken, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The <I>spirit of burning, the refiner's fire,</I> by which Christ 
 purifies his church, is of a divine original. It is by a celestial 
 fire, <I>fire</I> from <I>between the cherubim,</I> that wonders are 
 wrought. <I>The cherubim put it into</I> his <I>hand;</I> for the 
 angels are ready to be employed by the Lord Jesus and to serve all his 
 purposes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. When he had taken the fire he <I>went out,</I> no doubt to 
 <I>scatter</I> it up and down upon <I>the city,</I> as he was directed. 
 And <I>who can abide the day of his coming?</I> Who can stand before 
 him when he goes out in his anger?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man's hand
 under their wings.
 &nbsp; 9  And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims,
 one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and
 the appearance of the wheels <I>was</I> as the colour of a beryl
 stone.
 &nbsp; 10  And <I>as for</I> their appearances, they four had one likeness,
 as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel.
 &nbsp; 11  When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned
 not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they
 followed it; they turned not as they went.
 &nbsp; 12  And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and
 their wings, and the wheels, <I>were</I> full of eyes round about,
 <I>even</I> the wheels that they four had.
 &nbsp; 13  As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O
 wheel.
 &nbsp; 14  And every one had four faces: the first face <I>was</I> the face
 of a cherub, and the second face <I>was</I> the face of a man, and the
 third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
 &nbsp; 15  And the cherubims were lifted up. This <I>is</I> the living
 creature that I saw by the river of Chebar.
 &nbsp; 16  And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and
 when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the
 earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them.
 &nbsp; 17  When they stood, <I>these</I> stood; and when they were lifted
 up, <I>these</I> lifted up themselves <I>also:</I> for the spirit of the
 living creature <I>was</I> in them.
 &nbsp; 18  Then the glory of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> departed from off the threshold
 of the house, and stood over the cherubims.
 &nbsp; 19  And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from
 the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also <I>were</I>
 beside them, and <I>every one</I> stood at the door of the east gate
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s house; and the glory of the God of Israel <I>was</I>
 over them above.
 &nbsp; 20  This <I>is</I> the living creature that I saw under the God of
 Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they <I>were</I> the
 cherubims.
 &nbsp; 21  Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings;
 and the likeness of the hands of a man <I>was</I> under their wings.
 &nbsp; 22  And the likeness of their faces <I>was</I> the same faces which I
 saw by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves:
 they went every one straight forward.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a further account of the vision of God's glory which 
 Ezekiel saw, here intended to introduce that direful omen of the 
 departure of that glory from them, which would open the door for ruin 
 to break in.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Ezekiel sees the glory of God shining in the sanctuary, as he had 
 seen it <I>by the river of Chebar,</I> and gives an account of it, that 
 those who had by their wickedness provoked God to depart from them 
 might know what they had lost and might lament after the Lord, groaning 
 out their Ichabod, <I>Where is the glory?</I> Ezekiel here sees the 
 operations of divine Providence in the government of the lower world, 
 and the affairs of it, represented by the <I>four wheels;</I> and the 
 perfections of the holy angels, the inhabitants of the upper world, and 
 their ministrations, represented by the <I>four living creatures,</I> 
 every one of which had <I>four faces.</I> The agency of the angels in 
 directing the affairs of this world is represented by the close 
 communication that was between the <I>living creatures</I> and the 
 <I>wheels,</I> the wheels being guided by them in all their motions, as 
 the chariot is by him that drives it. But the same Spirit being both in 
 the <I>living creatures</I> and in the <I>wheels</I> denoted the 
 infinite wisdom which serves its own purposes by the ministration of 
 angels and all the occurrences of this lower world. So that this vision 
 gives out faith a view of that throne which the Lord has <I>prepared in 
 the heavens,</I> and that kingdom of which <I>rules over all,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:19">Ps. ciii. 19</A>.

 The prophet observes that this was <I>the same vision</I> with that he 
 saw by the river of Chebar

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:15,22"><I>v.</I> 15, 22</A>),

 and yet in one thing there seems to be a material difference, that that 
 which was there <I>was the face of an ox,</I> and was <I>on the left 
 side</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:10"><I>ch.</I> i. 10</A>),

 is here the <I>face of a cherub,</I> and is the <I>first face</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 whence some have concluded that the peculiar face of a cherub was that
 of an ox, which the Israelites had an eye to when they made the golden 
 calf. I rather think that in this latter vision the first face was the 
 proper appearance or figure of a cherub, which Ezekiel knew very well, 
 being a priest, by what he had seen in the temple of the Lord 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:29">1 Kings vi. 29</A>),

 but which we now have no certainty of at all; and by this Ezekiel knew
 assuredly, whereas before he only conjectured it, that they were all 
 cherubim, though putting on different faces,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 And this first appearing in the proper figure of a cherub, and yet it 
 being proper to retain the number of four, that of the ox is left out 
 and dropped, because the face of the cherub had been most abused by the 
 worship of an ox. As sometimes when God appeared to deliver his people, 
 so now when he appeared to depart from them, <I>he rode on a cherub, 
 and did fly.</I> Now observe here, 

 1. That this world is subject to turns, and changes, and various
 revolutions. The course of affairs in it is represented by
 <I>wheels</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 sometimes one spoke is uppermost and sometimes another; they are still 
 ebbing and flowing like the sea, waxing and waning like the moon, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:4">1 Sam. ii. 4</A>,

 &c. Nay, their appearance is as if there were a <I>wheel in the midst
 of a wheel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 which intimates the mutual references of providence to each other, 
 their dependences on each other, and the joint tendency of all to one 
 common end, while their motions as to us are intricate, and perplexed, 
 and seemingly contrary. 

 2. That there is an admirable harmony and uniformity in the various 
 occurrences of providence

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>As for the wheels,</I> though they moved several ways, yet <I>it was 
 cried to them, O wheel!</I> they were all as one, being guided by one 
 Spirit to one end; for God works all according to the counsel of his 
 own will, which is one, for his own glory, which is one. And this
 makes the disposal of Providence truly admirable, and to be looked upon 
 with wonder. As the works of his creation, considered separately, were 
 <I>good,</I> but all together <I>very good,</I> so the wheels of 
 Providence, considered by themselves, are wonderful, but put them 
 together and they are very wonderful. <I>O wheel!</I> 

 3. That the motions of Providence are steady and regular, and whatever
 the Lord pleases that he does and is never put upon new counsels. 
 <I>The wheels turned not as they went</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 and the <I>living creatures went every one straight forward,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Whatever difficulties lay in their way, they were sure to get over 
 them, and were never obliged to stand still, turn aside, or go back. So 
 perfectly known to God are all his works that he never put upon to new 
 counsels. 

 4. That God make more use of the ministration of angels in the 
 government of this lower world than we are aware of: <I>The four wheels 
 were by the cherubim, one wheel by one cherub and another wheel by 
 another cherub,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 What has been imagined by some concerning the spheres above, that every 
 orb has its intelligence to guide it, is here intimated concerning the 
 wheels below, that every wheel has its cherub to guide it. We think it 
 a satisfaction to us if under the wise God there are wise men employed 
 in managing the affairs of the kingdoms and churches; whether there be 
 so or no, it appears by this that there are wise angels employed, <I>a 
 cherub to every wheel.</I> 

 5. That all the motions of Providence and all the ministrations of
 angels are under the government of the great God. They are all <I>full 
 of eyes,</I> those eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the 
 earth and which the angels have always an eye to,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 The <I>living creatures</I> and <I>the wheels</I> concur in their 
 motions and rests 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);

 for <I>the Spirit of life,</I> as it may be read, or <I>the Spirit of 
 the living creatures, is in the wheels.</I> The Spirit of God directs 
 all the creatures, both upper and lower, so as to make them serve the 
 divine purpose. Events are not determined by the <I>wheel of 
 fortune,</I> which is blind, but by the <I>wheels of Providence,</I> 
 which are full of eyes.</P>

 II. Ezekiel sees the glory of God removing out of the sanctuary, the 
 place where God's honour had long dwelt, and this sight is as sad as 
 the other was grateful. It was pleasant to see that God had not 
 <I>forsaken the earth</I> (as the idolaters suggested, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+9:9"><I>ch.</I> ix. 9</A>),

 but sad to see that he was forsaking his sanctuary. The <I>glory of the
 Lord stood over the threshold,</I> having thence given the necessary 
 orders for the destruction of the city, and it <I>stood over the 
 cherubim,</I> not those in the most holy place, but those that Ezekiel 
 now saw in vision, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 It ascended that stately chariot, as the judge, when he comes off the 
 bench, goes into his coach and is gone. And immediately <I>the
 cherubim lifted up their wings</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 as they were directed, and they <I>mounted up from the earth,</I> as 
 birds upon the wing; and, <I>when they went out,</I> the wheels of this 
 chariot were not drawn, but went by instinct, <I>beside them,</I> by 
 which it appeared that <I>the Spirit of the living creatures was in the 
 wheels.</I> Thus, when God is leaving a people in displeasure, angels 
 above, and all events here below, shall concur to further his 
 departure. But observe here, In the courts of the temple where the 
 people of Israel had dishonoured their God, had cast off his yoke and 
 withdrawn the shoulder from it, blessed angels appear very ready to 
 serve him, to draw in his chariot, and to <I>mount upwards</I> with it.
 God has shown the prophet how the will of God was disobeyed by men on 
 earth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:1-18"><I>ch.</I> viii.</A>);

 here he shows him how readily it is obeyed by angels and inferior
 creatures; and it is a comfort to us, when we grieve for the wickedness 
 of the wicked, to think how his angels do his commandments, 
 <I>hearkening to the voice of his word,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:20">Ps. ciii. 20</A>.

 Let us now,

 1. Take a view of this chariot in which <I>the glory of the God of
 Israel rides triumphantly.</I> He that is the God of Israel is the God 
 of heaven and earth, and has the command of all the powers of both. Let 
 the faithful Israelites comfort themselves with this, that he who is 
 their God is above the cherubim; their Redeemer is so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:22">1 Pet. iii. 22</A>)

 and has the sole and sovereign disposal of all events; <I>the living
 creatures</I> and <I>the wheels</I> agree to serve him, so that he is 
 <I>head over all things to the church.</I> The rabbin call this vision 
 that Ezekiel had <I>Mercabah</I>--the <I>vision of the chariot;</I> and 
 thence they call the more abstruse part of divinity, which treats 
 concerning God and spirits, <I>Opus currus</I>--<I>The work of the 
 chariot,</I> as they do the other part, that is more plain and 
 familiar, <I>Opus bereshith</I>--<I>The work of the creation.</I>--

 2. Let us attend the motions of this chariot: The <I>cherubim, and the
 glory of God above them, stood at the door of the east gate of the 
 Lord's house,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 But observe with how many stops and pauses God departs, as loth to go, 
 as if to see if there be any that will intercede with him to return. 
 None of the priests in the inner court, between the temple and the 
 altar, would court his stay; therefore he leaves their court, and 
 stands at the <I>east gate,</I> which led into the <I>court of the 
 people,</I> to see if any of them would yet at length stand in the gap. 
 Note, God removes by degrees from a provoking people; and, when he is 
 ready to depart in displeasure, would return to them in mercy if they 
 were but a repenting praying people.</P>
