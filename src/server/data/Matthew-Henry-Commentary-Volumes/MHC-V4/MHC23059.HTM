 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have sin appearing exceedingly sinful, and grace 
 appearing exceedingly gracious; and, as what is here said of the 
 sinner's sin 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:7,8">ver. 7, 8</A>)

 is applied to the general corruption of mankind

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:15">Rom. iii. 15</A>),

 so what is here said of a Redeemer

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:20">ver. 20</A>)

 is applied to Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:26">Rom. xi. 26</A>.

 I. It is here charged upon this people that they had themselves stopped
 the current of God's favours to them, and the particular sins are
 specified which kept good things from them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>.

 II. It is here charged upon them that they had themselves procured the
 judgments of God upon them, and they are told both what the judgments 
 were which they had brought upon their own heads 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:9-11">ver. 9-11</A>)

 and what the sins were which provoked God to send those judgments,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:12-15">ver. 12-15</A>.

 III. It is here promised that, notwithstanding this, God would work
 deliverance for them, purely for his own name's sake 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:16-19">ver. 16-19</A>),

 and would reserve mercy in store for them and entail it upon them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:20,21">ver. 20, 21</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Behold, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s hand is not shortened, that it cannot
 save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:
 &nbsp; 2  But your iniquities have separated between you and your God,
 and your sins have hid <I>his</I> face from you, that he will not
 hear.
 &nbsp; 3  For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with
 iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered
 perverseness.
 &nbsp; 4  None calleth for justice, nor <I>any</I> pleadeth for truth: they
 trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and
 bring forth iniquity.
 &nbsp; 5  They hatch cockatrice' eggs, and weave the spider's web: he
 that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed
 breaketh out into a viper.
 &nbsp; 6  Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they
 cover themselves with their works: their works <I>are</I> works of
 iniquity, and the act of violence <I>is</I> in their hands.
 &nbsp; 7  Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent
 blood: their thoughts <I>are</I> thoughts of iniquity; wasting and
 destruction <I>are</I> in their paths.
 &nbsp; 8  The way of peace they know not; and <I>there is</I> no judgment in
 their goings: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever goeth
 therein shall not know peace.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet here rectifies the mistake of those who had been 
 quarrelling with God because they had not the deliverances wrought for 
 them which they had been often fasting and praying for, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:3"><I>ch.</I> lviii. 3</A>.

 Now here he shows,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That it was not owing to God. They had no reason to lay the fault 
 upon him that they were not saved out of the hands of their enemies; 
 for, 

 1. He was still as able to help as ever: <I>His hand is not
 shortened,</I> his power is not at all lessened, straitened, or 
 abridged. Whether we consider the extent of his power or the efficacy 
 of it, God can reach as far as ever and with as strong a hand as ever.
 Note, The church's salvation comes from the hand of God, and that has 
 not waxed weak nor is it at all shortened. <I>Has the Lord's hand waxed 
 short?</I> (says God to Moses,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:23">Num. xi. 23</A>).

 No, it has not; he will not have it thought so. Neither length of time 
 nor strength of enemies, no, nor weakness of instruments, can shorten 
 or straiten the power of God, with which it is all one to save by many 
 or by few. 

 2. He was still as ready and willing to help as ever in answer to 
 prayer: <I>His ear is not heavy, that it cannot hear.</I> Though he has 
 many prayers to hear and answer, and though he has been long hearing 
 prayer, yet he is still as ready to hear prayer as ever. The prayer of
 the upright is as much his delight as ever it was, and the promises 
 which are pleaded and put in suit in prayer are still yea and amen, 
 inviolably sure. More is implied than is expressed; not only his ear is 
 not heavy, but he is quick of hearing. <I>Even before they call he 
 answers,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:24"><I>ch.</I> lxv. 24</A>.

 If your prayers be not answered, and the salvation we wait for be not 
 wrought for us, it is not because God is weary of hearing prayer, but 
 because we are weary of praying, not because his ear is heavy when we 
 speak to him, but because our ears are heavy when he speaks to us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That it was owing to themselves; they stood in their own light and 
 put a bar in their own door. God was coming towards them in ways of 
 mercy and they hindered him. <I>Your iniquities have kept good things 
 from you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:25">Jer. v. 25</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. See what mischief sin does. 

 (1.) It hinders God's mercies from coming down upon us; it is a 
 partition wall that separates between us and God. Notwithstanding the 
 infinite distance that is between God and man by nature, there was a 
 correspondence settled between them, till sin set them at variance, 
 justly provoked God against man and unjustly alienated man from God; 
 thus it <I>separates between them and God.</I> "He is your God, yours 
 in profession, and therefore there is so much the more malignity and 
 mischievousness in sin, which separates between you and him." Sin 
 <I>hides his face from us</I> (which denotes great displeasure, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:17">Deut. xxxi. 17</A>);

 it provokes him in anger to withdraw his gracious presence, to suspend
 the tokens of his favour and the instances of his help; he hides his 
 face, as refusing to be seen or spoken with. See here sin in its 
 colours, sin exceedingly sinful, withdrawing the creature from his 
 allegiance to his Creator; and see sin in its consequences, sin 
 exceedingly hurtful, separating us from God, and so separating us not 
 only <I>from all good,</I> but <I>to all evil</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:21">Deut. xxix. 21</A>),

 which is the very quintessence of the curse.

 (2.) It hinders our prayers from coming up unto God; it provokes him to 
 hide his face, that he will not hear, as he has said,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:15"><I>ch.</I> i. 15</A>.

 If we <I>regard iniquity in our heart,</I> if we indulge it and allow
 ourselves in it, God <I>will not hear our prayers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:18">Ps. lxvi. 18</A>.

 We cannot expect that he should countenance us while we go on to
 affront him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Now, to justify God in hiding his face from them, and proceeding in 
 his controversy with them, the prophet shows very largely, in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:9-15">following verses</A>,

 how many and great their iniquities were, according to the charge given
 him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:1"><I>ch.</I> lviii. 1</A>),

 <I>to show God's people their transgressions;</I> and it is a black
 bill of indictment that is here drawn up against them, consisting of 
 many particulars, any one of which was enough to separate between them 
 and a just and a holy God. Let us endeavour to reduce these articles of 
 impeachment to proper heads.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) We must begin with their thoughts, for there all sin begins, and 
 thence it takes its rise: <I>Their thoughts are thoughts of 
 iniquity,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Their imaginations are so, only evil continually. Their projects and
 designs are so; they are continually contriving some mischief or other, 
 and how to compass the gratification of some base lust

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>They conceive mischief</I> in their fancy, purpose, counsel, and 
 resolution (thus the embryo receives its shape and life), and then they 
 <I>bring forth iniquity,</I> put it in execution when it is ripened for 
 it. Though it is in pain perhaps that the iniquity is brought forth, 
 through the oppositions of Providences and the checks of their own 
 consciences, yet, when they have compassed their wicked purpose, they 
 look upon it with as much pride and pleasure as if it were a 
 <I>man-child born into the world;</I> thus, <I>when lust has conceived, 
 it bringeth forth sin,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:15">Jam. i. 15</A>.
 
 This is called
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 <I>hatching the cockatrice' egg and weaving the spider's web.</I> See 
 how the thoughts and contrivances of wicked men are employed, and about 
 what they set their wits on work.

 [1.] At the best it is about that which is foolish and frivolous. Their 
 thoughts are vain, like weaving the spider's web, which the poor silly 
 animal takes a great deal of pains about, and, when all is done, it is 
 a weak insignificant thing, a reproach to the place where it is, and 
 which the besom sweeps away in an instant: such are the thoughts which 
 worldly men entertain themselves with, building castles in the air, and 
 pleasing themselves with imaginary satisfaction, like the 
 <I>spider,</I> which <I>takes hold with her hands</I> very finely 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:28">Prov. xxx. 28</A>),
 
 but cannot keep her hold.

 [2.] Too often it is about that which is malicious and spiteful. They
 hatch the eggs of the cockatrice or adder, which are poisonous and 
 produce venomous creatures; such are the thoughts of the wicked who 
 delight in doing mischief. <I>He that eats of their eggs</I> (that is, 
 he is in danger of having some mischief or other done him), <I>and that 
 which is crushed</I> in order to be eaten of, or which begins to be 
 hatched and you promise yourself some useful fowl from it, <I>breaks 
 out into a viper,</I> which you meddle with at your peril. Happy are 
 those that have least to do with such men. Even the spider's web which 
 they wove was woven with a spiteful design to catch flies in and make a 
 prey of them; for, rather than not be doing mischief, they will play at 
 small game.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Out of this abundance of wickedness in the heart their mouth 
 speaks, and yet it does not always speak out the wickedness that is 
 within, but, for the more effectually compassing the mischievous 
 design, it is dissembled and covered <I>with much fair speech</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Your lips have spoken lies;</I> and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 <I>They speak lies,</I> pretending kindness where they intend the 
 greatest mischief; or by slanders and false accusations they blasted 
 the credit and reputation of those they had a spite to and so did them 
 a real mischief unseen, and perhaps by suborning witnesses against them 
 took from them their estates and lives; for a false tongue is sharp 
 arrows, and coals of juniper, and every thing that is mischievous. 
 <I>Your tongue has muttered perverseness.</I> When they could not, for 
 shame, speak their malice against their neighbours aloud, or durst not, 
 for fear of being disproved and put to confusion, they muttered it 
 secretly. Backbiters are called <I>whisperers.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Their actions were all of a piece with their thoughts and words. 
 They were guilty of shedding innocent blood, a crime of the most 
 heinous nature: <I>Your hands are defiled with blood</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 for blood is defiling; it leaves an indelible stain of guilt upon the 
 conscience, which nothing but the blood of Christ can cleanse it from.
 Now was this a case of surprise, or one that occurred when there was 
 something of a force put upon them; but 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>)

 <I>their feet ran to this evil,</I> naturally and eagerly, and, hurried 
 on by the <I>impetus</I> of their malice and revenge, <I>they made 
 haste to shed innocent blood,</I> as if they were afraid of losing an 
 opportunity to do a barbarous thing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:16,Jer+22:17">Prov. i. 16; Jer. xxii. 17</A>.

 <I>Wasting and destruction are in their paths.</I> Wherever they go
 they carry mischief along with them, and the tendency of their way is 
 to lay waste and destroy, nor do they care what havoc they make. Nor do 
 they only thirst after blood, but with other iniquities are their 
 <I>fingers defiled</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 they wrong people in their estates and make every thing their own that 
 they can lay their hands on. <I>They trust in vanity</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 they depend upon their arts of cozenage to enrich themselves with, 
 which will prove vanity to them, and their deceiving others will but 
 deceive themselves. <I>Their works,</I> which they take so much pains 
 about and have their hearts so much upon, <I>are</I> all <I>works of 
 iniquity;</I> their whole business is one continued course of 
 oppressions and vexations, <I>and the act of violence is in their 
 hands,</I> according to the arts of violence that are in their heads 
 and the thoughts of violence in their hearts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) No methods are taken to redress these grievances, and reform these
 abuses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>None calls for justice,</I> none complains of the violation of the 
 sacred laws of justice, nor seeks to right those that suffer wrong or 
 to get the laws put in execution against vice and profaneness, and 
 those lewd practices which are the shame, and threaten to be the bane, 
 of the nation. Note, When justice is not done there is blame to be laid 
 not only upon the magistrates that should administer justice, but upon 
 the people that should call for it. Private persons ought to contribute 
 to the public good by discovering secret wickedness, and giving those 
 an opportunity to punish it that have the power of doing so in their 
 hands; but it is ill with a state when princes rule ill and the people 
 love to have it so. Truth is opposed, and there is not any that 
 <I>pleads for it,</I> not any that has the conscience and courage to 
 appear in defence of an honest cause, and confront a prosperous fraud 
 and wrong. <I>The way of peace</I> is as little regarded as the way of 
 truth; they <I>know it not,</I> that is, they never study the things 
 that make for peace, no care is taken to prevent or punish the breaches 
 of the peace and to accommodate matters in difference among neighbours; 
 they are utter strangers to every thing that looks quiet and peaceable, 
 and affect that which is blustering and turbulent. <I>There is no 
 judgment in their goings;</I> they have not any sense of justice in 
 their dealings; it is a thing they make no account of at all, but can 
 easily break through all its fences if they stand in the way of their 
 malicious covetous designs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) In all this they act foolishly, very foolishly, and as much 
 against their interest as against reason and equity. Those that 
 practise iniquity <I>trust in vanity,</I> which will certainly deceive 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 <I>Their webs,</I> which they weave with so much art and industry, 
 <I>shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves,</I> 
 either for shelter or for ornament, <I>with their works,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 They may do hurt to others with their projects, but can never do any 
 real service or kindness to themselves by them. There is nothing to be 
 got by sin, and so it will appear when profit and loss come to be 
 compared. Those paths of iniquity are <I>crooked paths</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 which will perplex them, but will never bring them to their journey's 
 end; whoever go therein, though they say that they shall have peace 
 notwithstanding they go on, deceive themselves; for they shall not know 
 peace, as appears by the following verses.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice

 <I>there was</I> no judgment.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The scope of this paragraph is the same with that of the last, to show 
 that sin is the great mischief-maker; as it is that which keeps good 
 things from us, so it is that which brings evil things upon us. But as 
 <I>there</I> it is spoken by the prophet, in God's name, to the people, 
 for their conviction and humiliation, and that God might be justified 
 when he speaks and clear when he judges, so <I>here</I> it seems to be 
 spoken by the people to God, as an acknowledgment of that which was 
 there told them and an expression of their humble submission and 
 subscription to the justice and equity of God's proceedings against 
 them. Their uncircumcised hearts here seem to be humbled in some 
 measure, and they are brought to confess (the confession is at least 
 extorted from them), that God had justly walked contrary to them, 
 because they had walked contrary to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They acknowledge that God had contended with them and had walked 
 contrary to them. Their case was very deplorable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:9-11"><I>v.</I> 9-11</A>.

 1. They were in distress, trampled upon and oppressed by their enemies, 
 unjustly dealt with, and ruled with rigour; and God did not appear for 
 them, to plead their just and injured cause: "<I>Judgment is far from 
 us, neither does justice overtake us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Though, as to our persecutors, we are sure that we have right on our 
 side; and they are the wrong-doers, yet we are not relieved, we are not 
 righted. We have not done justice to one another, and therefore God 
 suffers our enemies to deal thus unjustly with us, and we are as far as 
 ever from being restored to our right and recovering our property 
 again. Oppression is near us, and judgment is far from us. Our enemies 
 are far from giving our case its due consideration, but still hurry us 
 on with the violence of their oppressions, and justice does not 
 overtake us, to rescue us out of their hands." 

 2. Herein their expectations were sadly disappointed, which made their 
 case the more sad: "<I>We wait for light</I> as those that wait for the 
 morning, <I>but behold obscurity;</I> we cannot discern the least 
 dawning of the day of our deliverance. <I>We look for judgment, but 
 there is none</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);
 
 neither God nor man appears for our succour; we look for salvation, 
 because God (we think) has promised it, and we have prayed for it with 
 fasting; we look for it as for brightness, but it is far off from us, 
 as far off as ever for aught we can perceive, and still <I>we walk in 
 darkness;</I> and the higher our expectations have been raised the 
 sorer is the disappointment." 

 3. They were quite at a loss what to do to help themselves and were at
 their wits' end

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "<I>We grope for the wall like the blind;</I> we see no way open for 
 our relief, nor know which way to expect it, or what to do in order to 
 it." If we shut our eyes against the light of divine truth, it is just 
 with God to hide from our eyes the things that belong to our peace; 
 and, if we use not our eyes as we should, it is just with him to let us 
 be as if we had no eyes. Those that will not see their duty shall not 
 see their interest. Those whom God has given up to a judicial
 blindness are strangely infatuated; they stumble at noon-day as in the 
 night; they see not either those dangers, or those advantages, which 
 all about them see. <I>Quos Deus vult perdere, eos dementat--God
 infatuates those whom he means to destroy.</I> Those that love darkness 
 rather than light shall have their doom accordingly. 

 4. They sunk into despair and were quite overwhelmed with grief, the 
 marks of which appeared in every man's countenance; they grew 
 melancholy upon it, shunned conversation, and affected solitude: <I>We 
 are in desolate places as dead men.</I> The state of the Jews in 
 Babylon is represented by <I>dead and dry bones</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:12">Ezek. xxxvii. 12</A>)

 and the explanation of the comparison there

 explains this text: <I>Our hope is lost; we are cut off for our 
 parts.</I> In this despair the sorrow and anguish of some were loud and 
 noisy: <I>We roar like bears;</I> the sorrow of others was silent, and 
 preyed more upon their spirits: "<I>We mourn sore like doves,</I> like 
 doves of the valleys; we mourn both <I>for our iniquities</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:16">Ezek. vii. 16</A>)

 and for our calamities." Thus they owned that <I>the hand of the Lord
 had gone out against them.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They acknowledge that they had provoked God thus to contend with 
 them, that he had done right, for they had done wickedly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:12-15"><I>v.</I> 12-15</A>.

 1. They owned that they had sinned, and that to this day they were in
 a great trespass, as Ezra speaks 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+10:10">Ezra x. 10</A>):

 "<I>Our transgressions are with us;</I> the guilt of them is upon us,
 the power of them prevails among us, we are not yet reformed, nor have 
 we parted with our sins, though they have done so much mischief. Nay, 
 <I>our transgressions are multiplied;</I> they are more numerous and 
 more heinous than they have been formerly. Look which way we will, we 
 cannot look off them; all places, all orders and degrees of men, are 
 infected. The sense of our transgression is with us, as David said,
 <I>My sin is ever before me;</I> it is too plain to be denied or 
 concealed, too bad to be excused or palliated. God is a witness to 
 them: <I>They are multiplied before thee,</I> in thy sight, under thy 
 eye. We are witnesses against ourselves: <I>As for our iniquities, we 
 know them,</I> though we may have foolishly endeavoured to cover them. 
 Nay, they themselves are witnesses: <I>Our sins</I> stare us in the 
 face and <I>testify against us,</I> so many have they been and so 
 deeply aggravated."

 2. They owned the great evil and malignity of sin, of their sin; it is 
 <I>transgressing and lying against the Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 The sins of those that profess themselves God's people, and
 bear his name, are upon <I>this</I> account worse than the sins of 
 others, that in transgressing they <I>lie against the Lord,</I> they 
 falsely accuse him, they misrepresent and belie him, as if he had dealt 
 hardly and unfairly with them; or they perfidiously break covenant with 
 him and falsify their most sacred and solemn engagements to him, which 
 is <I>lying against him: it is departing away from our God,</I> to whom 
 we are bound as our God and to whom we ought to cleave with purpose of 
 heart; from him we have departed, as the rebellious subject from his 
 allegiance to his rightful prince, and the adulterous wife from the 
 guide of her youth and the covenant of her God. 

 3. They owned that there was a general decay of moral honesty; and it
 is not strange that those who were false to their God were unfaithful 
 to one another. They <I>spoke oppression,</I> declared openly for that, 
 though it was a revolt from their God and a revolt from the truth, by 
 the sacred bonds of which we should always be tied and held fast. They 
 <I>conceived and uttered words of falsehood.</I> Many ill thing is 
 conceived in the mind, yet is prudently stifled there, and not suffered 
 to go any further; but these sinners were so impudent, so daring, that 
 whatever wickedness they conceived, they gave it an <I>imprimatur--a 
 sanction,</I> and made no difficulty of publishing it. To think an ill 
 thing is bad, but to say it is much worse. Many a word of falsehood is 
 uttered in haste, for want of consideration; but these were conceived 
 and uttered, were uttered--deliberately and of malice prepense. They 
 were words of falsehood, and yet they are said to be uttered <I>from 
 the heart,</I> because, though they differed from the real sentiments 
 of the heart and therefore were words of falsehood, yet they agreed 
 with the malice and wickedness of the heart, and were the natural 
 language of that; it was a <I>double heart,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:2">Ps. xii. 2</A>.

 Those who by the grace of God kept themselves free from these enormous
 crimes yet put themselves into the confession of sin, because members 
 of that nation which was generally thus corrupted.

 4. They owned that that was not done which might have been done to 
 reform the land and to amend what was amiss,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 "<I>Judgment,</I> that should go forward, and bear down the opposition 
 that is made to it, that should run in its course like a river, like a 
 mighty stream, <I>is turned away backward,</I> a contrary course. The 
 administration of justice has become but a cover to the greatest 
 injustice. Judgment, that should check the proceedings of fraud and 
 violence, is driven back, and so they go on triumphantly. <I>Justice 
 stands afar off,</I> even from our courts of judicature, which are so 
 crowded with the patrons of oppression that <I>equity cannot enter,</I> 
 cannot have admission into the court, cannot be heard, or at least will 
 not be heeded. Equity enters not into the unrighteous decrees which 
 they decree,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:1"><I>ch.</I> x. 1</A>.

 <I>Truth is fallen in the street,</I> and there she may lie to be
 trampled upon by every foot of pride, and she has never a friend that 
 will lend a hand to help her up; <I>yea, truth fails</I> in common 
 conversation, and in dealings between man and man, so that one knows 
 not whom to believe nor whom to trust." 

 5. They owned that there was a prevailing enmity in men's minds to
 those that were good: <I>He that does evil goes unpunished,</I> but 
 <I>he that departs from evil makes himself a prey</I> to those beasts 
 of prey that were before described. It is crime enough with them for a
 man not to do as they do, and they treat <I>him</I> as an enemy who 
 will not partake with them in their wickedness. <I>He that departs from 
 evil is accounted mad;</I> so the margin reads. Sober singularity is 
 branded as folly, and he is thought next door to a madman who swims 
 against the stream that runs so strongly. 

 6. They owned that all this could not but be very displeasing to the 
 God of heaven. The evil was done in his sight. They knew very well, 
 though they were not willing to acknowledge it, that the Lord saw it; 
 though it was done secretly, and gilded over with specious pretences, 
 yet it could not be concealed from his all-seeing eye. All the 
 wickedness that is in the world is naked and open before the eyes of 
 God; and, as he is of quicker eyes than not to see iniquity, so he is 
 of purer eyes than to behold it with the least approbation or 
 allowance. <I>He saw it, and it displeased him,</I> though it was among 
 his own professing people that he saw it. It was evil in his eyes; he
 saw the sinfulness of all this sin, and that which was most offensive 
 to him was <I>that there was no judgment,</I> no reformation; had he 
 seen any signs of repentance, though the sin displeased him, he would 
 soon have been reconciled to the sinners upon their returning from 
 their evil way. <I>Then</I> the sin of a nation becomes national, and 
 brings public judgments, when it is not restrained by public 
 justice.</P>

 How sin abounded we have read, to our great amazement, in the former 
 part of the chapter; how grace does much more abound we read in these 
 verses. And, as sin took occasion from the commandment to become more 
 exceedingly sinful, so grace took occasion from the transgression of 
 the commandment to appear more exceedingly gracious. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Why God wrought salvation for this provoking people, notwithstanding 
 their provocations. It was purely for his own name's sake; because 
 there was nothing in them either to bring it about, or to induce him to 
 bring it about for them, no merit to deserve it, no might to effect it, 
 he would do it himself, would be exalted in his own strength, for his 
 own glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He took notice of their weakness and wickedness: <I>He saw that 
 there was no man</I> that would do any thing for the support of the 
 bleeding cause of religion and virtue among them, not a man that would 
 execute judgment 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:1">Jer. v. 1</A>),

 that would bestir himself in a work of reformation; those that
 complained of the badness of the times had not zeal and courage enough 
 to appear and act against it; there was a universal corruption of 
 manners, and nothing done to stem the tide; most were wicked, and those 
 that were not so were yet weak, and durst not attempt any thing in 
 opposition to the wickedness of the wicked. <I>There was no
 intercessor,</I> either none to intercede with God, to stand in the gap 
 by prayer to turn away his wrath (it would have pleased him to be thus 
 met, and he wondered that he was not), or, rather, none to interpose 
 for the support of justice and truth, which were trampled upon and run 
 down

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 no advocate to speak a good word for those who were made a prey of 
 because they kept their integrity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 They complained that God did not appear for them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:3"><I>ch.</I> lviii. 3</A>);

 but God with much more reason complains that they did nothing for
 themselves, intimating how ready he would have been to do them good if 
 he had found among them the least motion towards a reformation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He engaged his own strength and righteousness for them. They shall 
 be saved, notwithstanding all this; and, 

 (1.) Because they have no strength of their own, nor any active men 
 that will set to it in good earnest to redress the grievances either of 
 their iniquities or of their calamities, therefore <I>his own arm shall 
 bring salvation to him,</I> to his people, or to him whom he would 
 raise up to be the deliverer, Christ, the power of God and arm of the 
 Lord, that man of his right hand whom he made strong for himself. The 
 work of reformation (that is the first and principal article of the 
 salvation) shall be wrought by the immediate influences of the divine 
 grace on men's consciences. Since magistrates and societies for 
 reformation fail of doing their part, one will not do justice nor the 
 other call for it, God will let them know that he can do it without 
 them when his time shall come thus to prepare his people for mercy, and 
 then the work of deliverance shall be wrought by the immediate 
 operations of the divine Providence on men's affections and affairs. 
 When God stirred up the spirit of Cyrus, and brought his people out of 
 Babylon, <I>not by might, nor by power, but by the Spirit of the Lord 
 of hosts,</I> then his own arm, which is never shortened, brought 
 salvation. 

 (2.) Because they have no righteousness of their own to merit these 
 favours, and to which God might have an eye in working for them, 
 therefore <I>his</I> own <I>righteousness sustained him</I> and bore 
 him out in it. Divine justice, which by their sins they had armed 
 against them, through grace appears for them. Though they can expect no 
 favour as due to them, yet he will be just to himself, to his own 
 purpose and promise, and covenant with his people: he will, in 
 righteousness, punish the enemies of his people; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:5">Deut. ix. 5</A>.

 <I>Not for thy righteousness, but for the wickedness of these
 nations</I> they are driven out. In our redemption by Christ, since we 
 had no righteousness of our own to produce, on which God might proceed 
 in favour to us, he brought in a righteousness by the merit and 
 meditation of his own Son (it is called <I>the righteousness which is 
 of God by faith,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:9">Phil. iii. 9</A>),

 and this righteousness sustained him, and bore him out in all his
 favours to us, notwithstanding our provocations. <I>He put on
 righteousness as a breast-plate,</I> securing his own honour, as a 
 breast-plate does the vitals, in all his proceedings, by the justice 
 and equity of them; and then he put <I>a helmet of salvation upon his 
 head;</I> so sure is he to effect the salvation he intends that he 
 takes salvation itself for his helmet, which therefore must needs be 
 impenetrable, and in which he appears very illustrious, formidable in 
 the eyes of his enemies and amiable in the eyes of his friends. When
 righteousness is his coat of arms, salvation is his crest. In allusion 
 to this, among the pieces of a Christian's armour we find <I>the 
 breast-plate of righteousness,</I> and for a helmet <I>the hope of 
 salvation</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:14-17,1Th+5:8">Eph. vi. 14-17; 1 Thess. v. 8</A>),

 and it is called <I>the armour of God,</I> because he wore it first and
 so fitted it for us.

 (3.) Because they have no spirit or zeal to do any thing for 
 themselves, God will <I>put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, 
 and clothe himself with zeal as a cloak;</I> he will make his justice 
 upon the enemies of his church and people, and his jealousy for his own 
 glory and the honour of religion and virtue among men, to appear 
 evident and conspicuous in the eye of the world; and in these he will 
 show himself great, as a man shows himself in his rich attire or in the 
 distinguishing habit of his office. If men be not zealous against sin, 
 God will, and will take vengeance on it for all the injury it has done 
 to his honour and his people's welfare; and this was the business of 
 Christ in the world, to take away sin and be revenged on it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What the salvation is that shall be wrought out by the 
 righteousness and strength of God himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. There shall be a present temporal salvation wrought out for the Jews 
 in Babylon, or elsewhere in distress and captivity. This is promised 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>)

 as a type of something further. When God's time shall come he will do 
 his own work, though those fail that should forward it. It is here 
 promised, 

 (1.) That God will reckon with his enemies and will render to them 
 according to their deeds, to the enemies of his people abroad, that 
 have oppressed them, to the enemies of justice and truth at home, that 
 have oppressed them, for they also are God's enemies; and, when the day 
 of vengeance shall have come, he will deal with both as they have 
 deserved, <I>according to retribution</I> (so the word is), the law of 
 retributions 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:10">Rev. xiii. 10</A>),

 or <I>according to former retributions;</I> as he has rendered to his
 enemies formerly, accordingly he will now repay, <I>fury to his 
 adversaries, recompence to his enemies;</I> his fury shall not exceed 
 the rules of justice, as men's fury commonly does. Even <I>to the 
 islands,</I> that lie most remote, if they have appeared against him, 
 <I>he will repay recompence;</I> for <I>his hand shall find out all his 
 enemies</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:8">Ps. xxi. 8</A>),

 and his arrows reach them. Though God's people have behaved so ill that
 they do not deserve to be delivered, yet his enemies behave so much 
 worse that they do deserve to be destroyed.

 (2.) That, whatever attempts the enemies of God's people may afterwards 
 make upon them to disturb their peace, they shall be baffled and 
 brought to nought: <I>When the enemy shall come in like a flood,</I> 
 like a high spring-tide, or a land-flood, which threaten to bear down 
 all before them without control, then <I>the Spirit of the Lord</I> by 
 some secret undiscerned power <I>shall lift up a standard against 
 him,</I> and so (as the margin reads it) <I>put him to flight.</I> He
 that has delivered will still deliver. When God's people are weak and 
 helpless, and have no standard to lift up against the invading power, 
 God will <I>give a banner to those that fear him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+60:4">Ps. lx. 4</A>),

 will by his Spirit lift up a standard, which will draw multitudes
 together to appear on the church's behalf. Some read it, <I>He shall 
 come</I> (the name of the Lord, and his glory, before foreseen of the 
 Messiah promised) <I>like a straight river, the Spirit of the Lord
 lifting him up for an ensign.</I> Christ by the preaching of his gospel 
 shall cover the earth with the knowledge of God as with the waters of a 
 flood, the <I>Spirit of the Lord</I> setting up Christ as a 
 <I>standard</I> to the <I>Gentiles,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:10"><I>ch.</I> xi. 10</A>.

 (3.) That all this should redound to the glory of God and the
 advancement of religion in the world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>So shall they fear the name of the Lord and his glory</I> in all 
 nations that lie eastward or westward. The deliverance of the Jews out 
 of captivity, and the destruction brought on their oppressors, would 
 awaken multitudes to enquire concerning the God of Israel, and induce 
 them to serve and worship him and enlist themselves under the standard 
 which the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up. God's appearances for his 
 church shall occasion the accession of many to it. This had its full 
 accomplishment in gospel times, when many came <I>from the east and 
 west,</I> to fill up the places of <I>the children of the kingdom</I> 
 that were <I>cast out,</I> when there were set up eastern and western 
 churches, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:11">Matt. viii. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. There shall be a more glorious salvation wrought out by the Messiah 
 in the fulness of time, which salvation all the prophets, upon all 
 occasions, had in view. We have here the two great promises relating to 
 that salvation:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That the Son of God shall come to us to be our Redeemer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):
 
 <I>Thy Redeemer shall come;</I> it is applied to Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:26">Rom. ix. 26</A>.
 
 <I>There shall come the deliverer.</I> The coming of Christ as the
 Redeemer is the summary of all the promises both of the Old and New 
 Testament, and this was the redemption in Jerusalem which the believing 
 Jews looked for, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:38">Luke ii. 38</A>.

 Christ is our <I>Go&euml;l,</I> our next kinsman, that redeems both the
 person and the estate of the poor debtor. Observe,

 [1.] The place where this Redeemer shall appear: He <I>shall come to 
 Zion,</I> for there, on that holy hill, the Lord would set him up as 
 his King, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:6">Ps. ii. 6</A>.

 In Zion the chief corner-stone was to be laid, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:6">1 Pet. ii. 6</A>.

 He came to his temple there,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:1">Mal. iii. 1</A>.

 There salvation was to be placed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:13"><I>ch.</I> xlvi. 13</A>),
 
 for thence the law was to go forth,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:3"><I>ch.</I> ii. 3</A>.

 Zion was a type of the gospel church, for which the Redeemer acts in 
 all his appearances: <I>The Redeemer shall come for the sake of 
 Zion;</I> so the LXX. reads it. 

 [2.] The persons that shall have the comfort of the Redeemer's coming, 
 that shall then lift up their heads, knowing that their redemption 
 draws nigh. He shall come <I>to those that turn from the ungodliness in 
 Jacob,</I> to those that are in Jacob, to the praying seed of Jacob, in 
 answer to their prayers; yet not to all that are in Jacob, that are 
 within the pale of the visible church, but to those only that turn from 
 transgression, that repent, and reform, and forsake those sins which 
 Christ came to redeem them from. The sinners in Zion will fare never 
 the better for the Redeemer's coming to Zion if they go on still in 
 their trespasses.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That the Spirit of God shall come to us to be our sanctifier, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 In the Redeemer there was a new covenant made with us a covenant of 
 promises; and this is the great and comprehensive promise of that 
 covenant, that God will give and continue his word and Spirit to his 
 church and people throughout all generations. God's giving the 
 <I>Spirit to those that ask him</I> includes the giving of them all 
 <I>good things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:13,Mt+7:11">Luke xi. 13; Matt. vii. 11</A>.

 This covenant is here said to <I>be made with them,</I> that is, with
 those that turn from transgression; for those that cease to do evil 
 shall be taught to do well. But the promise is made to a single 
 person--<I>My Spirit that is upon thee,</I> being directed either,

 [1.] To Christ as the head of the church, who received that he might 
 give. The Spirit promised to the church was first upon him, and from 
 his head that precious ointment descended to the skirts of his 
 garments; and the word of the gospel was first put into his mouth; for 
 <I>it began to be spoken by the Lord.</I> And all believers are his 
 seed, in whom he prolongs his days,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:10"><I>ch.</I> liii. 10</A>.

 Or,

 [2.] To the church; and so it is a promise of the continuance and
 perpetuity of the church in the world to the end of time, parallel to 
 those promises that the throne and seed of Christ shall endure for 
 ever, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:29,36,Ps+22:30">Ps. lxxxix. 29, 36; xxii. 30</A>.

 Observe, <I>First,</I> How the church shall be kept up, in a
 succession, as the world of mankind is kept up, by the seed and the 
 seed's seed. As one generation passes away another generation shall 
 come. <I>Instead of the fathers shall be the children. Secondly,</I>
 How long it shall be kept up--<I>henceforth and for ever,</I> always, 
 even <I>unto the end of the world;</I> for, the world being left to 
 stand for the sake of the church, we may be sure that as long as it 
 does stand Christ will have a church in it, though no always visible. 
 <I>Thirdly,</I> By what means it shall be kept up; by the constant 
 residence of the word and Spirit in it.

 1. The Spirit that was upon Christ shall always continue in the hearts
 of the faithful; there shall be some in every age on whom he shall 
 work, and in whom he shall dwell, and thus the Comforter shall abide 
 with the church for ever, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:16">John xiv. 16</A>.

 2. The word of Christ shall always continue in the mouths of the 
 faithful; there shall be some in every age who, <I>believing with the 
 heart</I> unto righteousness, shall <I>with the tongue make confession 
 unto salvation.</I> The word shall never depart out of the mouth of the 
 church; for there shall still be a seed to speak Christ's holy language 
 and profess his holy religion. Observe, The Spirit and the word go 
 together, and by them the church is kept up. For the word in the
 mouths of our ministers, nay, the word in our own mouths, will not 
 profit us, unless the Spirit work with the word, and give us an 
 understanding. But the Spirit does his work by the word and in 
 concurrence with it; and whatever is pretended to be a dictate of the

 the chief corner-stone.</P>
