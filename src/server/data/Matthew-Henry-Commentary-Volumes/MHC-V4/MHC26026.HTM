 The prophet had soon done with those four nations that he set his face 
 against in the foregoing chapters; for they were not at that time very 
 considerable in the world, nor would their fall make any great noise 
 among the nations nor any figure in history. But the city of Tyre is 
 next set to the bar; this, being a place of vast trade, was known all 
 the world over; and therefore here are three whole chapters, this and 
 the two that follow, spent in the prediction of the destruction of 
 Tyre. We have "the burden of Tyre," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:1-18">Isa. xxiii.</A>

 It is but just mentioned in Jeremiah, as sharing with the natives in
 the common calamity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:22,27:3,47:4"><I>ch.</I> xxv. 22; xxvii. 3; xlvii. 4</A>.

 But Ezekiel is ordered to be copious upon that head. In this chapter we
 have,

 I. The sin charged upon Tyre, which was triumphing in the destruction
 of Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:2">ver. 2</A>.

 II. The destruction of Tyrus itself foretold.

 1. The extremity of this destruction: it shall be utterly ruined,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:4-6,12-14">ver. 4-6, 12-14</A>.

 2. The instruments of this destruction, many nations 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:3">ver. 3</A>),

 and the king of Babylon by name with his vast victorious army,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:7-11">ver. 7-11</A>.

 3. The great surprise that this should give to the neighbouring
 nations, who would all wonder at the fall of so great a city and be
 alarmed at it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:15-21">ver. 15-21</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first <I>day</I>
 of the month, <I>that</I> the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Son of man, because that Tyrus hath said against Jerusalem,
 Aha, she is broken <I>that was</I> the gates of the people: she is
 turned unto me: I shall be replenished, <I>now</I> she is laid waste:
 &nbsp; 3  Therefore thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Behold, I <I>am</I> against
 thee, O Tyrus, and will cause many nations to come up against
 thee, as the sea causeth his waves to come up.
 &nbsp; 4  And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her
 towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like
 the top of a rock.
 &nbsp; 5  It shall be <I>a place for</I> the spreading of nets in the midst
 of the sea: for I have spoken <I>it,</I> saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>: and it
 shall become a spoil to the nations.
 &nbsp; 6  And her daughters which <I>are</I> in the field shall be slain by
 the sword; and they shall know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 7  For thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; Behold, I will bring upon Tyrus
 Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north,
 with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies,
 and much people.
 &nbsp; 8  He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field: and
 he shall make a fort against thee, and cast a mount against thee,
 and lift up the buckler against thee.
 &nbsp; 9  And he shall set engines of war against thy walls, and with
 his axes he shall break down thy towers.
 &nbsp; 10  By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall
 cover thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen,
 and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into
 thy gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach.
 &nbsp; 11  With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy
 streets: he shall slay thy people by the sword, and thy strong
 garrisons shall go down to the ground.
 &nbsp; 12  And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey
 of thy merchandise: and they shall break down thy walls, and
 destroy thy pleasant houses: and they shall lay thy stones and
 thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water.
 &nbsp; 13  And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the
 sound of thy harps shall be no more heard.
 &nbsp; 14  And I will make thee like the top of a rock: thou shalt be
 <I>a place</I> to spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no more: for I
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> have spoken <I>it,</I> saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This prophecy is dated in the eleventh year, which was the year that 
 Jerusalem was taken, and <I>in the first day of the month,</I> but it 
 is not said what month, some think the month in which Jerusalem was 
 taken, which was the fourth month, others the month after; or perhaps 
 it was the first month, and so it was the first day of the year. 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The pleasure with which the Tyrians looked upon the ruins of 
 Jerusalem. Ezekiel was a great way off, in Babylon, but God told him 
 what Tyrus said against Jerusalem 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>Aha! she is broken,</I> broken to pieces, that was <I>the gates of 
 the people,</I> to whom there was a great resort and where there was a 
 general rendezvous of all nations, some upon one account and some upon 
 another, and I shall get by it; all the wealth, power, and interest, 
 which Jerusalem had, it is hoped, shall be turned to Tyre, and so 
 <I>now</I> that <I>she is laid waste I shall be replenished.</I>" We do 
 not find that the Tyrians had such a hatred and enmity to Jerusalem and 
 the sanctuary as the Ammonites and Edomites had, or were so spiteful 
 and mischievous to the Jews. They were men of business, and of large 
 acquaintance and free conversation, and therefore were not so bigoted, 
 and of such a persecuting spirit, as the narrow souls that lived 
 retired and knew not the world. All their care was to get estates, and 
 enlarge their trade, and they looked upon Jerusalem not as an enemy, 
 but as a rival. Hiram, king of Tyre, was a good friend to David and 
 Solomon, and we do not read of any quarrels the Jews had with the 
 Tyrians; but Tyre promised herself that the fall of Jerusalem would be 
 an advantage to her in respect of trade a commerce, that now she shall 
 have Jerusalem's customers, and the great men from all parts that used 
 to come to Jerusalem for the accomplishing of themselves, and to spend 
 their estates there, will now come to Tyre and spend them there; and 
 whereas many, since the Chaldean army became so formidable in those 
 parts, had retired into Jerusalem, and brought their estates thither 
 for safety, as the Rechabites did, now they will come to Tyre, which, 
 being in a manner surrounded with the sea, will be thought a place of 
 greater strength than Jerusalem, and thus the prosperity of Tyre will 
 rise out of the ruins of Jerusalem. Note, To be secretly pleased with 
 the death or decay of others, when we are likely to get by it, with 
 their fall when we may thrive upon it, is a sin that does most easily 
 beset us, but is not thought to be such a bad thing, and so provoking 
 to God, as really it is. We are apt to say, when those who stand in our 
 light, in our way, are removed, when they break of fall into disgrace, 
 "We shall be <I>replenished</I> now that they are <I>laid waste.</I>" 
 But this comes from a selfish covetous principle, and a desire to be 
 <I>placed alone in the midst of the earth,</I> as if we grudged that 
 any should live by us. This comes from a want of that love to our 
 neighbour as to ourselves which the law of God so expressly requires, 
 and from that inordinate love of the world as our happiness which the 
 love of God so expressly forbids. And it is just with God to blast the 
 designs and projects of those who thus contrive to raise themselves 
 upon the ruins of others; and we see they are often disappointed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The displeasure of God against them for it. The providence of God 
 had done well for Tyrus. Tyrus was a pleasant and wealthy city, and 
 might have continued so if she had, as she ought to have done, 
 sympathized with Jerusalem in her calamities and sent her an address of 
 condolence; but when, instead of that, she showed herself pleased with 
 her neighbour's fall, and perhaps sent an address of congratulation to 
 the conquerors, then God says, <I>Behold, I am against thee, O 
 Tyrus!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 And let her not expect to prosper long if God be against her.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God will bring formidable enemies upon her: <I>Many nations shall 
 come against thee,</I> an army made up of many nations, or one nation 
 that shall be as strong as many. Those that have God against them may 
 expect all the creatures against them; for what peace can those have 
 with whom God is at war? They shall come pouring in as <I>the waves of 
 the sea,</I> one upon the neck of another, with an irresistible force. 
 The person is named that shall bring this army upon 
 them--<I>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings,</I> that had
 many kings tributaries to him and dependents on him, besides those that 
 were his captives, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:37,38">Dan. ii. 37, 38</A>.

 He is that <I>head of gold.</I> He shall come with a vast army,
 <I>horses and chariots,</I> &c., all land-forces. We do not find that
 he had any naval force, or any thing wherewith he might attack it by 
 sea, which made the attempt the more difficult, as we find

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:18"><I>ch.</I> xxix. 18</A>,

 where it is called a <I>great service which he served against
 Tyrus.</I> He shall besiege it in form 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 <I>make a fort, and cast a mount,</I> and 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 shall <I>set engines of war against the walls.</I> His troops shall be 
 so numerous as to raise a dust that shall cover the city, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 They shall make a noise that shall even <I>shake the walls;</I> and 
 they shall shout at every attack, as soldiers do when they <I>enter a 
 city</I> that is <I>broken up;</I> the horses shall prance with so much 
 fury and violence that they shall even <I>tread down the streets</I> 
 though so ever well paved.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They shall do terrible execution. 

 (1.) The enemy shall make themselves masters of all their 
 fortifications, shall <I>destroy the walls</I> and <I>break down the 
 towers,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 For what walls are so strongly built as to be a fence against the 
 judgments of God? Her <I>strong garrisons shall go down to the 
 ground,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 And the walls shall be broken down, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 The city held out a long siege, but it was taken at last. 

 (2.) A great deal of blood shall be shed: <I>Her daughters who are in 
 the field,</I> the cities upon the continent, which were subject to 
 Tyre as the mother-city, the inhabitants of them <I>shall be slain by 
 the sword,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 The invaders begin with those that come first in their way. And 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)
 
 <I>he shall slay thy people with the sword;</I> not only the soldiers 
 that are found in arms, but the burghers, shall be <I>put to the 
 sword,</I> the king of Babylon being highly incensed against them for 
 holding out so long. 

 (3.) The wealth of the city shall all become a spoil to the conqueror

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 They <I>shall make a prey of the merchandise.</I> It was in hope of the 
 plunder that the city was set upon with so much vigour. See the vanity 
 of riches, that they are <I>kept for the owners to their hurt;</I> they 
 entice and recompense thieves, and not only cease to benefit those who 
 took pains for them and were duly entitled to them, but are made to 
 serve their enemies, who are thereby put into a capacity of doing them 
 so much the more mischief. 

 (4.) The city itself shall be laid in ruins. All the <I>pleasant
 houses</I> shall be <I>destroyed</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 such as were pleasantly situated, beautified, and furnished, shall 
 become a heap of rubbish. Let none please themselves too much in their 
 pleasant houses, for they know not how soon they may see the desolation 
 of them. Tyre shall be utterly ruined; the enemy shall not only pull
 down the houses, but shall carry away <I>the stones and the timber,</I> 
 and shall <I>lay them in the midst of the water,</I> not to be 
 recovered, or ever made use of again. Nay 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 <I>I will scrape her dust from her;</I> not only shall the loose dust 
 be blown away, but the very ground it stands upon shall be torn up by 
 the enraged enemy, carried off, and laid <I>in the midst of the 
 water,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 The <I>foundation</I> is <I>in the dust;</I> that dust shall be all 
 taken away, and then the city must fall of course. When Jerusalem was
 destroyed it was <I>ploughed like a field,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+3:12">Mic. iii. 12</A>.

 But the destruction of Tyre is carried further than that; the very soil
 of it shall be scraped away, and it shall be made <I>like the top of a 
 rock</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:4,14"><I>v.</I> 4, 14</A>),

 pure rock that has no earth to cover it; it shall only be a place
 <I>for the spreading of nets</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:5,14"><I>v.</I> 5, 14</A>);

 it shall serve fishermen to dry their nets upon and mend them. 

 (5.) There shall be a full period to all its mirth and joy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease.</I> Tyre had been a
 joyous city 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:7">Isa. xxiii. 7</A>);

 with her songs she had courted customers to deal with her in a way of 
 trade. But now farewell all her profitable commerce and pleasant 
 conversation; Tyre is no more a place either of business or of sport.
 <I>Lastly,</I> It shall be <I>built no more</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 not built any more as it had been, with such state and magnificence, 
 nor built any more in the same place, within the sea, nor built any 
 where for a long time; the present inhabitants shall be destroyed or 
 dispersed, so that this Tyre shall be <I>no more.</I> For <I>God has 
 spoken it</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:5,14"><I>v.</I> 5, 14</A>);

 and when what he has said is accomplished <I>they shall know</I> 
 thereby that <I>he is the Lord,</I> and <I>not a man that he should lie 
 nor the son of man that he should repent.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  Thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> to Tyrus; Shall not the isles shake
 at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded cry, when the
 slaughter is made in the midst of thee?
 &nbsp; 16  Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their
 thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their broidered
 garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall
 sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at <I>every</I> moment, and be
 astonished at thee.
 &nbsp; 17  And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to
 thee, How art thou destroyed, <I>that wast</I> inhabited of seafaring
 men, the renowned city, which wast strong in the sea, she and her
 inhabitants, which cause their terror <I>to be</I> on all that haunt
 it!
 &nbsp; 18  Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the
 isles that <I>are</I> in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure.
 &nbsp; 19  For thus saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>; When I shall make thee a
 desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I
 shall bring up the deep upon thee, and great waters shall cover
 thee;
 &nbsp; 20  When I shall bring thee down with them that descend into the
 pit, with the people of old time, and shall set thee in the low
 parts of the earth, in places desolate of old, with them that go
 down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I shall set
 glory in the land of the living;
 &nbsp; 21  I will make thee a terror, and thou <I>shalt be</I> no <I>more:</I>
 though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again,
 saith the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The utter ruin of Tyre is here represented in very strong and lively 
 figures, which are exceedingly affecting.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. See how high, how great, Tyre had been, how little likely ever to 
 come to this. The remembrance of men's former grandeur and plenty is a 
 great aggravation of their present disgrace and poverty. Tyre was <I>a 
 renowned city</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 famous among the nations, the <I>crowning</I> city (so she is called 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:8">Isa. xxiii. 8</A>),

 a city that had crowns in her gift, honoured all she smiled upon,
 crowned herself and all about her. She was <I>inhabited of seas,</I> 
 that is, of those that trade at sea, of those who from all parts came 
 thither by sea, bringing with them the <I>abundance of the seas</I> and 
 <I>the treasures hidden in the sand.</I> She was <I>strong in the 
 sea,</I> easy of access to her friends, but to her enemies 
 inaccessible, fortified by a <I>wall of water,</I> which made her 
 impregnable. So that <I>she</I> with her pomp, <I>and her 
 inhabitants</I> with their pride, <I>caused their terror to be on all 
 that haunted</I> that city, and upon any account frequented it. It was 
 well fortified, and formidable in the eyes of all that acquainted 
 themselves with it. Every body stood in awe of the Tyrians and was 
 afraid of disobliging them. Note, Those who know their strength are too 
 apt to cause terror, to pride themselves in frightening those they are 
 an over-match for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. See how low, how little, Tyre is made, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 This <I>renowned city</I> is made a <I>desolate city,</I> is no more 
 frequented as it has been; there is no more resort of merchants to it; 
 it is <I>like the cities not inhabited,</I> which are no cities, and 
 having none to keep them in repair, will go to decay of themselves. 
 Tyre shall be like a city overflowed by an inundation of waters, which 
 <I>cover</I> it, and upon which the <I>deep</I> is <I>brought up.</I> 
 As the waves had formerly been its defence, so now they shall be its 
 destruction. She shall be <I>brought down with those that descend into 
 the pit,</I> with the cities of the old world that were under water, 
 and with <I>Sodom and Gomorrah,</I> that lie in the bottom of the Dead 
 Sea. Or, she shall be in the condition of those who have been long 
 buried, of the <I>people of old time,</I> who are old inhabitants of 
 the silent grace, who are quite rotted away under ground and quite 
 forgotten above ground; such shall <I>Tyre be, free among the dead, set 
 in the lower parts of the earth,</I> humbled, mortified, reduced. It 
 shall be <I>like the places desolate of old,</I> as well as like 
 persons dead of old; it shall be like other cities that have formerly 
 been in like manner deserted and destroyed. It shall <I>not be 
 inhabited</I> again; none shall have the courage to attempt the 
 rebuilding of it upon that spot, so that <I>it shall be no more;</I> 
 The Tyrians shall be lost among the nations, so that people will look 
 in vain for Tyre in Tyre: <I>Thou shalt be sought for, and never found 
 again.</I> New persons may build a new city upon a new spot of ground 
 hard by, which they may call <I>Tyre,</I> but Tyre, as it is, shall 
 never be any more. Note, The strongest cities in this world, the 
 best-fortified and best-furnished, are subject to decay, and may in a 
 little time be brought to nothing. In the history of our own island
 many cities are spoken of as in being when the Romans were here which 
 now our antiquaries scarcely know where to look for, and of which there 
 remains no more evidence than Roman urns and coins digged up there 
 sometimes accidentally. But in the other world we look for a city that 
 shall stand for ever and flourish in perfection through all the ages of 
 eternity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. See what a distress the inhabitants of Tyre are in 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>There is a great slaughter made in the midst of thee,</I> many 
 slain, and great men. It is probable that, when the city was taken, the 
 generality of the inhabitants were put to the sword. Then did <I>the 
 wounded cry,</I> and they cried in vain, to the pitiless conquerors; 
 they cried <I>quarter,</I> but it would not be given them; the wounded 
 are <I>slain</I> without mercy, or, rather, that is the only mercy that 
 is shown them, that the second blow shall rid them out of their 
 pain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. See what a consternation all the neighbours are in upon the fall of 
 Tyre. This is elegantly expressed here, to show how astonishing it 
 should be. 

 (1.) the <I>islands</I> shall <I>shake at the sound of thy fall</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 as, when a great merchant breaks, all that he deals with are shocked by 
 it, and begin to look about them; perhaps they had effects in his 
 hands, which they are afraid they shall lose. Or, when they see one 
 fail and become bankrupt of a sudden, in debt a great deal more than he 
 is worth, it makes them afraid for themselves, lest they should do so 
 too. Thus <I>the isles,</I> which thought themselves safe in the 
 embraces of the sea, when they see Tyrus fall, shall <I>tremble</I> and 
 <I>be troubled,</I> saying, "What will become of us?" And it is well if 
 they make this good use of it, to take warning by it not to be secure, 
 but to stand in awe of God and his judgments. The sudden fall of a
 great tower shakes the ground round about it; thus all the islands in 
 the Mediterranean Sea shall feel themselves sensibly touched by the 
 destruction of Tyre, it being a place they had so much knowledge of, 
 such interests in, and such a constant correspondence with. 

 (2.) The <I>princes of the sea</I> shall be affected with it, who ruled 
 in those islands. Or the rich merchants, who live like princes 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:8">Isa. xxiii. 8</A>),

 and the masters of ships, who command like princes, these shall condole
 the fall of Tyre in a most compassionate and pathetic manner

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):
 
 <I>They shall come down from their thrones,</I> as neglecting the 
 business of their thrones and despising the pomp of them. They shall 
 <I>lay away their robes</I> of state, <I>their broidered garments,</I> 
 and shall <I>clothe themselves</I> all over with <I>tremblings,</I> 
 with sackcloth that will make them shiver. Or they shall by their own 
 act and deed make themselves to tremble upon this occasion; they shall 
 <I>sit upon the ground</I> in shame and sorrow; they shall <I>tremble 
 every moment</I> at the thought of what has happened to Tyre, and for 
 fear of what may happen to themselves; for what island is safe if Tyre 
 be not? They shall <I>take up a lamentation for thee,</I> shall have 
 elegies and mournful poems penned upon the fall of Tyre, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 <I>How art thou destroyed!</I> 

 [1.] It shall be a great surprise to them, and they shall be affected 
 with wonder, that a place so well fortified by nature and art, so famed 
 for politics and so full of money, which is the sinews of war, that 
 held out so long and with so much bravery, should be taken at last

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>I make thee a terror.</I> Note, It is just with God to make those a 
 terror to their neighbours, by the suddenness and strangeness of their 
 punishment, who make themselves a terror to their neighbours by the 
 abuse of their power. Tyre had <I>caused her terror</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>)

 and now is made a terrible example.

 [2.] It shall be a great affliction to them, and they shall be affected 
 with sorrow 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);

 they shall <I>take up a lamentation for Tyre,</I> as thinking it a 
 thousand pities that such a rich and splendid city should be thus laid 
 in ruins. When Jerusalem, the holy city, was destroyed, there were no 
 such lamentations for it; it was <I>nothing</I> to <I>those that passed 
 by</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+1:12">Lam. i. 12</A>);

 but when Tyre, the trading city, fell, it was universally bemoaned.
 Note, Those who have the world in their hearts lament the loss of great 
 men more than the loss of good men.

 [3.] It shall be a loud alarm to them: <I>They shall tremble in the day 
 of thy fall,</I> because they shall have reason to think that their own 
 turn will be next. If Tyre fall, who can stand? <I>Howl, fir-trees, if 
 such a cedar be shaken.</I> Note, The fall of others should awaken us 
 out of our security. The death or decay of others in the world is a 
 check to us, when we dream that our mountain <I>stands strongly and 
 shall not be moved.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. See how the irreparable ruin of Tyre is aggravated by the prospect 
 of the restoration of Israel. Thus shall Tyre sink <I>when I shall set 
 glory in the land of the living,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 
 Note, 

 (1.) The holy land is the <I>land of the living;</I> for none but holy 
 souls are properly living souls. Where living sacrifices are offered to 
 the living God, and where the lively oracles are, there <I>the land of 
 the living</I> is; there David hoped to <I>see the goodness of the 
 Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:13">Ps. xxvii. 13</A>.

 That was a type of heaven, which is indeed the <I>land of the
 living.</I>

 (2.) Though this land of the living may for a time lie under disgrace, 
 yet God will again <I>set glory</I> in it; the glory that had departed 
 shall return, and the restoration of what they had been deprived of 
 shall be so much more their glory. God will himself be the glory of the 
 lands that are the lands of the living.

 (3.) It will aggravate the misery of those that have their portion in 
 the land of the dying, of those that are for ever dying, to behold the 
 happiness of those, at the same time, that shall have their everlasting 
 portion in the land of the living. When the rich man was himself in 
 torment he saw Lazarus in the bosom of Abraham, and glory set for him 
 in the land of the living.</P>
