 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The same strings, though generally unpleasing ones, are harped upon in 
 this chapter that were in those before. People care not to be told 
 either of their sin or of their danger by sin; and yet it is necessary, 
 and for their good, that they should be told of both, nor can they 
 better hear of either than from the word of God and from their faithful 
 ministers, while the sin may be repented of and the danger prevented. 
 Here, 

 I. The people of Israel are reproved and threatened for their idolatry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+13:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. They are reproved and threatened for their wantonness, pride, and
 luxury, and other abuses of their wealth and prosperity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+13:5-8">ver. 5-8</A>.

 III. The ruin that is coming upon them for these and all their other
 sins is foretold as very terrible, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+13:12,13,15,16">ver. 12, 13, 15, 16</A>.

 IV. Those among them that yet retain a respect for their God are here
 encouraged to hope that he will yet appear for their relief, though 
 their kings and princes, and all their other supports and succours, 
 fail them,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel;
 but when he offended in Baal, he died.
 &nbsp; 2  And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten
 images of their silver, <I>and</I> idols according to their own
 understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of
 them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.
 &nbsp; 3  Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the
 early dew that passeth away, as the chaff <I>that</I> is driven with
 the whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the
 chimney.
 &nbsp; 4  Yet I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou
 shalt know no god but me: for <I>there is</I> no saviour beside me.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Idolatry was the sin that did most easily beset the Jewish nation till 
 after the captivity; the ten tribes from the first were guilty of it, 
 but especially after the days of Ahab; and this is the sin which, in 
 these verses, they are charged with. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The provision that God made to prevent their falling into idolatry. 
 This we have, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 God did what was fit to be done to keep them close to himself; what 
 could have been done more? 

 1. He made known himself to them as <I>the Lord their God,</I> and took
 them to be his people in a peculiar manner. Both by his word and by his 
 works all along <I>from the land of Egypt</I> he declared, <I>I am the 
 Lord thy God;</I> he told them so from heaven at Mount Sinai, that he 
 was <I>the Lord</I> and <I>their God,</I> who <I>brought them out of 
 the land of Egypt.</I> This he continued both to declare and to prove 
 to them by his prophets and by his providences. 

 2. He gave them a law forbidding them to worship any other: "<I>Thou
 shalt know no God but me;</I> not only shalt not own and worship any 
 other, but shalt not acquaint thyself with any other, nor make the 
 rites and usages of the Gentiles familiar to thee." Note, It is a happy 
 ignorance not to know that which we ought not to meddle with. We find 
 those commended who <I>have not known the depths of Satan.</I> 

 3. He gave them a good reason for it: <I>There is no saviour besides 
 me.</I> Whatever we take for our God we expect to have for our saviour,
 to make us happy here and hereafter; as, where we have protection, we 
 owe allegiance, so where we have salvation, and hope for it, we owe 
 adoration.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The honour that Ephraim had, while he kept himself clear from 
 idolatry 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>While Ephraim spoke trembling,</I> or <I>with trembling</I> (that 
 is, as Dr. Pocock understands it, while he behaved himself towards God 
 as his father Jacob did, with <I>weeping and supplications,</I> and 
 spoke not proudly and insolently against God and his prophets, while he 
 kept up a holy fear of God, and worshipped him in that fear) so long 
 <I>he exalted himself in Israel,</I> that is, he was very considerable 
 among the tribes and made a figure. Jeroboam, who was of that tribe, 
 exalted himself and his family. <I>When he spoke there was 
 trembling,</I> that is, all about him stood in awe of him; so some 
 understand it. Note, <I>Those that humble themselves,</I> especially 
 that humble themselves before God, <I>shall be exalted.</I> When people 
 speak with modesty and jealousy of themselves, with a diffidence of 
 their own judgment and a deference to others, they exalt themselves, 
 they gain a reputation. But as for Ephraim he soon lost himself: 
 <I>When he offended in Baal he died,</I> that is, he lost his 
 reputation, his honour soon dwindled and sunk, and was laid in the 
 dust. Baal is here put for all idolatry; when Ephraim forsook God, and 
 took to worship images, the state received its death's wound and was 
 never good for any thing afterwards. Note, Deserting God is the death 
 of any person or persons.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The lamentable growth of idolatry among them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>Now they sin more and more.</I> When once he began to <I>offend in 
 Baal</I> the ice was broken, and he grew worse and worse, coveted more 
 idols, doted more upon those he had, and grew more ridiculous in the 
 worship of them. Note, The way of idolatry, as of other sins, is 
 down-hill, and men cannot easily stop themselves. It is the sad case of 
 all those who have forsaken God that they sin yet more and more. Let us 
 trace them in their apostasy.

 1. They made themselves <I>molten images,</I> proud to have gods that
 they could cast into what mould they pleased; probably these were the 
 calves in miniature like the silver shrines for Diana; the zealots for 
 the calf-worship carried about with them, it may be, images of the gods 
 they worshipped, made on purpose <I>for themselves.</I> 

 2. They made them of <I>their silver,</I> and then doubted not of their
 property in them, when they purchased them with their own money or made 
 them of their own plate melted down for that purpose. See what cost 
 they put themselves to in the service of their idols, which they 
 honoured with the best they had, and therefore made their molten images 
 of silver. 

 3. They made them <I>according to their own understanding,</I>
 according to their own fancy. They consulted with themselves what shape 
 they should make their idol in, and made it accordingly, <I>a god</I> 
 according to the <I>best of their judgment.</I> Or <I>according to 
 their own likeness,</I> in the form of a man. And, when they made
 their idols men like themselves in shape, they made themselves stocks 
 and stones like them in reality; for <I>those that make them are like 
 unto them, and so is every one that trusts in them.</I> 

 4. It was <I>all the work of the craftsmen.</I> Their images did not
 pretend, like that of Diana, to have come down from Jupiter

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:35">Acts xix. 35</A>);

 no, perhaps the workmen stamped their names upon them, such an idol was
 such a man's work. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:6,Isa+44:9"><I>ch.</I> viii. 6; Isa. xliv. 9</A>,

 &c.

 5. Though they were thus the work of their hands, yet they were the
 beloved of their souls; for they say of them, <I>Let the men that 
 sacrifice kiss the calves.</I> Either the priests called upon the 
 people thus to pay their homage, or the people, who were not allowed to 
 come so near themselves, called upon the <I>men that sacrificed,</I> 
 the priests that attended for them, to <I>kiss the calves</I> in their 
 name and stead, because they could not reach to do it, so very fond 
 were they of paying their utmost respects to such an idol as they were 
 taught to have a veneration for. Though they were calves, yet, if they 
 were gods, the worshippers, by themselves or their proxies, thus made 
 their honours to them. They <I>kissed the calves,</I> in token of the 
 adoration of them, affection for them, and allegiance to them, as 
 theirs. Thus we are directed to <I>kiss the Son,</I> to take him for 
 our Lord and our God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Threatenings of wrath for their idolatry. The Lord, whose name is 
 <I>Jealous,</I> is a jealous God, and will not give his glory to 
 another; and therefore all those that <I>worship images</I> shall be 
 <I>confounded,</I> especially if Ephraim do it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+97:7">Ps. xcvii. 7</A>.

 Because they are so fond of kissing their calves, therefore God will
 give them sensible convictions of their folly,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 They promise themselves a great deal of safety and satisfaction in the 
 worship of their idols, and that their prosperity will thereby be 
 established; but God tells them that they shall be disappointed, and 
 <I>driven away in their wickedness.</I> This is illustrated by four 
 similitudes:--They shall be, 

 1. As the <I>morning cloud,</I> which promises showers of rain to the
 parched ground. 

 2. As the <I>early dew,</I> which seems to be an earnest of such
 showers. But both <I>pass away,</I> and the day proves as dry and hot 
 as ever; so fleet and transitory their profession of piety was

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:4"><I>ch.</I> vi. 4</A>),

 and so had they disappointed God's expectation from them, and therefore
 it is just that so their prosperity should be, and so their 
 expectations from their idols should be disappointed, and so will all 
 theirs be that make an idol of this world. 

 3. They are <I>as the chaff,</I> light and worthless; and they shall be
 driven <I>as the chaff is driven with the whirlwind out of the 
 floor,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:4,25:5,Job+21:18">Ps. i. 4; xxv. 5; Job xxi. 18</A>.
 
 Nay,

 4. They are <I>as the smoke,</I> noisome and offensive (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:5">Isa. lxv. 5</A>),

 and they shall be driven away <I>as the smoke out of the chimneys,</I>
 that is soon dissipated and disappears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:2">Ps. lxviii. 2</A>.

 Note, No solid lasting comfort is to be expected any where but in
 God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great
 drought.
 &nbsp; 6  According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were
 filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they
 forgotten me.
 &nbsp; 7  Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the
 way will I observe <I>them:</I>
 &nbsp; 8  I will meet them as a bear <I>that is</I> bereaved <I>of her
 whelps,</I> and will rend the caul of their heart, and there will I
 devour them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may observe here, 

 1. The plentiful provision God had made for Israel and the seasonable
 supplies he had blessed them with

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>I did know thee in the wilderness,</I> took cognizance of thy case 
 and made provision for thee, even in <I>a land of great drought,</I> 
 when thou wast in extreme distress, and when no relief was to be had in 
 an ordinary way." See a description of this wilderness, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:15,Jer+2:6">Deut. viii. 15, Jer. ii. 6</A>,

 and say, The God that knew them, and owned them, and fed them there,
 was a <I>friend indeed,</I> for he was a <I>friend at need</I> and an 
 all-sufficient friend, that could victual so vast an army when all 
 ordinary ways of provision were cut off, and where, if miracles had not 
 been their daily bread, they must all have perished. Note, Help at an
 exigency lays under peculiar obligations and must never be forgotten.

 2. Their unworthy ungrateful abuse of God's favour to them. God not
 only took care of them in the wilderness, but put them in possession of 
 Canaan, a good land, a large and fat pasture. And

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)
 
 <I>according to their pasture so were they filled.</I> God gave them 
 both plenty and dainties, and they did not spare it, but, having been 
 long confined to manna, when they came into Canaan they fed themselves 
 <I>to the full.</I> And this was no hopeful presage; it would have 
 looked better, and promised better, if they had been more modest and 
 moderate in the use of their plenty, and had learned to deny 
 themselves; but what was the effect of it? <I>They were filled, and 
 their heart was exalted.</I> Their luxury and sensuality made them 
 proud, insolent, and secure. The best comment upon this is that of 
 Moses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:13-15">Deut. xxxii. 13-15</A>.

 But <I>Jeshurun waxed fat and kicked.</I> When the body was stuffed up
 with plenty the soul was puffed up with pride. Then they began to
 think their religion a thing below them, and they could not persuade 
 themselves to stoop to the services of it. <I>The wicked, through the 
 pride of his countenance, will not seek after God.</I> When they were 
 poor and lame in the wilderness they thought it was necessary for them 
 to keep in with God; but when they were replenished and established in 
 Canaan they began to think they had no further need of him: <I>Their 
 heart was exalted, therefore have they forgotten me.</I> Note, Worldly 
 prosperity, when it feeds men's pride, makes them forgetful of God; for 
 they remember him only when they want him. When Israel was filled, what 
 more could the Almighty do for them? And therefore they said to him,
 <I>Depart from us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:17">Job xxii. 17</A>.

 It is sad that those favours which ought to make us mindful of God, and
 studious what we shall render to him, should make us unmindful of him, 
 and regardless what we do against him. We ought to know that we live 
 upon God when we live upon common providence, though we do not, as 
 Israel in the wilderness, live upon miracles.

 3. God's just resentment of their base ingratitude,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.
 
 The judgments threatened 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)
 
 intimated the departure of all good from them. The threatenings here go 
 further, and intimate the breaking in of all evils upon them; for God, 
 who had so much befriended them, now <I>turns to be their enemy and 
 fights against them,</I> which is expressed here very terribly: <I>I 
 will be unto them as a lion</I> and <I>as a leopard.</I> The lion is 
 strong, and there is no resisting him. The leopard is here taken notice 
 of to be crafty and vigilant: <I>As a leopard by the way will I observe 
 them.</I> As that beast of prey lies in wait by the road-side to catch 
 travellers, and devour them, so will God by his judgments <I>watch over 
 them</I> to do them hurt, as he had watched over them to do them good, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+44:27">Jer. xliv. 27</A>.

 No opportunity shall be let slip that may accelerate or aggravate their
 ruin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:6">Jer. v. 6</A>):

 <I>A leopard shall watch over their cities.</I> A lynx, or spotted
 beast (and such the leopard is), is noted for quicksightedness above 
 any creature (<I>lynx visu--the eyes of a lynx</I>), and so it 
 intimates that not only the power, but the wisdom of God is engaged 
 against those whom he has a controversy with. Some read it (and the
 original will bear it), <I>I will be as a leopard in the way of 
 Assyria.</I> The judgments of God shall surprise them just when they 
 are going to the Assyrians to seek for protection and help from them. 
 It is added, <I>I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved,</I> and 
 thereby exasperated and made more cruel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+17:8,Pr+28:15">2 Sam. xvii. 8, Prov. xxviii. 15</A>),

 which intimates how highly God was provoked, and he would make them 
 feel it: He will <I>rend the caul of their heart.</I> The lion is 
 observed to aim at the heart of the beasts he preys upon, and thus will 
 God <I>devour them like a lion.</I> He will send such judgments upon 
 them as shall prey upon their spirits and consume their vitals. Their 
 heart was exalted 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 but God will take an effectual course to bring it down: <I>The wild 
 beast shall tear them;</I> not only God will be as a lion and leopard 
 to them, but the metaphor shall be fulfilled in the letter, for 
 <I>noisome beasts</I> are one of the <I>four sore judgments</I> with 
 which God will destroy a provoking people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:15">Ezek. xiv. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now all this teaches us, 

 1. That abused goodness turns into the greater severity. Those who
 despise God and affront him, when he is to them as a careful tender 
 shepherd, shall find he will be even to his own flock as the beasts of 
 prey are. Those whom God has in vain <I>endured with much 
 long-suffering,</I> and invited with much affection, in them he will 
 <I>show his wrath</I> and make them <I>vessels</I> of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:22">Rom. ix. 22</A>.
 
 <I>Patientia l&aelig;sa fit furor</I>--<I>Despised patience will turn
 into fury.</I> 

 2. That the judgments of God, when they come with commission against
 impenitent sinners, will be irresistible and very terrible. They will 
 <I>rend the caul of the heart,</I> will fill the soul with confusion, 
 and tear that in pieces; and we are as unable to grapple with them as a 
 lamb is to make his part good against a roaring lion, for <I>who knows 
 the power of God's anger? Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord,</I> 
 let us be persuaded to make peace with him; for are we stronger then 
 he?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The first of these verses is the summary, or contents, of all the rest 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 where we have, 

 1. All the blame of Israel's ruin laid upon themselves: <I>O Israel!
 thy perdition is thence;</I> it is of and from thyself; or, "<I>It has 
 destroyed thee, O Israel!</I> that is, all that sin and folly of thine 
 which thou art before charged with. As <I>thy own wickedness</I> has 
 many a time <I>corrected thee,</I> so that has now at length destroyed 
 thee." Note, Wilful sinners are self-destroyers. Obstinate impenitence
 is the grossest self-murder. Those that are <I>destroyed of the
 destroyer</I> have their blood upon their own head; they have 
 <I>destroyed themselves.</I> 

 2. All the glory of Israel's relief ascribed to God: <I>But in me is
 thy help.</I> That is,

 (1.) It might have been: "I would have helped thee and healed thee, but 
 thou wouldst not be healed and helped, but wast resolutely set upon thy 
 own destruction." This will aggravate the condemnation of sinners, not 
 only that they did that which tended to their own ruin, but that they 
 opposed the offers God made them and the methods he took with them to 
 prevent it: <I>I would have gathered them,</I> and they <I>would 
 not.</I> They might have been easily and effectually helped, but they 
 put the help away from them. Nay, 

 (2.) It may be: "Thy case is bad, but it is not desperate. <I>Thou hast 
 destroyed thyself;</I> but come to me, and I will help thee." This is a 
 plank thrown out after shipwreck, and greatly magnifies not only the 
 power of God, that he can help when things are at the worst, can help 
 those that cannot help themselves, but the riches of his grace, that he 
 will help those that have destroyed themselves and therefore might 
 justly be left to perish, that he will help those that have long 
 refused his help. Dr. Pocock gives a different reading and sense of 
 this verse: "<I>O Israel! this has destroyed thee, that in me is thy 
 help.</I> Presuming upon God and his favour has emboldened thee in 
 those wicked ways which have been thy ruin."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, in the rest of these verses, we may see,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How Israel destroyed themselves. It is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 They <I>rebelled against God,</I> revolted from their allegiance to 
 him, entered into a confederacy with his enemies, and took up arms 
 against him; and this was the thing that ruined them, for never any 
 hardened themselves against God and prospered. Note, Those that rebel 
 against their God destroy themselves, for they make him their enemy for 
 whom they are an unequal match.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They treasure up wrath against the day of wrath, and so they destroy 
 themselves. They are doing that, every day, which will be remembered 
 against them another day 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up, and his sin is hid;</I> God 
 took notice of it, kept it upon record, and will produce it against him 
 and reckon with him for it afterwards. Their former sins contributed
 to their present destruction; for they were <I>laid up in store with 
 God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:34,35,Job+14:17">Deut. xxxii. 34, 35; Job xiv. 17</A>.

 It is laid up in safety, and will not be forgotten, nor the evidence
 against him lost; but it is laid up in secret; it is hid; the sinner 
 himself is not aware of it. It is bound up in God's omniscience, in the 
 sinner's own conscience. Note, The sin of sinners is not forgotten till 
 it is pardoned, but an exact account is kept of it, which will be 
 opened in proper time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They make no haste to repent and help themselves when they are under 
 divine rebukes; they are their own ruin because they will not do what 
 they should do towards their own salvation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 (1.) They are brought into trouble and distress by sin: <I>The sorrows 
 of a travailing woman shall come upon him.</I> They shall smart for 
 sin, and so be made sensible of it; they shall be thrown into pangs and 
 agonies by it, very sharp and severe, and yet, like the pains of a 
 woman in labour, hopeful and promising, and in order to deliverance; 
 and by these, though God corrects them, yet he designs their good. They 
 are chastened, that they may not be destroyed. But, 

 (2.) They are not by these forwarded as they ought to be towards 
 repentance and reformation, which would cause their sorrows to issue in 
 true joy: <I>He is an unwise son, for he should not stay long,</I> as 
 he does, <I>in the place of the breaking forth of children,</I> but, 
 being <I>brought to the birth,</I> should struggle to <I>get forth,</I> 
 lest he be stifled and <I>still-born at last.</I> Were the child which 
 the mother is in travail of capable of understanding its own case, we 
 should reckon it an unwise child that would choose to stay long in the 
 birth; for the <I>captive exile hasteth to be loosed, lest he die in 
 the pit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:14">Isa. li. 14</A>.

 Note, Those may justly be reckoned their own destroyers who defer and
 put off their repentance, by which alone they might help themselves. 
 Those are in danger of miscarrying in conversion who delay it, and will 
 not put forth themselves to speed the work and bring it to an 
 issue.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. <I>Therefore</I> they are destroyed because they have done that 
 which will be their certain ruin and neglected that which would have 
 been their only relief. Here is a sad description of the desolation 
 they are doomed to, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 It is here taken for granted that <I>Ephraim</I> is <I>fruitful among 
 his children;</I> his name signifies <I>fruitfulness.</I> He is 
 fruitful in respect of the plentiful products of his country and the 
 great numbers of its inhabitants; it was both a rich and a populous 
 tribe, as was foretold concerning it; but sin turns this fruitful tribe 
 into barrenness. <I>Joseph</I> was a <I>fruitful bough,</I> but for
 sin it was blasted. The instrument is an <I>east wind,</I>
 representing a foreign enemy that should invade it. It is called the 
 <I>wind of the Lord,</I> not only because it shall be a very great and 
 strong wind, but because it shall be sent by divine direction; it shall 
 come <I>from the Lord,</I> and do whatever he appoints; and see what 
 effect it shall have upon that flourishing tribe, what desolations war 
 shall make. 

 (1.) Was it a rich tribe? The foreign enemy shall make it poor enough. 
 This <I>wind of the Lord</I> shall come up <I>from the wilderness,</I> 
 a freezing blasting wind, and shall <I>dry up</I> the <I>springs</I> 
 and <I>fountains</I> with which this tree is watered, shall exhaust the 
 sources of its wealth. The invader shall waste the country and so 
 impoverish the husbandman, shall intercept trade and commerce and so 
 impoverish the merchant; and let not the great men, whose wealth lies 
 in their rich furniture, think that they shall be exempted from the 
 judgment, for he shall <I>spoil the treasure of all pleasant 
 vessels.</I> See the folly of those that lay up their treasure on 
 earth, that lay it up in <I>pleasant vessels (vessels of desire,</I> so 
 the word is), on which they set their affections, and in which they 
 place their comfort and satisfaction. This is treasure that may be 
 spoiled and that they may be spoiled of; it is what either moth or rust 
 may corrupt, or what thieves and soldiers may steal and carry away. But 
 wise and happy are those who have laid up their treasures in heaven, 
 and in the pleasant things of that world, which cannot be spoiled, 
 which they cannot be stripped of; ever happy are they, and therefore 
 truly wise. 

 (2.) Was it a populous tribe, and numerous? The enemy shall depopulate 
 it and make its men few: <I>Samaria shall become desolate,</I> without 
 inhabitants.

 [1.] Those shall be cut off who are the guard and joy of the present 
 generation; the men who bear arms shall bear them to no purpose, for 
 <I>they shall fall by the sword,</I> so that there shall be none to 
 make head against the fury of the conqueror nor to take care of the 
 concerns either of the public or of private families.

 [2.] Those shall be cut off who are the seed and hope of the next 
 generation, who should rise up in the places of those who fell by the 
 sword; the whole nation must be rooted out, and therefore <I>the 
 infants shall be dashed to pieces,</I> in the most cruel and barbarous 
 manner, and, which is if possible yet more inhuman, <I>the women with 
 child shall be ripped up.</I> Thus shall the glory of <I>Samaria flee 
 away from the birth, and from the womb,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:11,10:14"><I>ch.</I> ix. 11; x. 14</A>.

 See instances of this cruelty,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:12,15:16,Am+1:13">2 Kings viii. 12; xv. 16; Amos i. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Let us now see how God was the help of this self-destroying people, 
 how he was their only help 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>I will be thy King,</I> to rule and save thee. Though they had 
 refused to be his subjects and had rebelled against him, yet he would 
 still be their King and would not abandon them. The business and care 
 of a good king is to keep his people, not only from ruined by foreign 
 enemies, but from ruining themselves and one another. Thus will God yet 
 be Israel's King, as he was <I>their King of old.</I> Note, Our case 
 would be sad indeed if God were not better to us than we are to 
 ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God will be their King when they have no other king; he will protect 
 and save them when those are cut off and gone who should have been 
 their protectors and saviours: <I>I will be he</I> (so 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>

 may be read), he that shall help thee. "<I>Where is the king that may 
 save thee in all thy cities,</I> that may go in and out before thee, 
 and fight thy battles, when thy cities are invaded by a foreign power, 
 and suppress the more dangerous quarrels of thy citizens among 
 themselves? <I>Where are thy judges,</I> who by administering public
 justice should preserve the public peace? For it is 
 <I>righteousness</I> and <I>peace</I> that <I>kiss each other. Where 
 are thy judges</I> that thou hadst such a desire of and such a 
 dependence upon, of whom thou saidst, <I>Give me a king and 
 princes?</I> This refers, 

 (1.) To the foolish wicked desire which the whole nation had of a 
 kingly government, being weary of the theocracy, or divine government, 
 which they had been under during the time of the <I>Judges,</I> because 
 it looked too mean for them. They rejected Samuel, and in him <I>the 
 Lord,</I> when they said, <I>Give us a king</I> like the nations, 
 whereas the <I>Lord was their King.</I> 

 (2.) To the desire which the ten tribes had of a kingly government 
 different from that of the house of David, because they thought that 
 was too absolute and bore too hard upon them, and they hoped to better 
 themselves by setting up Jeroboam. Both these are instances,

 [1.] Of men's improvidence for themselves. When they are uneasy with
 their present lot they are fond of novelty, and think to better 
 themselves by a change; but they are commonly disappointed, and do not 
 find that advantage in the alteration which they promised themselves.

 [2.] Of men's impiety towards God, in thinking to refine upon his 
 appointments and amend them. God gave Israel judges and prophets for 
 their guidance; but they were weary of them, and cried, <I>Give us a 
 king and princes.</I> God gave them the house of David, established it 
 by a covenant of royalty; but they were soon weary of that too, and 
 cried, <I>We have no part in David.</I> Those destroy themselves who 
 are not pleased with what God does for them, but think they can do 
 better for themselves. Well, in both these requests, Providence 
 humoured them, gave them Saul first, and afterwards Jeroboam. And what 
 the better were they for them? Saul was <I>given in anger</I> (given in 
 <I>thunder,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+12:18,19">1 Sam. xii. 18, 19</A>)

 and soon after was <I>taken away in wrath,</I> upon Mount Gilboa. The
 kingly government of the ten tribes was given in anger, not only 
 against Solomon for his defection, but against the ten tribes that 
 desired it, for their discontent and disaffection to the house of 
 David; and God was now about to take that away in wrath by the power of 
 the king of Assyria. And then, <I>where is thy King?</I> He is gone, 
 and thou shalt abide many days <I>without a king, and without a 
 prince</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+3:4"><I>ch.</I> iii. 4</A>),

 shalt have none to save thee, none to rule thee. Note, <I>First,</I>
 God often gives in anger what we sinfully and inordinately desire, 
 gives it with a curse, and with it gives us up to our own hearts' 
 lusts. Thus he gave Israel quails. <I>Secondly,</I> What we 
 inordinately desire we are commonly disappointed in, and it cannot save 
 us, as we expected it should. <I>Thirdly,</I> What God gives in anger 
 he takes away in wrath; what he gives because we did not desire it well 
 he takes away because we did not use it well. It is the happiness of 
 the saints that, whether God gives or takes, it is all in love, and 
 furnishes them with matter for praise. <I>To the pure all things are 
 pure.</I> It is the misery of the wicked that, whether God gives or 
 takes, it is all in wrath; to them nothing is pure, nothing is 
 comfortable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. God will do that for them which no other king could do if they had 
 one 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+13:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>I will ransom them from the power of the grave.</I> Though Israel, 
 according to the flesh, be abandoned to destruction, God has mercy in 
 store for his spiritual Israel, in whom all the promises were to have 
 their accomplishment, and this among the rest, for to them the apostle 
 applies it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:55">1 Cor. xv. 55</A>),

 and particularly to the blessed resurrection of believers at the great
 day, yet not excluding their spiritual resurrection from the death of 
 sin to a holy, heavenly, spiritual, and divine life. It is promised,

 (1.) That the captives shall be delivered, <I>shall be ransomed, from 
 the power of the grave.</I> Their deliverance shall be by ransom; and 
 we know who it was that paid their ransom, and what the ransom was, for 
 it was the Son of man that <I>gave his life a ransom for many,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:28">Matt. xx. 28</A>.

 It is he that thus redeemed them. Those who, upon their repenting and 
 believing, are, for the sake of Christ's righteousness, acquitted from
 the guilt of sin and saved from death and hell, which are the <I>wages 
 of sin,</I> are those <I>ransomed of the Lord</I> that shall, in the 
 great day, be brought out of the grave in triumph, and it shall be as 
 impossible for the banks of death to hold them as it was to hold their 
 Master.

 (2.) That the conqueror shall be destroyed: <I>O death! I will be thy 
 plagues.</I> Jesus Christ was the plague and destruction of death and 
 the grave when by death he <I>destroyed him that had the power of 
 death,</I> and when in his own resurrection he triumphed over the 
 grave. But the complete destruction of them will be in the resurrection 
 of believers at the great day, when death shall for ever be swallowed 
 up in victory, and it is the last enemy that shall be destroyed. But 
 the word which we translate <I>I will</I> may as well be rendered 
 <I>Ubi nunc--Where now</I> are thy plagues? And so the apostle took it: 
 <I>'O death! where is thy plague,</I> or <I>sting,</I> with which thou 
 hast so long pestered the world? <I>O grave! where is thy victory,</I> 
 or thy <I>destruction,</I> wherewith thou has destroyed mankind?" 
 Christ has abolished death, has broken the power of it and altered the 
 property of it, and so enabled us to triumph over it. This promise he 
 has made, and it shall be made good to all that are his; for 
 <I>repentance shall be hidden from his eyes;</I> he will never recall 
 this sentence passed on death and the grave, for he is not a man that 
 he should repent. Thanks be to God therefore who gives us the 
 victory.</P>
