 In this chapter we have, 

 I. A command given to Jonah to preach at Nineveh, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. Jonah's disobedience to that command, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:3">ver. 3</A>.

 III. The pursuit and arrest of him for that disobedience by a storm, in 
 which he was asleep, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:4-6">ver. 4-6</A>.

 IV. The discovery of him, and his disobedience, to be the cause of the
 storm, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:7-10">ver. 7-10</A>.

 V. The casting of him into the sea, for the stilling of the storm, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:11-16">ver. 11-16</A>.

 VI. The miraculous preservation of his life there in the belly of a 
 fish 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:17">ver. 17</A>),
 
 which was his reservation for further services.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Now the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto Jonah the son of Amittai,
 saying,
 &nbsp; 2 Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it;
 for their wickedness is come up before me.
 &nbsp; 3 But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to
 Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to
 go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 1. The honour God put upon Jonah, in giving him a commission to go and 
 prophesy against Nineveh. <I>Jonah</I> signifies <I>a dove,</I> a 
 proper name for all God's prophets, all his people, who ought to be 
 <I>harmless as doves,</I> and to <I>mourn as doves</I> for the sins and 
 calamities of the land. His father's name was <I>Amittai--My truth;</I>
 for God's prophets should be sons of truth. To him <I>the word of the 
 Lord came--to him it was</I> (so the word signifies), for God's word is
 a real thing; men's words are but wind, but God's words are substance. 
 He has been before acquainted with the <I>word of the Lord,</I> and 
 knew his voice from that of a stranger; the orders now given him were, 
 <I>Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Nineveh was at this time the metropolis of the Assyrian monarchy, an 
 eminent city 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:11">Gen. x. 11</A>),

 <I>a great city, that great city,</I> forty-eight miles in compass
 (some make it much more), great in the number of the inhabitants, as 
 appears by the multitude of infants in it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+4:11"><I>ch.</I> iv. 11</A>),

 great in wealth (there was no end of its store, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+2:9">Nah. ii. 9</A>),

 great in power and dominion; it was the city that for some time
 <I>ruled over the kings of the earth.</I> But great cities, as well as 
 great men, are under God's government and judgment. Nineveh was a great 
 city, and yet a heathen city, without the knowledge and worship of the 
 true God. How many great cities and great nations are there that <I>sit 
 in darkness</I> and <I>in the valley of the shadow of death!</I> This 
 great city was a wicked city: <I>Their wickedness has come up before 
 me</I> (their <I>malice,</I> so some read it); <I>their wickedness was
 presumptuous,</I> and they sinned with <I>a high hand.</I> It is sad to 
 think what a great deal of sin is committed in great cities, where 
 there are many sinners, who are not only all sinners, but making one 
 another sin. <I>Their wickedness has come up,</I> that is, it has come 
 to a high degree, to the highest pitch; the <I>measure of it</I> is 
 <I>full</I> to the brim; <I>their wickedness has come up,</I> as that 
 of Sodom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:20,21">Gen. xviii. 20, 21</A>.

 It has come up <I>before me--to my face</I> (so the word is); it is a
 bold and open affront to God; it is sinning against him, <I>in his 
 sight;</I> therefore Jonah must <I>cry against it;</I> he must witness 
 against their great wickedness, and must warn them of the destruction 
 that was coming upon them for it. God is coming forth against it, and 
 he sends Jonah before, to proclaim war, and to sound an alarm. <I>Cry 
 aloud, spare not.</I> He must not whisper his message in a corner, but 
 publish it in the streets of Nineveh; <I>he that hath ears let him 
 hear</I> what God has to say by his prophet against that wicked city. 
 When the cry of sin comes up to God the cry of vengeance comes out 
 against the sinner. He must <I>go to Nineveh,</I> and cry there upon 
 the spot against the wickedness of it. Other prophets were ordered to
 send messages to the neighbouring nations, and the prophecy of Nahum is 
 particularly <I>the burden of Nineveh;</I> but Jonah must go and carry 
 the message himself: "<I>Arise</I> quickly; apply thyself to the 
 business with speed and courage, and the resolution that becomes a 
 prophet; <I>arise, and go to Nineveh.</I>" Those that go on God's 
 errands must rise and go, must stir themselves to the work cut out for 
 them. The prophets were sent first to the <I>lost sheep of the house of 
 Israel,</I> yet not to them only; they had the children's bread, but 
 Nineveh eats of the crumbs. 

 2. The dishonour Jonah did to God in refusing to obey his orders, and
 to go on the errand on which he was sent

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>But Jonah,</I> instead of rising to go to Nineveh, <I>rose up to 
 flee to Tarshish,</I> to <I>the sea,</I> not bound for any port, but 
 desirous to get away <I>from the presence of the Lord;</I> and, if he 
 might but do that, he card not whither he went, not as if he thought he 
 could go any where from under the eye of God's inspection, but from his 
 special presence, from the spirit of prophecy, which, when it put him 
 upon this work, he thought himself haunted with, and coveted to get out 
 of the hearing of. Some think Jonah went upon the opinion of some of
 the Jews that the spirit of prophecy was confined to the land of Israel 
 (which in Ezekiel and Daniel was effectually proved to be a mistake), 
 and therefore he hoped he should get clear of it if he could but get 
 out of the borders of that land. 

 (1.) Jonah would not go to Nineveh to cry against it either because it 
 was a long and dangerous journey thither, and in a road he knew not, or 
 because he was afraid it would be as much as his life was worth to 
 deliver such an ungrateful message to that great and potent city. He 
 <I>consulted with flesh and blood,</I> and declined the embassy because 
 he could not go with safety, or because he was jealous for the 
 prerogatives of his country, and not willing that any other nation 
 should share in the honour of divine revelation; he feared it would be 
 the beginning of the removal of the kingdom of God from the Jews to 
 another nation, that would bring forth more of the fruits of it. He 
 owns himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+4:2"><I>ch.</I> iv. 2</A>)

 that the reason of his aversion to this journey was because he foresaw
 that the Ninevites would repent, and God would forgive them and take 
 them into favour, which would be a slur upon the people of Israel, who 
 had been so long a peculiar people to God. 

 (2.) He therefore went to Tarshish, to Tarsus in Cilicia (so some),
 probably because he had friends and relations there, with whom he hoped 
 for some time to sojourn. He went to Joppa, a famous seaport in the 
 land of Israel, in quest of a ship bound for Tarshish, and there he 
 found one. Providence seemed to favour his design, and give him an 
 opportunity to escape. We may be out of the way of duty and yet may 
 meet with a favourable gale. The ready way is not always the right
 way. He found the ship just ready to weigh anchor perhaps, and to set
 sail for Tarshish, and so he lost no time. Or, perhaps, he went to 
 Tarshish because he found the ship going thither; otherwise all places 
 were alike to him. He did not think himself out of his way, the way he
 would go, provided he was not in his way, the way he should go. So he 
 <I>paid the fare thereof;</I> for he did not regard the charge, so he 
 could but gain his point, and get to a distance <I>from the presence of 
 the Lord.</I> He went <I>with them,</I> with the mariners, with the 
 passengers, with the merchants, whoever they were that were going to 
 Tarshish. Jonah, forgetting his dignity as well as his duty, herded 
 with them, and <I>went down</I> into the ship to go <I>with them to 
 Tarshish.</I> See what the best of men are when God leaves them to 
 themselves, and what need we have, when the <I>word of the Lord</I> 
 comes to us, to have the <I>Spirit of the Lord</I> come along with the 
 word, to bring every thought within us into obedience to it. The 
 prophet Isaiah owns that <I>therefore</I> he was not <I>rebellious,</I> 
 neither <I>turned away back,</I> because God not only spoke to him, but 
 <I>opened his ear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:5">Isa. l. 5</A>.

 Let us learn hence to <I>cease from man,</I> and not to be too
 confident either of ourselves or others in a time of trial; but <I>let 
 him that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4 But the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> sent out a great wind into the sea, and there
 was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be
 broken.
 &nbsp; 5 Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his
 god, and cast forth the wares that <I>were</I> in the ship into the
 sea, to lighten <I>it</I> of them. But Jonah was gone down into the
 sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.
 &nbsp; 6 So the ship-master came to him, and said unto him, What
 meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that
 God will think upon us, that we perish not.
 &nbsp; 7 And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast
 lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil <I>is</I> upon us. So
 they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.
 &nbsp; 8 Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose
 cause this evil <I>is</I> upon us; What <I>is</I> thine occupation? and
 whence comest thou? what <I>is</I> thy country? and of what people
 <I>art</I> thou?
 &nbsp; 9 And he said unto them, I <I>am</I> a Hebrew; and I fear the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry <I>land.</I>
 &nbsp; 10 Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, Why
 hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the
 presence of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, because he had told them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When Jonah was set on ship-board, and under sail for Tarshish, he 
 thought himself safe enough; but here we find him pursued and 
 overtaken, discovered and convicted as a deserter from God, as one that 
 had <I>run his colours.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God sends a pursuer after him, <I>a mighty tempest in the sea,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 God has the <I>winds in his treasure</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:7">Ps. cxxxv. 7</A>),

 and out of these treasures God <I>sent forth,</I> he <I>cast forth</I>
 (so the word is), with force and violence, <I>a great wind into the 
 sea;</I> even <I>stormy winds fulfil his word,</I> and are often the 
 messengers of his wrath; he <I>gathers the winds in his fist</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:4">Prov. xxx. 4</A>),

 where he holds them, and whence he squeezes them when he pleases; for 
 though, as to us, the <I>wind blows where it listeth,</I> yet not as to 
 God, but where he directs. The effect of this wind as <I>a mighty 
 tempest;</I> for when the winds rise the waves rise. Note, Sin brings 
 storms and tempests into the soul, into the family, into churches and 
 nations; it is a disquieting disturbing thing. The tempest prevailed to 
 such a degree that <I>the ship was likely to be broken;</I> the 
 mariners expected no other; <I>that ship</I> (so some read it), that 
 and no other. Other ships were upon the same sea at the same time, yet, 
 it should seem, that ship in which Jonah was was tossed more than any 
 other and was more in danger. This wind was sent after Jonah, to fetch 
 him back again to God and to his duty; and it is a great mercy to be 
 reclaimed and called home when we go astray, though it be by a 
 tempest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The ship's crew were alarmed by this mighty tempest, but Jonah 
 only, the person concerned, was unconcerned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The mariners were affected with their danger, though it was not with 
 them that God has this controversy. 

 1. They were <I>afraid;</I> though, their business leading them to be
 very much conversant with dangers of this kind, they used to make light 
 of them, yet now the oldest and stoutest of them began to tremble, 
 being apprehensive that there was something more than ordinary in this 
 tempest, so suddenly did it rise, so strongly did it rage. Note, God 
 can strike a terror upon the most daring, and make even <I>great men 
 and chief captains</I> call for shelter from rocks and mountains. 

 2. They <I>cried every man unto his god;</I> this was the effect of
 their fear. Many will not be brought to prayer till they are frightened 
 to it; he that would learn to pray, let him go to sea. <I>Lord, in
 trouble they have visited thee. Every man</I> of them prayed; they were 
 not some praying and others reviling, but every man engaged; as the 
 danger was general, so was the address to heaven; there was not one 
 praying for them all, but every one for himself. They cried <I>every 
 man to his god,</I> the god of his country or city, or his own tutelar 
 deity; it is a testimony against atheism that every man had a god, and 
 had the belief of a God; but it is an instance of the folly of paganism 
 that they had gods many, every man the god he had a fancy for, whereas 
 there can be but one God, there needs to be no more. But, though they 
 had lost that dictate of the light of nature that there is but <I>one 
 God,</I> they still were governed by that direction of the law of 
 nature that God is to be prayed to (<I>Should not a people seek under 
 their God?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:19">Isa. viii. 19</A>),
 
 and that he is especially to be prayed to when we are in distress and
 danger. <I>Call upon me in the time of trouble. Is any afflicted?</I> 
 Is any frightened? <I>Let him pray.</I> 

 3. Their prayers for deliverance were seconded with endeavours, and,
 having called upon their gods to help them, they did what they could to 
 help themselves; for that is the rule, <I>Help thyself and God will 
 help thee.</I> They <I>cast forth the wares that were in the ship into 
 the sea, to lighten it of them,</I> as Paul's mariners in a like case 
 cast forth even the <I>tackling of the ship,</I> and the <I>wheat,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:18,19,38">Acts xxvii. 18, 19, 38</A>.

 They were making a trading voyage, as it should seem, and were laden
 with many goods and much merchandise, by which they hoped to get gain; 
 but now they are content to suffer loss by throwing them overboard. to 
 save their lives. See how powerful the natural love of life is. <I>Skin 
 for skin,</I> and <I>all that a man has, will he give for it.</I> And 
 shall we not put a like value upon the spiritual life, the life of the 
 soul, reckoning that the gain of all the world cannot countervail the 
 loss of the soul? See the vanity of worldly wealth, and the uncertainty 
 of its continuance with us. Riches make themselves wings and fly away;
 nay, and the case may be such that we may be under a necessity of 
 making wings for them, and driving them away, as here, when they could 
 not be <I>kept for the owners thereof</I> but to their hurt, so that 
 they themselves are glad to be rid of them, and sink that which 
 otherwise would sink them, though they have no prospect of ever 
 recovering it. Oh that men would be thus wise for their souls, and 
 would be willing to part with that wealth, pleasure, and honour which 
 they cannot keep without <I>making shipwreck of faith and a good 
 conscience</I> and ruining their souls for ever! Those that thus quit 
 their temporal interests for the securing of their spiritual welfare 
 will be unspeakable gainers at last; for what they lose upon those 
 terms they shall find again to life eternal. But where is Jonah all 
 this while? One would have expected gone down into his cabin, nay, into 
 <I>the hold, between the sides of the ship,</I> and there he lies, and 
 is <I>fast asleep;</I> neither the noise without, for the sense of 
 guilt within, awoke him. Perhaps for some time before he had avoiding 
 sleeping, for fear of God's speaking to him again in a dream; and now 
 that he imagined himself out of the reach of that danger, he slept so 
 much the more soundly. Note, Sin is of a stupifying nature, and we are 
 concerned to <I>take heed lest at any time our hearts be hardened by 
 the deceitfulness of it.</I> It is the policy of Satan, when by his 
 temptations he has drawn men from God and their duty, to rock them 
 asleep in carnal security, that they may not be sensible of their 
 misery and danger. It concerns us all to <I>watch therefore.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The master of the ship called Jonah up to his prayers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 The <I>ship-master came to him,</I> and bade him for shame get up, both 
 to <I>pray for life</I> and to <I>prepare for death;</I> he gave him, 
 
 1. A just and necessary chiding: <I>What meanest thou, O sleeper?</I>
 Here we commend the ship-master, who gave him this reproof; for, though 
 he was a stranger to him, he was, for the present, as one of his 
 family; and whoever has a precious soul we must help, as we can, to 
 <I>save it from death.</I> We pity Jonah, who needed this reproof; as a 
 prophet of the Lord, if he had been in his place, he might have been 
 reproving the king of Nineveh, but, being out of the way of his duty, 
 he does himself lie open to the reproofs of a sorry ship-master. See
 how men by their sin and folly diminish themselves and make themselves 
 mean. Yet we must admire God's goodness in sending him this seasonable 
 reproof, for it was the first step towards his recovery, as the crowing 
 of the cock was to Peter. Note, Those that sleep in a storm may well be 
 asked what they mean. 

 2. A pertinent word of advice: "<I>Arise, call upon thy God;</I> we are
 here crying every man to his god, why dost not thou get up and cry to 
 thine? Art not thou equally concerned with the rest both in the danger 
 dreaded and in the deliverance desired?" Note, The devotions of others 
 should quicken ours; and those who hope to share in a common mercy 
 ought in all reason to contribute their quota towards the prayers and 
 supplications that are made for it. In times of public distress, if we 
 have any interest at the throne of grace, we ought to improve it for 
 the public good. And the servants of God themselves have sometimes need 
 to be called and stirred up to this part of their duty. 

 3. A good reason for this advice: <I>If so be that God will think upon
 us, that we perish not.</I> It should seem, the many gods they called 
 upon were considered by them only as mediators between them and the 
 supreme God, and intercessors for them with him; for the ship-master 
 speaks of one God still, from whom he expected relief. To engage 
 prayer, he suggested that the danger was very great and imminent: "We 
 are all likely to <I>perish;</I> there is but a step between us and 
 death, and that just ready to be stepped." Yet he suggested that there 
 was some hope remaining that their destruction might be prevented and 
 they might <I>not perish.</I> While there is still life there is hope, 
 and while there is hope there is room for prayer. He suggested also 
 that it was God only that could effect their deliverance, and it must 
 come from his power and his pity. "If he <I>think upon us,</I> and act 
 for us, we may yet be saved." And therefore to him we must look, and in 
 him we must put our trust, when the danger is ever so imminent.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Jonah is found out to be the cause of the storm.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The mariners observed so much peculiar and uncommon either in the 
 storm itself or in their own distress by it that they concluded it was 
 a messenger of divine justice sent to arrest some one of those that 
 were in that ship, as having been guilty of some enormous crime, 
 judging as the barbarous people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:4">Acts xxviii. 4</A>),

 "<I>no doubt one of us is a murderer,</I> or guilty of sacrilege, or
 perjury, or the like, who is thus <I>pursued</I> by the <I>vengeance of 
 the sea,</I> and it is for his sake that we all suffer." Even the light 
 of nature teaches that in extraordinary judgments the wrath of God is 
 revealed from heaven against some extraordinary sins and sinners. 
 Whatever evil is upon us at any time we must conclude <I>there is a 
 cause</I> for it; there is evil done by us, or else this evil would not 
 be upon us; there is a ground for God's controversy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They determined to refer it to the lot which of them was the 
 criminal that had occasioned this storm: <I>Let us cast lots, that we 
 may know for whose cause the evil is upon us.</I> None of them 
 suspected himself, or said, <I>Is it I,</I> Lord; <I>is it I?</I> But 
 they suspected one another, and would find out the man. Note, It is a 
 desirable thing, when any evil is upon us, to know for what cause it is 
 upon us, that what is amiss may be amended, and, the grievance being 
 redressed, the grief may be removed. In order to this we must look up 
 to heaven, and pray, Lord, <I>show me wherefore thou contendest with 
 me; that which I see not teach thou me.</I> These mariners desired to 
 know the person that was the dead weight in their ship, the accursed 
 thing, that that one man might <I>die for the people</I> and that the 
 whole ship <I>might not be lost;</I> this was not only expedient, but 
 highly just. In order to this they cast lots, by which they appealed to 
 the judgment of God, to whom <I>all hearts are open, and from whom no 
 secret is hid,</I> agreeing to acquiesce in his discovery and 
 determination, and to take that for true which the lot spoke; for they 
 knew by the light of nature, what the scripture tells us, that <I>the 
 lot is cast into the lap, but the whole disposal thereof is of the 
 Lord.</I> Even the heathen looked upon the casting of lots to be a 
 sacred thing, to be done with seriousness and solemnity, and not to be 
 made a sport of. It is a shame for Christians if they have not a like 
 reverence for an appeal to Providence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The <I>lot fell upon Jonah,</I> who could have saved them this 
 trouble if he would but have told them what his own conscience told 
 him, <I>Thou are the man;</I> but as is usual with criminals, he never 
 confesses till he finds he cannot help it, till <I>the lot falls upon 
 him.</I> We may suppose there were those in the ship who, upon other 
 accounts, were greater sinners than Jonah, and yet he is the man that 
 the tempest pursues and that the lot pitches upon; for it is his own 
 child, his own servant, that the parent, that the master, corrects, if 
 they do amiss; others that offend he leaves to the law. The storm is 
 sent after Jonah, because God has work for him to do, and it is sent to 
 fetch him back to it. Note, God has many ways of bringing to light 
 concealed sins and sinners, and making manifest that folly which was 
 thought to be hidden from the eyes of all living. God's right hand will 
 find out all his servants that desert him, as well as all his enemies 
 that have designs against him; yea, though they flee to the uttermost 
 parts of the sea, or go down to the sides of the ship.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Jonah is hereupon brought under examination before the master and 
 mariners. He was a stranger; none of them could say that they knew the 
 prisoner, or had any thing to lay to his charge, and therefore they 
 must extort a confession from him and judge him <I>out of his own 
 mouth;</I> and for this there needed no rack, the shipwreck they were 
 in danger of was sufficient to frighten him, so as to make him tell the 
 truth. Though it was discovered by the lot that he was the person for 
 whose sake they were thus damaged and exposed, yet they did not fly 
 outrageously upon him, as one would fear they might have done, but 
 calmly and mildly enquired into his case. There is a compassion due to 
 offenders when they are discovered and convicted. They give him no hard 
 words, but, "<I>Tell us, we pray thee,</I> what is the matter?" Two 
 things they enquire of him:--

 (1.) Whether he would himself own that he was the person for whose sake 
 the storm was sent, as the lot had intimated: "<I>Tell us for whose 
 cause this evil is upon us;</I> is it indeed for thy cause, and, if so, 
 <I>for what cause?</I> What is this offence for which thou art thus 
 prosecuted?" Perhaps the gravity and decency of Jonah's aspect and 
 behaviour made them suspect that the lot had missed its man, had missed 
 its mark, and therefore they would not trust it, unless he would 
 himself own his guilt; they therefore begged of him that he would 
 satisfy them in this matter. Note, Those that would find out the cause 
 of their troubles must not only begin, but pursue the enquiry, must 
 descend to particulars and <I>accomplish a diligent search.</I> 

 (2.) What his character was, both as to his calling and as to his 
 country.

 [1.] They enquire concerning his calling: <I>What is thy 
 occupation?</I> This was a proper question to be put to a vagrant.
 Perhaps they suspected his calling to be such as might bring this 
 trouble upon them: "Art thou a diviner, a sorcerer, a student in the 
 black art? Hast thou been conjuring for this wind? Or what business are 
 thou now going on? It is like Balaam's, to curse any of God's people, 
 and is this wind send to stop thee?" 

 [2.] They enquire concerning his country. One asked, <I>Whence comest 
 thou?</I> Another, not having patience to stay for an answer to that, 
 asked, <I>What is thy country?</I> A third to the same purport, "<I>Of 
 what people art thou?</I> Art thou of the Chaldeans," that were noted 
 for divination, "or of the Arabians," that were noted for stealing? 
 They wished to know of what country he was, that, knowing who was the 
 god of his country, they might guess whether he was one that could do 
 them any kindness in this storm.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. In answer to these interrogatories Jonah makes a full discovery. 
 
 (1.) Did they enquire concerning his country? He tells them he is <I>a
 Hebrew</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 not only of the nation of Israel, but of their religion, which they 
 received from their fathers. He is a Hebrew, and therefore is the more 
 ashamed to own that he is a criminal; for the sins of Hebrews, that 
 make such a profession of religion and enjoy such privileges, are 
 greater than the sins of others, and more exceedingly sinful. 

 (2.) Did they enquire concerning his calling--<I>What is thy 
 occupation?</I> In answer to that he gives an account of his religion, 
 for that was his calling, that was his occupation, that was it that he 
 made a business of: "<I>I fear the Lord Jehovah;</I> that is the God I 
 worship, the God I pray to, even <I>the God of heaven,</I> the 
 sovereign Lord of all, that has <I>made the sea and the dry land</I> 
 and has command of both." Not the god of one particular country, which 
 they enquired after, and such as the gods were that they had been every 
 man calling upon, but <I>the God of the whole earth,</I> who, having 
 made both the sea and the dry land, makes what work he pleases in both 
 and makes what use he pleases of both. This he mentions, not only as 
 condemning himself for his folly, in fleeing from the presence of this 
 God, but as designing to bring these mariners from the worship and 
 service of their many gods to the knowledge and obedience of the one 
 only living and true God. When we are among those that are strangers
 to us we should do what we can to bring them acquainted with God, by 
 being ready upon all occasions to own our relation to him and our 
 reverence for him. 

 (3.) Did they enquire concerning his crime, for which he is now 
 persecuted? He owns that he <I>fled from the presence of the Lord,</I>
 that he was here running away from his duty, and the storm was sent to 
 fetch him back. We have reason to think that he told them this with 
 sorrow and shame, justifying God and condemning himself and intimating 
 to the mariners what a great God Jehovah is, who could send such a 
 messenger as this tempest was after a runagate servant.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. We are told what impression this made upon the mariners: <I>The men 
 were exceedingly afraid,</I> and justly, for they perceived, 

 (1.) That God was angry, even that God that made <I>the sea and the dry 
 land.</I> This tempest comes from the hand of an offended justice, and 
 therefore they have reason to fear it will go hard with them. Judgments 
 inflicted for some particular sin have a peculiar weight and terror in 
 them. 

 (2.) That God was angry with one that feared and worshipped him, only 
 for once running from his work in particular instance; this made them 
 afraid for themselves. "If a prophet of the Lord be thus severely 
 punished for one offence, what will become of us that have been guilty 
 of so many, and great, and heinous offences?" If <I>the righteous 
 be</I> thus <I>scarcely saved,</I> and for a single act of disobedience 
 thus closely pursued, <I>where shall the ungodly and the sinner 
 appear?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:17,18">1 Pet. iv. 17, 18</A>.

 They said to him, "<I>Why hast thou done this?</I> If thou fearest the
 God that <I>made the sea and the dry land,</I> why wast thou such a 
 fool as to think thou couldst flee from his presence? What an absurd 
 unaccountable thing is it!" <I>Thus he was reproved,</I> as Abraham by 
 Abimelech

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:16">Gen. xx. 16</A>);

 for if the professors of religion do a wrong thing they must expect to
 hear of it from those that make no such profession. "<I>Why hast thou 
 done this to us?</I>" (so it may be taken) "Why has thou involved us in 
 the prosecution?" Note, Those that commit a willful sin know not how 
 far the mischievous consequences of it may reach, nor what mischief may 
 be done by it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11 Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that
 the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was
 tempestuous.
 &nbsp; 12 And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into
 the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for
 my sake this great tempest <I>is</I> upon you.
 &nbsp; 13 Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring <I>it</I> to the land;
 but they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous
 against them.
 &nbsp; 14 Wherefore they cried unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and said, We beseech
 thee, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's
 life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, hast
 done as it pleased thee.
 &nbsp; 15 So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and
 the sea ceased from her raging.
 &nbsp; 16 Then the men feared the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> exceedingly, and offered a
 sacrifice unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and made vows.
 &nbsp; 17 Now the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.
 And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three
 nights.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is plain that Jonah is the man for whose sake this evil is upon 
 them, but the discovery of him to be so was not sufficient to answer 
 the demands of this tempest; they had found him out, but something more 
 was to be done, for still <I>the sea wrought and was tempestuous</I> 
 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 and again

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 it <I>grew more and more tempestuous</I> (so the margin reads it); for
 if we discover sin to be the cause of our troubles, and do not forsake
 it, we do but make bad worse. Therefore they went on with the 
 prosecution.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They enquired of Jonah himself what he thought they must do with him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm to us?</I> They 
 perceived that Jonah is a prophet of the Lord, and therefore will not 
 do any thing, no, not in his own case, without consulting him. He 
 appears to be a delinquent, but he appears also to be a penitent, and 
 therefore they will not insult over him, nor offer him any rudeness. 
 Note, We ought to act with great tenderness towards those that are 
 overtaken in a fault and are brought into distress by it. They would 
 not <I>cast him into the sea</I> if he could think of any other 
 expedient by which to <I>save the ship.</I> Or, perhaps, thus they 
 would show how plain the case was, that there was no remedy but he must 
 be thrown overboard; let him be his own judge as he had been his own 
 accuser, and he himself will say so. Note, When sin has raised a storm, 
 and laid us under the tokens of God's displeasure, we are concerned to 
 enquire what we shall do that the sea may be calm; and what shall we 
 do? We must pray and believe, when we are in a storm, and study to 
 answer the end for which it was sent, and then the storm shall become a 
 calm. But especially we must consider what is to be done to the sin 
 that raised the storm; that must be discovered, and penitently 
 confessed; that must be detested, disclaimed, and utterly forsaken.
 What have I to do any more with it? Crucify it, crucify it, for this 
 evil it has done.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Jonah reads his own doom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea.</I> He would not himself 
 leap into the sea, but he put himself into their hands, to cast him 
 into the sea, and assured them that then the <I>sea would be calm,</I> 
 and not otherwise. He proposed this, in tenderness to the mariners, 
 that the might no suffer for his sake. "<I>Let thy hand be upon me</I>" 
 (says David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:17">1 Chron. xxi. 17</A>),

 "who am guilty; let me die for me own sin, but let not the innocent
 suffer for it." This is the language of true penitents, who earnestly 
 desire that none but themselves may ever smart, or fare the worse, for 
 their sins and follies. He proposed it likewise in submission to the 
 will of God, who sent this tempest in pursuit of him; and 
 <I>therefore</I> judged himself to be cast into the sea, because to 
 that he plainly saw God judging him, that he might not be <I>judged of 
 the Lord</I> to eternal misery. Note, Those who are truly humbled for 
 sin will cheerfully submit to the will of God, even in a sentence of 
 death itself. If Jonah sees this to be the punishment of his iniquity, 
 he accepts it, he subjects himself to it, and justifies God in it. No 
 matter though the <I>flesh</I> be <I>destroyed,</I> no matter how it is 
 destroyed, so that the <I>spirit may</I> be <I>but saved in the day of 
 the Lord Jesus,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:5">1 Cor. v. 5</A>.

 The reason he gives is, <I>For I know that for my sake this great
 tempest is upon you.</I> See how ready Jonah is to take all the guilt 
 upon himself, and to look upon all the trouble as theirs: "It is purely 
 for my sake, who have sinned, that this tempest is upon you; therefore 
 cast me forth into the sea; for,"

 1. "I deserve it. I have wickedly departed from my God, and it is upon
 my account that he is angry with you. Surely I am unworthy to breathe 
 in that air which for my sake has been hurried with winds, to live in 
 that ship which for my sake has been thus tossed. Cast me into the sea 
 after the wares which for my sake you have thrown into it. Drowning is 
 too good for me; a single death is punishment too little for such a 
 complicated offence." 

 2. "Therefore there is no way of having the sea calm. If it is I that
 have raised the storm, it is not casting the wares into the sea that 
 will lay it again; no, you must cast me thither." When conscience is 
 awakened, and a storm raised there, nothing will turn it into a calm 
 but parting with the sin that occasioned the disturbance, and 
 abandoning that. It is not parting with our money that will pacify 
 conscience; no, it is the Jonah that be thrown overboard. Jonah is 
 herein a type of Christ, that he <I>gives his life a ransom for 
 many;</I> but with this material difference, that the storm Jonah gave 
 himself up to still was of his own raising, but that storm which Christ 
 gave himself up to still was of our raising. Yet, as Jonah delivered
 himself up to be cast into a raging sea that it might be calm, so did 
 our Lord Jesus, when he died that we might live.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The poor mariners did what they could to save themselves from the 
 necessity of throwing Jonah into the sea, but all in vain 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):
 
 <I>They rowed hard to bring the ship to the land,</I> that, if they 
 must part with Jonah, they might set him safely on shore; <I>but they 
 could not.</I> All their pains were to no purpose; <I>for the sea 
 wrought</I> harder than they could, and <I>was tempestuous against 
 them,</I> so that they could by no means <I>make the land.</I> If they 
 thought sometimes that they had gained their point, they were quickly 
 thrown off to sea again. Still their ship was overladen; their 
 lightening it of the wares made it never the lighter as long as Jonah 
 was in it. And, besides, they rowed against wind and tide, the wind of 
 God's vengeance, the tide of his counsels; and it is in vain to contend 
 with God, in vain to think of saving ourselves any other way than by 
 destroying our sins. By this it appears that these mariners were very 
 loth to execute Jonah's sentence upon himself, though they knew it was 
 for his sake that this tempest was upon them. They were thus very 
 backward to it partly from a dread of bringing upon themselves the 
 guilt of blood, and partly from a compassion they could not but have 
 for poor Jonah, as a good man, as a man in distress, and as a man of 
 sincerity. Note, The more sinners humble and abase themselves, judge 
 and condemn themselves, the more likely they are to find pity both with 
 God and man. The more forward Jonah was to say, <I>Cast me into the 
 sea,</I> the more backward they were to do it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. When they found it necessary to cast Jonah into the sea they first 
 prayed to God that the guilt of his blood might not lie upon them, nor 
 be laid to their charge, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 When they found it in vain to row hard they quitted their oars and went 
 to their prayers: <I>Wherefore they cried unto the Lord,</I> unto 
 <I>Jehovah,</I> the true and living God, and no more to the <I>gods 
 many.</I> and <I>lords many,</I> that the had <I>cried to,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 They prayed to the <I>God of Israel,</I> being now convinced, by the 
 providences of God concerning Jonah and the information he had given 
 them, that he is God <I>alone.</I> Having determined to cast Jonah into 
 the sea, they first enter a protestation in the court of heaven that 
 they do not do it willingly, much less maliciously, or with any design 
 to be revenged upon him because it was for his sake that this tempest 
 was upon them. No; <I>his god forgive him,</I> as <I>they do!</I> But 
 they are forced to do it <I>se defendendo--in self-defence,</I> having 
 no other way to save their own lives; and they do it as ministers of 
 justice, both God and himself having sentenced him to <I>so great a 
 death.</I> They <I>therefore</I> present a humble petition to the God 
 whom Jonah feared, that they might not <I>perish for his life.</I> See, 
 
 1. What a fear they had of contracting the guilt of blood, especially
 the blood of one that feared God, and worshipped him, and had 
 fellowship with him, as they perceived Jonah had, though in a single 
 instance he had been faulty. Natural conscience cannot but have a dread 
 of blood-guiltiness, and make men very earnest in prayer, as David was, 
 to be delivered from it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:14">Ps. li. 14</A>.

 So they were here: <I>We beseech thee, O Lord! we beseech thee, lay not
 upon us innocent blood.</I> They are now as earnest in praying to be 
 saved from the peril of sin as they were before in praying to be saved 
 from the peril of the sea, especially because Jonah appeared to them to 
 be no ordinary person, but a very good man, a man of God, a worshipper 
 of the great Creator of heaven and earth, upon which account even these 
 rude mariners conceived a veneration for him, and trembled at the 
 thought of taking away his life. Innocent blood is precious, but 
 saints' blood, prophets' blood, is much more precious, and so those 
 will find to their cost that any way bring themselves under the guilt 
 of it. The mariners saw Jonah pursued by divine vengeance, and yet 
 could not without horror think of being his executioners. Though his 
 God has a controversy with him, yet, think they, <I>Let not our hand be 
 upon him.</I> The Israelites were at this time killing the prophets for 
 doing their duty (witness Jezebel's late persecution), and were 
 prodigal of their lives, which is aggravated by the tenderness these 
 heathens had for one whom they perceived to be a prophet, though he was 
 now out of the way of his duty.

 2. What a fear they had of incurring the wrath of God; they were
 jealous lest he should be angry if they should be the death of Jonah, 
 for he had said, <I>Touch not my anointed, and do my prophets no 
 harm;</I> it is at your peril if you do. "Lord," say they, "<I>let us 
 not perish for this man's life.</I> Let it not be such a fatal dilemma 
 to us. We see we must perish if we spare his life; Oh let us not perish 
 for taking away his life." And their plea is good: "<I>For thou, O 
 Lord! hast done as it pleased thee;</I> thou had laid us under a 
 necessity of doing it; the wind that pursued him, the lot that 
 discovered him, were both under thy direction, which we are herein 
 governed by; we are but the instruments of Providence, and it is sorely 
 against our will that we do it; but we must say, <I>The will of the 
 Lord be done.</I>" Note, When we are manifestly led by Providence to do 
 things contrary to our own inclinations, and quite beyond our own 
 intentions, it will be some satisfaction to us to be able to say, 
 <I>Thou, O Lord! has done as it pleased thee.</I> And, if God please 
 himself, we ought to be satisfied though he do not please us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Having deprecated the guilt they dreaded, they proceeded to 
 execution 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>They took up Jonah,</I> and <I>cast him forth into the sea.</I> They 
 cast him out of their ship, out of their company, and cast him into the 
 sea, a raging stormy sea, that cried, "Give, give; surrender the 
 traitor, or expect no peace." We may well think what confusion and 
 amazement poor Jonah was in when he saw himself ready to be hurried 
 into the presence of that God as a Judge whose presence as a Master he 
 was now fleeing from. Note, Those know not what ruin they run upon that 
 run away from God. <I>Woe unto them! for they have fled from me.</I>
 When sin is the Jonah that raises the storm, that must thus be cast 
 forth into the sea; we must abandon it, and be the death of it, must 
 drown that which otherwise will <I>drown us in destruction and 
 perdition.</I> And if we thus by a thorough repentance and reformation 
 cast our sins forth into the sea, never to recall them or return to 
 them again, God will by pardoning mercy subdue our iniquities, and 
 <I>cast them into the depths of the sea</I> too, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:19">Mic. vii. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The throwing of Jonah into the sea immediately put an end to the 
 storm. The sea has what she came for, and therefore rests contended; 
 she <I>ceases from her raging.</I> It is an instance of the sovereign 
 power of God that he can soon turn the storm into a calm, and of the 
 equity of his government that when the end of an affliction is answered 
 and attained the affliction shall immediately be removed. He will not 
 contend for ever, will not contend any longer till we submit ourselves 
 and give up the cause. If we turn from our sins, he will soon turn from 
 his anger.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The mariners were hereby more confirmed in their belief that 
 Jonah's God was the only true God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>Then the men feared the Lord with a great fear,</I> were possessed 
 with a deep veneration for the God of Israel, and came to a resolution 
 that they would worship him only for the future; for <I>there is no 
 other God that can</I> destroy, that <I>can deliver, after this 
 sort.</I> When they saw the power of God in raising and laying the 
 tempest, when they saw his justice upon Jonah his own servant, and when 
 they saw his goodness to them in saving them from the brink of ruin, 
 <I>then they feared the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:22">Jer. v. 22</A>.

 As an evidence of their fear of him, they <I>offered sacrifice</I> to
 him when they came ashore again in the land of Israel, and for the 
 present made vows that they would do so, in thankfulness for their 
 deliverance, and to make atonement for their souls. Or, perhaps, they 
 had something yet on board which might be for a sacrifice to God 
 immediately. Or it may be meant of the spiritual sacrifices of prayer 
 and praise, with which God is better pleased than with that of an ox or 
 bullock that has horns and hoofs. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:2">Ps. cvii. 2</A>,

 &c. We must make vows, not only when we are in the pursuit of mercy,
 but, which is much more generous, when we have received mercy, as those 
 that are still studying what we shall render.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. Jonah's life, after all, is saved by a miracle, and we shall hear of him again for all this. In the midst of judgment God <I>remembers mercy.</I> Jonah shall be worse frightened than hurt, not so much punished for his sin as reduced to his duty.

 Though he flees from the presence of the Lord, and seems to fall into 
 his avenging hands, yet God has more work for him to do, and therefore 
 has <I>prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 <I>a whale</I> our Saviour calls it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:40">Matt. xii. 40</A>),

 one of the largest sorts of whales, that have wider throats than 
 others, in the belly of which has sometimes been found the dead body of 
 a man in armour. Particular notice is taken, in the history of
 creation, of God's <I>creating great whales</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:21">Gen. i. 21</A>)

 and the <I>leviathan</I> in the waters <I>made to play therein,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:26">Ps. civ. 26</A>.

 But God finds work for this leviathan, has <I>prepared</I> him, has
 <I>numbered</I> him (so the word is), has appointed him to be Jonah's 
 receiver and deliverer. Note, God has command of all the creatures, and 
 can make any of them serve his designs of mercy to his people, even the 
 fishes of the sea, that are most from under man's cognizance, even the 
 great whales, that are altogether from under man's government. This 
 fish was prepared, lay ready under water close by the ship, that he 
 might keep Jonah from sinking to the bottom, and save him alive, though 
 he deserved to die. Let us <I>stand still and see this salvation of
 the Lord,</I> and admire his power, that he could thus save a drowning 
 man, and his pity, that he would thus save one that was running from 
 him and had offended him. It was of the Lord's mercies that Jonah was 
 not now consumed. The fish swallowed up Jonah, not to devour him, but 
 to protect him. <I>Out of the eater comes forth meat;</I> for Jonah was 
 alive and well <I>in the belly of the fish three days and three 
 nights,</I> not consumed by the heat of the animal, nor suffocated for 
 want of air. It is granted that to nature this was impossible, but not 
 to the God of nature, with whom all things are possible. Jonah by this 
 miraculous preservation was designed to be made,

 1. A monument of divine mercy, for the encouragement of those that have
 sinned, and gone away from God, to return and repent. 

 2. A successful preacher to Nineveh; and this miracle wrought for his
 deliverance, if the tidings of it reached Nineveh, would contribute to 
 his success.

 3. An illustrious type of Christ, who was buried and rose again
 according to the scriptures

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:4">1 Cor. xv. 4</A>),

 according to this scripture, for, <I>as Jonah was three days and three
 nights in the whale's belly, so was the Son of man three days and three 
 nights in the heart of the earth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:40">Matt. xii. 40</A>.

 Jonah's burial was a figure of Christ's. God prepared Jonah's grave, so
 he did Christ's, when it was long before ordained that he should
 <I>make his grave with the rich,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:9">Isa. liii. 9</A>.

 Was Jonah's grave a strange one, a new one? So was Christ's, one in
 which never man before was laid. Was Jonah there the best part of three 
 days and three nights? So was Christ; but both in order to their
 rising again for the bringing of the doctrine of repentance to the 
 Gentile world. <I>Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</I></P>
