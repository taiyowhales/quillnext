 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The scope of this chapter is much the same as that of the foregoing 
 chapter and many expressions of it are the same; it therefore looks the 
 same way, to the different state of the good and bad among the Jews at 
 their return out of captivity, but that typifying the rejection of the 
 Jews in the days of the Messiah, the conversion of the Gentiles, and 
 the setting up of the gospel-kingdom in the world. The 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:1">first verse</A>

 of this chapter is applied by Stephen to the dismantling of the temple
 by the planting of the Christian church 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:49,50">Acts vii. 49, 50</A>),

 which may serve as a key to the whole chapter. We have here,

 I. The contempt God puts upon ceremonial services in comparison with
 moral duties, and an intimation therein of his purpose shortly to put 
 an end to the temple, and sacrifice and reject those that adhered to 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. The salvation God will in due time work for his people out of the
 hands of their oppressors 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:5">ver. 5</A>),

 speaking terror to the persecutors

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:6">ver. 6</A>)

 and comfort to the persecuted, a speedy and complete deliverance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:7-9">ver. 7-9</A>),

 a joyful settlement

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:10,11">ver. 10, 11</A>),

 the accession of the Gentiles to them, and abundance of satisfaction
 therein,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:12-14">ver. 12-14</A>.

 III. The terrible vengeance which God will bring upon the enemies of 
 his church and people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:15-18">ver. 15-18</A>.

 IV. The happy establishment of the church upon large and sure 
 foundations, its constant attendance on God and triumph over its 
 enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:19-24">ver. 19-24</A>.

 And we may well expect that this evangelical prophet, here, in the 
 close of his prophecy, should (as he does) look as far forward as to 
 the latter days, to the last day, to the days of eternity.</P>

 burneth incense, <I>as if</I> he blessed an idol. Yea, they have
 chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their
 abominations.
 &nbsp; 4  I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their
 fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I
 spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and
 chose <I>that</I> in which I delighted not.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. The temple is slighted in comparison with a gracious soul, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.
 
 The Jews in the prophet's time, and afterwards in Christ's time, 
 gloried much in the temple and promised themselves great things from 
 it; to humble them therefore, and to shake their vain confidence, both 
 the prophets and Christ foretold the ruin of the temple, that God would 
 leave it and then it would soon be desolate. After it was destroyed by 
 the Chaldeans it soon recovered itself and the ceremonial services were 
 revived with it; but by the Romans it was made a perpetual desolation, 
 and the ceremonial law was abolished with it. That the world might be 
 prepared for this, they were often told, as here, of what little 
 account the temple was with God. 

 1. That he did not need it. Heaven is the throne of his glory and
 government; there he sits, infinitely exalted in the highest dignity 
 and dominion, above all blessing and praise. The earth is his 
 footstool, on which he stands, over-ruling all the affairs of it 
 according to his will. If God has so bright a throne, so large a 
 footstool, <I>where then is the house they can build</I> unto God, that 
 can be the residence of his glory, or <I>where is the place of his 
 rest?</I> What satisfaction can the Eternal Mind take in a house made 
 with men's hands? What occasion has he, as we have, for a house to 
 repose himself in, who <I>faints not neither is weary,</I> who neither 
 slumbers nor sleeps? Or, if he had occasion, he <I>would not tell 
 us</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:12">Ps. l. 12</A>),

 for <I>all these things hath his hand made,</I> heaven and all its
 courts, earth and all its borders, and all the hosts of both. All 
 <I>these things have been,</I> have had their beginning, by the power 
 of God, who was happy from eternity before they were, and therefore 
 could not be benefited by them. <I>All these things are</I> (so some 
 read it); they still continue, upheld by the same power that made them; 
 so that <I>our goodness extends not to him.</I> If he required a house 
 for himself to dwell in, he would have made one himself when he made 
 the world; and, if he had made one, it would have continued to this 
 day, as other creatures do, according to his ordinance; so that he had 
 no need of a temple made with hands.

 2. That he would not heed it as he would a humble, penitent, gracious 
 heart. He has a heaven and earth of his own making, and a temple of 
 man's making; but he overlooks them all, that he may look with favour 
 to him that is poor in spirit, humble and serious, self-abasing and 
 self-denying, whose heart is truly contrite for sin, penitent for it, 
 and in pain to get it pardoned, and who <I>trembles at God's word,</I> 
 not as Felix did, with a transient qualm that was over when the sermon 
 was done, but with an habitual awe of God's majesty and purity and an 
 habitual dread of his justice and wrath. Such a heart is a living 
 temple for God; he dwells there, and it is the place of his rest; it is 
 like heaven and earth, his throne and his footstool.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Sacrifices are slighted when they come from ungracious hands. 
 <I>The sacrifice of the wicked</I> is not only unacceptable, but it 
 <I>is an abomination to the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+15:8">Prov. xv. 8</A>);

 this is largely shown here,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. How detestable their sacrifices were to God. The carnal Jews, after 
 their return out of captivity, though they relapsed not to idolatry, 
 grew very careless and loose in the service of God; they brought the 
 <I>torn, and the lame, and the sick</I> for <I>sacrifice</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:8,13">Mal. i. 8, 13</A>),

 and this made their services abominable to God; they had no regard to
 their sacrifices, and therefore how could they think God would have any 
 regard to them? The unbelieving Jews, after the gospel was preached and 
 in it notice given of the offering up of the great sacrifice, which put 
 an end to all the ceremonial services, continued to offer sacrifices, 
 as if the law of Moses had been still in force and could <I>make the 
 comers thereunto perfect:</I> this was an abomination. <I>He that kills 
 an ox</I> for his own table is welcome to do it; but he that now kills 
 it, that thus kills it, for God's altar, <I>is as if he slew a man;</I> 
 it is as great an offence to God as murder itself; he that does it does 
 in effect set aside Christ's sacrifice, <I>treads under foot the blood 
 of the covenant,</I> and makes himself accessory to the guilt of <I>the 
 body and blood of the Lord,</I> setting up what Christ died to abolish.
 <I>He that sacrifices a lamb,</I> if it be a corrupt thing, and not the 
 male in his flock, the best he has, if he think to put God off with any 
 thing, he affronts him, instead of pleasing him; it is <I>as if he cut 
 off a dog's neck,</I> a creature in the eye of the law so vile that, 
 whereas an ass might be redeemed, the price of a dog was never to be 
 brought into the treasury, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:18">Deut. xxiii. 18</A>.

 <I>He that offers an oblation,</I> a meat offering or drink-offering,
 is as if he thought to make atonement with <I>swine's blood,</I> a 
 creature that must not be eaten nor touched, the <I>broth of it</I> was 
 abominable

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:4"><I>ch.</I> lxv. 4</A>),
 
 much more the blood of it. <I>He that burns incense to God,</I> and so
 puts contempt upon the incense of Christ's intercession, is <I>as if he 
 blessed an idol;</I> it was as great an affront to God as if they had 
 paid their devotions to a false god. Hypocrisy and profaneness are as 
 provoking as idolatry. 

 2. What their wickedness was which made their sacrifices thus 
 detestable. It was <I>because they had chosen their own ways,</I> the 
 ways of their own wicked hearts, and not only their hands did but 
 <I>their souls delighted in their abominations.</I> They were vicious 
 and immoral in their conversations, chose the way of sin rather than 
 the way of God's commandments, and took pleasure in that which was 
 provoking to God; this made their sacrifices so offensive to God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:11-15"><I>ch.</I> i. 11-15</A>.

 Those that pretend to honour God by a profession of religion, and yet
 live wicked lives, put an affront upon him, as if he were the patron of 
 sin. And that which was an aggravation of their wickedness was that 
 they persisted in it, notwithstanding the frequent calls given them to 
 repent and reform; they turned a deaf ear to all the warnings of divine 
 justice and all the offers of divine grace: <I>When I called, none did 
 answer,</I> as before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:12"><I>ch.</I> lxv. 12</A>.

 And the same follows here that did there: <I>They did evil before my
 eyes.</I> Being deaf to what he said, they cared not what he saw, but 
 <I>chose that in which</I> they knew <I>he delighted not.</I> How could 
 those expect to please him in their devotions who took no care to 
 please him in their conversations, but, on the contrary, designed to 
 provoke him?

 3. The doom passed upon them for this. They<I>chose their own ways,</I>
 therefore, says God, I also will <I>choose their delusions. They have 
 made their choice</I> (as Mr. Gataker paraphrases it), <I>and now I
 will make mine; they have taken what course they pleased with me, and I 
 will take what course I please with them.</I> I will choose their 
 <I>illusions,</I> or <I>mockeries</I> (so some); as they have mocked 
 God and dishonoured him by their wickedness, so God will give them up 
 to their enemies, to be trampled upon and insulted by them. Or they 
 shall be deceived by those vain confidences with which they have 
 deceived themselves. God will make their sin their punishment; they 
 shall be beaten with their own rod and hurried into ruin by their own 
 delusions. God will <I>bring their fears upon them,</I> that is, will 
 bring upon them that which shall be a great terror to them, or that 
 which they themselves have been afraid of and thought to escape by 
 sinful shifts. Unbelieving hearts, and unpurified unpacified 
 consciences, need no more to make them miserable than to have their own 
 fears brought upon them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet, having denounced God's judgments against a hypocritical 
 nation, that made a jest of God's word and would not answer him when he 
 called to them, here turns his speech to those that <I>trembled at his 
 word,</I> to comfort and encourage them; they shall not be involved in 
 the judgments that are coming upon their unbelieving nation. Ministers 
 must distinguish thus, that, when they speak terror to the wicked, they 
 may not <I>make the hearts of the righteous sad. Bone Christiane, hoc 
 nihil ad te--Good Christian, this is nothing to thee.</I> The prophet,
 having assured those that tremble at God's word of a gracious look from 
 him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 here brings them a gracious message from him. The word of God has 
 comforts in store for those that by true humiliation for sin are 
 prepared to receive them. There were those 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)

 who, when <I>God spoke, would not hear;</I> but, if some will not, 
 others sill. If the heart <I>tremble at the word,</I> the ear will be 
 open to it. Now what is here said to them?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Let them know that God will plead their just but injured cause 
 against their persecutors 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Your brethren that hated you said, Let the Lord be glorified. But he 
 shall appear to your joy.</I> This perhaps might have reference to the 
 case of some of the Jews at their return out of captivity; but nothing 
 like it appears in the history, and therefore it is rather to be 
 referred to the first preachers and professors of the gospel among the 
 Jews, to whose case it is very applicable. Observe, 

 1. How the faithful servants of God were persecuted: <I>Their brethren
 hated them.</I> The apostles were Jews by birth, and yet even in the 
 cities of the Gentiles the Jews they met with there were their most 
 bitter and implacable enemies and <I>stirred up the Gentiles</I> 
 against them. The spouse complains 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:6">Cant. i. 6</A>)

 that her <I>mother's children were angry with her.</I> Pilate upbraided
 our Lord Jesus with this, <I>Thy own nation have delivered thee unto
 me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:35">John xviii. 35</A>.

 Their brethren, who should have loved them and encouraged them for
 their work's sake hated them, and cast them out of their synagogues, 
 excommunicated them as if they had been the greatest blemishes, when 
 they were really the greatest blessings, of their church and nation.
 This was a fruit of the old enmity in the <I>seed of the serpent</I> 
 against the <I>seed of the woman.</I> Those that hated Christ hated his 
 disciples, because they supported his kingdom and interest

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:18">John xv. 18</A>),
 
 and they <I>cast them out for his name's sake,</I> because they were
 called by his name, and called upon his name, and laid out themselves 
 to advance his name. Note, It is no new thing for church censures to
 be misapplied, and for her artillery, which was intended for her 
 defence, to be turned against her best friends, by the treachery of her 
 governors. And those that did this <I>said, Let the Lord be 
 glorified;</I> they pretended conscience and a zeal for the honour of 
 God and the church in it, and did it with all the formalities of 
 devotion. Our Saviour explains this, and seems to have reference to it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:2">John xvi. 2</A>.

 <I>They shall put you out of their synagogues,</I> and <I>whosoever
 kills you will think that he does God service. In nomine Domini incipit 
 omne malum--In the name of the Lord commences evil of every kind.</I> 
 Or we may understand it as spoken in defiance of God: "You say God will 
 be glorified in your deliverance; <I>let him be glorified then; let him 
 make speed and hasten his work</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:19"><I>ch.</I> v. 19</A>);

 <I>let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him."</I> Some take it
 to be the language of the profane Jews in captivity, bantering their 
 brethren that hoped for deliverance, and ridiculing the expectations 
 they often comforted themselves with, that God would shortly be 
 glorified in it. They thus did what they could to <I>shame the counsel 
 of the poor,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:6">Ps. xiv. 6</A>.

 2. How they were encouraged under these persecutions: "Let your faith 
 and patience hold out yet a little while; your enemies hate you and 
 oppress you, your brethren hate you and cast you out, but your Father 
 in heaven loves you, and will appear for you when no one else will or 
 dare. His providence shall order things so as shall be for comfort to 
 you; he shall appear <I>for your joy</I> and for the confusion of those 
 that abuse you and trample on you; they <I>shall be ashamed</I> of 
 their enmity to you." This was fulfilled when, upon the signals given 
 of Jerusalem's approaching ruin, the <I>Jews' hearts failed them for 
 fear;</I> but the disciples of Christ, whom they had hated and 
 persecuted, <I>lifted up their heads with joy, knowing that their 
 redemption drew nigh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:26,28">Luke xxi. 26, 28</A>.

 Though God seem to hide himself, he will in due time show himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Let them know that God's appearances for them will be such as will 
 make a great noise in the world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 There shall be <I>a voice of noise from the city, from the temple.</I> 
 Some make it the joyful and triumphant voice of the church's friends, 
 others the frightful lamenting voice of her enemies, surprised in the 
 city, and fleeing in vain to the temple for shelter. These voices do 
 but echo to the <I>voice of the Lord,</I> who is now rendering a 
 <I>recompence to his enemies;</I> and those that will not hear him 
 speaking this terror shall hear them returning the alarms of it in 
 doleful shrieks. We may well think what a confused noise there was in 
 the city and temple when Jerusalem, after a long siege, was at last 
 taken by the Romans. Some think this prophecy was fulfilled in the 
 prodigies that went before that destruction of Jerusalem, related by 
 Josephus in his <I>History of the Wars of the Jews</I> (4.388 and
 6.311), that the temple-doors flew open suddenly of their own accord,
 and the priests heard a noise of motion or shifting in the most holy 
 place, and presently a voice, saying, <I>Let us depart hence.</I> And, 
 some time after, one Jesus Bar-Annas went up and down the city, at the 
 feast of tabernacles, continually crying, <I>A voice from the east, a 
 voice from the west, a voice from the four winds, a voice against 
 Jerusalem and the temple, a voice against all this people.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Let them know that God will set up a church for himself in the 
 world, which shall be abundantly replenished in a little time 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):
 
 <I>Before she travailed she brought forth.</I> This is to be applied in 
 the type to the deliverance of the Jews out of their captivity in 
 Babylon, which was brought about very easily and silently, without any 
 pain or struggle, such as was when they were brought out of Egypt; that 
 was done <I>by might and power</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:34">Deut. iv. 34</A>),

 but this by <I>the Spirit of the Lord of hosts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:6">Zech. iv. 6</A>.

 The man-child of the deliverance is rejoiced in, and yet the mother was
 never in labour for it; <I>before her pain came she was delivered.</I> 
 This is altogether surprising, uncommon, and without precedent, unless 
 in the story which the Egyptian midwives told of the Hebrew women

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+1:19">Exod. i. 19</A>),

 that <I>they were lively and were delivered ere the midwives came in
 unto them.</I> But <I>shall the earth be made to bring forth her fruits 
 in one day?</I> No, it is the work of some weeks in the spring to 
 <I>renew the face of the earth</I> and cover it with its products. Some 
 read this to the same purport with the next clause, <I>Shall a land be 
 brought forth in one day,</I> or <I>shall a nation be born at once?</I> 
 Is it to be imagined that a woman at one birth should bring children 
 sufficient to people a country and that they should in an instant grow 
 up to maturity? No; something like this was done in the creation; but 
 God has since rested from all such works, and leaves second causes to 
 produce their effects gradually. <I>Nihil facit per saltum--He does 
 nothing abruptly.</I> Yet, in this case, <I>as soon as Zion travailed 
 she brought forth.</I> Cyrus's proclamation was no sooner issued out 
 than the captives were formed into a body and were ready to make the 
 best of their way to their own land. And the reason is given

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 because <I>it is the Lord's doing; he</I> undertakes it whose work is 
 perfect. If he <I>bring to the birth</I> in preparing his people for
 deliverance, he will <I>cause to bring forth</I> in the accomplishment 
 of the deliverance. When every thing is ripe and ready for their 
 release, and the number of their months is accomplished, so that <I>the 
 children are brought to the birth,</I> shall not I then <I>give 
 strength to bring forth,</I> but leave mother and babe to perish 
 together in the most miserable case? How will this agree with the 
 divine pity? Shall I begin a work and not go through with it? How will 
 that agree with the divine power and perfection? <I>Am I he that causes 
 to bring forth</I> (so the following clause may be read) <I>and shall I 
 restrain her?</I> Does God cause mankind, and all the species of living 
 creatures, to propagate, and <I>replenish the earth,</I> and <I>will he 
 restrain Zion?</I> Will he not make her fruitful in a blessed offspring 
 to replenish the church? Or, <I>Am I he that begat, and should I 
 restrain from bringing forth?</I> Did God beget the deliverance in his 
 purpose and promise, and will he not bring it forth in the 
 accomplishment and performance of it? But this was a figure of the 
 setting up of the Christian church in the world, and the replenishing 
 of that family with children which was to be named from Jesus Christ.
 When the Spirit was poured out, and the gospel went forth from Zion, 
 multitudes were converted in a little time and with little pains 
 compared with the vast product. The apostles, even before they 
 travailed, brought forth, and the children born to Christ were so 
 numerous, and so suddenly and easily produced, that they were rather 
 like the dew from the morning's womb than like the son from the 
 mother's womb, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:3">Ps. cx. 3</A>.

 The success of the gospel was astonishing; that light, like the
 morning, strangely diffused itself till it took hold even of <I>the 
 ends of the earth.</I> Cities and nations were born at once to Christ. 
 The same day that the Spirit was poured out there were 3000 souls added 
 to the church. And, when this glorious work was once begun, it was 
 carried on wonderfully, beyond what could be imagined, <I>so mightily 
 grew the word of God and prevailed.</I> He that brought to the birth in 
 conviction of sin caused to bring forth in a thorough conversion to 
 God.</P>

 IV. Let them know that their present sorrows shall shortly be turned 
 into abundant joys, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. How the church's friends are described; they are such as <I>love 
 her, and mourn</I> with her and <I>for her.</I> Note, All that love God 
 love Jerusalem; they love the church of God, and lay its interest very 
 near their heart. They admire the beauty of the church, take pleasure 
 in communion with it, and heartily espouse its cause. And those that 
 have a sincere affection for the church have a cordial sympathy with 
 her in all the cares and sorrows of her militant state. They mourn for 
 her; all her grievances are their griefs; if Jerusalem be in distress, 
 their harps are hung on the willow-trees. 

 2. How they are encouraged: <I>Rejoice with her,</I> and again and 
 again <I>I say, Rejoice.</I> This intimates that Jerusalem shall have 
 cause to rejoice; the days of her mourning shall be at an end, and she 
 shall be comforted according to the time that she has been afflicted. 
 It is the will of God that all her friends should join with her in her 
 joys, for they shall share with her in those blessings that will be the 
 matter of her joy. If <I>we suffer with Christ</I> and sorrow with his 
 church, <I>we shall reign with him</I> and rejoice with her. We are 
 here called,

 (1.) To bear our part in the church's praises: "Come, <I>rejoice with 
 her, rejoice for joy with her,</I> rejoice greatly, rejoice and know 
 why you rejoice, rejoice on the days appointed for public thanksgiving. 
 You that mourned for her in her sorrows cannot but from the same 
 principle rejoice with her in her joys." 

 (2.) To take our part in the church's comforts. We must <I>suck and be 
 satisfied with the breasts of her consolation.</I> The word of God, the 
 covenant of grace (especially the promises of that covenant), the 
 ordinances of God, and all the opportunities of attending on him and 
 conversing with him, are the breasts, which the church calls and counts 
 the <I>breasts of her consolations,</I> where her comforts are laid up, 
 and whence by faith and prayer they are drawn. With her therefore we 
 must suck from these breasts, by an application of the promises of God 
 to ourselves and a diligent attendance on his ordinances; and with the 
 consolations which are drawn hence we must be satisfied, and not be 
 dissatisfied though we have ever so little of earthly comforts. It is 
 the glory of the church that she has the Lord for her God, that to her 
 <I>pertain the adoption and the service of God;</I> and with <I>the 
 abundance of</I> this <I>glory</I> we must be <I>delighted.</I> We must 
 take more pleasure in our relation to God and communion with him than 
 in all the delights of the sons and daughters of men. Whatever is the 
 glory of the church must be <I>our glory and joy,</I> particularly her 
 purity, unity, and increase.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Let them know that he who gives them this call to rejoice will give 
 them cause to do so and hearts to do so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:12-14"><I>v.</I> 12-14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He will give them cause to do so. For, 

 (1.) They shall enjoy a long uninterrupted course of prosperity: <I>I 
 will extend,</I> or am extending, <I>peace to her</I> (that is, all 
 good to her) <I>like a river</I> that runs in a constant stream, still 
 increasing till it be swallowed up in the ocean. The gospel brings with 
 it, wherever it is received in its power, such peace as this, which 
 shall go on <I>like a river,</I> supplying souls with all good and 
 making them fruitful, as a river does the lands it passes through, such 
 a <I>river of peace</I> as the springs of the world's comforts cannot 
 send forth and the dams of the world's troubles cannot stop nor drive 
 back nor its sand rack up, such a river of peace as will carry us to 
 the ocean of boundless and endless bliss. 

 (2.) There shall be large and advantageous additions made to them: 
 <I>The glory of the Gentiles</I> shall come to them <I>like a flowing 
 stream.</I> Gentiles converts shall come pouring into the church, and 
 swell the river of her peace and prosperity; for they shall <I>bring 
 their glory</I> with them; their wealth and honour, their power and 
 interest, shall all be devoted to the service of God and employed for 
 the good of the church: "<I>Then shall you suck</I> from the breasts of 
 her consolations. When you see such crowding for a share in those 
 comforts you shall be the more solicitous and the more vigorous to 
 secure your share, not for fear of having the less for others coming in 
 to partake of Christ" (there is no danger of that; he has enough for 
 all and enough for each), "but <I>their zeal</I> shall <I>provoke you 
 to a holy jealousy.</I>" It is well when it does so, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:14,2Co+9:2">Rom. xi. 14; 2 Cor. ix. 2</A>.

 (3.) God shall be glorified in all, and that ought to be more the 
 matter of our joy than any thing else

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):
 
 <I>The hand of the Lord shall be known towards his servants,</I> the 
 protecting supporting hand of his almighty power, the supplying 
 enriching hand of his inexhaustible goodness; the benefit which his 
 servants have by both these <I>shall be known</I> to his glory as well 
 as theirs. And, to make this the more illustrious, he will at the same 
 time make known <I>his indignation towards his enemies.</I> God's mercy 
 and justice shall both be manifested and for ever magnified.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. God will not only give them cause to rejoice, but will speak comfort 
 to them, will speak it <I>to their hearts;</I> and it is he only that 
 can do that, and make it fasten there. See what he will do for the 
 comfort of all the sons of Zion. 

 (1.) Their country shall be their tender nurse: You shall be <I>carried 
 on her sides,</I> under her arms, as little children are, and shall be 
 <I>dangled upon her knees,</I> as darlings are, especially when they 
 are weary and out of humour, and must be got to sleep. Those that are 
 joined to the church must be treated thus affectionately. The great 
 Shepherd <I>gathers the lambs in his arms and carries them in his 
 bosom,</I> and so must the under-shepherds, that they may not be 
 discouraged. Proselytes should be favourites. 

 (2.) God will himself be their powerful comforter: <I>As one whom his 
 mother comforts,</I> when he is sick or sore, or upon any account in 
 sorrow, <I>so will I comfort you;</I> not only with the rational 
 arguments which a prudent father uses, but with the tender affections 
 and compassions of a loving mother, that bemoans her afflicted child 
 when it has fallen and hurt itself, that she may quiet it and make it 
 easy, or endeavours to pacify it after she has chidden it and fallen 
 out with it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:20">Jer. xxxi. 20</A>):

 <I>Since I spoke against him, my bowels are troubled for him;</I> he is
 a dear son, he is a pleasant child. Thus the mother comforts. Thus 
 <I>you shall be comforted in Jerusalem,</I> in the favours bestowed on 
 the church, which you shall partake of, and in the thanksgivings 
 offered by the church, which you shall concur with.

 (3.) They shall feel the blessed effects of this comfort in their own 
 souls

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>When you see this,</I> what a happy state the church is restored to, 
 not only your tongues and your countenances, but <I>your hearts shall 
 rejoice.</I> This was fulfilled in the wonderful satisfaction which 
 Christ's disciples had in the success of their ministry. Christ, with 
 an eye to that, tells them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:22">John xvi. 22</A>),

 <I>Your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you.</I>
 Then <I>your bones,</I> that were dried and withered (the marrow of
 them quite exhausted), shall recover a youthful strength and vigour and
 <I>shall flourish like a herb.</I> Divine comforts reach the inward
 man; <I>they are marrow</I> and moistening to the bones, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:8">Prov. iii. 8</A>.
 
 The bones are the strength of the body; those shall be made to flourish
 with these comforts. <I>The joy of the Lord</I> will be <I>your
 strength,</I>

 These verses, like the pillar of cloud and fire, have a dark side 
 towards the enemies of God's kingdom and all that are rebels against 
 his crown, and a bright side towards his faithful loyal subjects. 
 Probably they refer to the Jews in captivity in Babylon, of whom some 
 are said to have been sent thither for their hurt, and with them God 
 here threatens to proceed in his controversy; they hated to be 
 reformed, and therefore should be ruined by the calamity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+24:9">Jer. xxiv. 9</A>);
 
 others were sent thither for their good, and they should have the
 trouble sanctified to them, should in due time get well through it and 
 see many a good day after it. Many of the expressions here used are 
 accommodated to that glorious dispensation; but doubtless the prophecy 
 looks further, to the judgment for which Christ did come once, and will 
 come again, into this world, and to the distinction which his word in 
 both makes <I>between the precious and the vile.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ will appear to the confusion and terror of all those that 
 stand it out against him. Sometimes he will appear in temporal 
 judgments. The Jews that persisted in infidelity were cut off <I>by 
 fire</I> and <I>by his sword.</I> The ruin was very extensive; <I>the 
 Lord</I> then <I>pleaded with all flesh;</I> and, it being his sword 
 with which they are cut off, they are called <I>his slain,</I> 
 sacrificed to his justice, and they <I>shall be many.</I> In the great 
 day the wrath of God will be his fire and sword, with which he will cut 
 off and consume all the impenitent; and his word, when it takes hold of 
 sinners' consciences, burns like fire, and is sharper <I>than any 
 two-edged sword.</I> Idolaters will especially be contended with in the 
 day of wrath, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Perhaps some of those who returned out of Babylon retained such 
 instances of idolatry and superstition as are here mentioned, had their 
 <I>idols in their gardens</I> (not daring to set them up publicly in 
 the high places) and there <I>purified themselves</I> (as the 
 worshippers of the true God used to do) when they went about their 
 idolatrous rites, <I>one after another,</I> or, as we read it, 
 <I>behind one tree in the midst,</I> behind <I>Ahad</I> or <I>Ehad,</I> 
 some idol that they worshipped by that name and in honour of which they 
 <I>ate swine's flesh</I> (which was expressly forbidden by the law of 
 God), <I>and other abominations,</I> as <I>the mouse,</I> or some other 
 like animal. But the prophecy may refer to all those judgments which 
 the wrath of God, according to the word of God, will bring upon 
 provoking sinners, that live in contempt of God and are devoted to the 
 world and the flesh: They <I>shall be consumed together.</I> From the 
 happiness of heaven we find expressly excluded all <I>idolaters, and 
 whosoever worketh abomination,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:27,22:15">Rev. xxi. 27; xxii. 15</A>.

 In the day of vengeance secret wickedness will be brought to light and
 brought to the account; for

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 <I>I know their works and their thoughts.</I> God knows both what men 
 do and from what principle and with what design they do it; and 
 therefore is fit to judge the world, because he can <I>judge the 
 secrets of men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:16">Rom. ii. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He will appear to the comfort and joy of all that are faithful to 
 him in the setting up of his kingdom in this world, the kingdom of 
 grace, the earnest and first-fruits of the kingdom of glory. The time 
 shall come that he will <I>gather all nations and tongues to 
 himself,</I> that they may <I>come and see his glory</I> as it shines 
 in the face of Jesus Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 This was fulfilled when all nations were to be discipled and the gift 
 of tongues was bestowed in order thereunto. The church had hitherto 
 been confined to one nation and in one tongue only God was worshipped; 
 but in the days of the Messiah the partition-wall should be taken down, 
 and those that had been strangers to God should be brought acquainted 
 with him and should <I>see his glory</I> in the gospel, as the Jews had 
 seen it <I>in the sanctuary.</I> As to this, it is here promised,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That some of the Jewish nation should, by the grace of God, be 
 distinguished form the rest, and marked for salvation: I will not only 
 set up a <I>gathering ensign</I> among them, to which the Gentiles 
 shall seek (as is promised, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:12"><I>ch.</I> xi. 12</A>),

 but there shall be those among them on whom <I>I will set a
 differencing sign;</I> for so the word signifies. Though they are a 
 corrupt degenerate nation, yet God will set apart a remnant of them, 
 that shall be devoted to him and employed for him, and a mark shall be 
 set upon them, with such certainty will God own them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+9:4">Ezek. ix. 4</A>.

 The <I>servants of God</I> shall be <I>sealed in their foreheads,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:3">Rev. vii. 3</A>.

 The Lord knows those that are his. Christ's sheep are marked.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That those who are themselves distinguished thus by the grace of God 
 shall be commissioned to invite others to come and take the benefit of 
 that grace. Those that escape the power of those prejudices by which 
 the generality of that nation is kept in unbelief shall be <I>sent to 
 the nations</I> to carry the gospel among them, and preach it to every 
 creature. Note, Those who themselves have escaped the wrath to come 
 should do all they can to snatch others also as brands out of the 
 burning. God chooses to send those on his errands that can deliver 
 their message feelingly and experimentally, and warn people of their 
 danger by sin as those who have themselves narrowly escaped the danger. 
 
 (1.) They shall be sent <I>to the nations,</I> several of which are 
 here named, Tarshish, and Pul, and Lud, &c. It is uncertain, nor are 
 interpreters agreed, what countries are here intended. <I>Tarshish</I> 
 signifies in general <I>the sea,</I> yet some take it for Tarsus in 
 Cilicia. <I>Pul</I> is mentioned sometimes as the name of one of the 
 kings of Assyria; perhaps some part of that country might likewise bear 
 that name. <I>Lud</I> is supposed to be Lydia, a warlike nation, famed 
 for archers: the Lydians are said to <I>handle</I> and <I>bend the 
 bow,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:9">Jer. xlvi. 9</A>.

 <I>Tubal,</I> some think, is Italy or Spain; and <I>Javan</I> most
 agree to be Greece, the Iones; and the <I>isles of the Gentiles,</I> 
 that were peopled by the posterity of Japhet

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:5">Gen. x. 5</A>),

 probably are here meant by the <I>isles afar off, that have not heard
 my name, neither have seen my glory.</I> In Judah only was God known, 
 and there only his name was great for many ages. Other countries sat
 in darkness, heard no the joyful sound, saw not the joyful light. This
 deplorable state of theirs seems to be spoken of here with compassion; 
 for it is a pity that any of the children of men should be at such a 
 distance from their Maker as not to hear his name and see his glory. In 
 consideration of this,

 (2.) Those that are sent to the nations shall go upon God's errand, to 
 <I>declare his glory among the Gentiles.</I> The Jews that shall be 
 dispersed among the nations shall declare the glory of God's providence 
 concerning their nation all along, by which many shall be invited to 
 join with them, as also by the appearances of God's glory among them in 
 his ordinances. Some out of all languages of the nations shall <I>take 
 hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew,</I> entreating him to take 
 notice of them, to admit them into his company, and to stay a little 
 while for them, till they are ready, "for <I>we will go with you, 
 having heard that God is with you,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:23">Zech. viii. 23</A>.

 Thus the glory of God was in part declared among the Gentiles; but more
 clearly and fully by the apostles and early preachers of the gospel, 
 who were sent into all the world, even to the isles afar off, to 
 publish the glorious gospel of the blessed God. They <I>went forth and 
 preached every where, the Lord working with them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:20">Mark xvi. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That many converts shall hereby be made, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>They shall bring all your brethren</I> (for proselytes ought to 
 be owned and embraced as brethren) <I>for an offering unto the 
 Lord.</I> God's glory shall not be in vain declared to them, but they 
 shall be both invited and directed to join themselves to the Lord. 
 Those that are sent to them shall succeed so well in their negotiation 
 that thereupon there shall be as great flocking to Jerusalem as used to 
 be at the time of a solemn feast, when all the males from all parts of 
 the country were to attend there, and not to appear empty. Observe, 
 
 [1.] The conveniences that they shall be furnished with for their 
 coming. Some shall come <I>upon horses,</I> because they came from far 
 and the journey was too long to travel on foot, as the Jews usually did 
 to their feasts. Persons of quality shall come <I>in chariots,</I> and 
 the aged, and sickly, and little children, shall be brought <I>in 
 litters</I> or covered wagons, and the young men <I>on mules and swift 
 beasts.</I> This intimates their zeal and forwardness to come. They 
 shall spare no trouble nor charge to get to Jerusalem. Those that 
 cannot ride on horseback shall come in litters; and in such haste shall 
 they be, and so impatient of delay, that those that can shall ride upon 
 mules and swift beasts. These expressions are figurative, and these
 various means of conveyance are heaped up to intimate (says the learned 
 Mr. Gataker) the abundant provision of all those gracious helps 
 requisite for the bringing of God's elect home to Christ. All shall be 
 welcome, and nothing shall be wanting for their assistance and 
 encouragement. 

 [2.] The character under which they shall be brought. They shall come,
 not as formerly they used to come to Jerusalem, to be offerers, but to 
 be themselves <I>an offering unto the Lord,</I> which must be 
 understood spiritually, of their being presented to God as <I>living 
 sacrifices,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:1">Rom. xii. 1</A>.

 The apostle explains this, and perhaps refers to it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:16">Rom. xv. 16</A>,

 where he speaks of his <I>ministering the gospel to the Gentiles,</I>
 that the <I>offering up,</I> or <I>sacrificing, of the Gentiles might 
 be acceptable.</I> They shall offer themselves, and those who are the 
 instruments of their conversion shall offer them, as the spoils which 
 they have taken for Christ and which are devoted to his service and 
 honour. They shall be brought <I>as the children of Israel bring an 
 offering in a clean vessel,</I> with great care that they be holy, 
 purified from sin, and sanctified to God. It is said of the converted 
 Gentiles

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:9">Acts xv. 9</A>)

 that <I>their hearts were purified by faith.</I> Whatever was brought
 to God was brought in a clean vessel, a vessel appropriated to 
 religious uses. God will be served and honoured in the way that he has 
 appointed, in the ordinances of his own institution, which are the 
 proper vehicles for these spiritual offerings. When the soul is offered 
 up to God the body must be a clean vessel for it, possessed <I>in 
 sanctification and honour, and not in the lusts of uncleanness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:4,5">1 Thess. iv. 4, 5</A>);

 and converts to Christ are not only <I>purged from an evil
 conscience,</I> but have their <I>bodies also washed with pure
 water,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:22">Heb. x. 22</A>.
 
 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) This may refer, 

 [1.] To the Jews, devout men, and proselytes out of every nation under 
 heaven, that flocked together to Jerusalem, expecting the kingdom of 
 the Messiah to appear, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:5,6,10">Acts ii. 5, 6, 10</A>.

 They came from all parts to the holy <I>mountain of Jerusalem,</I> as
 an <I>offering to the Lord,</I> and there many of them were brought to 
 the faith of Christ by the gift of tongues poured out on the apostles.
 Methinks there is some correspondence between that history and this 
 prophecy. The eunuch some time after came to worship at Jerusalem in 
 his chariot and took home with him the knowledge of Christ and his holy 
 religion.

 [2.] To the Gentiles, some of all nations, that should be converted to 
 Christ, and so added to his church, which, though a spiritual 
 accession, is often in prophecy represented by a local motion. The 
 apostle says of all true Christians that they <I>have come to Mount 
 Zion, and the heavenly Jerusalem</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:22">Heb. xii. 22</A>),

 which explains this passage, and shows that the meaning of all this
 parade is only that they shall be brought into the church by the grace 
 of God, and in the use of the means of that grace, as carefully, 
 safely, and comfortably, as if they were carried in chariots and 
 litters. Thus God shall <I>persuade Japhet</I> and he shall <I>dwell in 
 the tents of Shem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:27">Gen. ix. 27</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That a gospel ministry shall be set up in the church, it being thus 
 enlarged by the addition of such a multitude of members to it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):
 
 <I>I will take of them</I> (of the proselytes, of the Gentile converts)
 <I>for priests and for Levites,</I> to minister in holy things and to 
 preside in their religious assemblies, which is very necessary for 
 doctrine, worship, and discipline. Hitherto the priests and Levites 
 were all taken from among the Jews and were all of one tribe; but in 
 gospel times God will take of the converted Gentiles to minister to him 
 in holy things, to teach the people, to bless them in the name of the 
 Lord, to be the stewards of the mysteries of God as the priests and 
 Levites were under the law, to be pastors and teachers (or bishops), to 
 <I>give themselves to the word and prayer,</I> and deacons to <I>serve 
 tables,</I> and, as the Levites, to take care of the <I>outward 
 business of the house of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:1,Ac+6:2-4">Phil. i. 1; Acts vi. 2-4</A>.

 The apostles were all Jews, and so were the seventy disciples; the
 great apostle of the Gentiles was himself <I>a Hebrew of the 
 Hebrews;</I> but, when churches were planted among the Gentiles, they 
 had ministers settled who were <I>of themselves, elders in every 
 church</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:23,Tit+1:5">Acts xiv. 23, Tit. i. 5</A>),

 which made the ministry to spread the more easily, and to be the more
 familiar, and, if not the more venerable, yet the more acceptable; 
 gospel grace, it might be hoped, would cure people of those corruptions 
 which kept a prophet from having <I>honour in his own country.</I> God 
 says, <I>I will take,</I> not <I>all of them,</I> though they are all 
 in a spiritual sense made to our God kings and priests, but <I>of 
 them,</I> some of them. It is God's work originally to choose ministers 
 by qualifying them for and inclining them to the service, as well as to 
 make ministers by giving them their commission. <I>I will take 
 them,</I> that is, I will admit them, though Gentiles, and will accept 
 of them and their ministrations. This is a great honour and advantage 
 to the Gentile church, as it was to the Jewish church that God 
 <I>raised up of their sons for prophets</I> and <I>their young men for 
 Nazarites,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:11">Amos ii. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. That the church and ministry, being thus settled, shall continue and 
 be kept up in a succession from one generation to another, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 The change that will be made by the setting up of the kingdom of the 
 Messiah is here described to be, 

 (1.) A very great and universal change; it shall be a new world, <I>the 
 new heavens and the new earth</I> promised before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:17"><I>ch.</I> lxv. 17</A>.

 <I>Old things have passed away,</I> behold <I>all things have become
 new</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:17">2 Cor. v. 17</A>),

 the old covenant of peculiarity is set aside, and a new covenant, a
 covenant of grace, established, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:13">Heb. viii. 13</A>.

 We are now to serve <I>in newness of the spirit,</I> and <I>not in the
 oldness of the letter,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:6">Rom. vii. 6</A>.

 New commandments are given relating both to heaven and earth, and new
 promises relating to both, and both together make a New Testament; so
 that they are new heavens and a new earth that God will create, and
 these a preparative for the new heavens and new earth designed at the
 end of time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:13">2 Pet. iii. 13</A>.

 (2.) A change of God's own making; he will create the new heavens and 
 the new earth. The change was made by him that had authority to make 
 new ordinances, as well as power to make new worlds. 

 (3.) It will be an abiding lasting change, a change never to be 
 changed, a new world that will be always new, and never wax old, as 
 that does which is ready to vanish away: <I>It shall remain before 
 me</I> unalterable; for the gospel dispensation is to continue to the 
 end of time and not to be succeeded by any other. The kingdom of Christ 
 is a <I>kingdom that cannot be moved;</I> the laws and privileges of it 
 <I>are things that cannot be shaken,</I> but shall <I>for ever 
 remain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:27,28">Heb. xii. 27, 28</A>.

 It shall <I>therefore</I> remain, because it is before God; it is under
 his eye, and care, and special protection.

 (4.) It will be maintained in a seed that shall serve Christ: <I>Your 
 seed,</I> and in them <I>your name, shall remain</I>--a seed of 
 ministers, a seed of Christians; as one generation of both passes away, 
 another generation shall come; and thus the name of Christ, with that 
 of Christians, shall continue on earth while the earth remains, and his 
 throne as the days of heaven. The gates of hell, though they fight 
 against the church, shall not <I>prevail,</I> nor <I>wear out the 
 saints of the Most High.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. That the public worship of God in religious assemblies shall be 
 carefully and constantly attended upon by all that are thus brought 
 <I>as an offering to the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 This is described in expressions suited to the Old-Testament 
 dispensation, to show that though the ceremonial law should be 
 abolished, and the temple service should come to an end, yet God should 
 be still as regularly, constantly, and acceptably worshipped as ever. 
 Heretofore only Jews went up to appear before God, and they were bound 
 to attend only three times a year, and the males only; but now all 
 flesh, Gentiles as well as Jews, women as well as men, shall <I>come 
 and worship before God,</I> in his presence, though not in his temple 
 at Jerusalem, but in religious assemblies dispersed all the world over, 
 which shall be to them as the tabernacle of meeting was to the Jews. 
 God will in them record his name, and, though but two or three come 
 together, he will be among them, will meet them, and bless them. And 
 they shall have the benefit of these holy convocations frequently, 
 every new moon and every sabbath, not, as formerly, at the three annual 
 feasts only. There is no necessity of one certain place, as the temple 
 was of old. Christ is our temple, in whom by faith all believers meet, 
 and now that the church is so far extended it is impossible that all 
 should meet at one place; but it is fit that there should be a certain 
 time appointed, that the service may be done certainly and frequently, 
 and a token thereby given of the spiritual communion which all 
 Christian assemblies have with each other by faith, hope, and holy 
 love. The <I>new moons</I> and the <I>sabbaths</I> are mentioned 
 because, under the law, though the yearly feasts were to be celebrated 
 at Jerusalem, yet the new moons and the sabbaths were religiously 
 observed all the country over, in the <I>schools of the prophets</I> 
 first and afterwards <I>in the synagogues</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+4:23,Am+8:5,Ac+15:21">2 Kings iv. 23, Amos viii. 5, Acts xv. 21</A>),

 according to the model of which Christian assemblies seem to be formed.
 Where the Lord's day is weekly sanctified, and the Lord's supper 
 monthly celebrated, and both are duly attended on, there this promise 
 is fulfilled, there the Christian new moons and sabbaths are observed. 
 See, here,

 (1.) That God is to be worshipped in solemn assemblies, and that it is 
 the duty of all, as they have opportunity, to wait upon God in those 
 assemblies: <I>All flesh must come;</I> though flesh, weak, corrupt, 
 and sinful, let them come that the flesh may be mortified. 

 (2.) In worshipping God we present ourselves before him, and are in a 
 special manner in his presence. 

 (3.) For doing this there ought to be stated times, and are so; and we 
 must see that it is our interest as well as our duty constantly and 
 conscientiously to observe these times.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. That their thankful sense of God's distinguishing favour to them 
 should be very much increased by the consideration of the fearful doom 
 and destruction of those that persist and perish in their infidelity 
 and impiety, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Those that have been worshipping the Lord of hosts, and rejoicing 
 before him in the goodness of his house, shall, in order to affect 
 themselves the more with their own happiness, take a view of the misery 
 of the wicked. Observe, 

 (1.) Who they are whose misery is here described. They are men that
 have <I>transgressed against God,</I> not only broken his laws, but 
 broken covenant with him, and thought themselves able to contend with 
 him. It may be meant especially of the unbelieving Jews that rejected 
 the gospel of Christ. 

 (2.) What their misery is. It is here represented by the frightful 
 spectacle of a field of battle, covered with the <I>carcases</I> of the 
 slain, that lie rotting above ground, full of <I>worms</I> crawling 
 about them and feeding on them; and, if you go to burn them, they are 
 so scattered, and it is such a noisome piece of work to get them 
 together, that it would be endless, and the <I>fire would never be 
 quenched;</I> so that they are an <I>abhorring to all flesh,</I> nobody 
 cares to come near them. Now this is sometimes accomplished in temporal 
 judgments, and perhaps never nearer the letter than in the destruction 
 of Jerusalem and the Jewish nation by the Romans, in which destruction 
 it is computed that above two millions, first and last, were cut off by 
 the sword, besides what perished by famine and pestilence. It may refer 
 likewise to the spiritual judgments that came upon the unbelieving 
 Jews, which St. Paul looks upon, and shows us,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:8">Rom. xi. 8</A>,

 &c. They became dead in sins, twice dead. The church of the Jews was a
 <I>carcase</I> of a church; all its members were putrid carcases; 
 <I>their worm died not,</I> their own consciences made them continually 
 uneasy, and the fire of their rage against the gospel was not quenched, 
 which was their punishment as well as their sin; and they became, more 
 than ever any nation under the sun, <I>an abhorring to all flesh.</I> 
 But our Saviour applies it to the everlasting misery and torment of 
 impenitent sinners in the future state, where their <I>worm dies not, 
 and their fire is not quenched</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:44">Mark ix. 44</A>);

 for the soul, whose conscience is its constant tormentor, is immortal,
 and God, whose wrath is its constant terror, is eternal.

 (3.) What notice shall be taken of it. Those that worship God shall 
 <I>go forth and look upon them,</I> to affect their own hearts with the 
 love of their Redeemer, when they see what misery they are redeemed 
 from. As it will aggravate the miseries of the damned to see others in 
 the kingdom of heaven and <I>themselves thrust out</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:28">Luke xiii. 28</A>),

 so it will illustrate the joys and glories of the blessed to see what
 becomes of those that died in their transgression, and it will elevate 
 their praises to think that they were themselves as brands plucked out 
 of that burning. To the honour of that free grace which thus 
 distinguished them let the redeemed of the Lord with all humility, and 
 not without a holy trembling, sing their triumphant songs.</P>
