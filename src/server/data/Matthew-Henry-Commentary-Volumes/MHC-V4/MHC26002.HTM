 What our Lord Jesus said to St. Paul 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:16">Acts xxvi. 16</A>)

 may fitly be applied to the prophet Ezekiel, to whom the same Jesus is
 here speaking, "Rise and stand upon thy feet, for I have appeared unto 
 thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister." We have here Ezekiel's 
 ordination to his office, which the vision was designed to fit him for, 
 not to entertain his curiosity with uncommon speculations, but to put 
 him into business. Now here,

 I. He is commissioned to go as a prophet to the house of Israel, now
 captives in Babylon, and to deliver God's messages to them from time to 
 time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+2:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. He is cautioned not to be afraid of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+2:6">ver. 6</A>.

 III. He is instructed what to say to them, and has words put into his
 mouth, signified by the vision of a roll, which he was ordered to eat
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+2:7-10">ver. 7-10</A>),
 
 and which, in the next chapter, we find he did eat.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I
 will speak unto thee.
 &nbsp; 2  And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set
 me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me.
 &nbsp; 3  And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children
 of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me:
 they and their fathers have transgressed against me, <I>even</I> unto
 this very day.
 &nbsp; 4  For <I>they are</I> impudent children and stiff-hearted. I do send
 thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord
 G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 5  And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will
 forbear, (for they <I>are</I> a rebellious house,) yet shall know that
 there hath been a prophet among them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The title here given to Ezekiel, as often afterwards, is very 
 observable. God, when he speaks to him, calls him, <I>Son of man</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+2:1,3"><I>v.</I> 1, 3</A>),

 <I>Son of Adam, Son of the earth.</I> Daniel is once called so 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:17">Dan. viii. 17</A>)

 and but once; the compellation is used to no other of the prophets but 
 to Ezekiel all along. We may take it,

 1. As a humble diminishing title. Lest Ezekiel should be lifted up with 
 the abundance of the revelations, he is put in mind of this, that sill 
 he is a <I>son of man,</I> a mean, weak, mortal creature. Among other 
 things made known to him, it was necessary he should be made to know 
 this, that he was a <I>son of man,</I> and therefore that it was 
 wonderful condescension in God that he was pleased thus to manifest 
 himself to him. Now he is among the living creatures, the angels; yet 
 he must remember that he is himself a man, a dying creature. <I>What is 
 man, or the son of man,</I> that he should be thus visited, thus 
 dignified? Though God had here a splendid retinue of holy angles about
 his throne, who were ready to go on his errands, yet he passes them all 
 by, and pitches on Ezekiel, a <I>son of man,</I> to be his messenger to 
 the <I>house of Israel;</I> for we <I>have this treasure in earthen 
 vessels,</I> and God's messages sent us by men like ourselves, whose 
 terror shall not <I>make us afraid</I> nor <I>their hand be heavy upon 
 us.</I> Ezekiel was a priest, but the priesthood was brought low and 
 the honour of it laid in the dust. It therefore became him, and all of 
 his order, to humble themselves, and to lie low, as sons of men, common 
 men. He was now to be employed as a prophet, God's ambassador, and a
 ruler over the kingdoms 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:10">Jer. i. 10</A>),

 a post of great honour, but he must remember that he is a <I>son of
 man,</I> and, whatever good he did, it was not by any might of his own, 
 for he was a <I>son of man,</I> but in the strength of divine grace, 
 which must therefore have all the glory. Or,

 2. We may take it as an honourable dignifying title; for it is one of 
 the titles of the Messiah in the Old Testament 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:13">Dan. vii. 13</A>,

 <I>I saw one like the Son of man come with the clouds of heaven</I>), 
 whence Christ borrows the title he often calls himself by, <I>The Son 
 of man.</I> The prophets were types of him, as they had near access to 
 God and great authority among men; and therefore as David the king is 
 called the <I>Lord's anointed,</I> or <I>Christ,</I> so Ezekiel the 
 prophet is called <I>son of man.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Ezekiel is here set up, and made to stand, that he might receive his 
 commission, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+2:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.
 
 He is set up,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. By a divine command: <I>Son of man, stand upon thy feet.</I> His 
 lying prostrate was a posture of greater reverence, but his standing up 
 would be a posture of greater readiness and fitness for business. Our 
 adorings of God must not hinder, but rather quicken and excite, our 
 actings for God. He <I>fell on his face</I> in a holy fear and awe of 
 God, but he was quickly raised up again; for those that <I>humble 
 themselves shall be exalted.</I> God delights no in the dejections of 
 his servants, but the same that brings them low will raise them up; the 
 same that is a Spirit of bondage will be a Spirit of adoption. 
 <I>Stand, and I will speak to thee.</I> Note, We may expect that God 
 will speak to us when we stand ready to do what he commands us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. By a divine power going along with that command, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 God bade him <I>stand up;</I> but, because he had not strength of his 
 own to recover his feet nor courage to face the vision, <I>the Spirit 
 entered into him</I> and <I>set him upon his feet.</I> Note, God is 
 graciously pleased to work that in us which he requires of us and 
 raises those whom he bids rise. We must stir up ourselves, and then God 
 will put strength into us; we must <I>work out our salvation,</I> and 
 then God will <I>work in us.</I> He observed that the Spirit entered 
 into him when Christ spoke to him; for Christ conveys his Spirit by his 
 word as the ordinary means and makes the word effectual by the Spirit. 
 <I>The Spirit set</I> the prophet <I>upon his feet,</I> to raise him up 
 from his dejections, for <I>he is the Comforter.</I> Thus, in a similar 
 case, Daniel was strengthened by a divine touch 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:18">Dan. x. 18</A>)

 and John was raised by the right hand of Christ laid upon him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:17">Rev. i. 17</A>.

 The <I>Spirit set him upon his feet,</I> made him willing and forward 
 to do as he was bidden, and then he <I>heard him that spoke</I> to him. 
 He heard the voice before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:28"><I>ch.</I> i. 28</A>),

 but now he heard it more distinctly and clearly, heard it and submitted
 to it. The Spirit sets us upon our feet by inclining our will to our 
 duty, and thereby disposes the understanding to receive the knowledge 
 of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Ezekiel is here sent, and made to go, with a message to the 
 children of Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>I send thee to the children of Israel.</I> God had for many ages 
 been sending to them his servants the prophets, rising up betimes and 
 sending them, but to little purpose; they were now sent into captivity 
 for abusing God's messengers, and yet even there God sends this prophet 
 among them, to try if their ears were open to discipline, now that they 
 were holden in the cords of affliction. As the supports of life, so the 
 means of grace, are continued to us after they have been a thousand 
 times forfeited. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The rebellion of the people to whom this ambassador is sent; he is 
 sent to reduce them to their allegiance, to bring back the children of 
 Israel to the Lord their God. Let the prophet know that there is
 occasion for his going on this errand, for they are a <I>rebellious 
 nation</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 <I>a rebellious house,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 They are called <I>children of Israel;</I> they retain the name of
 their pious ancestors, but they have wretchedly degenerated, they have 
 become <I>Goim--nations,</I> the word commonly used for the Gentiles. 
 The <I>children of Israel</I> have become as the <I>children of the 
 Ethiopian</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:7">Amos ix. 7</A>),

 for they are <I>rebellious;</I> and rebels at home are much more
 provoking to a prince than enemies abroad. Their idolatries and false 
 worships were the sins which, more than any thing, denominated them a 
 <I>rebellious nation;</I> for thereby they set up another prince in 
 opposition to their rightful Sovereign, and did homage and paid tribute 
 to the usurper, which is the highest degree of rebellion that can be.

 (1.) They had been all along a rebellious generation and had persisted 
 in their rebellion: <I>They and their fathers have transgressed against 
 me.</I> Note, Those are not always in the right that have antiquity and 
 the fathers on their side; for there are errors and corruptions of long 
 standing: and it is so far from being an excuse for walking in a bad 
 way that our fathers walked in it that it is really an aggravation, for 
 it is justifying the sin of those that have gone before us. They have 
 continued in their rebellion <I>even unto this very day;</I> 
 notwithstanding the various means and methods that have been made use 
 of to reclaim them, <I>to this day,</I> when they are under divine 
 rebukes for their rebellion, they continue <I>rebellious;</I> many 
 among them, like Ahaz, even <I>in their distress, trespass yet 
 more;</I> they are not the better for all the changes that have 
 befallen them, but still remain unchanged. 

 (2.) They were now hardened in their rebellion. They are <I>impudent 
 children,</I> brazen-faced, and cannot blush; they are still-hearted, 
 self-willed, and cannot bend, cannot stoop, neither ashamed nor afraid 
 to sin; they will not be wrought upon by the sense either of honour or 
 duty. We are willing to hope this was not the character of all, but of 
 many, and those perhaps the leading men. Observe, 

 [1.] God knew this concerning them, how inflexible, how incorrigible, 
 they were. Note, God is perfectly acquainted with every man's true 
 character, whatever his pretensions and professions may be.

 [2.] He told the prophet this, that he might know the better how to 
 deal with them and what handle to take them by. He must rebuke such
 men as those sharply, cuttingly, must deal plainly with them, though 
 they call it <I>dealing roughly.</I> God tells him this, that it might 
 be no surprise or stumbling-block to him if he found that his preaching 
 should not make that impression upon them, which he had reason to think 
 it would.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The dominion of the prince by whom this ambassador is sent. 

 (1.) He has authority to command him whom he sends: "<I>I do send thee 
 unto them,</I> and therefore <I>thou shalt say</I> thus and thus unto 
 them,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Note, it is the prerogative of Christ to send prophets and ministers 
 and to enjoin them their work. St. Paul thanked Christ Jesus who put 
 him into the ministry 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:12">1 Tim. i. 12</A>);

 for, as he was sent of the Father, ministers are sent by him; and as he
 received the Spirit without measure he gives the Spirit by measure, 
 saying, <I>Receive you the Holy Ghost.</I> They are <I>impudent</I> and 
 <I>rebellious,</I> and yet <I>I send thee unto them.</I> Note, Christ 
 gives the means of grace to many who he knows will not make a good use 
 of those means, puts many a price into the hand of fools to get wisdom, 
 who not only have no heart to it, but have their hearts turned against 
 it. Thus he will magnify his own grace, justify his own judgment, leave 
 them inexcusable, and make their condemnation more intolerable.

 (2.) He has authority by him to command those to whom he sends him: 
 <I>Thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God.</I> All he said 
 to them must be spoken in God's name, enforced by his authority, and 
 delivered as from him. Christ delivered his doctrines as a 
 Son--<I>Verily, verily, I say unto you;</I> the prophets as 
 <I>servants--Thus saith the Lord God,</I> our Master and yours. Note, 
 The writings of the prophets are the word of God, and so are to be 
 regarded by every one of us. 

 (3.) He has authority to call those to an account to whom he sends his 
 ambassadors. <I>Whether they will hear or whether they will
 forbear,</I> whether they will attend to the word or turn their backs 
 upon it, <I>they shall know that there has been a prophet among 
 them,</I> shall know by experience. 

 [1.] If they hear and obey, they will know by comfortable experience 
 that the word which did them good was brought to them by one that had a 
 commission from God and a divine power going along with him in the 
 execution of it. Thus those who were converted by St. Paul's preaching 
 are said to be <I>the seals of his apostleship,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:2">1 Cor. ix. 2</A>.

 When men's hearts are made to burn under the word, and their wills to
 bow to it, then they know and bear the witness in themselves that it is 
 not the <I>word of men, but of God.</I>

 [2.] If they forbear, if they turn a deaf ear to the word (as it is to 
 be feared they will, <I>for they are a rebellious house</I>), yet they 
 shall be made to know that he whom they slighted was indeed a prophet, 
 by the reproaches of their own consciences and the just judgments of 
 God upon them for refusing him; they shall know it to their cost, know 
 it to their confusion, know it by sad experience, what a pernicious 
 dangerous thing it is to despise God's messengers. They shall know by 
 the accomplishment of the threatenings that the prophet who denounced 
 them was sent of God; thus the word will <I>take hold of men,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:6">Zech. i. 6</A>.

 Note, <I>First,</I> Those to whom the word of God is sent are upon
 their trial <I>whether they will hear</I> or <I>whether they will 
 forbear,</I> and accordingly will their doom be. <I>Secondly,</I>
 Whether we be edified by the word or no, it is certain that God will be 
 glorified and his word magnified and made honourable. Whether it be a
 <I>savour of life unto life</I> or <I>of death unto death,</I> either 
 way it will appear to be of divine original.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet, having received his commission, here receives a charge
 with it. It is a post of honour to which he is advanced, but withal it
 is a post of service and work, and it is here required of him,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That he be bold. He must act in the discharge of this trust with an 
 undaunted courage and resolution, and not be either driven off from his 
 work or made to drive on heavily, by the difficulties and oppositions 
 that he would be likely to meet with in it: <I>Son of man, be not 
 afraid of them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Note, Those that will do any thing to purpose in the service of God 
 must not be afraid of the face of man; for the fear of men will bring a 
 snare, which will be very entangling to us in the work of God.

 1. God tells the prophet what was the character of those to whom he 
 sent him, as before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+2:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 They are <I>briers and thorns,</I> scratching, and tearing, and vexing 
 a man, which way soever he turns. They are continually teazing God's
 prophets and entangling them in their <I>talk</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:15">Matt. xxii. 15</A>);

 they are <I>pricking briers</I> and <I>grieving thorns.</I> The best of 
 them is as a brier, and <I>the most upright sharper than a
 thorn-hedge,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:4">Mic. vii. 4</A>.

 Thorns and briers are the fruit of sin and the curse, and of equal date
 with the enmity between the seed of the woman and the seed of the 
 serpent. Note, Wicked men, especially the persecutors of God's prophets 
 and people, are as briers and thorns, which are hurtful to the ground, 
 choke the good seed, hinder God's husbandry, are vexatious to his 
 husbandmen; but they are <I>nigh unto cursing</I> and <I>their end is 
 to be burned.</I> Yet God makes use of them sometimes for the
 correction and instruction of his people, as <I>Gideon taught the men
 of Succoth with thorns and briers,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+8:16">Judg. viii. 16</A>.

 Yet this is not the worst of their character: they are
 <I>scorpions,</I> venomous and malignant. The sting of a scorpion is a
 thousand times more hurtful than the scratch of a brier. Persecutors
 are a <I>generation of vipers,</I> are of the serpent's seed, and the
 <I>poison of asps is under their tongue;</I> and they are <I>more 
 subtle than any beast of the field.</I> And, which makes the prophet's 
 case the more grievous, he dwells among these scorpions; they are 
 continually about him, so that he cannot be safe nor quiet in his own 
 house; these bad men are his bad neighbours, who thereby have many 
 opportunities, and will let slip none, to do him a mischief. God takes 
 notice of this to the prophet, as Christ to the angel of one of the 
 churches,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:13">Rev. ii. 13</A>.

 <I>I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat 
 is.</I> Ezekiel had been, in vision, conversing with angels, but when 
 he comes down from this mount he finds he <I>dwells with scorpions.</I>

 2. He tells him what would be their conduct towards him, that they
 would do what they could to frighten him with <I>their looks</I> and 
 <I>their words;</I> they would hector him and threaten him, would look 
 scornfully and spitefully at him, and do their utmost to face him down 
 and put him our of countenance, that they might drive him off from 
 being a prophet, or at least from telling them of their faults and 
 threatening them with the judgments of God; or, if they could not 
 prevail in this, that they might vex and perplex him, and disturb the 
 repose of his mind. They were now themselves in subjection, divested of 
 all power, so that they had no other way of persecuting the prophet 
 than with <I>their looks and their words;</I> and so they did persecute 
 him. <I>Behold, thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou
 couldest,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:5">Jer. iii. 5</A>.

 If they had had more power, they would have done more mischief. They
 were now in captivity, smarting for their rebellion, and particularly 
 their misusing God's prophets; and yet they are as bad as ever. 
 <I>Though thou brag a fool in a mortar, yet will not his foolishness 
 depart from him;</I> no providences will of themselves humble and 
 reform men, unless the grace of God work with them. But, how malicious 
 soever they were, Ezekiel must not be <I>afraid of them</I> nor 
 <I>dismayed,</I> he must not be deterred from his work, or any part of 
 it, nor be disheartened or dispirited in it by all their menaces, but 
 go on in it with resolution and cheerfulness, assuring himself of 
 safety under the divine protection.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It is required that he be faithful, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 1. He must be faithful to Christ who sent him: <I>Thou shalt speak my
 words unto them.</I> Note, As it is the honour of prophets that they
 are entrusted to speak God's words, so it is their duty to cleave
 closely to them and to speak nothing but what is agreeable to the words 
 of God. Ministers must always speak according to that rule. 

 2. He must be faithful to the souls of those to whom he was sent: 
 <I>Whether they will hear of whether they will forbear,</I> he must 
 deliver his message to them as he received it. He must bring them to 
 comply with the word, and not study to accommodate the word to their 
 humours. "It is true they are <I>most rebellious,</I> they are 
 rebellion itself; but, however, <I>speak my words</I> to them, whether 
 they are pleasing or unpleasing." Note, The untractableness and 
 unprofitableness of people under the word are no good reason why 
 ministers should leave off preaching to them; nor must we decline an 
 opportunity by which good may be done, though we have a great deal of 
 reason to think no good will be done.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. It is required that he be observant of his instructions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here is a general intimation what the instructions were that were 
 given him, in the contents of the book which was <I>spread before 
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 (1.) His instructions were large; for the roll was <I>written within 
 and without,</I> on the inside and on the outside of the roll. It was 
 as a sheet of paper written on all the four sides. One side contained 
 their sins; the other side contained the judgments of God coming upon 
 them for those sins. Note, God has a great deal to say to his people 
 when they have degenerated and become rebellious. 

 (2.) His instructions were melancholy. He was sent on a sad errand; the 
 matter contained in the book was, <I>lamentations, and mourning, and 
 woe.</I> The idea of his message is taken from the impression it would 
 make upon the minds of those that carefully attended to it; it would 
 set them a weeping and crying out, <I>Woe! and, Alas!</I> Both the 
 discoveries of sin and the denunciations of wrath would be matter of 
 lamentation. What could be more lamentable, more mournful, more woeful, 
 than to see a holy happy people sunk into such a state of sin and 
 misery as it appears by the prophecy of this book the Jews were at this 
 time? Ezekiel echoes to Jeremiah's lamentations. Note, Though God is 
 rich in mercy, yet impenitent sinners will find there are even among 
 his words <I>lamentations and woe.</I></P>

 2. Here is an express charge given to the prophet to observe his 
 instructions, both in receiving his message and delivering it. He is
 now to receive it and is here commanded,

 (1.) To attend diligently to it: <I>son of man, hear what I say unto 
 thee,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Note, Those that speak from God to others must be sure to hear from God 
 themselves and be obedient to his voice: "<I>Be not thou 
 rebellious;</I> do not refuse to go on this errand, or to deliver it; 
 do not fly off, as Jonah did, for fear of disobliging thy countrymen. 
 They are a <I>rebellious house,</I> among whom thou livest; but be not 
 thou like them, do not comply with them in any thing that is evil." If 
 ministers, who are reprovers by office, connive at sin and indulge 
 sinners, either show them not their wickedness or show them not the 
 fatal consequences of it, for fear of displeasing them and getting 
 their ill-will, they hereby make themselves partakers of their guilt 
 and are rebellious like them. If people will not do their duty in 
 reforming, yet let ministers do theirs in reproving, and they will have 
 the comfort of it in the reflection, whatever the success be, as that 
 prophet had, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:5">Isa. l. 5</A>.

 <I>The Lord God has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious.</I> Even
 the best of men, when their lot is cast in bad times and places, have 
 need to be cautioned against the worst of crimes.

 (2.) To digest it in his own mind by an experience of the favour and 
 power of it: "Do not only <I>hear what I say unto thee,</I> but <I>open 
 thy mouth, and eat that which I give thee.</I> Prepare to eat it and 
 eat it willingly and with an appetite." All God's children are content 
 to be at their heavenly father's finding, and to eat whatever he gives 
 them. That which God's hand reached out to Ezekiel was <I>a roll of a 
 book,</I> or <I>the volume of a book,</I> a book or scroll of paper or 
 parchment fully written and rolled up. Divine revelation comes to us 
 from the hand of Christ; he gave it to the prophets,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:1">Rev. i. 1</A>.

 When we look at <I>the roll of thy book</I> we must have an eye to the 
 hand by which it is sent to us. He that brought it to the prophet 
 <I>spread it before him,</I> that he might now swallow it with an 
 implicit faith, but might fully understand the contents of it, and then 
 receive it and make it his own. <I>Be not rebellious,</I> says Christ, 
 but <I>eat what I give thee.</I> If we receive not what Christ in his 
 ordinances and providences allots for us, if we submit not to his word 
 and rod, and reconcile not ourselves to both, we shall be accounted 
 rebellious.</P>
