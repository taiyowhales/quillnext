 We left Jonah in the belly of the fish, and had reason to think we 
 should hear no more of him, that if he were not destroyed by the waters 
 of the sea he would be consumed in the bowels of that leviathan, "out 
 of whose mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire, and whose breath 
 kindles coals," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:19,21">Job xli. 19, 21</A>.

 But God brings his people through fire, and through water

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:12">Ps. lxvi. 12</A>);

 and by his power, behold, Jonah the prophet is yet alive, and is heard
 of again. In this chapter God hears from him, for we find him praying; 
 in the next Nineveh hears from him, for we find him preaching. In his 
 prayer we have,

 I. The great distress and danger he was in, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+2:2,3,5,6">ver. 2, 3, 5, 6</A>.

 II. The despair he was thereby almost reduced to, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+2:4">ver. 4</A>.

 III. The encouragement he took to himself, in this deplorable condition, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+2:4,7">ver. 4, 7</A>.
 
 IV. The assurance he had of God's favour to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+2:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>.
 
 V. The warning and instruction he gives to others, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+2:8">ver. 8</A>.

 VI. The praise and glory of all given to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+2:9">ver. 9</A>.

 In the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+2:10">last verse</A>

 we have Jonah's deliverance out of the belly of the fish, and his
 coming safe and sound upon dry land again.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Then Jonah prayed unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> his God out of the fish's
 belly,
 &nbsp; 2 And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, <I>and</I> thou
 heardest my voice.
 &nbsp; 3 For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the
 seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy
 waves passed over me.
 &nbsp; 4 Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look
 again toward thy holy temple.
 &nbsp; 5 The waters compassed me about, <I>even</I> to the soul: the depth
 closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.
 &nbsp; 6 I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with
 her bars <I>was</I> about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my
 life from corruption, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> my God.
 &nbsp; 7 When my soul fainted within me I remembered the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and my
 prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple.
 &nbsp; 8 They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.
 &nbsp; 9 But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of
 thanksgiving; I will pay <I>that</I> that I have vowed. Salvation <I>is</I>
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God and his servant Jonah had parted in anger, and the quarrel began on 
 Jonah's side; he fled from his country that he might outrun his work; 
 but we hope to see them both together again, and the reconciliation 
 begins on God's side. In the close of the foregoing chapter we found 
 God returning to Jonah in a way of mercy, <I>delivering him from going 
 down to the pit,</I> having <I>found a ransom;</I> in this chapter we 
 find Jonah returning to God in a way of duty; he was called up in the 
 former chapter to pray to his God, but we are not told that he did so; 
 however, now at length he is brought to it. Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. When he prayed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>Then Jonah prayed;</I> then when he was in trouble, under the sense 
 of sin and the tokens of God's displeasure against him for sin, then he 
 prayed. Note, When we are in affliction we must pray; then we have 
 occasion to pray, then we have errands at the throne of grace and 
 business there; then, if ever, we shall have a disposition to pray, 
 when the heart is humbled, and softened, and made serious; then God 
 expects it (<I>in their affliction they will seek me early,</I> seek me 
 earnestly); and, though we bring our afflictions upon ourselves by our 
 sins, yet, if we pray in humility and godly sincerity, we shall be 
 welcome to the throne of grace, as Jonah was. Then when he was in a
 hopeful way of deliverance, being preserved alive by miracle, a plain 
 indication that he was reserved for further mercy, then he prayed. An 
 apprehension of God's good-will to us, notwithstanding our offences, 
 gives us boldness of access to him, and opens the lips in prayer which 
 were closed with the sense of guilt and dread of wrath.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Where he prayed--in <I>the fish's belly.</I> No place is amiss for
 prayer. <I>I will that men pray every where.</I> Wherever God casts us 
 we may find a way open to heaven-ward, if it be not our own fault. 
 <I>Undique ad c&oelig;los tantundem est vi&aelig;--The heavens are equally
 accessible from every part of the earth.</I> He that has Christ 
 dwelling in his heart by faith, wherever he goes carries the altar 
 along with him, that <I>sanctifies the gift,</I> and is himself a 
 <I>living temple.</I> Jonah was here in confinement; the belly of the 
 fish was his prison, was a close and dark dungeon to him; yet there he 
 had freedom of access to God, and walked at liberty in communion with 
 him. Men may shut us out from communion with one another, but not from 
 communion with God. Jonah was now in the bottom of the sea, yet <I>out 
 of the depths he cries to God;</I> as Paul and Silas prayed in the 
 prison, in the stocks.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. To whom he prayed--<I>to the Lord his God.</I> He had been fleeing
 from God, but now he sees the folly of it, and returns to him; by 
 prayer he draws near to that God whom he had gone aside from, and 
 <I>engages his heart to approach him.</I> In prayer he has an eye to 
 him, not only as <I>the Lord,</I> but as <I>his God,</I> a God in 
 covenant with him; for, thanks be to God, every transgression in the 
 covenant does not throw us out of covenant. This encourages even 
 backsliding children to return.
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:22">Jer. iii. 22</A>,

 <I>Behold, we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. What his prayer was. He afterwards recollected the substance of it, 
 and left it upon record. He reflects upon the workings of his heart 
 towards God when he was in his distress and danger, and the conflict 
 that was then in his breast between faith and sense, between hope and 
 fear.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He reflects upon the earnestness of his prayer, and God's readiness 
 to hear and answer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 He said, <I>I cried, by reason of my affliction, unto the Lord.</I> 
 Note, Many that prayed not at all, or did but whisper prayer, when they 
 were in prosperity, are brought to pray, nay, are brought to cry, <I>by 
 reason of their affliction;</I> and it is for this end that afflictions 
 are sent, and they are in vain if this end be not answered. Those 
 <I>heap up wrath</I> who <I>cry not when God binds them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:13">Job xxxvi. 13</A>.
 
 "<I>Out of the belly of hell</I> and the grave <I>cried I.</I>" The
 fish might well be called a grave, and, as it was a prison to which 
 Jonah was condemned for his disobedience and in which he lay under the 
 wrath of God, it might well be called the belly of hell. Thither this 
 good man was cast, and yet thence he cried to God, and it was not in 
 vain; God <I>heard him, heard the voice</I> of his affliction, the 
 voice of his supplication. There is a hell in the other world, out of 
 which there is no crying to God with any hope of being heard; but, 
 whatever hell we may be <I>in the belly of</I> in this world, we may 
 thence <I>cry to God.</I> When Christ lay, as Jonah, three days and 
 three nights in the grave, though he prayed not, as Jonah did, yet his 
 very lying there cried to God for poor sinners, and the cry was 
 heard.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He reflects upon the very deplorable condition that he was in when 
 he was in the belly of hell, which, when he lay there, he was very 
 sensible of and made particular remarks upon. Note, If we would get 
 good by our troubles, we must take notice of our troubles, and of the 
 hand of God in them. Jonah observes here, 
 
 (1.) How low he was thrown 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Thou hadst cast me into the deep.</I> The mariners cast him there; 
 but he looked above them, and saw the hand of God casting him there. 
 Whatever deeps we are cast into, it is God that casts us into them, and 
 he it is who, <I>after he has killed, has power to cast into hell.</I> 
 He was <I>cast into the midst of the seas--the heart of the seas</I> 
 (so the word is), and thence Christ borrows that Hebrew phrase, when he 
 applies it to his own lying so long in the <I>heart of the earth.</I> 
 For he that is laid dead in the grave, though it be ever so shallow, is 
 cut off as effectually from the land of the living as if he were laid 
 in the <I>heart of the earth.</I> 

 (2.) How terribly he was beset: <I>The floods compassed me about.</I> 
 The channels and springs of the waters of the sea surrounded him on 
 every side; it was always high-water with him. God's dear saints and 
 servants are sometimes encompassed with the floods of affliction, with 
 troubles that are very forcible and violent, that bear down on all 
 before them, and that run constantly upon them, as the waters of a 
 river in a continual succession, one trouble upon the neck of another, 
 as Job's messengers of evil tidings; they are enclosed by them on all 
 sides, as the church complains, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:7">Lam. iii. 7</A>.

 <I>He has hedged me about, that I cannot get out,</I> nor see which way
 I may flee for safety. <I>All thy billows and they waves passed over
 me.</I> Observe, He calls them God's billows and his waves, not only 
 because he made them (<I>the sea is his, and he made it</I>), and 
 because he <I>rules</I> them (for <I>even the winds and the seas obey 
 him</I>), but because he had now commissioned them against Jonah, and 
 limited them, and ordered them to afflict and terrify him, but not to 
 destroy him. These words are plainly quoted by Jonah from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:7">Ps. xlii. 7</A>,

 where, though the translations differ a little, in the original David's 
 complaint is the same <I>verbatim</I>--<I>word for word,</I> with this 
 of Jonah's: <I>All thy billows and thy waves passed over me.</I> What 
 David spoke figuratively and metaphorically Jonah applied to himself as 
 literally fulfilled. For the reconciling of ourselves to our 
 afflictions, it is good to search precedents, that we may find <I>there 
 has no temptation taken us but such as is common to men.</I> If ever 
 any man's case was singular, and not to be paralleled, surely Jonah's 
 was, and yet, to his great satisfaction, he finds even the man after 
 God's own heart making the same complaint of God's <I>waves and billows 
 going over him</I> that he has now occasion to make. When God 
 <I>performs the thing that is appointed for us</I> we shall find that 
 <I>many such things are with him,</I> that even our path of trouble is 
 no untrodden path, and that God deals with us no otherwise than as he 
 <I>uses to deal with those that love his name.</I> And therefore for 
 our assistance in our addresses to God, when we are in trouble, it is 
 good to make use of the complaints and prayers which the saints that 
 have been before us made use of in the like case. See how good it is to 
 be ready in the scriptures; Jonah, when he could make no use of his 
 Bible, by the help of his memory furnished himself from the scripture 
 with a very proper representation of his case: <I>All thy billows and 
 thy waves passed over me.</I> To the same purport,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>,

 <I>The waters compassed me about even to the soul;</I> they threatened 
 his life, which was hereby brought into imminent danger; or they made 
 an impression upon his spirit; he saw them to be tokens of God's 
 displeasure, and in them the <I>terrors of the Almighty set themselves 
 in array against him;</I> this reached to his soul, and put that into 
 confusion. And this also is borrowed from David's complaint, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:1">Ps. lxix. 1</A>.
 
 The <I>waters have come in unto my soul.</I> When <I>without are
 fightings</I> it is no marvel that <I>within are fears.</I> Jonah, in 
 the fish's belly, finds the <I>depths enclosing him round about,</I> so 
 that if he would get out of his prison, yet he must unavoidably perish 
 in the waters. He feels the <I>sea-weed</I> (which the fish sucked in 
 with the water) <I>wrapped about his head,</I> so that he has no way 
 left him to help himself, nor hope that any one else can help him.
 Thus are the people of God sometimes perplexed and entangled, that they 
 may learn not to <I>trust in themselves, but in God that raises the 
 dead,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:8,9">2 Cor. i. 8, 9</A>.
 
 (3.) How fast he was held

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 He <I>went down to the bottom of the mountains,</I> to the rocks in the
 sea, upon which the hills and promontories by the seaside seem to be 
 bottomed; he lay among them, nay, he lay under them; the <I>earth with 
 her bars was about him,</I> so close about him that it was likely to be 
 about him for ever. The earth was so shut and locked, so barred and 
 bolted, against him, that he was quite cut off from any hope of ever 
 returning to it. Thus helpless, thus hopeless, did Jonah's case seem to 
 be. Those whom God contends with the whole creation is at war with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He reflects upon the very black and melancholy conclusion he was 
 then ready to make concerning himself, and the relief he obtained 
 against it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+2:4,7">3<I>v.</I> 4, 7</A>.

 (1.) He began to sink into despair, and to give up himself for gone and 
 undone to all intents and purposes. When the <I>waters compassed him 
 about even to the soul</I> no marvel that <I>his soul fainted within 
 him,</I> fainted away, so that he had not any comfortable enjoyments or 
 expectations; his spirits quite failed, and he looked upon himself as a 
 dead man. <I>Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight,</I> and the 
 apprehension of that was the thing that made his spirit faint within 
 him. He thought God had quite forsaken him, would never return in mercy 
 to him, nor show him any token for good again. He had no example
 before him of any that were brought alive out of a fish's belly; if he 
 thought of Job upon the dunghill, Joseph in the pit, David in the cave, 
 yet these did not come up to his case. Nor was there any visible way of 
 escape open for him but by miracle; and what reason had he to expect 
 that a miracle of mercy should be wrought for him who was now made a 
 monument of justice? How own conscience told him that he had wickedly 
 <I>fled from the presence of the Lord,</I> and therefore he might 
 justly <I>cast him away from his presence,</I> and, in token of that, 
 <I>take away his Holy Spirit from him,</I> never to visit him more. 
 What hopes could he have of deliverance out of a trouble which his 
 <I>own ways and doings</I> had <I>procured to himself?</I> Observe, 
 When Jonah would say the worst he could of his case he says this, <I>I 
 am cast out of thy sight;</I> those, and those only, are miserable, 
 whom God has cast out of his sight, whom he will no longer own and 
 favour. What is the misery of the damned in hell but this, that they 
 are cast out of God's sight? For what is the happiness of heaven but 
 the vision and fruition of God? Sometimes the condition of God's people 
 may be such in this world that they may think themselves quite excluded 
 from God's presence, so as no more to see him, or to be regarded by 
 him. Jacob and Israel said, <I>My way is hidden from the Lord, and my 
 judgment is passed over from my God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:27">Isa. xl. 27</A>.

 <I>Zion said, The Lord has forsaken me, my God has forgotten me,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:14">Isa. xlix. 14</A>.

 But it is only the surmise of unbelief, for God has not <I>cast away
 his people whom he has chosen.</I>

 (2.) Yet he recovered himself from sinking into despair, with some 
 comfortable prospects of deliverance. Faith corrected and controlled
 the surmises of fear and distrust. Here was a fierce struggle between 
 sense and faith, but faith had the last word and came off a conqueror.
 In trying times, the issue will be good at last, providing our faith do 
 not fail; it was therefore the continuance of that in its vigour that 
 Christ secured to Peter. <I>I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail 
 not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:32">Luke xxii. 32</A>.

 David would have fainted if he had not <I>believed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:13">Ps. xxvii. 13</A>.
 
 Jonah's faith said, <I>Yet I will look again towards thy holy
 temple.</I> Thus, though he was <I>perplexed,</I> yet <I>not in 
 despair;</I> in the depth of the sea he had this hope in him, as an 
 <I>anchor of the soul, sure and stedfast.</I> That which he supports 
 himself with the hope of is that he shall yet <I>look again towards 
 God's holy temple.</I>

 [1.] That he shall live; he shall look again heaven-ward, shall again 
 see the light of the sun, though now he seems to be cast into utter 
 darkness. Thus <I>against hope he believed in hope.</I> 

 [2.] That he shall <I>live, and praise God;</I> and a good man does not 
 desire to live for any other purpose, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:175">Ps. cxix. 175</A>.

 That he shall enjoy communion with God again in holy ordinances, shall
 <I>look towards,</I> and go up to, <I>the holy temple,</I> there <I>to 
 enquire,</I> there to <I>behold the beauty of the Lord.</I> When 
 Hezekiah desired that he might be assured of his recovery, he asked, 
 <I>What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the Lord?</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+38:22">Isa. xxxviii. 22</A>),

 as if that were the only thing for the sake of which he wished for
 health; so Jonah here hopes he shall <I>look again towards the 
 temple;</I> that way he had looked many a time with pleasure, rejoicing 
 when he was called <I>to go up to the house of the Lord;</I> and the 
 remembrance of it was his comfort, that, when he had opportunity, he 
 was no stranger to the holy temple. But now he could not so much as
 look towards it; in the fish's belly he could not tell which way it 
 lay, but he hopes he shall be again able to look towards it, to look on 
 it, to look into it. Observe, How modestly Jonah expresses himself; as
 one conscious to himself of guilt and unworthiness, he dares not speak 
 of dwelling in God's house, as David, knowing that he is <I>no more 
 worthy to be called a son,</I> but he hopes that he may be admitted to 
 look towards it. He calls it the <I>holy temple,</I> for the holiness 
 of it was, in his eye, the beauty of it, and that for the sake of which 
 he loved and looked towards it. The temple was a type of heaven; and
 he promises himself that though being now a <I>captive exile,</I> he 
 should never be <I>loosed,</I> but <I>die in the pit,</I> yet he should 
 look towards the heavenly temple, and be brought safely thither. Though 
 he die in the fish's belly, in the bottom of the sea, yet thence he 
 hopes his soul shall be carried by angels into Abraham's bosom. Or 
 these words may be taken as Jonah's vow when he was in distress, and he 
 speaks

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 of paying what he vowed; his vow is that if God deliver him he will 
 praise him <I>in the gates of the daughter of Zion,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:13,14">Ps. ix. 13, 14</A>.
 
 His sin for which God pursued him was <I>fleeing from the presence of
 the Lord,</I> the folly of which he is now convinced of, and promises
 not only that he will never again look towards Tarshish, but that he
 will again look towards the temple, and will go <I>from strength to
 strength</I> till he appear before God there. And thus we see how faith
 and hope were his relief in his desponding condition. To these he added
 prayer to God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "<I>When my soul fainted within me,</I> then <I>I remembered</I> the
 Lord, I betook myself to that cordial." He remembered what he is, how 
 nigh to those that seem to be thrown at the greatest distance by 
 trouble, how merciful to those that seem to have thrown themselves at a 
 distance from him by sin. He remembered what he had done for him, what
 he had done for others, what he could do, what he had promised to do; 
 and this kept him from fainting. Remembering God, he made his addresses 
 to him: "<I>My prayer came in unto thee;</I> I sent it in, and expected 
 to receive an answer to it." Note, Our afflictions should put us in 
 mind of God, and thereby put us upon prayer to him. When our souls 
 faint we must remember God; and, when we remember God, we must send up 
 a prayer to him, a pious ejaculation at least; when we think on his 
 name we should call on his name.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He reflects upon the favour of God to him when thus in his distress 
 he sought to God and trusted him. 

 (1.) He graciously accepted his prayer, and gave admission and audience 
 to it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>My prayer,</I> being sent to him, <I>came in unto him,</I> even 
 <I>into his holy temple;</I> it was heard in the highest heavens, 
 though it was prayed in the lowest deeps. 

 (2.) He wonderfully wrought deliverance for him, and, when he was in 
 the depth of his misery, gave him the earnest and assurance of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O Lord my God!</I> 
 Some think he said this when he was vomited up on dry ground; and then 
 it is the language of thankfulness, and he sets it over-against the 
 great difficulty of his case, that the power of God might be the more 
 magnified in his deliverance: <I>The earth with her bars was about me 
 for ever,</I> and yet <I>thou hast brought up my life from the pit,</I> 
 from the <I>bars of the pit.</I> Or, rather, we may suppose it spoken 
 while he was yet in the fish's belly, and then it is the language of 
 his faith: "Thou hast kept me alive here, in the pit, and therefore 
 thou canst, thou wilt, <I>bring up my life from the pit;</I>" and he 
 speaks of it with as much assurance as if it were done already: <I>Thou 
 has brought up my life.</I> Though he has not an express promise of 
 deliverance, he has an earnest of it, and on that he depends: he has 
 life, and therefore believes his life shall be <I>brought up from 
 corruption;</I> and this assurance he addresses to God: <I>Thou has 
 done it, O Lord my God!</I> Thou art the Lord, and therefore 
 <I>canst</I> do it for me, my God, and therefore wilt do it. Note, If 
 the Lord be our God, he will be to us the <I>resurrection and the 
 life,</I> will redeem our lives from destruction, from the power of the 
 grave.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He gives warning to others, and instructs them to keep close to God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Those that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy,</I> that 
 is, 

 (1.) Those that worship other gods, as the heathen mariners did, and 
 call upon them, and expect relief and comfort from them, <I>forsake 
 their own mercy;</I> they stand in their own light; they turn their 
 back upon their own happiness, and go quite out of the way of all good.
 Note, Idols are <I>lying vanities,</I> and those that pay that homage 
 to them which is due to God only act as contrarily to their interests 
 as to their duty. Or, 

 (2.) Those that follow their own inventions, as Jonah himself had done 
 when he <I>fled from the presence of the Lord</I> to go to Tarshish, 
 <I>forsake their own mercy,</I> that mercy which they might find in 
 God, and might have such a covenant-right and title to it as to be able 
 to call it their own, if they would but keep close to God and their 
 duty. Those that think to go any where to be from under the eye of God, 
 as Jonah did--that think to better themselves by deserting his service, 
 as Jonah did--and that grudge his mercy to any poor sinners, and 
 pretend to be wiser than he in judging who are fit to have prophets 
 sent them and who are not, as Jonah did--they <I>observe lying 
 vanities,</I> are led away by foolish groundless fancies, and, like 
 him, they <I>forsake their own mercy,</I> and no good can come of it. 
 Note, Those that forsake their own duty forsake their own mercy; those 
 that run away from the work of their place and day run away from the 
 comfort of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. He solemnly binds his soul with a bond that, if God work deliverance 
 for him, the God of his mercies shall be the God of his praises, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 
 He covenants with God, 

 (1.) That he will honour him in his devotions with the <I>sacrifice of 
 thanksgiving;</I> and God has said, for the encouragement of those that 
 do so, that those that <I>offer praise glorify him.</I> He will, 
 according to the law of Moses, bring <I>a sacrifice of 
 thanksgiving,</I> and will offer that according to the law of nature, 
 with the <I>voice of thanksgiving.</I> The love and thankfulness of the 
 heart to God are the life and soul of this duty; without these neither 
 the sacrifice of thanksgiving nor the voice of thanksgiving will avail 
 any thing. But gratitude was then, by a divine appointment, to be 
 expressed by a sacrifice, in which the offerer presented the beast 
 slain to God, not in lieu of himself, but in token of himself; and it 
 is now to be expressed by the <I>voice of thanksgiving,</I> the 
 <I>calves of our lips</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:2">Hos. xiv. 2</A>),
 
 the <I>fruit of our lips</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:15">Heb. xiii. 15</A>),

 speaking forth, singing forth, the high praises of our God. This Jonah
 here promises, that with the sacrifice of thanksgiving he will 
 <I>mention the lovingkindness of the Lord,</I> to his glory, and the 
 encouragement of others.

 (2.) That he will honour him in his conversation by a punctual 
 performance of his vows, which he made in the fish's belly. Some think 
 it was some work of charity that he vowed, or such a vow as Jacob's 
 was, <I>Of all that thou hast given me I will give the tenth unto 
 thee.</I> More probably his vow was that if God would deliver him he 
 would readily go wherever he should please to send him, though it were 
 to Nineveh. When we smart for deserting our duty it is time to promise 
 that we will adhere to it, and abound in it. Or, perhaps, the sacrifice 
 of thanksgiving is the thing he vowed, and that is it which he will 
 pay, as David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:17-19">Ps. cxvi. 17-19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. He concludes with an acknowledgment of God as the Saviour of his
 people: <I>Salvation is of the Lord;</I> it <I>belongs to the Lord,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+3:8">Ps. iii. 8</A>.

 He is the <I>God of salvation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:19,20">Ps. lxviii. 19, 20</A>.

 He only can work salvation, and he can do it be the danger and distress
 ever so great; he has promised salvation to his people that trust in
 him. All the salvations of his church in general, and of particular
 saints, were wrought by him; he is the <I>Saviour of those that
 believe,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:10">1 Tim. iv. 10</A>.

 Salvation is still of him, as it has always been; from him alone it is
 to be expected, and on him we are to depend for it. Jonah's experience 
 shall encourage others, in all ages, to trust in God as the God of 
 their salvation; all that read this story shall say with assurance, say 
 with admiration, that <I>salvation is of the Lord,</I> and is sure to 
 all that belongs to him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah
 upon the dry <I>land.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Jonah's discharge from his imprisonment, and his 
 deliverance from that death which there he was threatened with--his
 return, though not to life, for he lived in the fish's belly, yet to 
 the <I>land of the living,</I> for from that he seemed to be quite cut 
 off--his resurrection, though not from death, yet from the grave, for
 surely never man was so buried alive as Jonah was in the fish's belly. 
 His enlargement may be considered, 

 1. As an instance of God's power over all the creatures. God <I>spoke 
 to the fish,</I> gave him orders to return him, as before he had given 
 him orders to receive him. God speaks to other creatures, and <I>it is 
 done;</I> they are all his ready obedient servants. But to man he 
 <I>speaks once, yea, twice, and he perceives it not,</I> regards it 
 not, but turns a deaf ear to what he says. Note, God has all creatures 
 at his command, makes what use he pleases of them, and serves his own 
 purposes by them. 

 2. As an instance of God's mercy to a poor penitent, that in his
 distress prays to him. Jonah had sinned, and had done foolishly, very
 foolishly; his own backslidings did not correct him, and it appears by 
 his after-conduct that his foolishness was not quite driven from him, 
 no, not by the rod of this correction; and yet, upon his praying, and 
 humbling himself before God, here is a miracle in nature wrought for 
 his deliverance, to intimate what a miracle of grace, free grace, God's 
 reception and entertainment of returning sinners are. When God had him 
 at his mercy he showed him mercy, and did not <I>contend for ever.</I> 
 
 3. As a type and figure of Christ's resurrection. He died and was
 buried, to lay in the grave, as Jonah did, three days and three nights, 
 a prisoner for our debt; but the third day he came forth, as Jonah did, 
 by his messengers to preach repentance, and remission of sins, even to 
 the Gentiles. And thus was another scripture fulfilled, <I>After two 
 days he will receive us, and the third day he will raise us up,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:2">Hos. vi. 2</A>.

 The earth trembled as if full of her burden, as the fish was of
 Jonah.</P>
