 book of Jonah, though it be placed here in the midst of the prophetical 
 books of scripture, is yet rather a history than a prophecy; one line 
 of prediction there is in it, <I>Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be 
 overthrown;</I> the rest of the book is a narrative of the preface to 
 and the consequences of that prediction. In the midst of the obscure 
 prophecies before and after this book, wherein are many things dark and 
 hard to be understood, which are puzzling to the learned, and are 
 <I>strong meat for strong men,</I> comes in this plain and pleasant 
 story, which is entertaining to the weakest, and <I>milk for babes.</I> 
 Probably Jonah was himself the penman of this book, and he, as Moses 
 and other inspired penmen, records his own faults, which is an evidence 
 that in these writings they designed God's glory and not their own. We 
 read of this same Jonah

 where we find that he was of Gath-hepher in Galilee, a city that
 belonged to the tribe of Zebulun, in a remote corner of the land of 
 Israel; for the Spirit, which like the wind, <I>blows where it 
 listeth,</I> will as easily find out Jonah in Galilee as Isaiah at 
 Jerusalem. We find also that he was a messenger of mercy to Israel in 
 the reign of Jeroboam the second; for the success of his arms, in the 
 <I>restoring of the coast of Israel,</I> is said to be <I>according to 
 the word of the Lord which he spoke by the hand of his servant Jonah 
 the prophet.</I> Those prophecies were not committed to writing, but 
 this against Nineveh was, chiefly for the sake of the story that 
 depends upon it, and that is recorded chiefly for the sake of Christ, 
 of whom Jonah was a type; it contains also very remarkable instances of 
 human infirmity in Jonah, and of God's mercy both in pardoning 
 repenting sinners, witness Nineveh, and in bearing with repining 
 saints, witness Jonah.</P>
