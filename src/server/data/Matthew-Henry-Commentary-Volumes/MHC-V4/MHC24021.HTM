 It is plain that the prophecies of this book are not placed here in the 
 same order in which they were preached; for there are chapters after 
 this which concern Jehoahaz, Jehoiakim, and Jeconiah, who all reigned 
 before Zedekiah, in whose reign the prophecy of this chapter bears 
 date. Here is, 

 I. The message which Zedekiah sent to the prophet, to desire him to
 enquire of the Lord for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+21:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. The answer which Jeremiah, in God's name, sent to that message, in
 which, 

 1. He foretels the certain and inevitable ruin of the city, and the
 fruitlessness of their attempts for its preservation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+21:3-7">ver. 3-7</A>.

 2. He advises the people to make the best of bad, by going over to the
 king of Babylon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+21:8-10">ver. 8-10</A>.

 3. He advises the king and his family to repent and reform 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+21:11,12">ver. 11, 12</A>),

 and not to trust to the strength of their city and grow secure, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+21:13,14">ver. 13, 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The word which came unto Jeremiah from the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, when king
 Zedekiah sent unto him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah
 the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Enquire, I pray thee, of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> for us; for Nebuchadrezzar
 king of Babylon maketh war against us; if so be that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he
 may go up from us.
 &nbsp; 3  Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah:
 &nbsp; 4  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel; Behold, I will turn back
 the weapons of war that <I>are</I> in your hands, wherewith ye fight
 against the king of Babylon, and <I>against</I> the Chaldeans, which
 besiege you without the walls, and I will assemble them into the
 midst of this city.
 &nbsp; 5  And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand
 and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great
 wrath.
 &nbsp; 6  And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and
 beast: they shall die of a great pestilence.
 &nbsp; 7  And afterward, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, I will deliver Zedekiah king
 of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and such as are left
 in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the
 famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into
 the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek
 their life: and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword;
 he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A very humble decent message which king Zedekiah, when he was in 
 distress, sent to Jeremiah the prophet. It is indeed charged upon this 
 Zedekiah that he <I>humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet, 
 speaking from the mouth of the Lord</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:12">2 Chron. xxxvi. 12</A>);

 he did not always humble himself as he did sometimes; he never humbled
 himself till necessity forced him to it; he humbled himself so far as 
 to desire the prophet's assistance, but not so far as to take his 
 advice, or to be ruled by him. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The distress which king Zedekiah was now in: <I>Nebuchadrezzar made
 war upon him,</I> not only invaded the land, but besieged the city, and 
 had now actually invested it. Note, Those that put the evil day far 
 from them will be the more terrified when it comes upon them; and those 
 who before slighted God's ministers may then perhaps be glad to court 
 an acquaintance with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The messengers he sent--<I>Pashur and Zephaniah,</I> one belonging to
 the fifth course of the priests, the other to the twenty-fourth, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+24:9,18">1 Chron. xxiv. 9, 18</A>.

 It was well that he sent, and that he sent persons of rank; but it
 would have been better if he had desired a personal conference with the 
 prophet, which no doubt he might easily have had if he would so far 
 have humbled himself. Perhaps these priests were no better than the 
 rest, and yet, when they were commanded by the king, they must carry a 
 respectful message to the prophet, which was both a mortification to 
 them and an honour to Jeremiah. He had rashly said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+20:18"><I>ch.</I> xx. 18</A>),

 <I>My days are consumed with shame;</I> and yet here we find that he
 lived to see better days than those were when he made that complaint; 
 now he appears in reputation. Note, It is folly to say, when things are 
 bad with us, "They will always be so." It is possible that those who 
 are despised may come to be respected; and it is promised that those 
 who <I>honour God he will honour,</I> and that those who have 
 <I>afflicted his people shall bow to them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:14">Isa. lx. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The message itself: <I>Enquire, I pray thee, of the Lord for us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+21:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Now that the Chaldean army had got into their borders, into their 
 bowels, they were at length convinced that Jeremiah was a true prophet, 
 though loth to own it and brought too late to it. Under this conviction 
 they desire him to stand their friend with God, believing him to have 
 that interest in heaven which none of their other prophets had, who had 
 flattered them with hopes of peace. They now employ Jeremiah,

 (1.) To consult the mind of God for them: "<I>Enquire of the Lord for 
 us;</I> ask him what course we shall take in our present strait, for 
 the measures we have hitherto taken are all broken." Note, Those that 
 will not take the direction of God's grace how to get clear of their 
 sins would yet be glad of the directions of his providence how to get 
 clear of their troubles. 

 (2.) To seek the favour of God for them (so some read it): "<I>Entreat
 the Lord for us;</I> be an intercessor for us with God." Note, Those 
 that slight the prayers of God's people and ministers when they are in 
 prosperity may perhaps be glad of an interest in them when they come to 
 be in distress. <I>Give us of your oil.</I> The benefit they promise 
 themselves is, <I>It may be the Lord will deal with us</I> now 
 <I>according to the wondrous works he wrought for our fathers,</I> that 
 the enemy may raise the siege and <I>go up from us.</I> Observe,

 [1.] All their care is to get rid of their trouble, not to make their 
 peace with God and be reconciled to him--"That our enemy may <I>go up 
 from us,</I>" not, "That our God may return to us." Thus Pharaoh 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:17">Exod. x. 17</A>):

 <I>Entreat the Lord that he may take away this death.</I>

 [2.] All their hope is that God had done wondrous works formerly in the 
 deliverance of Jerusalem when Sennacherib besieged it, at the prayer of 
 Isaiah (so we are told, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:20,21">2 Chron. xxxii. 20, 21</A>),

 and who can tell but he may destroy these besiegers (as he did those)
 at the prayer of Jeremiah? But they did not consider how different the
 character of Zedekiah and his people was from that of Hezekiah and his 
 people: those were days of general reformation and piety, these of 
 general corruption and apostasy. Jerusalem is now the reverse of what 
 it was then. Note, It is folly to think that God should do for us while 
 we hold fast our iniquity as he did for those that held fast their 
 integrity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A very startling cutting reply which God, by the prophet, sent to 
 that message. If Jeremiah had been to have answered the message of 
 himself we have reason to think that he would have returned a 
 comfortable answer, in hope that their sending such a message was an 
 indication of some good purposes in them, which he would be glad to 
 make the best of, for he did not desire the woeful day. But God knows 
 their hearts better than Jeremiah does, and sends them an answer which 
 has scarcely one word of comfort in it. He sends it to them in the name 
 of <I>the Lord God of Israel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+21:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 to intimate to them that though God allowed himself to be called the 
 <I>God of Israel,</I> and had done great things for Israel formerly, 
 and had still great things in store for Israel, pursuant to his 
 covenants with them, yet this should stand the present generation in no 
 stead, who were Israelites in name only, and not in deed, any more than 
 God's dealings with them should cut off his relation to Israel as their 
 God. It is here foretold,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That God will render all their endeavours for their own security 
 fruitless and ineffectual 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+21:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "I will be so far from teaching your hands to war, and putting an edge 
 upon your swords, that I will <I>turn back the weapons of war that are 
 in your hand,</I> when you sally out upon the besiegers to beat them 
 off, so that they shall not give the stroke you design; nay, they shall 
 recoil into your own faces, and be turned upon yourselves." Nothing can 
 make for those who have God against them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That the besiegers shall in a little time make themselves masters of 
 Jerusalem, and of all its wealth and strength: <I>I will assemble</I> 
 those <I>in the midst of this city</I> who are now surrounding it. 
 Note, If that place which should have been a centre of devotion be made 
 a centre of wickedness, it is not strange if God make it a rendezvous 
 of destroyers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That God himself will be their enemy; and then I know not who can 
 befriend them, no, not Jeremiah himself
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+21:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "I will be so far from protecting you, as I have done formerly in a 
 like case, that <I>I myself will fight against you.</I>" Note, Those 
 who rebel against God may justly expect that he will make war upon 
 them, and that, 

 (1.) With the power of a God who is irresistibly victorious: <I>I will 
 fight against you with an outstretched hand,</I> which will reach far, 
 and <I>with a strong arm,</I> which will strike home and wound deeply. 
 
 (2.) With the displeasure of a God who is indisputably righteous. It is 
 not a correction in love, but an execution <I>in anger, in fury, and in 
 great wrath;</I> it is upon a sentence sworn in wrath, against which 
 there will lie no exception, and it will soon be found what a fearful 
 thing it is to fall into the hands of the living God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That those who, for their own safety, decline sallying out upon the 
 besiegers, and so avoid their sword, shall yet not escape the sword of 
 God's justice 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+21:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>I will smite those that abide in the city</I> (so it may be read), 
 <I>both man and beast,</I> both the beasts that are for food and those 
 that are for service in war, foot and horse; <I>they shall, die of a 
 great pestilence,</I> which shall rage within the walls, while the 
 enemies are encamped about them. Though Jerusalem's gates and walls may 
 for a time keep out the Chaldeans, they cannot keep out God's 
 judgments. His arrows of pestilence can reach those that think 
 themselves safe from other arrows.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. That the king himself, and people that escape the <I>sword, 
 famine,</I> and <I>pestilence,</I> shall fall <I>into the hands</I> of 
 the Chaldeans, who shall cut them off in cold blood 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+21:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 They <I>shall not spare them,</I> nor <I>have pity</I> on them. Let not 
 those expect to find mercy with men who have forfeited God's 
 compassions, and shut themselves out from his mercy. Thus had the 
 decree gone forth; and then to what purpose was it for Jeremiah to 
 <I>enquire of the Lord for them?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 By the civil message which the king sent to Jeremiah it appeared that 
 both he and the people began to have a respect for him, which it would 
 have been Jeremiah's policy to make some advantage of for himself; but 
 the reply which God obliges him to make is enough to crush the little 
 respect they begin to have for him, and to exasperate them against him 
 more than ever. Not only the predictions in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+21:1-7">foregoing verses</A>,

 but the prescriptions in these, were provoking; for here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He advises the people to surrender and desert to the Chaldeans, as
 the only means left them to save their lives,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+21:8-10"><I>v.</I> 8-10</A>.

 This counsel was very displeasing to those who were flattered by their 
 false prophets into a desperate resolution to hold out to the last 
 extremity, trusting to the strength of their walls and the courage of 
 their soldiery to keep out the enemy, or to their foreign aids to raise 
 the siege. The prophet assures them, "<I>The city shall be given into 
 the hand of the king of Babylon,</I> and he shall not only plunder it, 
 but <I>burn it with fire,</I> for God himself hath <I>set his face 
 against this city for evil and not for good,</I> to lay it waste and 
 not to protect it, <I>for evil</I> which shall have no good mixed with 
 it, no mitigation or merciful allay; and therefore, if you would make 
 the best of bad, you must beg quarter of the Chaldeans, and surrender 
 prisoners of war." In vain did Rabshakeh persuade the Jews to do this 
 while they had God for them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+36:16">Isa. xxxvi. 16</A>),

 but it was the best course they could take now that God was against
 them. Both the law and the prophets had often set before them life and 
 death in another sense--life if they obey the voice of God, death if 
 they persist in disobedience, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:19">Deut. xxx. 19</A>.

 But they had slighted that life which would have made them truly happy,
 to upbraid them with which the prophet here uses the same expression

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+21:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death,</I> 
 which denotes not, as that, a fair proposal, but a melancholy dilemma, 
 advising them of two evils to choose the less; and that less evil, a 
 shameful and wretched captivity, is all the life now left for them to 
 propose to themselves. <I>He that abides in the city,</I> and trusts to 
 that to secure him, shall certainly die either by <I>the sword</I> 
 without the walls or <I>famine</I> or <I>pestilence</I> within. But he 
 that can so far bring down his spirit, and quit his vain hopes, as to 
 go out, and fall <I>to the Chaldeans, his life shall be given him for a 
 prey;</I> he shall save his life, but with much difficulty and hazard, 
 as a prey is taken from the mighty. It is an expression like that, 
 <I>He shall be saved, yet so as by fire.</I> He shall escape but very 
 narrowly, or he shall have such surprising joy and satisfaction in 
 escaping with his life from such a universal destruction as shall equal 
 theirs that divide the spoil. They thought to make a prey of the camp 
 of the Chaldeans, as their ancestors did that of the Assyrians 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:23">Isa. xxxiii. 23</A>),

 but they will be sadly disappointed; if by yielding at discretion they
 can but save their lives, that is all the prey they must promise 
 themselves. Now one would think this advice from a prophet, in God's 
 name, should have gained some credit with them and been universally 
 followed; but, for aught that appears, there were few or none that took 
 it; so wretchedly were their hearts hardened, to their destruction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He advises the king and princes to reform, and make conscience of 
 the duty of their place. Because it was the king that sent the message 
 to him, in the reply there shall be a particular word for <I>the house 
 of the king,</I> not to compliment or court them (that was no part of 
 the prophet's business, no, not when they did him the honour to send to 
 him), but to give them wholesome counsel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+21:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>):

 "<I>Execute judgment in the morning;</I> do it carefully and 
 diligently. Those magistrates that would fill up their place with duty 
 had need rise betimes. Do it quickly, and do not delay to do justice 
 upon appeals made to you, and tire out poor petitioners as you have 
 done. Do not lie in your beds in a morning to sleep away the debauch of 
 the night before, nor spend the morning in pampering the body (as those 
 princes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:16">Eccl. x. 16</A>),

 but spend it in the despatch of business. You would be delivered out of
 the hand of those that distress you, and expect that therein God should 
 do you justice; see then that you do justice to those that apply to 
 you, and <I>deliver them out of the hand of their oppressors, lest my 
 fury go out like fire</I> against you in a particular manner, and you 
 fare worst who think to escape best, <I>because of the evil of your 
 doings.</I>" Now,

 1. This intimates that it was their neglect to do their duty that
 brought all this desolation upon the people. It was the <I>evil of 
 their doings</I> that kindled the fire of God's wrath. Thus plainly 
 does he deal even with the <I>house of the king;</I> for those that 
 would have the benefit of a prophet's prayers must thankfully take a 
 prophet's reproofs. 

 2. This directs them to take the right method for a national 
 reformation. The princes must begin, and set a good example, and then 
 the people will be invited to reform. They must use their power for the 
 punishment of wrong, and then the people will be obliged to reform. He 
 reminds them that they are <I>the house of David,</I> and therefore 
 should tread in his steps, who executed judgment and justice to his 
 people. 

 3. This gives them some encouragement to hope that there may yet be a
 lengthening of their tranquillity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:27">Dan. iv. 27</A>.

 If any thing will recover their state from the brink of ruin, this
 will.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He shows them the vanity of all their hopes so long as they 
 continued unreformed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+21:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 Jerusalem is an <I>inhabitant of the valley,</I> guarded with mountains 
 on all sides, which were their natural fortifications, making it 
 difficult for an army to approach them. It is a <I>rock of the 
 plain,</I> which made it difficult for an enemy to undermine them. 
 These advantages of their situation they trusted to more than to the 
 power and promise of God; and, thinking their city by these means to be 
 impregnable, they set the judgments of God at defiance, saying, "<I>Who 
 shall come down against us?</I> None of our neighbours dare make a 
 descent upon us, or, if they do, <I>who shall enter into our 
 habitations?</I>" They had some colour for this confidence; for it 
 appears to have been the sense of all their neighbours that no enemy 
 could force his way into Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:12">Lam. iv. 12</A>.

 But those are least safe that are most secure. God soon shows the
 vanity of that challenge, <I>Who shall come down against us?</I> when 
 he says

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+21:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 <I>Behold, I am against thee.</I> They had indeed by the wickedness 
 driven God out of their city when he would have tarried with them as a 
 friend; but they could not by their bulwarks keep them out of their 
 city when he came against them as an enemy. If God be for us, who can 
 be against us? But, if he be against us, who can be for us, to stand
 us in any stead? Nay, he comes against them not as an enemy that may
 lawfully and with some hope of success be resisted, but as a judge that 
 cannot be resisted; for he says 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+21:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 <I>I will punish you,</I> by due course of law, <I>according to the 
 fruit of your doings,</I> that is, according to the merit of them and 
 the direct tendency of them. That shall be brought upon you which is
 the natural product of sin. Nay, he will not only come with the anger
 of an enemy and the justice of a judge, but with the force of a 
 consuming fire, which has no compassion, as a judge sometimes has, nor 
 spares any thing combustible that comes in its way. Jerusalem has
 become a forest, in which God will <I>kindle a fire</I> that shall 
 consume all before it; for our God is himself <I>a consuming fire;</I> 
 and <I>who is able to stand in his sight</I> when once he is angry?</P>
