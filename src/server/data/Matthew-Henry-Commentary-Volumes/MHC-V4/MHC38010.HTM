 The scope of this chapter is much the same with that of the foregoing 
 chapter--to encourage the Jews that had returned with hopes that though
 they had been under divine rebukes for their negligence in rebuilding 
 the temple, and were now surrounded with enemies and dangers, yet God 
 would do them good, and make them prosperous at home and victorious 
 abroad. Now, 

 I. They are here directed to eye the great God in all events that
 concerned them, and, both in the evils they suffered and in the 
 comforts they desired, to acknowledge his hand, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+10:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. They are encouraged to expect strength and success from him in all
 their struggles with the enemies of their church and state, and to hope 
 that the issue would be glorious at last,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Ask ye of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> rain in the time of the latter rain; <I>so</I>
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain,
 to every one grass in the field.
 &nbsp; 2 For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen
 a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain:
 therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled,
 because <I>there was</I> no shepherd.
 &nbsp; 3 Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished
 the goats: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts hath visited his flock the house
 of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle.
 &nbsp; 4 Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of
 him the battle bow, out of him every oppressor together.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Gracious things and glorious ones, very glorious and very gracious, 
 were promised to this poor afflicted people in the foregoing chapter; 
 now here God intimates to them that he will <I>for these things be 
 enquired of</I> by them, and that he expects they should acknowledge 
 him in all their ways and in all his ways towards them--and not idols
 that were rivals with him for their respects.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The prophet directs them to apply to God by prayer for rain in the 
 season thereof. He had promised, in the close of the foregoing chapter, 
 that there should be great plenty of corn and wine, whereas for several 
 years, by reason of unseasonable weather, there had been great scarcity 
 of both; but the earth will not yield its fruits unless the heavens 
 water it, and therefore they must look up to God for the <I>dew of 
 heaven,</I> in order to the fatness and fruitfulness of the earth 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+10:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 "<I>Ask you of the Lord rain.</I> Do not pray to the clouds, nor to the 
 stars, for rain, but <I>to the Lord;</I> for he it is that <I>hears the 
 heavens,</I> when they <I>hear the earth,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:21">Hos. ii. 21</A>.

 Seasonable rain is a great mercy, which we must <I>ask of God, rain in
 the time of the latter rain,</I> when there is most need of it. The 
 former rain fell at the seed-time, in autumn, the latter fell in the 
 spring, between March and May, which brought the corn to an ear and 
 filled it. If either of these rains failed, it was very bad with that
 land; for from the end of May to September they never had any rain at 
 all. Jerome, who lived in Judea, says that he never saw any rain there
 in June or July. They are directed to ask for it <I>in the time</I> 
 when it used to come. Note, We must, in our prayers, dutifully attend 
 the course of Providence; we must ask for mercies in their proper time, 
 and not expect that God should go out of his usual way and method for 
 us. But, since sometimes God denied rain in the usual time as a token
 of his displeasure, they must pray for it then as a token of his 
 favour, and they shall not pray in vain. <I>Ask and it shall be given 
 you. So the Lord shall make bright clouds</I> (which, though they are 
 without rain themselves, are yet presages of rain)--<I>lightnings</I> 
 (so the margin reads it), for <I>he maketh lightnings for the rain.</I> 
 He will <I>give them showers of rain</I> in great abundance, and so 
 give to <I>every one grass in the field;</I> for God is universally 
 good, and <I>makes his rain to fall upon the just and the 
 unjust.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He shows them the folly of making their addresses to idols as their 
 fathers had done 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+10:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>The idols have spoken vanity;</I> the teraphim, which they courted 
 and consulted in their distress, were so far from being able to command 
 rain for them that they could not so much as tell them when they should 
 have rain. They pretended to promise them rain at such a time, but it 
 did not come. <I>The diviners,</I> who were the prophets of those 
 idols, <I>have seen a lie</I> (their visions were all a cheat and a 
 sham); and <I>they have told false dreams,</I> such as the event did 
 not answer, which proved that they were not from God. Thus they 
 <I>comforted in vain</I> those that consulted the lying oracles; all 
 the <I>vanities of the heathen</I> put together could not <I>give 
 rain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:22">Jer. xiv. 22</A>.

 Yet this was not the worst of it; they not only got nothing by the
 false gods, but they lost the favour of the true God, for <I>therefore 
 they went their way</I> into captivity <I>as a flock</I> driven into 
 the fold, and <I>they were troubled</I> with one vexation after 
 another, as scattered sheep are, <I>because there was no shepherd,</I> 
 no prince to rule them, no priest to intercede for them, none to take 
 care of them and keep them together. Those that wandered after strange 
 gods were made to wander, into strange nations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He shows them the hand of God in all the events that concerned 
 them, both those that made against them and those that made for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+10:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 Let them consider, 

 1. When every thing went cross it was God that walked contrary to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+10:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>My anger was kindled against the shepherds</I> that should have fed 
 the flock, but neglected it, and starved it. I was displeased at the 
 wicked magistrates and ministers, the idol-shepherds." The captivity in 
 Babylon was a token of God's anger against them; in it likewise he 
 <I>punished the goats,</I> those of the flock that were filthy and 
 mischievous; they were set on the left hand, to go away into 
 punishment. Though the body of the nation suffered in the captivity, 
 yet it was only the goats and the shepherds that God was angry with, 
 and that he punished; the same affliction to others came from the love 
 of God, and was but a fatherly chastisement, which to them came from 
 his wrath, and was a judicial punishment. 

 2. When things began to change for the better it was God that gave
 them the happy turn. "He has now <I>visited his flock</I> with favour, 
 to enquire after them, and provides what he finds proper for them, and 
 he has made them <I>as his goodly horse in the battle,</I> has 
 beautified them, taken care of them, managed and made use of them, as a 
 man does the horse he rides on, has made them valuable in themselves 
 and formidable to those about them, <I>as his goodly horse.</I>" It is 
 God that makes us what we are, and it is with us as he appoints.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He shows them that every creature is to them what God makes it to 
 be 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+10:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nails.</I> 

 1. All the power that was engaged against them was from God. <I>Out of
 him</I> came all the combined force of their enemies; every 
 <I>oppressor together</I> (and the oppressors of Israel were not a few) 
 did but what his hand and his counsel determined before to be done; nor 
 could they have had such power against them unless it had been given 
 them from above.

 2. All the power likewise that was engaged for them was derived from
 him and depended on him. Out of him came forth <I>the corner-stone</I> 
 of the building, the power of magistrates, which keeps the several 
 parts of the state together. Princes are often called the <I>corners of 
 the people,</I> as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:38">1 Sam. xiv. 38</A>,

 marg. Out of him came forth <I>the nail</I> that fixed the state, the
 <I>nail in the sure place</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:23">Isa. xxii. 23</A>),
 
 the <I>nail in his holy place,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+9:8">Ezra ix. 8</A>.
 
 Out of him came forth <I>the battle-bow,</I> the military power, and
 out of him <I>every oppressor,</I> or exactor, that had the civil power 
 in his hand; and therefore to God, the fountain of power, we must 
 always have an eye, and see every man's judgment proceeding from 
 him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5 And they shall be as mighty <I>men,</I> which tread down <I>their
 enemies</I> in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall
 fight, because the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> with them, and the riders on horses
 shall be confounded.
 &nbsp; 6 And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the
 house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them; for I
 have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast
 them off: for I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> their God, and will hear them.
 &nbsp; 7 And <I>they of</I> Ephraim shall be like a mighty <I>man,</I> and their

 &nbsp; 8 I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed
 them: and they shall increase as they have increased.
 &nbsp; 9 And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember
 me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and
 turn again.
 &nbsp; 10 I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and
 gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land
 of Gilead and Lebanon; and <I>place</I> shall not be found for them.
 &nbsp; 11 And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall
 smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall
 dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the
 sceptre of Egypt shall depart away.
 &nbsp; 12 And I will strengthen them in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and they shall walk
 up and down in his name, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here are divers precious promises made to the people of God, which look 
 further than to the state of the Jews in the latter days of their 
 church, and have certain reference to the spiritual Israel of God, the 
 gospel-church, and all true believers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They shall have God's favour and presence, and shall be owned and 
 accepted of him. This is the foundation of all the rest: <I>The Lord is 
 with them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+10:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 He espouses their cause, takes their part, is on their side; and, if he 
 be for them, who can be against them? Again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+10:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 <I>I have mercy upon them.</I> All their dignity and joy are owing 
 purely to God's mercy; and mercy, as it supposes misery, so it excludes 
 merit. They had been cast off, the effect of which could not but be 
 misery; they had been justly cast off, and therefore could pretend to 
 merit nothing at God's hand but wrath and the curse; yet it is 
 promised, <I>They shall be as though I had not cast them off.</I> The 
 transgressions of their fathers, for which they had been rejected, 
 shall not only not be visited upon them, but shall not be so much as 
 remembered against them. God will be as perfectly reconciled to them
 as if he had never contended with them, and the falling out of these 
 lovers shall rather be the renewing than the weakening of love. They 
 shall have such a full assurance of God's being reconciled to them, and 
 upon that shall be so well reconciled to themselves, that they shall be 
 as easy as if they had never been cast off; and their condition, after 
 their restoration to the divine favour, shall be so very happy that 
 there shall not remain the least scar from the wounds which were given 
 them by their being cast off. Such favour does God show to returning 
 repenting sinners, who were by nature at a distance, and children of 
 wrath; such fellowship are they admitted into, and such freedom does he 
 use with them, that they are <I>as though they had never been cast 
 off.</I> 

 1. The covenant they are admitted into is the same that ever it was:
 <I>I am the Lord their God,</I> according to the original contract, the 
 covenant made with their fathers. 

 2. The communion they are admitted into is the same that ever it was:
 <I>I will hear them.</I> They shall be as welcome as ever to speak to 
 him, and as sure as ever to receive from him an answer of peace; for, 
 as he never did, so he never will, say to Jacob's seed, <I>Seek you me 
 in vain.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They shall be victorious over their enemies, that would draw them 
 from either their duty to God or their comfort in God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+10:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>They shall be as mighty men,</I> that are both strong in body and 
 bold in spirit, men of vigour, men of valour, effective men. <I>Those 
 of Ephraim,</I> as well as those of Judah, shall be <I>like a mighty 
 man</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+10:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 that dares to go about a difficult enterprise and is able to go through 
 with it. They shall, as mighty men, <I>tread down their enemies in the 
 battle,</I> as the dirt that is thrown out of the houses is trodden 
 with other dirt <I>in the mire of the streets.</I> And <I>they 
 shall</I> therefore <I>fight, because the Lord is with them.</I> Some 
 would argue that they may <I>therefore</I> sit still, and do nothing, 
 because the Lord is with them, who can and will do all. No; God's
 gracious presence with us to help us must not supersede, but quicken 
 and animate, our endeavours to help ourselves; and we must therefore 
 <I>work out our salvation with fear and trembling,</I> because <I>it is 
 God that works in us both to will and to do.</I> They shall fight with 
 readiness and resolution because, if God be with them, they are sure to 
 be conquerors, more than conquerors. For then <I>the riders on horses 
 shall be confounded.</I> The cavalry of the enemies shall be routed, 
 and put into disorder, by the infantry of the Jews. The preachers of
 the gospel of Christ went forth to war a good warfare; they charged 
 bravely, because God was with them; and the <I>riders on horses</I> 
 that opposed them <I>were confounded,</I> for God chose the <I>weak</I> 
 and <I>foolish things of the world to confound the wise and mighty.</I> 
 But whence have they all this might? How come they to be so able, so 
 active? It is in the Lord, and in the power of his might, that they are 
 so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+10:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>I will strengthen the house of Judah,</I> and <I>so I will save the 
 house of Joseph.</I> Note, God saves us by strengthening us, and works 
 out our happiness by working in us to do our duty. And thus we are 
 engaged to the utmost diligence in using the strength God gives us; and 
 yet, when all is done, God must have the glory of all. God is our
 strength, and so becomes both our song and our salvation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Those of them that are dispersed shall be gathered together into 
 one body 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+10:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>I will bring them again to place them,</I> bring them from other 
 lands to place them in their own land. This was a token of their being 
 perfectly restored to all their other ancient privileges--they shall be 
 restored to the possession of their own land. This was fulfilled when
 the <I>children of God that were scattered abroad</I> were by faith in 
 Christ incorporated in the gospel-church, and Jews and Gentiles became 
 <I>one fold,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:16">John x. 16</A>.
 
 In order to this

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+10:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>)

 <I>I will hiss for them,</I> or, rather, <I>whistle</I> for them, as 
 the shepherd with his pipe calls his sheep together, that <I>know his 
 voice;</I> and so <I>I will gather them.</I> The preaching of the 
 gospel was, as it were, God's hissing for souls to come to Jesus 
 Christ, his calling in his scattered sheep to the green pastures. <I>I 
 will gather them, for I have redeemed them.</I> Note, Those whom Christ 
 has redeemed by his blood God will gather by his grace, as a <I>hen 
 gathers her brood under her wings.</I> This promise is enlarged upon 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+10:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>,

 <I>I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt.</I> Some 
 think this was literally fulfilled when Ptolem&aelig;us Philadelphus 
 king of Egypt sent 120,000 Jews out of his country into their own land, 
 as was the promise of gathering them out of Assyria by Alexander the 
 son of Antiochus Epiphanes. But it has its spiritual accomplishment in 
 the gathering in of precious souls out of a bondage worse than that in 
 Egypt or Assyria, and the bringing of them into the glorious liberties 
 of the children of God and their enjoyments, which are as the beautiful 
 fruitful pastures in <I>the land of Gilead and Lebanon.</I> All the 
 land of promise is theirs, even Gilead, the utmost border of it 
 eastward, and Lebanon, the utmost border northward. But how shall this 
 be? How shall a people so dispersed be got together? How shall those 
 that are set at such a distance from their own country be brought to it 
 again? It is true the difficulties seem insuperable, but they shall be 
 got over as easily, as effectually as those that lay in the way of 
 their deliverance out of Egypt and their entrance into Canaan: <I>He 
 shall pass through the sea with affliction,</I> as of old through the 
 Red Sea, to the sore affliction of Pharaoh and his hosts, or to the 
 sore affliction of the sea, the waves whereof <I>he shall smite,</I> so 
 that it shall be <I>driven back,</I> as when <I>the sea saw and 
 fled,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+114:3">Ps. cxiv. 3</A>.

 And <I>all the deeps of the river</I> (all the rivers, though ever so
 deep) <I>shall dry up,</I> as Jordan did, to make way for Israel's 
 passage into that good land which God had given them. Does <I>the pride 
 of Assyria</I> stand in the way of their deliverance? He shall give 
 check to it who sets bounds to the <I>proud waves of the sea,</I> and 
 it <I>shall be brought down.</I> Does the sceptre of Egypt oppose it? 
 That shall <I>depart away,</I> so that it shall not be able to obstruct 
 the gathering in of God's Israel when his time shall come for the doing 
 of it. When the gospel-church was to be gathered out of all nations by 
 the preaching of the gospel great opposition was given to it by the 
 enraged combined powers of earth and hell. Insuperable difficulties 
 seemed to be in the way of it. But, by a divine power going along with 
 the doctrine of Christ, it became <I>mighty to the pulling down of 
 strong holds,</I> and the conversion and salvation of thousands. Then 
 the sea fled, and Jordan was <I>driven back at the presence of the 
 Lord.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. They shall greatly multiply, and the church, that new world, shall 
 be replenished 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+10:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>They shall increase as they have increased</I> formerly in Egypt, 
 and great additions shall be made to their numbers, as in the days of 
 David and Solomon. When God gathers his redeemed ones to himself they
 shall help to gather in others with them, and their motion homeward 
 shall be like that of a snow-ball. <I>Crescit eundo--The further it
 goes the larger it grows by accretion. I will gather them, and they
 shall increase.</I> Note, The church of Christ is a growing body, as 
 long as it is in the present state of minority, till it comes <I>to the 
 measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.</I> There are added to 
 it <I>daily such as shall be saved.</I> 

 1. It shall spread to distant places. It shall fill Canaan, even to
 the lands of Gilead and Lebanon, so that no more place, no more room, 
 shall be found for it there,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+10:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 <I>In Judah</I> only <I>God</I> had been <I>known,</I> and his <I>name 
 was great in Israel</I> only; here only he revealed his <I>statutes</I> 
 and <I>judgments.</I> But in gospel-times that place shall be much too 
 strait; the church's tent must be enlarged, and its <I>cords 
 lengthened:</I> Then <I>I will sow them among the people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+10:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 
 Their scattering shall be like the scattering of seed in the ground, 
 not to bury it, but to increase it, that it may bring forth much fruit.
 The Jews are said to be dispersed <I>into every nation under heaven</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:5">Acts ii. 5</A>);

 and, as it was their troubles that dispersed some of them, so perhaps
 others transplanted themselves into colonies because the land of Israel
 was too strait for them; and many were natives of other nations, but
 proselyted to the Jewish religion. Now these were <I>sown among the
 people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:23">Hos. ii. 23</A>.

 And this contributed very much to the spreading of the gospel. The Jews
 that came from all parts to worship at Jerusalem fetched thence the
 gospel light and fire to their own countries, as those 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:1-47">Acts ii.</A>,

 and the eunuch,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:26-40">Acts viii.</A>

 And their own synagogues in the several cities of the Gentiles were the
 first receptacles of the apostles and their preaching, wherever they 
 came. Thus when God <I>sowed them among the people,</I> that they
 might not get hurt by the Gentiles, but do good to them, he took care 
 that they should <I>remember him,</I> and make mention of his name 
 <I>in far countries;</I> and, by keeping up the knowledge of God among 
 them as he had revealed himself in the Old Testament, they would be the 
 more ready to admit the knowledge of Christ as he has revealed himself 
 in the New Testament.

 2. It shall last to future <I>ages.</I> The church shall not be <I>res
 unius &aelig;tatis--a temporary thing,</I> but a seed in it shall 
 <I>serve the Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+10:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 <I>Yea, their children shall see it and be glad;</I> and <I>they shall
 live with their children, and turn again,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+10:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Converts to Christ shall have their children about them, whom they 
 shall teach the knowledge of the Lord, and bring with them when they 
 turn again to the holy land and the way of holiness. It was said to 
 those to whom the gospel was first preached, <I>The promise is to you 
 and to your children,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:39">Acts ii. 39</A>.

 They shall be <I>so sown among the people</I> as never to be
 extirpated. Christ's family upon earth shall never be extinct, nor his
 purchased possession lost for want of heirs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. God himself will be both their strength and their song. 

 1. In him they shall be comforted, and shall have abundant satisfaction

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+10:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Their heart shall rejoice as through wine;</I> for Christ's
 <I>love,</I> which is their joy, is <I>better than wine.</I> They shall 
 be <I>like a mighty man,</I> and <I>their heart shall rejoice.</I> When 
 we resolutely resist, and so overcome, our spiritual enemies, then our 
 hearts shall rejoice. But we ruin our own joy if our resistance be 
 feeble and we yield to the temptations of Satan. Their <I>heart shall 
 rejoice,</I> and then they shall be as a <I>mighty man;</I> for the 
 <I>joy of the Lord</I> will be <I>our strength.</I> And with their 
 graces their joys shall be propagated: <I>Their children shall see it 
 and be glad, and their hearts</I> also <I>shall rejoice in the 
 Lord.</I> It is good to acquaint children betimes with the delights of 
 religion, and to make the services of it as pleasant as may be to them, 
 that, learning betimes to rejoice in the Lord, they may with purpose of 
 heart cleave to him. 

 2. By him they shall be carried on with vigour, and enlargement of
 heart, in his service

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+10:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>I will strengthen them in the Lord,</I> strengthen them for their 
 walk and work, as well as for their warfare. It is the God of Israel
 that <I>gives strength and power unto his people,</I> that strengthens 
 all their powers and faculties for spiritual performances, above what 
 they are by nature and against what they are by the corruption of 
 nature. Now observe, 

 (1.) How they are thus enabled and invigorated for their duty: <I>I</I> 
 the Lord <I>will strengthen them in the Lord,</I> in the 
 <I>Messiah,</I> who is <I>Jehovah our strength,</I> as well as 
 <I>Jehovah our righteousness.</I> Strength is treasured up for us in 
 Christ, and from him it is communicated to us. It is <I>through Christ 
 strengthening</I> us that we can <I>do all things,</I> and <I>without 
 him we can do nothing.</I> His <I>strength is commanded</I> him <I>for 
 this</I> purpose, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:28">Ps. lxviii. 28</A>.

 (2.) What good use they shall make of this strength given unto them:
 <I>They shall walk up and down in his name.</I> If God strengthen us, 
 we must bestir ourselves, must <I>walk up and down</I> in all the 
 duties of the Christian life, must be active and busy in the work of 
 God, must walk up and down as industrious men do, losing no time, and 
 letting slip no opportunity. But still we must <I>walk up and down in 
 the name of Christ,</I> must do all by warrant from him and in 
 dependence on him, with an eye to his word as our rule and his glory as 
 our end. To us to live must be Christ; and, <I>whatever we do in word 
 or deed,</I> we must <I>do all in the name of the Lord Jesus,</I> that 
 we receive not the strengthening grace of God in vain. See
