 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Relief is here brought to Samaria and her king, when the case is, in a 
 manner, desperate, and the king despairing. 

 I. It is foretold by Elisha, and an unbelieving lord shut out from the 
 benefit of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. It is brought about, 

 1. By an unaccountable fright into which God put the Syrians
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:6">ver. 6</A>),
 
 which caused them to retire precipitately, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:7">ver. 7</A>.

 2. By the seasonable discovery which four lepers made of this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>),

 and the account which they gave of it to the court, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:8-11">ver. 8-11</A>.

 3.  By the cautious trial which the king made of the truth of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:12-15">ver. 12-15</A>.

 III. The event answered the prediction both in the sudden plenty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:16">ver. 16</A>),

 and the death of the unbelieving lord 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:17-20">ver. 17-20</A>);

 for no word of God shall fall to the ground.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Thus saith
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, To morrow about this time <I>shall</I> a measure of fine
 flour <I>be sold</I> for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a
 shekel, in the gate of Samaria.
 &nbsp; 2 Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of
 God, and said, Behold, <I>if</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> would make windows in
 heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see
 <I>it</I> with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. Elisha foretels that, notwithstanding the great straits to which the 
 city of Samaria is reduced, yet within twenty-four hours they shall 
 have plenty,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 The king of Israel despaired of it and grew weary of waiting: then 
 Elisha foretold it, when things were at the worst. Man's extremity is 
 God's opportunity of magnifying his own power; his time to appear for 
 his people is when <I>their strength is gone,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:36">Deut. xxxii. 36</A>.

 When they had given over expecting help it came. <I>When the son of
 man comes shall he find faith on the earth?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:8">Luke xviii. 8</A>.

 The king said, <I>What shall I wait for the Lord any longer?</I> And
 perhaps some of the elders were ready to say the same: "Well," said 
 Elisha, "you hear what these say; <I>now hear you the word of the 
 Lord,</I> hear what he says, hear it and heed it and believe it: 
 to-morrow corn shall be sold at the usual rate in the gate of Samaria;" 
 that is, the siege shall be raised, for the gate of the city shall be 
 opened, and the market shall be held there as formerly. The return of 
 peace is thus expressed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:11">Judg. v. 11</A>),

 <I>Then shall the people of the Lord go down to the gates,</I> to buy
 and sell there. 

 2. The consequence of that shall be great plenty. This would, in time,
 follow of course, but that corn should be thus cheap in so short a time 
 was quite beyond what could be thought of. Though the king of Israel 
 had just now threatened Elisha's life, God promises to save his life 
 and the life of his people; for <I>where sin abounded grace doth much 
 more abound.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A peer of Israel that happened to be present openly declared his 
 disbelief of this prediction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 He was a courtier whom the king had an affection for, as the man of his
 right hand, on whom he leaned, that is, on whose prudence he much 
 relied, and in whom he reposed much confidence. He thought it 
 impossible, unless God should rain corn out of the clouds, as once he 
 did manna; no less than the repetition of Moses's miracle will serve 
 him, though that of Elijah might have served to answer this intention, 
 the increasing of the meal in the barrel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The just doom passed upon him for his infidelity, that he should 
 see this great plenty for this conviction, and yet not eat of it to his 
 comfort. Note, Unbelief is a sin by which men greatly dishonour and 
 displease God, and deprive themselves of the favours he designed for 
 them. The murmuring Israelites saw Canaan, but could not enter in 
 because of unbelief. Such (says bishop Patrick) will be the portion of 
 those that believe not the promise of eternal life; they shall see it 
 at a distance--Abraham afar off, but shall never taste of it; for they
 forfeit the benefit of the promise if they cannot find in their heart 
 to take God's word.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>3 And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the
 gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?
 &nbsp; 4 If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine <I>is</I>
 in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we
 die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of
 the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they
 kill us, we shall but die.
 &nbsp; 5 And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the
 Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the
 camp of Syria, behold, <I>there was</I> no man there.
 &nbsp; 6 For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise
 of chariots, and a noise of horses, <I>even</I> the noise of a great
 host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath
 hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the
 Egyptians, to come upon us.
 &nbsp; 7 Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their
 tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it
 <I>was,</I> and fled for their life.
 &nbsp; 8 And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp,
 they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried
 thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid <I>it;</I> and
 came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence
 <I>also,</I> and went and hid <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 9 Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day <I>is</I>
 a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till
 the morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now therefore
 come, that we may go and tell the king's household.
 &nbsp; 10 So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and
 they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and,
 behold, <I>there was</I> no man there, neither voice of man, but
 horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they <I>were.</I>
 &nbsp; 11 And he called the porters; and they told <I>it</I> to the king's
 house within.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How the siege of Samaria was raised in the evening, at the edge of 
 night 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>),

 not by might or power, but by the Spirit of the Lord of hosts, striking
 terror upon the spirits of the besiegers. Here was not a sword drawn 
 against them, not a drop of blood shed, it was not by thunder or 
 hailstones that they were discomfited, nor were they slain, as 
 Sennacherib's army before Jerusalem, by a destroying angel; but,

 1.  <I>The Lord made them to hear a noise of chariots and horses.</I> 
 The Syrians that besieged Dothan had their <I>sight</I> imposed upon,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+6:18"><I>ch.</I> vi. 18</A>.

 These had their <I>hearing</I> imposed upon. For God knows how to work
 upon every sense, pursuant to his own counsels as <I>he makes the 
 hearing ear and the seeing eye,</I> so he makes <I>the deaf and the 
 blind,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:11">Exod. iv. 11</A>.

 Whether the noise was really made in the air by the ministry of angels,
 or whether it was only a sound in their ears, is not certain; which 
 soever it was, it was from God, who both <I>brings the wind out of his 
 treasures,</I> and <I>forms the spirit of man within him.</I> The sight 
 of horses and chariots had encouraged the prophet's servant,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+6:17"><I>ch.</I> vi. 17</A>.

 The noise of horses and chariots terrified the hosts of Syria. For
 notices from the invisible world are either very comfortable or very 
 dreadful, according as men are at peace with God or at war with him. 

 2.  Hearing this noise, they concluded the king of Israel had certainly
 procured assistance from some foreign power: <I>He has hired against us 
 the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians.</I> There 
 was, for aught we know but one king of Egypt, and what kings there were 
 of the Hittites nobody can imagine; but, as they were imposed upon by 
 that dreadful sound in their ears, so they imposed upon themselves by 
 the interpretation they made of it. Had they supposed the king of Judah 
 to have come with his forces, there would have been more of probability 
 in their apprehensions than to dream of the <I>kings of the Hittites 
 and the Egyptians.</I> If the fancies of any of them raised this 
 spectre, yet their reasons might soon have laid it: how could the king 
 of Israel, who was closely besieged, hold intelligence with those 
 distant princes? What had he to hire them with?  It was impossible but 
 some notice would come, before, of the motions of so great a host; but 
 <I>there were they in great fear where no fear was.</I> 

 3. Hereupon they all fled with incredible precipitation, as for their 
 lives, left their camp as it was: even their horses, that might have 
 hastened their flight, they could not stay to take with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 None of them had so much sense as to send out scouts to discover the
 supposed enemy, much less courage enough to face the enemy, though 
 fatigued with a long march. <I>The wicked flee when none pursues.</I> 
 God can, when he pleases, dispirit the boldest and most brave, and make 
 the stoutest heart to tremble. Those that will not fear God he can make 
 to fear at the shaking of a leaf.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How the Syrians' flight was discovered by four leprous men. Samaria 
 was delivered, and did not know it. The watchmen on the walls were not 
 aware of the retreat of the enemy, so silently did they steal away. But 
 Providence employed four lepers to be the intelligencers, who had their 
 lodging without the gate, being excluded from the city, as ceremonially 
 unclean: the Jews say they were Gehazi and his three sons; perhaps 
 Gehazi might be one of them, which might cause him to be taken notice 
 of afterwards by the king, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:4"><I>ch.</I> viii. 4</A>.
 
 See here, 

 1. How these lepers reasoned themselves into a resolution to make a
 visit in the night to the camp of the Syrians, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 They were ready to perish for hunger; none passed through the gate to
 relieve them.  Should they go into the city, there was nothing to be 
 had there, they mist die in the streets; should they sit still, they 
 must pine to death in their cottage. They therefore determine to go 
 over to the enemy, and throw themselves upon their mercy: if they 
 killed them, better die by the sword than by famine, one death than a 
 thousand; but perhaps they would save them alive, as objects of 
 compassion. Common prudence will put us upon that method which may 
 better our condition, but cannot make it worse. The prodigal son 
 resolves to return to his father, whose displeasure he had reason to 
 fear, rather than perish with hunger in the far country. These lepers 
 conclude, "If they kill us, we shall but die;" and happy they who, in 
 another sense, can thus speak of dying.  "We shall but die, that is the 
 worst of it, not die and be damned, not be hurt of the second death." 
 According to this resolution, they went, in the beginning of the night, 
 to the camp of the Syrians, and, to their great surprise, found it 
 wholly deserted, not a man to be seen or heard in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Providence ordered it, that these lepers came as soon as ever the 
 Syrians had fled, for they fled in the twilight, the evening twilight 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),
 
 and in the twilight the lepers came
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 and so no time was lost.

 2. How they reasoned themselves into a resolution to bring tidings of
 this to the city. They feasted in the first tent they came to 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>)
 
 and then began to think of enriching themselves with the plunder; but
 they corrected themselves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>We do not well</I> to conceal these good tidings from the community
 we are members of, under colour of being avenged upon them for 
 excluding us from their society; it was the law that did it, not they, 
 and therefore let us bring them the news. Though it awake them from 
 sleep, it will be <I>life from the dead</I> to them." Their own 
 consciences told them that some mischief would befal them if they acted 
 separately, and sought themselves only.  Selfish narrow-spirited people 
 cannot expect to prosper; the most comfortable advantage is that which 
 our brethren share with us in.  According to this resolution, they 
 returned to the gate, and acquainted the sentinel with what they had 
 discovered

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 who straightway brought the intelligence to court

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 and it was not the less acceptable for being first brought by
 lepers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12 And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants,
 I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know
 that we <I>be</I> hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to
 hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the
 city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.
 &nbsp; 13 And one of his servants answered and said, Let <I>some</I> take,
 I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in
 the city, (behold, they <I>are</I> as all the multitude of Israel that
 are left in it: behold, <I>I say,</I> they <I>are</I> even as all the
 multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us send
 and see.
 &nbsp; 14 They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent
 after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.
 &nbsp; 15 And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way
 <I>was</I> full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast
 away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the
 king.
 &nbsp; 16 And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the
 Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was <I>sold</I> for a shekel, and
 two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 17 And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to
 have the charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in the
 gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the
 king came down to him.
 &nbsp; 18 And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the
 king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure
 of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in
 the gate of Samaria:
 &nbsp; 19 And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now,
 behold, <I>if</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> should make windows in heaven, might such a
 thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes,
 but shalt not eat thereof.
 &nbsp; 20 And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him
 in the gate, and he died.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The king's jealousy of a stratagem in the Syrian's retreat, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 
 He feared that they had withdrawn into an ambush, to draw out the
 besieged, that they might fall on them with more advantage. He knew he
 had no reason to expect that God should appear thus wonderfully for 
 him, having forfeited his favour by his unbelief and impatience. He 
 knew no reason the Syrians had to fly, for it does not appear that he 
 or any of this attendants heard the noise of the chariots which the 
 Syrians were frightened at. Let not those who, like him, are 
 <I>unstable in all their ways, think to receive any thing from God;</I> 
 nay, a guilty conscience fears the worst and makes men suspicious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The course they took for their satisfaction, and to prevent their 
 falling into a snare. They sent out spies to see what had become of the 
 Syrians, and found they had all fled indeed, commanders as well a 
 common soldiers. They could track them by the garments which they threw 
 off, and left by the way, for their greater expedition, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 He that gave this advice seems to have been very sensible of the
 deplorable condition the people were in

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 for speaking of the horses, many of which were dead and the rest ready
 to perish for hunger, he says, and repeats it, "<I>They are as all the 
 multitude of Israel.</I> Israel used to glory in their multitude, but 
 now they are diminished and brought low." He advised to send five 
 horsemen, but, it should seem, there were only two horses fit to be 
 sent, and those chariot-horses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Now the Lord repented himself concerning his servants, when he saw that
 their strength was gone,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:36">Deut. xxxii. 36</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The plenty that was in Samaria, from the plunder of the camp of 
 the Syrians, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Had the Syrians been governed by the modern policies of war, when they
 could not take their baggage and their tents with them they would 
 rather have burnt them (as it is common to do with the forage of a 
 country) than let them fall into their enemies' hands; but God 
 determined that the besieging of Samaria, which was intended for its 
 ruin, should turn to its advantage, and that Israel should now be 
 enriched with the spoil of the Syrians as of old with that of the 
 Egyptians. Here see,

 1. The <I>wealth of the sinner laid up for the just</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+27:16,17">Job xxvii. 16, 17</A>)
 
 and the spoilers spoiled, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:1">Isa. xxxiii. 1</A>.

 2. The wants of Israel supplied in a way that they little thought of,
 which should encourage us to depend upon the power and goodness of God 
 in our greatest straits. 

 3. The word of Elisha fulfilled to a tittle: <I>A measure of fine flour 
 was sold for a shekel;</I> those that spoiled the camp had not only 
 enough to supply themselves with, but an overplus to sell at an easy 
 rate for the benefit of others, and so even <I>those that tarried at 
 home did divide the spoil,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:12,Isa+33:23">Ps. lxviii. 12; Isa. xxxiii. 23</A>.

 God's promise may be safely relied on, for no word of his shall fall to
 the ground.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The death of the unbelieving courtier, that questioned the truth of 
 Elisha's word. Divine threatenings will as surely be accomplished as 
 divine promises. <I>He that believeth not shall be damned</I> stands as 
 firm as <I>He that believeth shall be saved.</I> This lord, 

 1. Was preferred by the king to the <I>charge of the gate</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),
 
 to keep the peace, and to see that there was no tumult or disorder in
 dividing and disposing of the spoil. So much trust did the king repose 
 in him, in his prudence and gravity, and so much did he delight to 
 honour him.  He that will be great, let him serve the public. 

 2. Was trodden to death by the people in the gate, either by accident,
 the crowd being exceedingly great, and he in the thickest of it, or 
 perhaps designedly, because he abused his power, and was imperious in 
 restraining the people from satisfying their hunger. However it was, 
 God's justice was glorified, and the word of Elisha was fulfilled. He 
 saw the plenty, for the silencing and shaming of his unbelief, corn 
 cheap without <I>opening windows in heaven,</I> and therein saw his own 
 folly in prescribing to God; but he did not eat of the plenty he saw.  
 <I>When he was about to fill his belly</I> God <I>cast the fury of his 
 wrath upon him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:23">Job xx. 23</A>)

 and it came between the cup and the lip.  Justly are those thus
 tantalized with the world's promises that think themselves tantalized 
 with the promises of God. If believing shall not be seeing, seeing 
 shall not be enjoying. This matter is repeated, and the event very 
 particularly compared with the prediction

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:18-20"><I>v.</I> 18-20</A>),
 
 that we might take special notice of it, and might learn,

 (1.) How deeply God resents out distrust of him, of his power, 
 providence, and promise.  When Israel said, <I>Can God furnish a table? 
 the Lord heard it and was wroth.</I> Infinite wisdom will not be 
 limited by our folly. God never promises the end without knowing where 
 to provide the means. 

 (2.) How uncertain life and the enjoyments of it are. Honour and power 
 cannot secure men from sudden and inglorious deaths. He whom the king 
 leaned upon the people trod upon; he who fancied himself the stay and 
 support of the government was trampled under foot as the mire in the 
 streets.  Thus hath the pride of men's glory been often stained. 

 (3.) How certain God's threatenings are, and how sure to alight on the 
 guilty and obnoxious heads. Let all men fear before the great God, who 
 <I>treads upon princes as mortar</I> and is <I>terrible to the kings of 
 the earth.</I></P>
