 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter begins with as melancholy a "but" as almost any we find in 
 all the Bible. Hitherto we have read nothing of Solomon but what was 
 great and good; but the lustre both of his goodness and of his 
 greatness is here sullied and eclipsed, and his sun sets under a cloud. 
 
 I. The glory of his piety is stained by his departure from God and his
 duty, in his latter days, marrying strange wives and worshipping
 strange gods, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:4-8">ver. 4-8</A>.

 II. The glory of his prosperity is stained by God's displeasure against
 him and the fruits of that displeasure. 
 
 1. He sent him an angry message,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:9-13">ver. 9-13</A>.

 2. He stirred up enemies, who gave him disturbance, Hadad
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:14-22">ver. 14-22</A>),

 Rezon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:23-25">ver. 23-25</A>.

 3. He gave away ten tribes of his twelve, from his posterity after him,
 to Jeroboam, whom therefore he sought in vain to slay 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:26-40">ver. 26-40</A>),

 and this is all that remains here to be told concerning Solomon, except
 his death and burial 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:41-43">ver. 41-43</A>),

 for there is nothing perfect under the sun, but all is so above the
 sun.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the
 daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites,
 Zidonians, <I>and</I> Hittites;
 &nbsp; 2 Of the nations <I>concerning</I> which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto the
 children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall
 they come in unto you: <I>for</I> surely they will turn away your
 heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.
 &nbsp; 3 And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred
 concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.
 &nbsp; 4 For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, <I>that</I> his wives
 turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not
 perfect with the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> his God, as <I>was</I> the heart of David his
 father.
 &nbsp; 5 For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the
 Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
 &nbsp; 6 And Solomon did evil in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and went not
 fully after the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, as <I>did</I> David his father.
 &nbsp; 7 Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh, the
 abomination of Moab, in the hill that <I>is</I> before Jerusalem, and
 for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.
 &nbsp; 8 And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt
 incense and sacrificed unto their gods.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is a sad story, and very surprising, of Solomon's defection and 
 degeneracy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Let us enquire into the occasions and particulars of it. Shall 
 Solomon fall, that was the beauty of Israel, and so great a blessing of 
 his generation? Yes, it is too true, and the scripture is faithful in 
 relating it, and repeating it, and referring to it long after, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:26">Neh. xiii. 26</A>.

 <I>There was no king like Solomon who was beloved of his God, yet even
 him did outlandish women cause to sin.</I> There is the summary of his 
 apostasy; it was the woman that <I>deceived him,</I> and was <I>first 
 in the transgression.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He doted on strange women, <I>many strange women.</I> Here his 
 revolt began. 

 (1.) He gave himself to women, which his mother had particularly 
 cautioned him against. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:3">Prov. xxxi. 3</A>,

 <I>Give not thy strength unto women</I> (perhaps alluding to Samson,
 who lost his strength by giving information of it to a woman), for it 
 is that which, as much as any thing, destroys kings. His father David's 
 fall began with the lusts of the flesh, which he should have taken 
 warning by. The love of women has <I>cast down many wounded</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+7:26">Prov. vii. 26</A>)

 and <I>many</I> (says bishop Hall) <I>have had their head broken by
 their own rib.</I>

 (2.) He took many women, so many that, at last, they amounted to 700 
 wives and 300 concubines, 1000 in all, and not one good one among them, 
 as he himself owns in his penitential sermon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:28">Eccl. vii. 28</A>),

 for no woman of established virtue would be one of such a set.  God
 had, by his law, particularly forbidden the kings to multiply either 
 horses or wives,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:16,17">Deut. xvii. 16, 17</A>.

 How he broke the former law, in multiplying horses, and having them
 <I>out of Egypt</I> too (which was expressly prohibited in that law) we 
 read

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:29"><I>ch.</I> x. 29</A>,

 and here we are told how he broke the latter (which proved of more
 fatal consequence) in multiplying wives. Note, Less sins, made gold 
 with, open the door to greater. David had multiplied wives too much, 
 and perhaps that made Solomon presume it lawful. Note, If those that 
 are in reputation for religion in any thing set a bad example, they 
 know not what a deal of mischief they may do by it, particularly to 
 their own children. One bad act of a good man may be of more pernicious 
 consequence to others than twenty of a wicked man. Probably Solomon, 
 when he began to multiply wives, intended not to exceed his father's 
 number. But the way of sin is down-hill; those that have got into it 
 cannot easily stop themselves. Divine wisdom has appointed one woman 
 for one man, did so at first; and those who do not think one enough 
 will not think two or three enough. Unbridled lust will be unbounded, 
 and the loosened hind will wander endlessly. But this was not all: 

 (3.) They were strange women, Moabites, Ammonites, &c., of the nations 
 which God had particularly forbidden them to intermarry with, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 Some think it was in policy that he married these foreigners, by them
 to get intelligence of the state of those countries. I rather fear it 
 was because the daughters of Israel were too grave and modest for him, 
 and those foreigners pleased him with the looseness and wantonness of 
 their dress, and air, and conversation. Or, perhaps, it was looked upon 
 as a piece of state to have his seraglio, as his other treasures, 
 replenished with that which was far-fetched; as if that were too great 
 an honour for the best of his subjects which would really have been a 
 disgrace to the meanest of them--to be his mistresses. And, 

 (4.) To complete the mischief, <I>Solomon clave unto these in love,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 He not only kept them, but was extravagantly fond of them, set his
 heart upon them, spent his time among them, thought every thing well 
 they said and did, and despised Pharaoh's daughter, his rightful wife, 
 who had been dear to him, and all the ladies of Israel, in comparison 
 of them. Solomon was master of a great deal of knowledge, but to what 
 purpose, when he had no better a government of his appetites?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He was drawn by them to the worship of strange gods, as Israel to 
 Baal-peor by the daughters of Moab. This was the bad consequence of his 
 multiplying wives. We have reason to think it impaired his health, and 
 hastened upon him the decays of age; it exhausted his treasure, which, 
 though vast indeed, would be found little enough to maintain the pride
 and vanity of all these women; perhaps it occasioned him, in his latter 
 end, to neglect his business, by which he lost his supplies from 
 abroad, and was forced, for the keeping up of his grandeur, to burden 
 his subjects with those taxes which they complained of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:4"><I>ch.</I> xii. 4</A>.

 But none of these consequences were so bad as this: <I>His wives turned
 away his heart after other gods,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 (1.) He grew cool and indifferent in his own religion and remiss in the 
 service of the God of Israel: <I>His heart was not perfect with the 
 Lord his God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 nor did he <I>follow him fully</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 like David. We cannot suppose that he quite cast off the worship of 
 God, much less that he restrained or hindered it (the temple-service 
 went on as usual); but he grew less frequent, and less serious, in 
 <I>his ascent to the house of the Lord</I> and his attendance on his 
 altar. He left his first love, lost his zeal for God, and did not 
 persevere to the end as he had begun; therefore it is said <I>he was 
 not perfect,</I> because he was not <I>constant;</I> and he followed 
 not God fully, because he turned from following him, and did not 
 continue to the end. His father David had many faults, but he never 
 neglected the worship of God, nor grew remiss in that, as Solomon did 
 (his wives using all their arts to divert him from it), and 
 <I>there</I> began his apostasy.

 (2.) He tolerated and maintained his wives in their idolatry and made 
 no scruple of joining with them in it.  Pharaoh's daughter was 
 proselyted (as is supposed) to the Jews' religion, but, when he began 
 to grow careless in the worship of God himself, he used no means to 
 convert his other wives to it; in complaisance to them, he built 
 chapels for their gods 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>),

 maintained their priests, and occasionally did himself attend their
 altars, making a jest of it, asking, "What harm is there in it? Are not 
 all religions alike?" which (says bishop Patrick) has been the 
 <I>disease of some great wits.</I> When he humoured one thus, the rest 
 would take it ill if he did not, in like manner, gratify them, so that 
 he did it for all his wives 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and at last came to such a degree of impiety that he set up a high 
 place for <I>Chemosh in the hill that is before Jerusalem,</I> the 
 <I>mount of Olives,</I> as if to confront the temple which he himself 
 had built. These high places continued here, not utterly demolished, 
 till Josiah's time,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:13">2 Kings xxiii. 13</A>.
 
 This is the account here given of Solomon's apostasy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Let us now pause awhile, and lament Solomon's fall; and we may 
 justly stand and wonder at it. <I>How has the gold become dim! How has 
 the most fine gold changed! Be astonished, O heavens! at this, and be 
 horribly afraid,</I> as the prophet exclaims in a like case, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:12">Jer. ii. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How strange, 

 (1.) That Solomon, in his old age, should be ensnared with fleshly 
 lusts, youthful lusts. As we must never presume upon the strength of 
 our resolutions, so neither upon the weakness of our corruptions, so as 
 to be secure and off our guard. 

 (2.) That so wise a man as Solomon was, so famed for a quick 
 understanding and sound judgment, should suffer himself to be made such 
 a fool of by these foolish women. 

 (3.) That one who had so often and so plainly warned others of the 
 danger of the love of women should himself be so wretchedly bewitched 
 with it; it is easier to see a mischief, and to show it to others, than 
 to shun it ourselves. 

 (4.) That so good a man, so zealous for the worship of God, who had 
 been so conversant with divine things, and who prayed that excellent 
 prayer at the dedication of the temple, should do these sinful things. 
 Is this Solomon? Have all his wisdom and devotion come to this at last? 
 Never was gallant ship so wrecked; never was crown so profaned.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What shall we say to all this? Why God permitted it it is not for us 
 to enquire; his way is in the sea and his path in the great waters; he 
 knew how to bring glory to himself out of it. God foresaw it when he 
 said concerning him that should build the temple, <I>If he commit 
 iniquity,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:14">2 Sam. vii. 14</A>.

 But it concerns us to enquire what good use we may make of it. 

 (1.) Let him that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall. We see how 
 weak we are of ourselves, without the grace of God; let us therefore 
 live in a constant dependence on that grace. 

 (2.) See the danger of a prosperous condition, and how hard it is to 
 overcome the temptations of it.  Solomon, like Jeshurun, waxed fat and 
 then kicked. The food convenient, which Agur prayed for, is safer and 
 better than the food abundant, which Solomon was even surfeited with. 
 
 (3.) See what need those have to stand upon their guard who have made a 
 great profession of religion, and shown themselves forward and zealous 
 in devotion, because the devil will set upon them most violently, and, 
 if they misbehave, the reproach is the greater. It is the evening that 
 commends the day; let us therefore fear, lest, having run well, we seem 
 to come short.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was angry with Solomon, because his heart was
 turned from the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel, which had appeared unto him
 twice,
 &nbsp; 10 And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should
 not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 commanded.
 &nbsp; 11 Wherefore the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is
 done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes,
 which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from
 thee, and will give it to thy servant.
 &nbsp; 12 Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy
 father's sake: <I>but</I> I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.
 &nbsp; 13 Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; <I>but</I> will
 give one tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for
 Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. God's anger against Solomon for his sin. The thing he did
 <I>displeased the Lord.</I> Time was then the Lord <I>loved Solomon</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:24">2 Sam. xii. 24</A>)
 
 and delighted in him
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:9"><I>ch.</I> x. 9</A>),

 but now <I>the Lord was angry with Solomon</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 for there was in his sin, 

 1. The most base ingratitude that could be.  He turned from the Lord
 <I>who had appeared unto him twice,</I> once before he began to build 
 the temple

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:5"><I>ch.</I> iii. 5</A>)
 
 and once after he had dedicated it,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+9:2"><I>ch.</I> ix. 2</A>.

 God keeps account of the gracious visits he makes us, whether we do or
 no, knows how often he has appeared <I>to</I> us and <I>for</I> us, and 
 will remember it against us if we <I>turn from him.</I> God's appearing 
 to Solomon was such a sensible confirmation of his faith as should have 
 for ever prevented his worshipping <I>any other god;</I> it was also 
 such a distinguishing favour, and put such an honour upon him, as he 
 ought never to have forgotten, especially considering what God said to 
 him in both these appearances. 

 2. The most wilful disobedience. This was the very thing concerning
 which <I>God had commanded him--that he should not go after other 
 gods,</I> yet he was not restrained by such an express admonition, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Those who have dominion over men are apt to forget God's dominion over
 them; and, while they demand obedience from their inferiors, to deny it 
 to him who is the Supreme.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The message he sent him hereupon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>The Lord said unto Solomon</I> (it is likely by a prophet) that he 
 must expect to smart for his apostasy. And here, 

 1. The sentence is just, that, since he had revolted from God, part of
 his kingdom should revolt from his family; he had given God's glory to 
 the creature, and therefore God would give his crown to his servant: 
 "<I>I will rend the kingdom from thee,</I> in thy posterity, and will 
 <I>give it to thy servant,</I> who shall bear rule over much of that 
 for which thou hast laboured." This was a great mortification to 
 Solomon, who pleased himself no doubt with the prospect of the entail 
 of his rich kingdom upon his heirs for ever. Sin brings ruin upon 
 families, cuts off entails, alienates estates, and lays men's honour in 
 the dust. 

 2. Yet the mitigations of it are very kind, for David's sake

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>),

 that is, for the sake of the promise made to David. Thus all the favour 
 God shows to man is for <I>Christ's sake,</I> and for the sake of the 
 covenant made with him.  The kingdom shall be rent from Solomon's 
 house, but,

 (1.) Not immediately. Solomon shall not live to see it done, but it 
 shall be rent <I>out of the hand of his son,</I> a son that was born to 
 him by one of his strange wives, for his mother was an Ammonitess

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:31">1 Kings xiv. 31</A>)

 and probably had been a promoter of idolatry. What comfort can a man
 take in leaving children and an estate behind him if he do not leave a 
 blessing behind him? Yet, if judgments be coming, it is a favour to us 
 if they come not in our days, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+20:19">2 Kings xx. 19</A>.

 (2.) Not wholly. One tribe, that of Judah, the strongest and most
 numerous, shall remain to the house of David 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 for Jerusalem's sake, which David built, and for the sake of the temple 
 there, which Solomon built; these shall not go into other hands. 
 Solomon did not quickly nor wholly turn away from God; therefore God 
 did not quickly nor wholly take the kingdom from him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Upon this message which God graciously sent to Solomon, to awaken his 
 conscience and bring him to repentance, we have reason to hope that he 
 humbled himself before God, confessed his sin, begged pardon, and 
 returned to his duty, that he then published his repentance in the book 
 of Ecclesiastes, where he bitterly laments his own folly and madness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:25,26"><I>ch.</I> vii. 25, 26</A>),

 and warns others to take heed of the like evil courses, and to <I>fear
 God</I> and <I>keep his commandments,</I> in consideration of <I>the 
 judgment to come,</I> which, it is likely, had made him tremble, as it 
 did Felix. That penitential sermon was as true an indication of a heart 
 broken for sin and turned from it as David's penitential psalms were, 
 though of another nature. God's grace in his people works variously. 
 Thus, though Solomon fell, <I>he was not utterly cast down;</I> what 
 God had said to David concerning him was fulfilled: <I>I will chasten 
 him with the rod of men, but my mercy shall not depart from him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:14,15">2 Sam. vii. 14, 15</A>.

 Though God may suffer those whom he loves to fall into sin, he will not
 suffer them to lie still in it. Solomon's defection, though it was much 
 his reproach and a great blemish to his personal character, yet did not 
 so far break in upon the character of his reign but that it was 
 afterwards made the pattern of a good reign,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+11:17">2 Chron. xi. 17</A>,

 where the kings are said to have done well, while <I>they walked in the
 way of David and Solomon.</I> But, though we have all this reason to 
 hope he repented and found mercy, yet the Holy Ghost did not think fit 
 expressly to record his recovery, but left it doubtful, for warning to 
 others not to sin upon presumption of repenting, for it is but a 
 peradventure whether <I>God will give them repentance,</I> or, if he 
 do, whether he will give the evidence of it to themselves or others.
 Great sinners may recover themselves and have the benefit of their 
 repentance, and yet be denied both the comfort and credit of it; the 
 guilt may be taken away, and yet not the reproach.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the
 Edomite: he <I>was</I> of the king's seed in Edom.

 captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had
 smitten every male in Edom;
 &nbsp; 16 (For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until
 he had cut off every male in Edom:)
 &nbsp; 17 That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's
 servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad <I>being</I> yet a little
 child.
 &nbsp; 18 And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they
 took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto
 Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him a house, and appointed him
 victuals, and gave him land.
 &nbsp; 19 And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so
 that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister
 of Tahpenes the queen.
 &nbsp; 20 And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom
 Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh's
 household among the sons of Pharaoh.
 &nbsp; 21 And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his
 fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad
 said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own
 country.
 &nbsp; 22 Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with
 me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he
 answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.
 &nbsp; 23 And God stirred him up <I>another</I> adversary, Rezon the son of
 Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:
 &nbsp; 24 And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a
 band, when David slew them <I>of Zobah:</I> and they went to Damascus,
 and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.
 &nbsp; 25 And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon,
 beside the mischief that Hadad <I>did:</I> and he abhorred Israel, and
 reigned over Syria.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 While Solomon kept closely to God and to his duty there was <I>no 
 adversary nor evil occurrent</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+5:4"><I>ch.</I> v. 4</A>),

 nothing to create him any disturbance or uneasiness in the least; but
 here we have an account of two adversaries that appeared against him, 
 inconsiderable, and that could not have done any thing worth taking 
 notice of if Solomon had not first made God his enemy. What hurt could 
 Hadad or Rezon have done to so great and powerful a king as Solomon was 
 if he had not, by sin, made himself mean and weak? And then those 
 little people menace and insult him. If God be on our side, we need not 
 fear the greatest adversary; but, if he be against us, he can made us 
 fear the least, and the very grasshopper shall be a burden.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Both these adversaries God stirred up, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:14,23"><I>v.</I> 14, 23</A>.

 Though they themselves were moved by principles of ambition or revenge,
 God made use of them to serve his design of correcting Solomon. The 
 principal judgment threatened was deferred, namely, the rending of the 
 kingdom from him, but he himself was made to fee the smart of the rod, 
 for his greater humiliation. Note, Whoever are, in any way, adversaries 
 to us, we must take notice of the hand of God stirring them up to be 
 so, as he bade Shimei curse David; we must look through the instruments 
 of our trouble to the author of it and hear the Lord's controversy in 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Both these adversaries had the origin of their enmity to Solomon 
 and Israel laid in David's time, and in his conquests of their 
 respective countries, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:15,24"><I>v.</I> 15, 24</A>.

 Solomon had the benefit and advantage of his father's successes both in
 the enlargement of his dominion and the increase of his treasure, and 
 would never have known any thing but the benefit of them if he had kept 
 closely to God; but now he finds evils to balance the advantages, and 
 that David had made himself enemies, who were thorns in his sides. 
 Those that are too free in giving provocation ought to consider that 
 perhaps it may be remembered in time to come and returned with interest 
 to theirs after them; having so few friends in this world, it is our 
 wisdom not to make ourselves more enemies than we needs must.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Hadad, an Edomite, was an adversary to Solomon. We are not told what 
 he did against him, nor which way he gave him disturbance, only, in 
 general, that he was an adversary to him: but we are told, 

 (1.) What induced him to bear Solomon a grudge. David had conquered 
 Edom,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:14">2 Sam. viii. 14</A>.

 Joab put all the males to the sword, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 A terrible execution he made, avenging on Edom their old enmity to
 Israel, yet perhaps with too great a severity. From this general 
 slaughter, while Joab was burying the slain (for he left not any alive 
 of their own people to bury them, and buried they must be, or they 
 would be an annoyance to the country,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:12">Ezek. xxxix. 12</A>),

 Hadad, a branch of the royal family, then a little child, was taken and
 preserved by some of the king's servants, and conveyed to Egypt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 
 They halted by the way, in Midian first, and then in Paran, where they
 furnished themselves with men, not to fight for them or force their 
 passage, but to attend them, that their young master might go into 
 Egypt with an equipage agreeable to his quality. There he was kindly 
 sheltered and entertained by Pharaoh, as a distressed prince, as well 
 provided for, and so recommended himself that, in process of time, he 
 married the queen's sister 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 and by her had a child, which the queen herself conceived such a 
 kindness for that she brought him up in Pharaoh's house, among the 
 king's children.

 (2.) What enabled him to do Solomon a mischief. Upon the death of David 
 and Joab, he returned to his own country, in which, it should seem, he 
 settled and remained quiet while Solomon continued wise and watchful 
 for the public good, but from which he had opportunity of making 
 inroads upon Israel when Solomon, having sinned away his wisdom as 
 Samson did his strength (and in the same way), grew careless of public 
 affairs, was off his guard himself, and had forfeited the divine 
 protection. What vexation Hadad gave to Solomon we are not here told, 
 but only how loth Pharaoh was to part with him and how earnestly he 
 solicited his stay 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>What hast thou lacked with me?</I> "Nothing," says Hadad; "but let 
 me go to my own country, my native air, my native soil." Peter Martyr 
 has a pious reflection upon this: "Heaven is our home, and we ought to 
 keep up a holy affection to that, and desire towards it, even when the 
 world, the place of our banishment, smiles most upon us." Does it ask, 
 What have you lacked, that you are so willing to be gone? We may 
 answer, "Nothing that the world can do for us; but still let us go 
 thither, where our hope, and honour, and treasure are."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Rezon, a Syrian, was another adversary to Solomon. When David 
 conquered the Syrians, he headed the remains, lived at large by spoil 
 and rapine, till Solomon grew careless, and then he got possession of 
 Damascus, reigned there 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>)

 and over the country about 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 and he created troubles to Israel, probably in conjunction with Hadad, 
 all the days of Solomon (namely, after his apostasy), or he was an 
 enemy to Israel during all Solomon's reign, and upon all occasions 
 vented his then impotent malice against them, but till Solomon's 
 revolt, when his defence had departed from him, he could not do them 
 any mischief. It is said of him that <I>he abhorred Israel.</I> Other 
 princes loved and admired Israel and Solomon, and courted their 
 friendship, but here was one that abhorred them. The greatest and best 
 of princes and people, however much they may in general be respected, 
 will yet perhaps be hated and abhorred by some.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>26 And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda,
 Solomon's servant, whose mother's name <I>was</I> Zeruah, a widow
 woman, even he lifted up <I>his</I> hand against the king.
 &nbsp; 27 And this <I>was</I> the cause that he lifted up <I>his</I> hand
 against the king: Solomon built Millo, <I>and</I> repaired the
 breaches of the city of David his father.
 &nbsp; 28 And the man Jeroboam <I>was</I> a mighty man of valour: and
 Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him
 ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.
 &nbsp; 29 And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of
 Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the
 way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two
 <I>were</I> alone in the field:
 &nbsp; 30 And Ahijah caught the new garment that <I>was</I> on him, and
 rent it <I>in</I> twelve pieces:
 &nbsp; 31 And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus
 saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the
 kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to
 thee:
 &nbsp; 32 (But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake,
 and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all
 the tribes of Israel:)
 &nbsp; 33 Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped
 Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the
 Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have
 not walked in my ways, to do <I>that which is</I> right in mine eyes,
 and <I>to keep</I> my statutes and my judgments, as <I>did</I> David his
 father.
 &nbsp; 34 Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand:
 but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my
 servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and
 my statutes:
 &nbsp; 35 But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will
 give it unto thee, <I>even</I> ten tribes.
 &nbsp; 36 And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my
 servant may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city
 which I have chosen me to put my name there.
 &nbsp; 37 And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all
 that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.
 &nbsp; 38 And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I
 command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do <I>that is</I> right in
 my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my
 servant did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure
 house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.
 &nbsp; 39 And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for
 ever.
 &nbsp; 40 Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam
 arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was
 in Egypt until the death of Solomon.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the first mention of that infamous name <I>Jeroboam the 
 son of Nebat, that made Israel to sin;</I> he is here brought upon the 
 stage as an adversary to Solomon, whom God had expressly told 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)
 
 that he would give the greatest part of his kingdom to his servant, and 
 Jeroboam was the man. We have here an account,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Of his extraction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 He was of the tribe of Ephraim, he next in honour to Judah. His mother
 was a widow, to whom Providence had made up the loss of a husband in a 
 son that was active and ingenious, and (we may suppose) a great support 
 and comfort to her.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Of his elevation. It was Solomon's wisdom, when he had work to do, 
 to employ proper persons in it. He observed Jeroboam to be a very 
 industrious young man, one that minded his business, took a pleasure in 
 it, and did it with all his might, and therefore he gradually advanced 
 him, till at length he made him receiver-general for the two tribes of 
 Ephraim and Manasseh, or perhaps put him into an office equivalent to 
 that of lord-lieutenant of those two counties, for he was ruler of the 
 burden, or tribute, that is, either of the taxes or of the militia of 
 the house of Joseph. Note, Industry is the way to preferment. <I>Seest 
 thou a man diligent in his business,</I> that will take care and pains, 
 and go through with it? he shall <I>stand before kings,</I> and not 
 always be on the level with mean men. Observe a difference between 
 David, and both his predecessor and his successor: when Saul saw a 
 <I>valiant man he took him to himself</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:52">1 Sam. xiv. 52</A>);

 when Solomon saw an <I>industrious</I> man he preferred him; but
 David's <I>eyes were upon the faithful in the land,</I> that they might 
 <I>dwell with him:</I> if he saw a godly man, he preferred him, for he 
 was a man after God's own heart, whose <I>countenance beholds the 
 upright.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Of his designation to the government of the ten tribes after the 
 death of Solomon. Some think he was himself plotting against Solomon, 
 and contriving to rise to the throne, that he was turbulent and 
 aspiring. The Jews say that when he was employed by Solomon in building 
 Millo he took opportunities of reflecting upon Solomon as oppressive to 
 his people, and suggesting that which would alienate them from his 
 government. It is not indeed probable that he should say much to that 
 purport, for Solomon would have got notice of it, and it would have 
 hindered his preferment; but it is plainly intimated that he had it in 
 his thoughts, for the prophet tells him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>),

 <I>Thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth.</I> But 
 this was the <I>cause,</I> or rather this was the <I>story,</I> of the 
 lifting up of his hand against the king: Solomon made him ruler over 
 the tribes of Joseph, and, as he was going to take possession of his 
 government, he was told by a prophet in God's name that he should be 
 king, which emboldened him to aim high, and in some instances to oppose 
 the king and give him vexation. 

 1. The prophet by whom this message was sent was <I>Ahijah of
 Shiloh;</I> we shall read of him again,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:2"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 2</A>.

 It seems, Shiloh was not so perfectly forsaken and forgotten of God but
 that, in remembrance of the former days, it was blessed with a prophet.
 He delivered his message to Jeroboam in the way, his servants being 
 probably ordered to retire, as in a like case 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:27">1 Sam. ix. 27</A>),

 when Samuel delivered his message to Saul. God's word was not the less
 sacred and sure for being delivered to him thus obscurely, under a 
 hedge it may be. 

 2. The sign by which it was represented to him was the rending of a
 garment into twelve pieces, and giving him ten,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:30,31"><I>v.</I> 30, 31</A>.

 It is not certain whether the garment was Jeroboam's, as is commonly
 taken for granted, or Ahijah's, which is more probable: <I>He</I> (that 
 is, the prophet) <I>had clad himself with a new garment,</I> on purpose 
 that he might with it give him a sign. The rending of the kingdom from 
 Saul was signified by the rending of Samuel's mantle, not Saul's,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:27,28">1 Sam. xv. 27, 28</A>.

 And it was more significant to give Jeroboam ten pieces of that which
 was not his own before than of that which was. The prophets, both true 
 and false, used such signs, even in the New Testament, as Agabus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:10,11">Acts xxi. 10, 11</A>.

 3. The message itself, which is very particular,

 (1.) He assures him that he shall be king over ten of the twelve tribes 
 of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 The meanness of his extraction and employment shall be no hindrance to
 his advancement, when the God of Israel says (by whom kings reign), 
 <I>I will give ten tribes unto thee.</I>

 (2.) He tells him the reason; not for his good character or deserts, 
 but for the chastising of Solomon's apostasy: "Because he, and his 
 family, and many of his people with him,<I> have forsaken me, and 
 worshipped other gods,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 It was because they had done ill, not because he was likely to do much
 better. Thus Israel must know that it is not <I>for their 
 righteousness</I> that they are made masters of Canaan, but for the 
 wickedness of the Canaanites,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:4">Deut. ix. 4</A>.

 Jeroboam did not deserve so good a post, but Israel deserved so bad a
 prince. In telling him that the reason why he rent the kingdom from the 
 house of Solomon was because they had forsaken God, he warns him to 
 take heed of sinning away his preferment in like manner. 

 (3.) He limits his expectations to the ten tribes only, and to them in 
 reversion after the death of Solomon, lest he should aim at the whole 
 and give immediate disturbance to Solomon's government. He is here 
 told, 

 [1.] That two tribes (called here <I>one tribe,</I> because little 
 Benjamin was in a manner lost in the thousands of Judah) should remain 
 sure to the house of David, and he must never make any attempt upon 
 them: <I>He shall have one tribe</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),
 
 and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>),
 
 <I>That David may have a lamp,</I> that is, a shining name and memory 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:17">Ps. cxxxii. 17</A>),

 and his family, as a royal family, may not be extinct. He must not
 think that David was rejected, as Saul was. No, God would not take his 
 loving-kindness from him, as he did from Saul. The house of David must 
 be supported and kept in reputation, for all this, because out of it 
 the Messiah must arise. <I>Destroy it not,</I> for that <I>blessing is 
 in it.</I>

 [2.] That Solomon must keep possession during his life, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:34,35"><I>v.</I>  34, 35</A>.
 
 Jeroboam therefore must not offer to dethrone him, but wait with
 patience till his day shall come to fall. Solomon shall be <I>prince, 
 all the days of his life,</I> not for his own sake (he had forfeited 
 his crown to the justice of God), but for <I>David my servant's sake,
 because he kept my commandments.</I> Children that do not tread in 
 their parents' steps yet often fare the better in this world for their 
 good parents' piety.

 (4.) He gives him to understand that he will be upon his good
 behaviour. The grant of the crown must run <I>quamdiu se bene 
 gesserit--during good behaviour.</I> "If thou wilt <I>do what is right 
 in my sight, I will build thee a sure house,</I> and not otherwise" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:38"><I>v.</I>  38</A>),

 intimating that, if he forsook God, even his advancement to the throne
 would in time lay his family in the dust; whereas the seed of David, 
 though afflicted, should not be afflicted for ever

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>),
 
 but should flourish again, as it did in many of the illustrious kings 
 of Judah, who reigned in glory when Jeroboam's family was 
 extirpated.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Jeroboam's flight into Egypt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.

 In some way or other Solomon came to know of all this, probably from
 Jeroboam's own talk of it; he could not conceal it as Saul did, nor 
 keep his own counsel; if he had, he might have staid in his country, 
 and been preparing there for his future advancement; but letting it be 
 known,

 1. Solomon foolishly sought to kill his successor. Had not he taught
 others that, whatever devices are in men's hearts, <I>the counsel of 
 the Lord shall stand?</I> And yet does he himself think to defeat that 
 counsel? 

 2.  Jeroboam prudently withdrew into Egypt. Though God's promise would
 have secured him any where, yet he would use means for his own 
 preservation, and was content to live in exile and obscurity for a 
 while, being sure of a kingdom at last. And shall not we be so, who 
 have a better kingdom in reserve?</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>41 And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did,

 Israel <I>was</I> forty years.
 &nbsp; 43 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the
 city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his
 stead.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the conclusion of Solomon's story, and in it, 

 1. Reference is had to another history then extant, but (not being
 divinely inspired) since lost, <I>the Book of the Acts of Solomon,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>.
 
 Probably this book was written by a chronologer or historiographer,
 whom Solomon employed to write his annals, out of which the sacred 
 writer extracted what God saw fit to transmit to the church. 

 2. A summary of the years of his reign 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>):

 <I>He reigned in Jerusalem</I> (not, as his father, part of his time in 
 Hebron and part in Jerusalem), <I>over all Israel</I> (not as his son, 
 and his father in the beginning of his time, over Judah only), <I>forty 
 years.</I> His reign was as long as his father's, but not his life. Sin 
 shortened his days. 
 
 3. His death and burial, and his successor,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>.

 (1.) He followed his fathers to the grave, slept with them, and was 
 buried in David's burying-place, with honour no doubt. 

 (2.) His son followed him in the throne. Thus the graves are filling 
 with the generations that go off, and houses are filling with those 
 that are growing up. As the grave cries, "Give, give," so land is never 
 lost for want of an heir.</P>
