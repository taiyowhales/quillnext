 The idea which this chapter gives us of Samson is not what one might
 have expected concerning one who, by the special designation of heaven,
 was a Nazarite to God and a deliverer of Israel; and yet really he was
 both. Here is,

 I. Samson's courtship of a daughter of the Philistines, and his
 marriage to her,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+14:1-5,7,8">ver. 1-5, 7, 8</A>.

 II. His conquest of a lion, and the prize he found in the carcase of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+14:5,6,8,9">ver. 5, 6, 8, 9</A>.

 III. Samson's riddle proposed to his companions

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+14:10-14">ver.  10-14</A>)

 and unriddled by the treachery of his wife,

 IV. The occasion this gave him to kill thirty of the Philistines

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+14:19">ver. 19</A>)

 and to break off his new alliance,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath
 of the daughters of the Philistines.
 &nbsp; 2 And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said,
 I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the
 Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.
 &nbsp; 3 Then his father and his mother said unto him, <I>Is there</I>
 never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all
 my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised
 Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for
 she pleaseth me well.
 &nbsp; 4 But his father and his mother knew not that it <I>was</I> of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at
 that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.
 &nbsp; 5 Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to
 Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a
 young lion roared against him.
 &nbsp; 6 And the Spirit of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came mightily upon him, and he
 rent him as he would have rent a kid, and <I>he had</I> nothing in his
 hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.
 &nbsp; 7 And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased
 Samson well.
 &nbsp; 8 And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside
 to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, <I>there was</I> a swarm
 of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion.
 &nbsp; 9 And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and
 came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did
 eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the
 carcase of the lion.

 Here, 

 I. Samson, under the extraordinary guidance of Providence, seeks an 
 occasion of quarrelling with the Philistines, by joining in affinity 
 with them--a strange method, but the truth is Samson was himself a 
 riddle, a paradox of a man, did that which was really great and good, 
 by that which was seemingly weak and evil, because he was designed not 
 to be a pattern to us (who must walk by rule, not by example), but a 
 type of him who, though he knew no sin, was made sin for us, and 
 appeared <I>in the likeness of sinful flesh,</I> that he might 
 <I>condemn</I> and <I>destroy sin in the flesh,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:3">Rom.  viii. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. As the negotiation of Samson's marriage was a common case, we may 
 observe, 

 (1.) That is was weakly and foolishly done of him to set his affections 
 upon a daughter of the Philistines; the thing appeared very improper. 
 Shall one that is not only an Israelite, but a Nazarite, devoted to the 
 Lord, covet to become one with a worshipper of Dagon?  Shall one marked 
 for a patriot of his country match among those that are its sworn 
 enemies? He saw this woman 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 and she <I>pleased him well,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:3"><I>v.</I>  3</A>.

 It does not appear that he had any reason to think her wise or 
 virtuous, or in any way likely to be a help-meet for him; but he saw 
 something in her face that was very agreeable to his fancy, and 
 therefore nothing will serve but she must be his wife. He that in the 
 choice of a wife is guided only by his eye, and governed by his fancy, 
 must afterwards thank himself if he find a Philistine in his arms.

 (2.) Yet it was wisely and well done not to proceed so much as to make 
 his addresses to her till he had first made his parents acquainted with 
 the matter. He told them, and desired them to <I>get her for him to 
 wife,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Herein he is an example to all children. Conformably to the law of the 
 fifth commandment, children ought not to marry, nor to move towards 
 marrying, without the advice and consent of their parents; those that 
 do (as bishop Hall here expresses it) <I>wilfully unchild themselves, 
 and exchange natural affections for violent.</I> parents have a 
 property in their children as parts of themselves.  In marriage this 
 property is transferred; for such is the law of the relation that <I>a 
 man shall leave his father and his mother and cleave to his wife.</I> 
 It is therefore not only unkind and ungrateful, but very unjust, to 
 alienate this property without their concurrence; whoso thus <I>robbeth 
 his father or mother,</I> stealing himself from them, who is nearer and 
 dearer to them than their goods, <I>and</I> yet <I>saith, It is no 
 transgression, the same is the companion of a destroyer,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:24">Prov. xxviii. 24</A>.

 (3.) His parents did well to dissuade him from yoking himself thus
 unequally with unbelievers. Let those who profess religion, but are 
 courting an affinity with the profane and irreligious, matching into 
 families where they have reason to think the fear of God is not, nor 
 the worship of God, let them hear their reasoning, and apply it to 
 themselves: "<I>Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy 
 brethren,</I> or, if none of our tribe, <I>never a one among all thy 
 people,</I> never an Israelite, that pleases thee, or that thou canst 
 think worthy of thy affection, that thou shouldest marry a Philistine?" 
 In the old world the sons of God corrupted and ruined themselves, their 
 families, and that truly primitive church, by marrying with the 
 <I>daughters of men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:2">Gen. vi. 2</A>.

 God had forbidden the people of Israel to marry with the devoted
 nations, one of which the Philistines were,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:3">Deut. vii. 3</A>.

 (4.) If there had not been a special reason for it, it certainly would
 have been improper in him to insist upon his choice, and in them to 
 agree to it at last. Yet their tender compliance with his affections 
 may be observed as an example to parents not to be unreasonable in 
 crossing their children's choices, nor to deny their consent, 
 especially to those that have seasonably and dutifully asked it, 
 without some very good cause. As children must <I>obey their parents in 
 the Lord,</I> so parents must not <I>provoke their children to wrath, 
 lest they be discouraged.</I> This Nazarite, in his subjection to his 
 parents, asking their consent, and not proceeding till he had it, was 
 not only an example to all children, but a type of the holy child 
 Jesus, who <I>went down with his parents to Nazareth</I> (thence called 
 a <I>Nazarene</I>) and was subject to them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:51">Luke  ii. 51</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. But this treaty of marriage is expressly said to be <I>of the 
 Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Not only that God afterwards overruled it to serve his designs against 
 the Philistines, but that he put it into Samson's heart to make this 
 choice, that he <I>might have occasion against the Philistine.</I> It 
 was not a thing evil in itself for him to marry a Philistine. It was 
 forbidden because of the danger of receiving hurt by idolaters; where 
 there was not only no danger of that kind, but an opportunity hoped for 
 of doing that hurt to them which would be good service to Israel, the 
 law might well be dispense with. It was said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:25"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 25</A>)

 that <I>the Spirit of the Lord began to move him at times,</I> and we
 have reason to think he himself perceived that Spirit to move him at 
 this time, when he made this choice, and that otherwise he would have 
 yielded to his parents' dissuasives, nor would they have consented at 
 last if he had not satisfied them it was <I>of the Lord.</I> This would 
 bring him into acquaintance and converse with the Philistines, by which 
 he might have such opportunities of galling them as otherwise he could 
 not have. It should seem, the way in which the Philistines oppressed 
 Israel was, not by great armies, but by the clandestine incursions of 
 their giants and small parties of their plunderers. In the same way 
 therefore Samson must deal with them; let him but by this marriage get 
 among them, and he would be a <I>thorn in their sides.</I> Jesus 
 Christ, having to deliver us from this present evil world, and to cast 
 out the prince of it, did himself visit it, though full of pollution 
 and enmity, and, by assuming a body, did in some sense join in affinity 
 with it, that he might destroy our spiritual enemies, and his own arm 
 might work the salvation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Samson, by a special providence, is animated and encouraged to 
 attack the Philistines. That being the service for which he was 
 designed, God, when he called him to it, prepared him for it by two 
 occurrences:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. By enabling him, in one journey to Timnath, to <I>kill a lion,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 Many decline doing the service they might do because they <I>know not 
 their own strength.</I> God let Samson know what he could do in the 
 strength of the <I>Spirit of the Lord,</I> that he might never be 
 afraid to look the greatest difficulties in the face. David, who was to 
 complete the destruction of the Philistines, must try his hand first 
 upon <I>a lion and a bear,</I> that thence he might infer, as we may 
 suppose Samson did, that the uncircumcised Philistine should be as one 
 of them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:36">1 Sam. xvii. 36</A>.

 (1.) Samson's encounter with the lion was hazardous. It was a young
 lion, one of the fiercest sort, that set upon him, roaring for his 
 prey, and setting his eye particularly upon him; <I>he roared in 
 meeting him,</I> so the word is. He was all alone in the vineyards, 
 whither he had rambled from his father and mother (who kept the high 
 road), probably to eat grapes. Children consider not how they expose 
 themselves to the roaring lion that seeks to devour when, out of a 
 foolish fondness for liberty, they wander from under the eye and wing 
 of their prudent pious parents. Nor do young people consider what lions 
 lurk in the vineyards, the vineyards of red wines, as dangerous as 
 snakes under the green grass. Had Samson met with this lion in the way, 
 he might have had more reason to expect help both from God and man than 
 here in the solitary vineyards, out of his road. But there was a 
 special providence in it, and the more hazardous the encounter was, 
 
 (2.) The victory was so much the more illustrious. It was obtained 
 without any difficulty: he strangled the lion, and tore his throat as 
 easily as he would have strangled a kid, yet without any instrument, 
 not only no sword nor bow, but not so much as a staff or knife; he had 
 <I>nothing in his hand.</I> Christ engaged the roaring lion, and 
 conquered him in the beginning of his public work

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:1-11">Matt. iv. 1</A>,

 &c.), and afterwards spoiled principalities and powers, triumphing over
 them <I>in himself,</I> as some read it, not by any instrument. He was 
 <I>exalted in his own strength.</I> That which added much to the glory 
 of Samson's triumph over the lion was that when he had done this great 
 exploit he did not boast of it, did <I>not so much as tell his father 
 nor mother</I> that which many a one would soon have published through 
 the whole country. Modesty and humility make up the brightest crown of 
 great performances.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. By providing him, the next journey, with honey in the carcase of 
 this lion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 When he came down the next time to solemnize his nuptials, and his 
 parents with him, he had the curiosity to turn aside into the vineyard 
 where he had killed the lion, perhaps that with the sight of the place 
 he might affect himself with the mercy of that great deliverance, and 
 might there solemnly give thanks to God for it. It is good thus to 
 <I>remind ourselves</I> of God's former favours to us.  There he found 
 the carcase of the lion; the birds or beasts of prey, it is likely, had 
 eaten the flesh, and in the skeleton a swarm of bees had knit, and made 
 a hive of it, and had not been idle, but had there laid up a good stock 
 of honey, which was one of the staple commodities of Canaan; such 
 plenty there was of it that the land is said to <I>flow with milk and 
 honey.</I> Samson, having a better title than any man to the hive, 
 seizes the honey with his hands. This supposes an encounter with the 
 bees; but he that dreaded not lion's paws had no reason to fear 
 <I>their</I> stings. As by his victory over the lion he was emboldened 
 to encounter the Philistine-giants, if there should be occasion, 
 notwithstanding their strength and fierceness, so by dislodging the 
 bees he was taught not to fear the multitude of the Philistines; though 
 they <I>compassed him about like bees, yet in the name of the Lord he 
 should destroy them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+118:12">Ps. cxviii. 12</A>.
 
 Of the honey he here found,

 (1.) He ate himself, asking no questions for conscience' sake; for the 
 dead bones of an unclean beast had not that ceremonial pollution in 
 them that the bones of a man had. John Baptist, that Nazarite of the 
 New Testament, lived upon wild honey. 

 (2.) He gave to his parents, and they did eat; he did not eat all 
 himself. <I>Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for 
 thee,</I> and no more, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:16">Prov. xxv. 16</A>.

 He let his parents share with him.  Children should be grateful to 
 their parents with the fruits of their own industry, and so <I>show 
 piety at home,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:4">1 Tim. v. 4</A>.

 Let those that by the grace of God have found sweetness in religion
 themselves communicate their experience to their friends and relations, 
 and invite them to come and share with them. He told not his parents 
 whence he had it, lest they should scruple eating it. Bishop Hall 
 observes here that <I>those are less wise and more scrupulous than 
 Samson that decline the use of God's gifts because they find them in 
 ill vessels.</I> Honey is hone still, though in a dead lion. Our Lord 
 Jesus having conquered Satan, that roaring lion, believers find honey 
 in the carcase, abundant strength and satisfaction, enough for 
 themselves and for all their friends, from that victory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10 So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made
 there a feast; for so used the young men to do.
 &nbsp; 11 And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought
 thirty companions to be with him.
 &nbsp; 12 And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle
 unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days
 of the feast, and find <I>it</I> out, then I will give you thirty
 sheets and thirty change of garments:
 &nbsp; 13 But if ye cannot declare <I>it</I> me, then shall ye give me
 thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto
 him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.
 &nbsp; 14 And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and
 out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in
 three days expound the riddle.
 &nbsp; 15 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto
 Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us
 the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire:
 have ye called us to take that we have? <I>is it</I> not <I>so?</I>
 &nbsp; 16 And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but
 hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the
 children of my people, and hast not told <I>it</I> me. And he said
 unto her, Behold, I have not told <I>it</I> my father nor my mother,
 and shall I tell <I>it</I> thee?
 &nbsp; 17 And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast
 lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her,
 because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the
 children of her people.
 &nbsp; 18 And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day
 before the sun went down, What <I>is</I> sweeter than honey? and what
 <I>is</I> stronger than a lion? And he said unto them, If ye had not
 plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.
 &nbsp; 19 And the Spirit of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came upon him, and he went down
 to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil,
 and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle.
 And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.
 &nbsp; 20 But Samson's wife was <I>given</I> to his companion, whom he had
 used as his friend.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of Samson's wedding feast and the occasion it 
 gave him to fall foul upon the Philistines.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Samson conformed to the custom of the country in making a festival 
 of his nuptial solemnities, which continued seven days, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Though he was a Nazarite, he did not affect, in a thing of this nature, 
 to be singular, but did <I>as the young men used to do</I> upon such 
 occasions. It is no part of religion to go contrary to the innocent 
 usages of the places where we live: nay, it is a reproach to religion 
 when those who profess it give just occasion to others to call them 
 covetous, sneaking, and morose. A good man should strive to make 
 himself, in the best sense, a good companion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His wife's relations paid him the accustomed respect of the place 
 upon that occasion, and brought him thirty young men to keep him 
 company during the solemnity, and to attend him as his grooms-men 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>When they saw him,</I> what a comely man he was, and what an 
 ingenuous graceful look he had, they brought him these to do him 
 honour, and to improve by his conversation while he staid among them.  
 Or, rather, when they saw him, what a strong stout man he was, they 
 brought these, seemingly to be his companions, but really to be a guard 
 upon him, or spies to observe him. Jealous enough they were of him, but 
 would have been more so had they known of his victory over the lion, 
 which therefore he had industriously concealed. The favours of 
 Philistines have often some mischief or other designed in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Samson, to entertain the company, propounds a riddle to them, and 
 lays a wager with them that they cannot find it out in seven days, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:12-14"><I>v.</I>  12-14</A>.

 The usage, it seems, was very ancient upon such occasions, when friends 
 were together, to be innocently merry, not to spend all the time in 
 dull eating and drinking, as bishop Patrick expresses it, or in other 
 gratifications of sense, as music, dancing, or shows, but to propose 
 questions, by which their learning and ingenuity might be tried and 
 improved.  This becomes men, wise men, that value themselves by their 
 reason; but very unlike to it are the infamous and worse than brutish 
 entertainments of this degenerate age, which send nothing round but the 
 glass and the health, till reason is drowned, and wisdom sunk.  Now, 

 1.  Samson's riddle was his own invention, for it was his own
 achievement that gave occasion for it: <I>Out of the eater came forth 
 meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness.</I> Read my riddle, 
 what is this?  Beasts of prey do not yield meat for man, yet <I>food 
 came from the devourer;</I> and those creatures that are strong when 
 they are alive commonly smell strong and are every way offensive when 
 they are dead, as horses, and yet <I>out of the strong,</I> or out of 
 <I>the bitter,</I> so the Syriac and Arabic read it, <I>came 
 sweetness.</I> If they had but so much sense as to consider what eater 
 is most strong, and what meat is most sweet, they would have found out 
 the riddle, and neither lions nor honey were such strangers to their 
 country that the thoughts of them needed to be out of the way; and the 
 solving of the riddle would have given him occasion to tell them the 
 entertaining story on which it was founded. This riddle is applicable 
 to many of the methods of divine providence and grace. When God, by an 
 over-ruling providence, brings good out of evil to his church and 
 people,--when that which threatened their ruin turns to their 
 advantage,--when their enemies are made serviceable to them, and the 
 wrath of men turns to God's praise,--then comes <I>meat out of the 
 eater</I> and <I>sweetness out of the strong.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:12">Phil. i. 12</A>.

 2.  His water was more considerable to him than to them, because he was
 one against thirty partners. It was not a wager laid upon God's 
 providence, or upon the chance of a die or a card, but upon their 
 ingenuity, and amounted to no more than an honorary recompence of wit 
 and a disgrace upon stupidity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. His companions, when they could not expound the riddle themselves, 
 obliged his wife to get from him the exposition of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Whether they were really of a dull capacity, or whether under a 
 particular infatuation at this time, it was strange that none of the 
 thirty could in all this time stumble upon so plain a thing as that, 
 <I>What is sweeter than honey</I> and <I>what stronger than a lion?</I> 
 It should seem that in wit, as well as manners, they were 
 barbarous--barbarous indeed to threaten the bride that, if she would 
 not use means with the bridegroom to let them into the meaning of it, 
 they would <I>burn her and her father's house with fire.</I> Could any 
 thing be more brutish?  It was base enough to turn a jest into earnest, 
 and those were unworthy of conversation that would grow so outrageous 
 rather than confess their ignorance and lose so small a wager; nor 
 would it save their credit at all to tell the riddle when they were 
 told it. It was yet more villainous to engage Samson's wife to be a 
 traitor to her own husband, and to pretend a greater interest in her 
 than he had. Now that she was married she must <I>forget her own 
 people.</I> Yet most inhuman of all was it to threaten, if she could 
 not prevail, to burn her and all her relations with fire, and all for 
 fear of losing each of them the value of a shirt and a coat: <I>Have 
 you called us to take what we have?</I> Those must never lay wagers 
 that cannot lose more tamely and easily than thus.</P>

 V. His wife, by unreasonable importunity, obtains from him a key to his 
 riddle. It was <I>on the seventh day,</I> that is, the seventh day of 
 the week (as Dr. Lightfoot conjectures), but the fourth day of the 
 feast, that they solicited her to entice her husband 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 and she did it, 
 
 1. With great art and management

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 resolving not to believe he loved her, unless he would gratify her in
 this thing. She knew he could not bear to have his love questioned, and 
 therefore, if any thing would work upon him, that would: "<I>Thou dost 
 but hate me, and lovest me not,</I> if thou deniest me;" whereas he had 
 much more reason to say, "Thou dost but <I>hate me,</I> and <I>lovest 
 me not,</I> if thou insistest on it." And, that she might not make this 
 the test of his affection, he assures her he had not told his own 
 parents, notwithstanding the confidence he reposed in them. If this 
 prevail not, she will try the powerful eloquence of tears: she <I>wept 
 before him</I> the rest of <I>the days of the feast,</I> choosing 
 rather to mar the mirth, as the bride's tears must needs do, than not 
 gain her point, and oblige her countrymen,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 2. With great success. At last, being quite wearied with her 
 importunity, he told her what was the meaning of his riddle, and though 
 we may suppose she promised secresy, and that if he would but let her 
 know she would tell nobody, she immediately told it to the <I>children 
 of her people;</I> nor could he expect better from a Philistine, 
 especially when the interests of her country were ever so little 
 concerned. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:5,6">Mic. vii. 5, 6</A>.
 
 The riddle is at length <I>unriddled</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>What is sweeter than honey,</I> or a better meat? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+24:13">Prov.  xxiv. 13</A>.
 
 <I>What is stronger than a lion,</I> or a greater devourer?  Samson 
 generously owns they had won the wager, though he had good reason to 
 dispute it, because they had not declared the riddle, as the bargain 
 was 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 but it had been declared to them.  But he only thought fit to tell them 
 of it: <I>If you had not ploughed with my heifer,</I> made use of your 
 interest with my wife, <I>you would not have found out my riddle.</I> 
 Satan, in his temptations, could not do us the mischief he does if he 
 did not plough with the heifer of our own corrupt nature.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Samson pays his wager to these Philistines with the spoils of 
 others of their countrymen, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 He took this occasion to quarrel with the Philistines, went down to 
 Ashkelon, one of their cities, where probably he knew there was some 
 great festival observed at this time, to which many flocked, out of 
 whom he picked out thirty, slew them, and took their clothes, and gave 
 them to those that had expounded the riddle; so that, in balancing the 
 account, it appeared that the Philistines were the losers, for one of 
 the lives they lost was worth all the suits of clothes they won: the 
 body is more than raiment.  <I>The Spirit of the Lord came upon 
 him,</I> both to authorize and to enable him to do this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. This proves a good occasion of weaning Samson from his new 
 relations. He found how his companions had abused him and how his wife 
 had betrayed him, and therefore <I>his anger was kindled,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Better be angry with Philistines than in love with them, because, when 
 we join ourselves to them, we are most in danger of being ensnared by 
 them. And, meeting with this ill usage among them, he <I>went up to his 
 father's house.</I> It were well for us if the unkindnesses we meet 
 with from the world, and our disappointments in it, had but this good 
 effect upon us, to oblige us by faith and prayer to return to our 
 heavenly Father's house and rest there. The inconveniences that occur 
 in our way should make us love home and long to be there. No sooner had 
 he gone than his wife was disposed of to another, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Instead of begging his pardon for the wrong she had done him, when he 
 justly signified his resentment of it only by withdrawing in 
 displeasure for a time, she immediately marries him that was the chief 
 of the guests, the friend of the bridegroom, whom perhaps she loved too 
 well, and was too willing to oblige, when she got her husband to tell 
 her the riddle. See how little confidence is to be put in man, when 
 those may prove our enemies whom we have used as our friends.</P>
