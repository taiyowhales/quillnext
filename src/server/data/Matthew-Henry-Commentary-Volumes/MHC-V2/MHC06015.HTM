 Though the land was not completely conquered, yet being (as was said in 
 the close of the foregoing chapter) as rest from war for the present, 
 and their armies all drawn out of the field to a general rendezvous at
 Gilgal, there they began to divide the land, though the work was
 afterwards perfected at Shiloh,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 <I>This</I> then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah
 by their families; <I>even</I> to the border of Edom the wilderness of
 Zin southward <I>was</I> the uttermost part of the south coast.
 &nbsp; 2 And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea,
 from the bay that looketh southward:
 &nbsp; 3 And it went out to the south side to Maaleh-acrabbim, and
 passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto
 Kadesh-barnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar,
 and fetched a compass to Karkaa:
 &nbsp; 4 <I>From thence</I> it passed toward Azmon, and went out unto the
 river of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea:
 this shall be your south coast.
 &nbsp; 5 And the east border <I>was</I> the salt sea, <I>even</I> unto the end
 of Jordan. And <I>their</I> border in the north quarter <I>was</I> from the
 bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan:
 &nbsp; 6 And the border went up to Beth-hogla, and passed along by the
 north of Beth-arabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan
 the son of Reuben:
 &nbsp; 7 And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor,
 and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that <I>is</I> before the
 going up to Adummim, which <I>is</I> on the south side of the river:
 and the border passed toward the waters of En-shemesh, and the
 goings out thereof were at En-rogel:
 &nbsp; 8 And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom
 unto the south side of the Jebusite; the same <I>is</I> Jerusalem: and
 the border went up to the top of the mountain that <I>lieth</I> before
 the valley of Hinnom westward, which <I>is</I> at the end of the
 valley of the giants northward:
 &nbsp; 9 And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the
 fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of
 mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which <I>is</I>
 Kirjath-jearim:
 &nbsp; 10 And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount
 Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which <I>is</I>
 Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Beth-shemesh, and
 passed on to Timnah:
 &nbsp; 11 And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward:
 and the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount
 Baalah, and went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the
 border were at the sea.
 &nbsp; 12 And the west border <I>was</I> to the great sea, and the coast
 <I>thereof.</I> This <I>is</I> the coast of the children of Judah round
 about according to their families.

 Judah and Joseph were the two sons of Jacob on whom Reuben's forfeited 
 birth-right devolved. Judah had the dominion entailed on him, and 
 Joseph the double portion, and therefore these two tribes were first 
 seated, Judah in the southern part of the land of Canaan and Joseph in 
 the northern part, and on them the other seven did attend, and had 
 their respective lots as appurtenances to these two; the lots of 
 Benjamin, Simeon, and Dan, were appendant to Judah, and those of 
 Issachar and Zebulun, Naphtali and Asher, to Joseph. These two were 
 first set up to be provided for, it should seem, before there was such 
 an exact survey of the land as we find afterwards, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+18:9"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 9</A>.

 It is probable that the most considerable parts of the northern and
 southern countries, and those that lay nearest to Gilgal, and which the 
 people were best acquainted with, were first put into two portions, and 
 the lot was cast upon them between these two principal tribes, of the 
 one of which Joshua was, and of the other Caleb, who was the first 
 commissioner in this writ of partition; and, by the decision of that 
 lot, the southern country, of which we have an account in this chapter, 
 fell to Judah, and the northern, of which we have an account in the two 
 following chapters, to Joseph. And when this was done there was a more 
 equal dividend (either in quantity or quality) of the remainder among 
 the seven tribes. And this, probably, was intended in that general rule 
 which was given concerning this partition 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+33:54">Num. xxxiii. 54</A>),

 <I>to the more you shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer
 you shall give the less,</I> and <I>every man's inheritance shall be 
 where his lot falleth;</I> that is, "You shall appoint two greater 
 portions which shall be determined by lot to those more numerous tribes 
 of Judah and Joseph, and then the rest shall be less portions to be 
 allotted to the less numerous tribes." The former was done in Gilgal, 
 the latter in Shiloh.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses, we have the borders of the lot of Judah, which, as the 
 rest, is said to be <I>by their families,</I> that is, with an eye to 
 the number of their families. And it intimates that Joshua and Eleazar, 
 and the rest of the commissioners, when they had by lot given each 
 tribe its portion, did afterwards (it is probable by lot likewise) 
 subdivide those larger portions, and assign to each family its 
 inheritance, and then to each household, which would be better done by 
 this supreme authority, and be apt to give less disgust than if it had 
 been left to the inferior magistrates of each tribe to make that 
 distribution. The borders of this tribe are here largely fixed, yet not 
 unalterably, for a good deal of that which lies within these bounds was 
 afterwards assigned to the lots of Simeon and Dan. 

 1. The eastern border was all, and only, the Salt Sea, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Every sea is salt, but this was of an extraordinary and more than
 natural saltness, the effects of that fire and brimstone with which 
 Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed in Abraham's time, whose ruins lie 
 buried in the bottom of this dead water, which never either was moved 
 itself or had any living thing in it.

 2. The southern border was that of the land of Canaan in general, as
 will appear by comparing 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:1-4,Nu+34;3-5"><I>v.</I> 1-4 with Num. xxxiv. 3-5</A>.

 So that this powerful and warlike tribe of Judah guarded the frontiers
 of the whole land, on that side which lay towards their old sworn 
 enemies (though their two fathers were twin-brethren), the Edomites. 
 Our Lord therefore, who <I>sprang out of Judah,</I> and whose <I>the 
 kingdom is, shall judge the mount of Esau,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:21">Obad. 21</A>.

 3. The northern border divided it from the lot of Benjamin. In this,
 mention is made of <I>the stone of Bohan</I> a Reubenite 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 who probably was a great commander of those forces of Reuben that came
 over Jordan, and died in the camp at Gilgal, and was buried not far off 
 under this stone. The valley of Achor likewise lies upon this border

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 to remind the men of Judah of the trouble which Achan, one of their
 tribe, gave to the congregation of Israel, that they might not be too 
 much lifted up with their services. This northern line touched closely 
 upon Jerusalem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 so closely as to include in the lot of this tribe Mount Zion and Mount
 Moriah, though the greater part of the city lay in the lot of Benjamin.

 4. The west border went near to the great sea at first

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 but afterwards the lot of the tribe of Dan took off a good part of
 Judah's lot on that side; for the lot was only to determine between 
 Judah and Joseph, which should have the north and which the south, and 
 not immovably to fix the border of either. Judah's inheritance had its 
 boundaries determined. Though it was a powerful warlike tribe, and had 
 a great interest in the other tribes, yet they must not therefore be 
 left to their own choice, to enlarge their possessions at pleasure, but 
 must live so as that their neighbours might live by them. Those that 
 are placed high yet must not think to be <I>placed alone in the midst 
 of the earth.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13 And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the
 children of Judah, according to the commandment of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> to
 Joshua, <I>even</I> the city of Arba the father of Anak, which <I>city
 is</I> Hebron.
 &nbsp; 14 And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and
 Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.
 &nbsp; 15 And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the
 name of Debir before <I>was</I> Kirjath-sepher.
 &nbsp; 16 And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher, and taketh
 it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.
 &nbsp; 17 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it:
 and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.
 &nbsp; 18 And it came to pass, as she came <I>unto him,</I> that she moved
 him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off <I>her</I> ass;
 and Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou?
 &nbsp; 19 Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a
 south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the
 upper springs, and the nether springs.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The historian seems pleased with every occasion to make mention of 
 Caleb and to do him honour, because he had honoured God in following 
 him fully.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The grant Joshua made him of the mountain of Hebron for his 
 inheritance is here repeated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 and it is said to be given him.  

 1. <I>According to the commandment of the Lord to Joshua.</I> Though
 Caleb, in his petition, had made out a very good title to it by 
 promise, yet, because God had ordered Joshua to divide the land by lot, 
 he would not in this one single instance, no, not to gratify his old 
 friend Caleb, do otherwise, without orders from God, whose oracle, it 
 is probable, he consulted upon this occasion. In every doubtful case it 
 is very desirable to know the mind of God, and to see the way of our 
 duty plain. 

 2. It is said to be a part <I>among the children of Judah;</I> though
 it was assigned him before the lot of that tribe came up, yet it 
 proved, God so directing the lot, to be in the heart of that tribe, 
 which was graciously ordered in kindness to him, that he might not be 
 as one separated from his brethren and surrounded by those of other 
 tribes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Caleb having obtained this grant, we are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How he signalized his own valour in the conquest of Hebron 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):
 
 <I>He drove thence the three sons of Anak,</I> he and those that he
 engaged to assist him in this service. This is mentioned here to show 
 that the confidence he had expressed of success in this affair, through 
 the presence of God with him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+14:12"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 12</A>),

 did not deceive him, but the event answered his expectation. It is not
 said that he <I>slew these giants,</I> but he <I>drove them thence,</I> 
 which intimates that they retired upon his approach and fled before 
 him; the strength and stature of their bodies could not keep up the 
 courage of their minds, but with the countenances of lions they had the 
 hearts of trembling hares. Thus does God often <I>cut off the spirit of 
 princes</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:12">Ps. lxxvi. 12</A>),

 <I>take away the heart of the chief of the people</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:24">Job xii. 24</A>),

 and so shame the confidence of the proud; and thus if we resist the
 devil, that roaring lion, though he fall not, yet he will flee.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How he encouraged the valour of those about him in the conquest of 
 Debir, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:15-19"><I>v.</I> 15</A>,

 &c. It seems, though Joshua had once made himself master
 of Debir 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:39"><I>ch.</I> x. 39</A>),

 yet the Canaanites had regained the possession in the absence of the
 army, so that the work had to be done a second time; and when Caleb had 
 completed the reduction of Hebron, which was for himself and his own 
 family, to show his zeal for the public good, as much as for his own 
 private interest, he pushes on his conquest to Debir, and will not lay 
 down his arms till he sees that city also effectually reduced, which 
 lay but ten miles southward from Hebron, though he had not any 
 particular concern in it, but the reducing of it would be to the 
 general advantage of his tribe. Let us learn hence not to seek and mind 
 our own things only, but to concern and engage ourselves for the 
 welfare of the community we are members of; we are not born for 
 ourselves, nor must we <I>live to ourselves.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Notice is taken of the name of this city. It had been called 
 <I>Kirjath-sepher, the city of a book,</I> and <I>Kirjath-sannah</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>),

 which some translate <I>the city of learning</I> (so the LXX.
 <B><I>Polis grammaton</I></B>), whence some conjecture that it had been 
 a university among the Canaanites, like Athens in Greece, in which 
 their youth were educated; or perhaps the books of their chronicles or 
 records, or the antiquities of the nation, were laid up there; and, it 
 may be, this was it that made Caleb so desirous to see Israel master of 
 this city, that they might get acquainted with the ancient learning of 
 the Canaanites.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The proffer that Caleb made of his daughter, and a good portion 
 with her, to any one that would undertake to reduce that city, and to 
 command the forces that should be employed in that service, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Thus Saul promised a daughter to him that would kill Goliath

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:25">1 Sam. xvii. 25</A>),
 
 neither of them intending to force his daughter to marry such as she
 could not love, but both of them presuming upon their daughters' 
 obedience, and submission to their fathers' will, though it might be 
 contrary to their own humour or inclination. Caleb's family was not 
 long honourable and wealthy, but religious; he that himself <I>followed 
 the Lord fully</I> no doubt taught his children to do so, and therefore 
 it could not but be a desirable match to any young gentleman.  Caleb, 
 in making the proposal, aims, 

 [1.] To do service to his country by the reducing of that important
 place; and, 

 [2.] To marry a daughter well, to a man of learning, that would have a
 particular affection for <I>the city of books,</I> and a man of war, 
 that would be likely to serve his country, and do worthily in his 
 generation. Could he but marry his child to a man of such a character, 
 he would think her well bestowed, whether the share in the lot of his 
 tribe were more or less.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The place was bravely taken by Othniel, a nephew of Caleb, whom 
 probably Caleb had thoughts of when he made the proffer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 This Othniel, who thus signalized himself when he was young, had long
 after, in his advanced years, the honour to be both a deliverer and a 
 judge in Israel, the first single person that presided in their affairs 
 after Joshua's death. It is good for those who are setting out in the 
 world to begin betimes with that which is great and good, that, 
 excelling in service when they are young, they may excel in honour when 
 they grow old.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) Hereupon (all parties being agreed) Othniel married his
 cousin-german Achsah, Caleb's daughter. It is probable that he had a 
 kindness for her before, which put him upon this bold undertaking to 
 obtain her. Love to his country, an ambition of honour, and a desire to 
 find favour with the princes of his people, might not have engaged him 
 in this great action, but his affection for Achsah did. This made it 
 intolerable to him to think that any one should do more to win her 
 favour than he would, and so inspired him with this generous fire. Thus 
 is love strong as death, and jealousy cruel as the grave.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) Because the historian is now upon the dividing of the land, he 
 gives us an account of Achsah's portion, which was in land, as more 
 valuable because enjoyed by virtue of the divine promise, though we may 
 suppose the conquerors of Canaan, who had had the spoil of so many rich 
 cities, were full of money too. 

 [1.] Some land she obtained by Caleb's free grant, which was allowed
 while she married within her own tribe and family, as Zelophehad's 
 daughters did. He <I>gave her a south land,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Land indeed, but <I>a south land,</I> dry, and apt to be parched.

 [2.] She obtained more upon her request; she would have had her husband
 to ask for a field, probably some particular field, or champaign 
 ground, which belonged to Caleb's lot, and joined to that south land 
 which he had settled upon his daughter at marriage. She thought her 
 husband had the best interest in her father, who, no doubt, was 
 extremely pleased with his late glorious achievement, but he thought it 
 was more proper for her to ask, and she would be more likely to 
 prevail; accordingly she did, submitting to her husband's judgment, 
 though contrary to her own; and she managed the undertaking with great 
 address. <I>First,</I> She took the opportunity when her father brought 
 her home to the house of her husband, when the satisfaction of having 
 disposed of his daughter so well would make him think nothing too much 
 to do for her.  <I>Secondly,</I> She <I>lighted off her ass,</I> in 
 token of respect and reverence to her father, whom she would honour 
 still, as much as before her marriage. She <I>cried</I> or 
 <I>sighed</I> from off her ass, so the LXX. and the vulgar Latin read 
 it; she expressed some grief and concern, that she might give her 
 father occasion to ask her what she wanted.  <I>Thirdly,</I> She calls 
 it <I>a blessing,</I> because it would add much to the comfort of her 
 settlement; and she was sure that, since she married not only with her 
 father's consent, but in obedience to his command, he would not deny 
 her his blessing.  <I>Fourthly,</I> She asks only for the <I>water,</I> 
 without which the ground she had would be of little use either for 
 tillage or pasture, but she means the field in which the springs of 
 water were. The modesty and reasonableness of her quest gave it a great 
 advantage. Earth without water would be like a tree without sap, or the 
 body of an animal without blood; therefore, when God <I>gathered the 
 waters into one place,</I> he wisely and graciously left some in every 
 place, that the earth might be enriched for the service of man. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:10-23">Ps. civ. 10</A>,

 &c. Well, Achsah gained her point; her father gave her what she
 asked, and perhaps more, for <I>he gave her the upper springs and the 
 nether springs,</I> two fields so called from the springs that were in 
 them, as we commonly distinguish between the higher field and the lower 
 field. Those who understand it but of one field, watered both with the 
 rain of heaven and the springs that issued out of the bowels of the 
 earth, give countenance to the allusion we commonly make to this, when 
 we pray for spiritual and heavenly blessings which relate to our souls 
 as blessings of the upper springs, and those which relate to the body 
 and the life that now is as blessings of the nether springs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 From this story we learn, 

 1. That it is no breach of the tenth commandment moderately to desire
 those comforts and conveniences of this life which we see attainable in 
 a fair and regular way. 

 2. That husbands and wives should mutually advise, and jointly agree,
 about that which is for the common good of their family; and much more 
 should they concur in asking of their heavenly Father the best 
 blessings, those of the upper springs. 

 3. That parents must never think that lost which is bestowed upon their
 children for their real advantage, but must be free in giving them 
 portions as well as maintenance, especially when they are dutiful.  
 Caleb had sons

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+4:15">1 Chron. iv. 15</A>),

 and yet gave thus liberally to his daughter. Those parents forget
 themselves and their relation who grudge their children what is 
 convenient for them when they can conveniently part with it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a list of the several cities that fell within the lot of 
 the tribe of Judah, which are mentioned by name, that they might know 
 their own, and both keep it and keep to it, and might neither through 
 cowardice nor sloth lose the possession of what was their own.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The cities are here named, and numbered in several classes, which 
 they then could account for the reason of better than we can now. Here 
 are, 

 1. Some that are said to be the uttermost cities <I>towards the coast
 of Edom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:21-32"><I>v.</I> 21-32</A>.

 Here are thirty-eight named, and yet said to be <I>twenty-nine</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),

 because nine of these were afterwards transferred to the lot of Simeon,
 and are reckoned as belonging to that, as appears by comparing

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+19:2-9"><I>ch.</I> xix. 2</A>,

 &c.; therefore those only are counted (though the rest are named) which
 remained to Judah.

 2. Others that are said to be <I>in the valley</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>)

 are counted to be fourteen, yet fifteen are named; but it is probable
 that Gederah and Gederathaim were either two names or two parts of one 
 and the same city. 

 3. Then sixteen are named without any head of distinction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:37-41"><I>v.</I>  37-41</A>,

 and nine more,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:42-44"><I>v.</I> 42-44</A>.

 4. Then the three Philistine-cities, Ekron, Ashdod, and Gaza, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:45-47"><I>v.</I> 45-47</A>.

 5. Cities <I>in the mountains,</I> eleven in all

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:48-51"><I>v.</I> 48-51</A>),
 
 nine more
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:52-54"><I>v.</I> 52-54</A>),
 
 ten more
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:55-57"><I>v.</I> 55-57</A>),

 six more
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:58,59"><I>v.</I> 58, 59</A>),
 
 then two
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:60"><I>v.</I> 60</A>),

 and six in the wilderness, a part of the country not so thick of
 inhabitants as some others were.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Now here, 

 1. We do not find Bethlehem, which was afterwards the city of David,
 and was ennobled by the birth of our Lord Jesus in it.  But that city, 
 which at the best was but <I>little among the thousands of Judah</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:2">Mic. v. 2</A>),

 except that it was thus dignified, was now so little as not to be
 accounted one of the cities, but perhaps was one of the villages not 
 named. Christ came to give honour to the places he was related to, not 
 to receive honour from them. 

 2. Jerusalem is said to continue in the hands of the Jebusites

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:63"><I>v.</I> 63</A>),

 <I>for the children of Judah could not drive them out,</I> through
 their sluggishness, stupidity, and unbelief. Had they attempted it with 
 vigour and resolution, we have reason to think God would not have been 
 wanting to them to give them success; but they could not do it, because 
 they would not. Jerusalem was afterwards to be the holy city, the royal 
 city, the city of the great King, the brightest ornament of all the 
 land of Israel. God has designed it should be so. It may therefore be 
 justly looked upon as a punishment of their neglect to conquer other 
 cities which God had given them that they were so long kept out of 
 this. 

 3.  Among the cities of Judah (in all 114) we meet with Libnah, which
 in Joram's days revolted, and probably set up for a free independent 
 state

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:22">2 Kings viii. 22</A>),
 
 and Lachish, where king Amaziah was slain
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:19">1 Kings xiv. 19</A>);
 
 it led the dance in idolatry 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+1:13">Mic. i. 13</A>);

 it was the <I>beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion.</I> Giloh,
 Ahithophel's town, is here mentioned, and Tekoa, of which the prophet 
 Amos was, and near which Jehoshaphat obtained that glorious victory,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+20:20-30">2 Chron. xx. 20</A>,

 &c., and Maresha, where Asa was a conqueror. Many of the cities of this 
 tribe occur in the history of David's troubles.  Adullam, Ziph, Keilah, 
 Maon, Engedi, Ziklag, here reckoned in this tribe, were places near 
 which David had most of his haunts; for, though sometimes Saul drove 
 him out from the inheritance of the Lord, yet he kept as close to it as 
 he could. The wilderness of Judah he frequented much, and in it John 
 Baptist preached, and there the kingdom of heaven commenced,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:1">Matt. iii. 1</A>.

 The riches of this country no doubt answered Jacob's blessing of this
 tribe, that he should <I>wash his garments in wine,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:11">Gen. xlix. 11</A>.

 And, in general, <I>Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall
 praise,</I> not envy.</P>
