 This chapter gives us an account of a war David has with the Ammonites 
 and the Syrians their allies, with the occasion and success of it. 

 I.  David sent a friendly embassy to Hanun king of the Ammonites, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+10:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. He, upon a base surmise that it was ill intended, abused David's
 ambassadors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+10:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>.

 III. David resenting it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+10:5">ver. 5</A>),

 and the Ammonites prepared for war against him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+10:6">ver. 6</A>.

 IV. David carried the war into their country, sent against them. Joab
 and Abishai, who addressed themselves to the battle with a great deal
 of conduct and bravery, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+10:7-12">ver. 7-12</A>.

 V. The Ammonites, and the Syrians their allies, were totally routed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+10:13,14">ver. 13, 14</A>.

 VI. The forces of the Syrians, which rallied again, were a second time
 defeated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+10:15-19">ver. 15-19</A>.

 Thus did David advance his own reputation for gratitude, in returning
 kindness, and for justice, in repaying injuries.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children
 of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.
 &nbsp; 2 Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of
 Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent to
 comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And
 David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.
 &nbsp; 3 And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun
 their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that
 he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David <I>rather</I> sent
 his servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out,
 and to overthrow it?
 &nbsp; 4 Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one
 half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle,
 <I>even</I> to their buttocks, and sent them away.
 &nbsp; 5 When they told <I>it</I> unto David, he sent to meet them, because
 the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho
 until your beards be grown, and <I>then</I> return.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The great respect David paid to his neighbour, the king of the 
 Ammonites,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+10:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 1. The inducement to it was some kindness he had formerly received from
 Nahash the deceased king. He <I>showed kindness to me,</I> says David

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+10:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 and therefore (having lately had satisfaction in showing kindness to
 Mephibosheth for his father's sake) he resolves to show kindness to his 
 son, and to keep up a friendly correspondence with him. Thus the 
 pleasure of doing one kind and generous action should excite us to 
 another. Nahash had been an enemy to Israel, a cruel enemy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:2">1 Sam. xi. 2</A>),

 and yet had shown kindness to David, perhaps only in contradiction to
 Saul, who was unkind to him: however, if David receives kindness, he is 
 not nice in examining the grounds and principles of it, but resolves 
 gratefully to return it. If a Pharisee give alms in pride, though God 
 will not reward him, yet he that receives the alms ought to return 
 thanks for it. God knows the heart, but we do not. 

 2. The particular instance of respect was sending an embassy to condole
 with him on his father's death, as is common among princes in alliance 
 with each other: <I>David sent to comfort him.</I> Note, It is a 
 comfort to children, when their parents are dead, to find that their 
 parents' friends are theirs, and that they intend to keep up an 
 acquaintance with them. It is a comfort to mourners to find that there 
 are those who mourn with them, are sensible of their loss and share 
 with them in it. It is a comfort to those who are honouring the memory 
 of their deceased relations to find there are others who likewise 
 honour it and who had a value for those whom they valued.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The great affront which Hanun the king of the Ammonites put upon 
 David in his ambassadors. 

 1. He hearkened to the spiteful suggestions of his princes, who
 insinuated that David's ambassadors, under pretence of being 
 comforters, were sent as spies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+10:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 False men are ready to think others as false as themselves; and those
 that bear ill-will to their neighbours are resolved not to believe that 
 their neighbours bear any good-will to them. They would not thus have 
 imagined that David dissembled but that they were conscious to 
 themselves that they could have dissembled, to serve a turn. Unfounded 
 suspicion argues a wicked mind. Bishop Patrick's note on this is that 
 "there is nothing so well meant but it may be ill interpreted, and is 
 wont to be so by men who love nobody but themselves." Men of the 
 greatest honour and virtue must not think it strange if they be thus 
 misrepresented. <I>Charity thinketh no evil.</I>

 2. Entertaining this vile suggestion, he basely abused David's
 ambassadors, like a man of a sordid villainous spirit, that was fitter 
 to rake a kennel than to wear a crown. If he had any reason to suspect 
 that David's messengers came on a bad design, he would have done 
 prudently enough to be upon the reserve with them, and to dismiss them 
 as soon as he could; but it is plain he only sought an occasion to put 
 the utmost disgrace he could upon them, out of an antipathy to their 
 king and their country. They were themselves men of honour, and much 
 more so as they represented the prince that sent them; they and their 
 reputation were under the special protection of the law of nations; 
 they put a confidence in the Ammonites, and came among them unarmed; 
 yet Hanun used them like rogues and vagabonds, and worse, <I>shaved off 
 the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the 
 midst,</I> to expose them to the contempt and ridicule of his servants, 
 that they might make sport with them and that these men might seem 
 vile.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. David's tender concern for his servants that were thus abused. He 
 sent to meet them, and to let them know how much he interested himself 
 in their quarrel and how soon he would avenge it, and directed them to 
 stay at Jericho, a private place, where they would not have occasion to 
 come into company, till that half of their beards which was shaved off 
 had grown to such a length that the other half might be decently cut to 
 it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+10:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The Jews wore their beards long, reckoning it an honour to appear aged
 and grave; and therefore it was not fit that persons of their rank and 
 figure should appear at court unlike their neighbours.  Change of 
 raiment, it is likely, they had with them, to put on, instead of that 
 which was cut off; but the loss of their beards would not be so soon 
 repaired; yet in time these would grow again, and all would be well. 
 Let us learn not to lay too much to heart unjust reproaches; after 
 awhile they will wear off of themselves, and turn only to the shame of 
 their authors, while the injured reputation in a little time grows 
 again, as these beards did. God will <I>bring forth thy righteousness 
 as the light,</I> therefore <I>wait patiently for him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:6,7">Ps. xxxvii. 6, 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Some have thought that David, in the indignity he received from the 
 king of Ammon, was but well enough served for courting and 
 complimenting that pagan prince, whom he knew to be an inveterate enemy 
 to Israel, and might now remember how, when he would have put out the 
 right eyes of the men of Jabesh-Gilead, he designed that, as he did 
 this, for a <I>reproach upon all Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:2">1 Sam. xi. 2</A>.

 What better usage could he expect from such a spiteful family and
 people? Why should he covet the friendship of a people whom Israel must 
 have so little to do with as that an Ammonite might not <I>enter into 
 the congregation of the Lord, even to the tenth generation?</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before
 David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of
 Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and
 of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men.
 &nbsp; 7 And when David heard of <I>it,</I> he sent Joab, and all the host
 of the mighty men.
 &nbsp; 8 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in
 array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba,
 and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Maacah, <I>were</I> by themselves in the
 field.
 &nbsp; 9 When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him
 before and behind, he chose of all the choice <I>men</I> of Israel,
 and put <I>them</I> in array against the Syrians:
 &nbsp; 10 And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of
 Abishai his brother, that he might put <I>them</I> in array against
 the children of Ammon.
 &nbsp; 11 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou
 shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for
 thee, then I will come and help thee.
 &nbsp; 12 Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people,
 and for the cities of our God: and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> do that which seemeth
 him good.
 &nbsp; 13 And Joab drew nigh, and the people that <I>were</I> with him,
 unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.
 &nbsp; 14 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were
 fled, then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the
 city. So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to
 Jerusalem.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have, 
 
 I. The preparation which the Ammonites made for war, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+10:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 They saw they had made themselves very odious to David and obnoxious to
 his just displeasure. This they might easily have foreseen when they 
 abused his ambassadors, which was no other than a challenge to war, and 
 a bold defiance of him. Yet, it seems, they had not considered how 
 unable they were, with their thousands, to meet his; for now they found 
 themselves an unequal match, and were forced to hire forces of other 
 nations into their service. Thus sinners daringly provoke God, and 
 expose themselves to his wrath, and never consider that he is 
 <I>stronger than they,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:22">1 Cor. x. 22</A>.

 The Ammonites gave the affront first, and they were the first that
 raised forces to justify it.  Had they humbled themselves, and begged 
 David's pardon, probably an honorary satisfaction might have atoned for 
 the offence. But, when they were thus desperately resolved to stand by 
 what they had done, they courted their own ruin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The speedy descent which David's forces made upon them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+10:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 When David heard of their military preparations, he sent Joab with a
 great army to attack them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+10:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Those that are at war with the Son of David not only give the
 provocation, but begin the war; for he <I>waits to be gracious,</I> but 
 they <I>strengthen themselves against him,</I> and therefore, <I>if 
 they turn not, he will whet his sword,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:12">Ps. vii. 12</A>.
 
 God has forces to send against those that set his wrath at defiance
 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:19">Isa. v. 19</A>),

 which will convince them, when it is too late, that <I>none ever
 hardened his heart against God and prospered.</I> It was David's 
 prudence to carry the war into their country, and fight them at the 
 entering in of the gate of their capital city, <I>Rabbah,</I> as some 
 think, or <I>Medeba,</I> a city in their borders, before which they 
 pitched to guard their coast,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+19:7">1 Chron. xix. 7</A>.

 Such are the terrors and desolations of war that every good prince
 will, in love to his people, keep it as much as may be at a distance 
 from them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Preparations made on both sides for an engagement. 

 1. The enemy disposed themselves into two bodies, one of Ammonites,
 which, being their own, were posted at the gate of the city; the other 
 of Syrians, whom they had taken into their pay, and who were therefore 
 posted at a distance in the field, to charge the forces of Israel in 
 the flank or rear, while the Ammonites charged them in the front, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+10:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 2. Joab, like a wise general, was soon aware of the design, and
 accordingly divided his forces: the choicest men he took under his own 
 command, to fight the Syrians, whom probably he knew to be the better 
 soldiers, and, being hired men, better versed in the arts of war, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+10:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 
 The rest of the forces he put under the command of Abishai his brother,
 to engage the Ammonites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+10:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 It should seem, Joab found the enemy so well prepared to receive them
 that his conduct and courage were never so tried as now.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Joab's speech before the battle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+10:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 It is not long, but pertinent, and brave.

 1. He prudently concerts the matter with Abishai his brother, that the
 dividing of the forces might not be the weakening of them, but that, 
 which part soever was borne hard upon, the other should come in to its 
 assistance. He supposes the worst, that one of them should be obliged 
 to give back; and in that case, upon a signal given, the other should 
 send a detachment to relieve it. Note, Mutual helpfulness is brotherly 
 duty. If occasion be, <I>thou shalt help me, and I will help thee.</I> 
 Christ's soldiers should thus strengthen one another's hands in their 
 spiritual warfare. The strong must succour and help the weak. Those 
 that through grace are conquerors over temptation must counsel, and 
 comfort, and pray for, those that are tempted.  <I>When thou art 
 converted, strengthen thy brethren,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:32">Luke xxii. 32</A>.

 The members of the natural body help one another,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:21">1 Cor. xii. 21</A>.

 2. He bravely encourages himself, and his brother, and the rest of the
 officers and soldiers, to do their utmost. Great dangers put an edge 
 upon true courage. When Joab saw the front of the battle was against 
 him, both before and behind, instead of giving orders to make an 
 honourable retreat, he animated his men to charge so much more 
 furiously: <I>Be of good courage and let us play the men,</I> not for 
 pay and preferment, for honour and fame, but <I>for our people, and for 
 the cities of our God,</I> for the public safety and welfare, in which 
 the glory of God is so much interested. <I>God and our country</I> was 
 the word. "Let us be valiant, from a principle of love to Israel, that 
 are our people, descended from the same stock, for whom we are 
 employed, and in whose peace we shall have peace; and from a principle 
 of love to God, for they are his cities that we are fighting in the 
 defence of." The relation which any person or thing stands in to God 
 should endear it to us, and engage us to do our utmost in its service.  
 
 3. He piously leaves the issue with God: "When we have done our part,
 according to the duty of our place, <I>let the Lord do that which 
 seemeth to him good.</I>" Let nothing be wanting in us, whatever the 
 success be; let God's work be done by us, and then God's will be done 
 concerning us.  When we make conscience of doing our duty we may, with 
 the greatest satisfaction, leave the event with God, not thinking that 
 our valour binds him to prosper us, but that still he may do as he 
 pleases, yet hoping for his salvation in his own way and time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The victory Joab obtained over the confederate forces of Syria and 
 Ammon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+10:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 He provided for the worst, and put the case that the Syrians and
 Ammonites might prove too strong for him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+10:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 but he proved too strong for them both. We do not hinder our success by
 preparing for disappointment. The Syrians were first routed by Joab, 
 and then the Ammonites by Abishai; the Ammonites seem not to have 
 fought at all, but, upon the retreat of the Syrians, to have fled into 
 the city. It is a temptation to soldiers to fly when they have a city 
 at their backs to fly to. It is one thing when men may either fight or 
 fly and another thing when they must either fight or die.</P>

 <A NAME="2Sa10_19"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before
 Israel, they gathered themselves together.
 &nbsp; 16 And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that <I>were</I>
 beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain
 of the host of Hadarezer <I>went</I> before them.
 &nbsp; 17 And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together,
 and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set
 themselves in array against David, and fought with him.
 &nbsp; 18 And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew <I>the men
 of</I> seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand
 horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died
 there.
 &nbsp; 19 And when all the kings <I>that were</I> servants to Hadarezer saw
 that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with
 Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the
 children of Ammon any more.
 </FONT></P>
 

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. A new attempt of the Syrians to recover their lost honour and to
 check the progress of David's victorious arms. The forces that were 
 lately dispersed rallied again, and <I>gathered themselves 
 together,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+10:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Even the baffled cause will make head as long as there is any life in
 it; the enemies of the Son of David do so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:34,Re+19:19">Matt, xxii. 34; Rev. xix. 19</A>.
 
 These, being conscious of their insufficiency, called in the aid of
 their allies and dependencies on the other side of <I>the river</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+10:16"><I>v.</I>  16</A>),

 and, being thus recruited, they hoped to make their part good against
 Israel, but <I>they knew not the thoughts of the Lord, for he gathered 
 them as sheaves into the floor;</I> see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+4:11-13">Mic. iv. 11-13</A>.

 2. The defeat of this attempt by the vigilance and valour of David,
 who, upon notice of their design, resolved not to stay till they 
 attacked him, but went in person at the head of his army over Jordan

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+10:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),
 
 and, in a pitched battle, routed the Syrians
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+10:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),
 
 slew 7000 men, who belonged to 700 chariots, and 40,000 other soldiers,
 horse and foot, as appears by comparing 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+19:18">1 Chron. xix. 18</A>.

 Their general was killed in the battle, and David came home in triumph,
 no doubt. 
 
 3. The consequence of this victory over the Syrians.

 (1.) David gained several tributaries, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+10:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 <I>The kings,</I> or petty princes, that had been subject to Hadarezer,
 when they saw how powerful David was, very wisely <I>made peace with 
 Israel,</I> whom they found they could not make war with, <I>and served 
 them,</I> since they were able to give them protection. Thus the 
 promise made to Abraham

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:18">Gen. xv. 18</A>),
 
 and repeated to Joshua

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:4"><I>ch.</I> i. 4</A>),

 that the borders of Israel should extend to the river Euphrates, was
 performed, at length. 

 (2.) The Ammonites lost their old allies: <I>The Syrians feared to help
 the children of Ammon,</I> not because they had an unrighteous cause 
 (justifying a crime which was a breach of the law of nations), but 
 because they found it was an unsuccessful cause. It is dangerous 
 helping those that have God against them; for, when they fall, their 
 helpers will fall with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Jesus Christ, the Son of David, sent his ambassadors, his apostles and 
 ministers, after all his servants the prophets, to the Jewish church 
 and nation; but they treated them shamefully, as Hanun did David's 
 ambassadors, mocked them, abused them, slew them; and it was this that
 filled the measure of their iniquity, and brought upon them ruin 
 without remedy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:35,41,22:7,2Ch+26:16">Matt. xxi. 35, 41; xxii. 7;
 compare 2 Chron. xxvi. 16</A>);

 for Christ takes the affronts and injuries done to his ministers as
 done to himself and will avenge them accordingly.</P>
