 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have, 

 I. The eclipsing of the glory of the ark, by its privacy in 
 Kirjath-jearim for many years,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. The appearing of the glory of Samuel in his public services for the
 good of Israel, to whom he was raised up to be a judge, and he was the
 last that bore that character. This chapter gives us all the account we
 have of him when he was in the prime of his time; for what we had
 before was in his childhood

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:1-3:21"><I>ch.</I> ii. and iii.</A>);

 what we have of him after was in his old age,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:1"><I>ch.</I> viii. 1</A>.

 We have him here active,

 1. In the reformation of Israel from their idolatry,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>.

 2. In the reviving of religion among them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:5,6">ver. 5, 6</A>.

 3. In praying for them against the invading Philistines 
 
 (ver. 7-9</A>), 

 over whom God, in answer to his prayer, gave them a glorious victory, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:10,11">ver. 10, 11</A>.

 4. In erecting a thankful memorial of that victory, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:12">ver. 12</A>.

 5. In the improvement of that victory, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:13,14">ver. 13, 14</A>.

 6. In the administration of justice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:15-17">ver. 15-17</A>.

 And these were the things for which God was preparing the designing
 him, in the early vouchsafements of his grace to him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And the men of Kirjath-jearim came, and fetched up the ark of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill,
 and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 2 And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjath-jearim,
 that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the
 house of Israel lamented after the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we must attend the ark to Kirjath-jearim, and then leave it there, 
 to hear not a word more of it except once 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:18"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 18</A>),

 till David fetched it thence, about forty years after, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+13:6">1 Chron. xiii. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We are very willing to attend it thither, for the men of 
 Beth-shemesh have by their own folly made that a burden which might 
 have been a blessing; and gladly would we see it among those to whom it 
 will be a <I>savour of life unto life,</I> for in every place where it 
 has been of late it has been a <I>savour of death unto death.</I> 
 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The men of Kirjath-jearim cheerfully bring it among them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 
 <I>They came,</I> at the first word, <I>and fetched up the ark of the
 Lord.</I> Their neighbours the Beth-shemites, were not more glad to get 
 rid of it than they were to receive it, knowing very well that what 
 slaughter the ark had made at Beth-shemesh was not an act of arbitrary 
 power, but of necessary justice, and those that suffered by it must 
 blame themselves, not the ark; we may depend upon the word which God 
 hath said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:6">Jer. xxv. 6</A>),

 <I>Provoke me not, and I will do you no hurt.</I> Note, The judgments
 of God on those who profane his ordinances should not make us afraid of 
 the ordinances, but of profaning them and making an ill use of 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They carefully provided for its decent entertainment among them, as 
 a welcome guest, with true affection, and, as an honourable guest, with 
 respect and reverence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They provided a proper place to receive it. They had no public
 building to adorn with it, but they lodged it in the house of Abinadab, 
 which stood upon the highest ground, and, probably, was the best house 
 in their city; or perhaps the master of it was the most eminent man 
 they had for piety, and best affected to the ark. The men of 
 Beth-shemesh left it exposed upon a stone in the open field, and, 
 though it was a city of priests, none of them received it into his 
 house; but the men of Kirjath-jearim, though common Israelites, gave it 
 house-room, and no doubt the best-furnished room in the house to which 
 it was brought. Note, 

 [1.] God will find out a resting-place for his ark; if some thrust it
 from them, yet the hearts of others shall be inclined to receive it.
 
 [2.] It is no new thing for God's ark to be thrust into a private
 house. Christ and his apostles preached from house to house when they 
 could not have public places at command. 

 [3.] Sometimes priests are shamed and out-done in religion by common
 Israelites.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They provided a proper person to attend it: <I>They sanctified 
 Eleazar his son to keep it;</I> not the father, either because he was 
 aged and infirm, or because he had the affairs of his house and family 
 to attend, from which they would not take him off. But the son, who, it 
 is probable, was a very pious devout young man, and zealously affected 
 towards the best things. His business was to keep the ark, not only 
 from being seized by malicious Philistines, but from being touched or 
 looked into by too curious Israelites. He was to keep the room clean 
 and decent in which the ark was, that, though it was in an obscure 
 place, it might no look like a neglected thing, which no man looked 
 after. It does not appear that this Eleazar was of the tribe of Levi, 
 much less of the house of Aaron, nor was it needful that he should, for 
 here was no altar either for sacrifice or incense, only we may suppose 
 that some devout Israelites would come and pray before the ark, and 
 those that did so he was there ready to attend and assist. For this 
 purpose they sanctified him, that is, by his own consent, they obliged 
 him to make this his business, and to give a constant attendance to it; 
 they set him apart for it in the name of all their citizens. This was 
 irregular, but was excusable because of the present distress. When the 
 ark has but recently come out of captivity we cannot expect it to be on 
 a sudden in its usual solemnity, but must take things as they are, and 
 make the best of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Yet we are very loth to leave it here, wishing it well at Shiloh 
 again, but that is made desolate 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:14">Jer. vii. 14</A>),

 or at least wishing it at Nob, or Gibeon, or wherever the tabernacle
 and the altars are; but, it seems, it must lie by the way for want of 
 some public-spirited men to bring it to its proper place. 

 1. The time of its continuance here was long, very long, above forty
 years it lay in these fields of the wood, a remote, obscure, private 
 place, unfrequented and almost unregarded

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>The time that the ark abode in Kirjath-jearim was long,</I> even
 till David fetched it thence. It was very strange that all the time 
 that Samuel governed the ark was never brought to its place in the holy 
 of holies, an evidence of the decay of holy zeal among them. God 
 suffered it to be so, to punish them for their neglect of the ark when 
 it was in its place and to show that the great stress which the 
 institution laid upon the ark was but typical of Christ, and those 
 <I>good things to come which cannot be moved,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:23,12:27">Heb. ix. 23; xii. 27</A>.

 It was a just reproach to the priests that one not of their order was
 sanctified to keep the ark.

 2. Twenty years of this time had passed before the house of Israel was
 sensible of the want of the ark. The Septuagint read it somewhat more 
 clearly than we do; <I>and it was twenty years, and</I> (that is, when) 
 <I>the whole house of Israel looked up again after the Lord.</I> So 
 long the ark remained in obscurity, and the Israelites were not 
 sensible of the inconvenience, nor ever made any enquiry after it, what 
 has become of it; though, while it was absent from the tabernacle, the 
 token of God's special presence was wanting, nor could they keep the 
 day of atonement as it should be kept. They were content with the 
 altars without the ark; so easily can formal professors rest satisfied 
 in a round of external performances, without any tokens of God's 
 presence or acceptance. But at length they bethought themselves, and 
 began to lament after the lord, stirred up to it, it is probable, by 
 the preaching of Samuel, with which an extraordinary working of the 
 Spirit of God set in. A general disposition to repentance and 
 reformation now appears throughout all Israel, and they begin to 
 <I>look unto him whom they had slighted, and to mourn,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:10">Zech. xii. 10</A>.

 Dr. Lightfoot thinks this was a matter and time as remarkable as almost
 any we read of in scripture; and that the great conversion, Acts 2 and 
 3, is the only parallel to it. Note, 

 (1.) Those that know how to value God's ordinances cannot but reckon it
 a very lamentable thing to want them.

 (2.) True repentance and conversion begin in lamenting after the Lord;
 we must be sensible that by sin we have provoked him to withdraw and 
 are undone if we continue in a state of distance from him, and be 
 restless till we have recovered his favour and obtained his gracious 
 returns. It was better with the Israelites when they wanted the ark, 
 and were lamenting after it, than when they had the ark, and were 
 prying into it, or priding themselves in it. Better see people longing 
 in the scarcity of the means of grace than loathing in the abundance of 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye
 do return unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> with all your hearts, <I>then</I> put away the
 strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your
 hearts unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and serve him only: and he will deliver you
 out of the hand of the Philistines.
 &nbsp; 4 Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and
 Ashtaroth, and served the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> only.
 &nbsp; 5 And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray
 for you unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 6 And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and
 poured <I>it</I> out before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and fasted on that day, and said
 there, We have sinned against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>. And Samuel judged the
 children of Israel in Mizpeh.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may well wonder where Samuel was and what he was doing all this 
 while, for we have not had him so much as named till now, since 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:1"><I>ch.</I> iv. 1</A>,

 not as if he were unconcerned, but his labours among his people are not
 mentioned till there appears the fruit of them. When he perceived that 
 they began to <I>lament after the Lord</I> he struck while the iron was 
 hot, and two things he endeavoured to do for them, as a faithful 
 servant of God and a faithful friend to the Israel of God:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He endeavoured to separate between them and their idols, for 
 <I>there</I> reformation must begin. He <I>spoke to all the house of 
 Israel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 going, as it should seem, from place to place, an itinerant preacher
 (for we find not that they were gathered together till

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 and wherever he came this was his exhortation, "<I>If you do indeed
 return to the Lord,</I> as you seem inclined to do, by your 
 lamentations for your departure from him and his from you, then know, 
 
 1. That you must renounce and abandon your idols, <I>put away the
 strange gods,</I> for your God will admit no rival; put them away from 
 you, each one from himself, nay, and put them <I>from among you,</I> do 
 what you can, in your places, to rid them out of the country. Put away 
 Baalim, the strange gods, and Ashtaroth, the strange goddesses," for 
 such also they had. Or Ashtaroth is particularly named because it was 
 the best-beloved idol, and that which they were most wedded to. Note, 
 True repentance strikes at the darling sin, and will with a peculiar 
 zeal and resolution put away that, the sin which most <I>easily besets 
 us.</I> 

 2. "That you must make a solemn business of returning to God, and do it
 with a serious consideration and a stedfast resolution, for both are 
 included in <I>preparing the heart,</I> directing, disposing, 
 establishing, the heart unto the Lord. 

 3. That you must be wholly for God, for him and no other, <I>serve him
 only,</I> else you do not serve him at all so as to please him. 

 4. That this is the only way and a sure way to prosperity and
 deliverance. Take this course, and <I>he will deliver you out of the 
 hand of the Philistines;</I> for it was because you forsook him and 
 served other gods that he delivered you into their hands." This was the 
 purport of Samuel's preaching, and it had a wonderfully good effect

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>They put away Baalim and Ashtaroth,</I> not only quitted the worship
 of them, but destroyed their images, demolished their altars, and quite 
 abandoned them.  <I>What have we to do any more with idols?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:8,Isa+30:22">Hos. xiv. 8; Isa. xxx. 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He endeavoured to engage them for ever to God and his service. Now 
 that he had them in a good mind he did all he could to keep them in 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He summons all Israel, at least by their elders, as their 
 representatives, to meet him at Mizpeh 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 and there he promises to pray for them. And it was worth while for them
 to come from the remotest part of the country to join with Samuel in 
 see king God's favour. Note, Ministers should pray for those to whom 
 they preach, that God by his grace would make the preaching effectual. 
 And, when we come together in religious assemblies, we must remember 
 that it is as much our business there to join in public prayers as it 
 is to hear a sermon.  He would pray for them that, by the grace of God, 
 they might be parted from their idols, and that then, by the providence 
 of God, they might be delivered from the Philistines. Ministers would 
 profit their people more if they did but pray more for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They obey his summons, and not only come to the meeting, but conform 
 to the intentions of it, and appear there very well disposed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>They drew water and poured it out before the Lord,</I> 
 signifying, 

 [1.] Their humiliation and contrition for sin, owning themselves as
 water spilt upon the ground, which cannot be gathered up again

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:14">2 Sam. xiv. 14</A>),

 so mean, so miserable, before God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:14">Ps. xxii. 14</A>.

 The Chaldee reads it, <I>They poured out their hearts in repentance
 before the Lord.</I> They wept rivers of tears, and sorrowed after a 
 godly sort, for it was before the Lord and with an eye to him.

 [2.] Their earnest prayers and supplications to God for mercy. The soul
 is, in prayer, poured out before God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:8">Ps. lxii. 8</A>.

 [3.] Their universal reformation; they thus expressed their willingness
 to part with all their sins, and to retain no more of the relish or 
 savour of them than the vessel does of the water that is poured out of 
 it. They were free and full in their confession, and fixed in their 
 resolution to cast away from them <I>all their transgressions.</I> 
 Israel is now <I>baptized from their idols,</I> so Dr. Lightfoot. 

 [4.] Some think it signifies their joy in the hope of God's mercy,
 which Samuel had assured them of. This ceremony was used with that 
 signification at the feast of tabernacles,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:37,38">John vii. 37, 38</A>,
 
 and see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+12:3">Isa. xii. 3</A>.

 Taking it in this sense, it must be read, <I>They drew water after they
 had fasted.</I> In the close of their humiliation they thus expressed 
 their hope of pardon and reconciliation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) <I>They fasted,</I> abstained from food, afflicted their souls, so 
 expressing repentance and exciting devotion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) They made a public confession: <I>We have sinned against the 
 Lord,</I> so giving glory to God and taking shame to themselves. And, 
 if we thus confess our sins, we shall find our God <I>faithful and just 
 to forgive us our sins.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Samuel judged them at that time in Mizpeh, that is, he assured them, 
 in God's name, of the pardon of their sins, upon their repentance, and 
 that God was reconciled to them. It was a judgment of absolution. Or he 
 received informations against those that did not leave their idols, and 
 proceeded against them according to law. Those that would not judge 
 themselves he judged. Or now he settled courts of justice among them, 
 and appointed the terms and circuits which he observed afterwards, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Now he set those wheels a-going; and, whereas he began to act as a
 magistrate, to prevent their relapsing into those sins which now they 
 seemed to have renounced.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel
 were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines
 went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard
 <I>it,</I> they were afraid of the Philistines.
 &nbsp; 8 And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry
 unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God for us, that he will save us out of the
 hand of the Philistines.
 &nbsp; 9 And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered <I>it for</I> a burnt
 offering wholly unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and Samuel cried unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> for
 Israel; and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> heard him.
 &nbsp; 10 And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the
 Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines,
 and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel.
 &nbsp; 11 And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the
 Philistines, and smote them, until <I>they came</I> under Beth-car.
 &nbsp; 12 Then Samuel took a stone, and set <I>it</I> between Mizpeh and
 Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> helped us.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 
 
 I. The Philistines invade Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 taking umbrage from that general meeting for repentance and prayer as
 if it had been a rendezvous for war, and, if so, they thought it 
 prudent to keep the war out of their own country. They had no just 
 cause for this suspicion; but those that seek to do mischief to others 
 will be forward to imagine that others design mischief to them. Now see 
 here, 

 1. How evil sometimes seems to come out of good. The religious meeting
 of the Israelites at Mizpeh brought trouble upon them from the 
 Philistines, which perhaps tempted them to wish they had staid at home 
 and to blame Samuel for calling them together. But we may be in God's 
 way and yet meet with distress; nay, when sinners begin to repent and 
 reform, they must expect that Satan will muster all his force against 
 them, and set his instruments on work to the utmost to oppose and 
 discourage them.  But, 

 2. How good is, at length, brought out of that evil. Israel could never
 be threatened more seasonably than at this time, when they were 
 repenting and praying, nor could they have been better prepared to 
 receive the enemy; nor could the Philistines have acted more impolitely 
 for themselves than to make war upon Israel at this time, when they 
 were making their peace with God. But God permitted them to do it, that 
 he might have an opportunity immediately of crowning his people's 
 reformation with tokens of his favour, and of confirming the words of 
 his messenger, who had assured them that if they repented God would 
 <I>deliver them out of the hand of the Philistines.</I> Thus he makes 
 man's wrath to praise him, and serves the purposes of his grace to his 
 people even by the malicious designs of their enemies against them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+4:11,12">Mic. iv. 11, 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Israel cleaves closely to Samuel, as their best friend, under God, 
 in this distress; though he was no military man, nor ever celebrated as 
 a mighty man of valour, yet, being afraid of the Philistines, for whom 
 they thought themselves an unequal match, they engaged Samuel's prayers 
 for them: <I>Cease not to cry unto the Lord our God for us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 They were here unarmed, unprepared for war, come together to fast and
 pray, not to fight; prayers and tears therefore being all the weapons 
 many of them are now furnished with, to these they have recourse. And, 
 knowing Samuel to have a great interest in heaven, they earnestly beg 
 of him to improve it for them. They had reason to expect it, because he 
 had promised to <I>pray for them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 had promised them deliverance from the Philistines

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and they had been observant of him in all that which he had spoken to
 them from the Lord. Thus those who sincerely submit to Christ, as their 
 lawgiver and judge, need not doubt of their interest in his 
 intercession. They were very solicitous that Samuel should not cease to 
 pray for them: what military preparations were to be made they would 
 undertake them, but let him continue instant in prayer, perhaps 
 remembering that when Moses did but let down his hand ever so little 
 Amalek prevailed. O what a comfort is it to all believers that our 
 great intercessor above never ceases, is never silent, for he <I>always 
 appears in the presence of God for us!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Samuel intercedes with God for them, and does it <I>by 
 sacrifice,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 He took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a <I>burnt-offering, a whole
 burnt-offering, to the Lord,</I> and, while the sacrifice was in 
 burning, with the smoke of it his prayers ascended up to heaven for 
 Israel. Observe,

 1. He made intercession with a sacrifice. Christ intercedes in the
 virtue of his satisfaction, and in all our prayers we must have an eye 
 to his great oblation, depending upon that for audience and acceptance. 
 Samuel's sacrifice without his prayer would have been an empty shadow, 
 his prayer without the sacrifice would not have been so prevalent, but 
 both together teach us what great things we may expect from God in 
 answer to those prayers which are made with faith in Christ's 
 sacrifice. 

 2. It was a burnt-offering, which was offered purely for the glory of
 God, so intimating that the great plea he relied on in his prayer was 
 taken from the honour of God. "Lord, help thy people now for thy name's 
 sake." When we endeavour to give glory to God we may hope he will, in 
 answer to our prayers, work for his own glory. 

 3. It was but one sucking lamb that he offered; for it is the integrity
 and intention of the heart that God looks at, more than the bulk or 
 number of the offerings. This one lamb (typifying the Lamb of God) was 
 more acceptable than thousands of rams or bullocks would have been 
 without faith and prayer. Samuel was no priest, but he was a Levite and 
 a prophet; the case was extraordinary, and what he did was by special 
 direction, and therefore was accepted of God. And justly was this 
 reproach put upon the priests because they had corrupted 
 themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. God gave a gracious answer to Samuel's prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>The Lord heard him.</I> He was himself a <I>Samuel, asked of
 God,</I> and many a Samuel, many a mercy in answer to prayer, God gave 
 him. Sons of prayer should be famous for praying, as <I>Samuel was 
 among those that call upon his name,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+99:6">Ps. xcix. 6</A>.

 The answer was a real answer: the Philistines were discomfited

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>),

 totally routed, and that in such a manner as highly magnified the
 prayer of Samuel, the power of God, and the valour of Israel. 

 1. The prayer of Samuel was honoured; for at the very time when he was
 offering up his sacrifice, and his prayer with it, the battle began, 
 and turned immediately against the Philistines. Thus <I>while he was 
 yet speaking God heard,</I> and answered in thunder, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:24">Isa. lxv. 24</A>.

 God showed that it was Samuel's prayer and sacrifice that he had
 respect to, and hereby let Israel know that as in a former engagement 
 with the Philistines he had justly chastised their presumptuous 
 confidence in the presence of the ark, on the shoulders of two profane 
 priests, so now he graciously accepted their humble dependence upon the 
 prayer of faith from the mouth and heart of a pious prophet.

 2. The power of God was greatly honoured; for he took the work into his
 own hand, and discomfited them, not with great hail-stones, which would 
 kill them (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:11">Josh. x. 11</A>),

 but with a great thunder, which frightened them and put them into such
 terror and consternation that they fainted away, and became a very easy 
 prey to the sword of Israel, before whom, being thus confounded, they 
 were smitten. Josephus adds that the earth quaked under them when first 
 they made the onset and in many places opened and swallowed them up, 
 and that, besides the terror of the thunder, their faces and hands were 
 burnt with lightning, which obliged them to shift for themselves by 
 flight. And, being thus driven to their heels by the immediate hand of 
 God (whom they feared not so much as they had feared his ark,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:7"><I>ch.</I> iv. 7</A>),
 
 then, 

 3. Honour was put upon the hosts of Israel; they were made use of for
 the completing of the victory, and had the pleasure of triumphing over 
 their oppressors: <I>They pursued the Philistines, and smote them.</I> 
 How soon did they find the benefit of their repentance, and 
 reformation, and return to God! Now that they have thus engaged him for 
 them none of their enemies can stand before them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Samuel erected a thankful memorial of this victory, to the glory of 
 God and for the encouragement of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 He set up an <I>Eben-ezer, the stone of help.</I> If ever the people's
 hard hearts should lose the impressions of this providence, this stone 
 would either revive the remembrance of it, and make them thankful, or 
 remain a standing witness against them for their unthankfulness.

 1. The place where this memorial was set up was the same where, twenty
 years before, the Israelites were smitten before the Philistines, for 
 that was beside Eben-ezer,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:1"><I>ch.</I> iv. 1</A>.

 The sin which procured that defeat formerly being pardoned upon their
 repentance, the pardon was sealed by this glorious victory in the very 
 same place where they then suffered loss; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:10">Hos. i. 10</A>.

 2. Samuel himself took care to set up this monument. He had been
 instrumental by prayer to obtain the mercy, and therefore he thought 
 himself in a special manner obliged to make this grateful 
 acknowledgement of it. 

 3.  The reason he gives for the name is, <I>Hitherto the Lord hath
 helped us,</I> in which he speaks thankfully of what was past, giving 
 the glory of the victory to God only, who had added this to all his 
 former favours; and yet he speaks somewhat doubtfully for the future: 
 "Hitherto things have done well, but what God may yet do with us we 
 know not, <I>that</I> we refer to him; but let us praise him for what 
 he has done." Note, The beginnings of mercy and deliverance are to be 
 acknowledged by us with thankfulness so far as they go, though they be 
 not completely finished, nay, though the issue seem uncertain.  
 <I>Having obtained help from God, I continue hitherto,</I> says blessed 
 Paul,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a short account of the further good services that Samuel 
 did to Israel. Having parted them from their idols, and brought them 
 home to their God, he had put them into a capacity of receiving further 
 benefits by his ministry. Having prevailed in that, he becomes, in 
 other instances, a great blessing to them; yet, writing it himself, he 
 is brief in the relation. We are not told here, but it appears 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:18">2 Chron. xxxv. 18</A>)

 that in the days of Samuel the prophet the people of Israel kept the
 ordinance of the passover with more than ordinary devotion, 
 notwithstanding the distance of the ark and the desolations of Shiloh.  
 Many good offices, no doubt, he did for Israel, but here we are only 
 told how instrumental he was, 
 
 1. In securing the public peace
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):
 
 "<I>In his days the Philistines came no more into the coast of
 Israel,</I> made no inroads or incursions upon them; they perceived 
 that God now fought for Israel and that his hand was against the 
 Philistines, and this kept them in awe, and restrained the remainder of 
 their wrath." Samuel was a protector and deliverer to Israel, not by 
 dint of sword, as Gideon, nor by strength of arm, as Samson, but by the 
 power of prayer to God and carrying on a work of reformation among the 
 people. Religion and piety are the best securities of a nation. 

 2. In recovering the public rights, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 By his influence Israel had the courage to demand the cities which the
 Philistines had unjustly taken from them and had long detained; and the 
 Philistines, not daring to contend with one that had so great an 
 interest in heaven, tamely yielded to the demand, and restored (some 
 think) even Ekron and Gath, two of the capital cities, though 
 afterwards they retook them; others think some small towns that lay 
 between Ekron and Gath, which were forced out of the Philistines' 
 hands. This they got by their reformation and religion, they got ground 
 of their enemies and got forward in their affairs. It is added, 
 <I>There was peace between Israel and the Amorites,</I> that is, the 
 Canaanites, the remains of the natives. Not that Israel made any league 
 with them, but they were quiet, and not so mischievous to Israel as 
 they had sometimes been.  Thus <I>when a man's ways please the Lord he 
 maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him</I> and give him no 
 disturbance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+16:7">Prov. xvi. 7</A>.

 3. In administering public justice

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>):

 <I>He judged Israel;</I> as a prophet he taught them their duty and
 reproved them for their sins, which is called <I>judging,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:4,22:2">Ezek. xx. 4; xxii. 2</A>.

 Moses judged Israel when he <I>made them know the statutes of God and
 his laws</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:16">Exod.  xviii. 16</A>);

 and thus Samuel judged them to the last, even after Saul was made king;
 so he promised them then, when Saul was inaugurated

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+12:23"><I>ch.</I> xii. 23</A>),

 <I>I will</I> not cease to <I>teach you the good and the right way.</I>
 As a magistrate, he received appeals from the inferior courts and gave 
 judgment upon them, tried causes and determined them, tried prisoners 
 and acquitted or condemned them, according to the law. This he did all 
 his days, till he grew old and past service, and resigned to Saul; and 
 afterwards he exercised authority when application was made to him; 
 nay, he judged even Agag, and Saul himself. But when he was in his 
 prime he rode the circuit, for the convenience of the country, at least 
 of that part of it which lay most under his influence. He kept courts 
 at Beth-el, Gilgal, and Mizpeh, all in the tribe of Benjamin; but his 
 constant residence was at Ramah, his father's city, and there he judged 
 Israel, thither they resorted to him from all parts with their 
 complaints, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:17">v. 17</A>.

 4. In keeping up the public exercises of religion; for there, where he
 lived, he built an altar to the Lord, not in contempt of the altar that 
 was at Nob, or Gibeon, or wherever the tabernacle was; but divine 
 justice having laid Shiloh waste, and no other place being yet chosen 
 for them to bring their offerings to

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:11">Deut. xii. 11</A>),

 he looked upon the law which confined them to one place to be for the
 present suspended, and therefore, being a prophet, and under divine 
 direction, he did as the patriarchs did, he built an altar where he 
 lived, both for the use of his own family and for the good of the 
 country that resorted to it. Great men should use their wealth, power, 
 and interest, for the keeping up of religion in the places where they 
 live.</P>
