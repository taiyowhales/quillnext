 We left Elijah at the entrance of Jezreel, still appearing publicly, 
 and all the people's eyes upon him. In this chapter we have him again 
 absconding, and driven into obscurity, at a time when he could ill be 
 spared; but we are to look upon it as a punishment to Israel for the 
 insincerity and inconstancy of their reformation. When people will not 
 learn it is just with God to remove their teachers into corners. Now 
 observe, 

 I. How he was driven into banishment by the malice of Jezebel his sworn
 enemy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. How he was met, in his banishment, by the favour of God, his
 covenant-friend.

 1. How God fed him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:4-8">ver. 4-8</A>.

 2. How he conversed with him, and manifested himself to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:9,11-13">ver. 9, 11-13</A>),

 heard his complaint

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:10-14">ver. 10-14</A>),

 directed him what to do

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:15-17">ver. 15-17</A>),

 and encouraged him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:18">ver. 18</A>.

 III. How his hands were strengthened, at his return out of banishment,
 by the joining of Elisha with him,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal
 how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.
 &nbsp; 2 Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the
 gods do <I>to me,</I> and more also, if I make not thy life as the
 life of one of them by to morrow about this time.
 &nbsp; 3 And when he saw <I>that,</I> he arose, and went for his life, and
 came to Beer-sheba, which <I>belongeth</I> to Judah, and left his
 servant there.
 &nbsp; 4 But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and
 came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for
 himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 take away my life; for I <I>am</I> not better than my fathers.
 &nbsp; 5 And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an
 angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise <I>and</I> eat.
 &nbsp; 6 And he looked, and, behold, <I>there was</I> a cake baken on the
 coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and
 drink, and laid him down again.
 &nbsp; 7 And the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came again the second time, and
 touched him, and said, Arise <I>and</I> eat; because the journey <I>is</I>
 too great for thee.
 &nbsp; 8 And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength
 of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of
 God.

 One would have expected, after such a public and sensible manifestation 
 of the glory of God and such a clear decision of the controversy 
 depending between him and Baal, to the honour of Elijah, the confusion 
 of Baal's prophets, and the universal satisfaction of the people--after
 they had seen both fire and water come from heaven at the prayer of 
 Elijah, and both in mercy to them, the one as it signified the 
 acceptance of their offering, the other as it <I>refreshed their 
 inheritance, which was weary</I>--that now they would all, as one man,
 return to the worship of the God of Israel and take Elijah for their 
 guide and oracle, that he would thenceforward be prime-minister of 
 state, and his directions would be as laws both to king and kingdom. 
 But it is quite otherwise; he is neglected whom God honoured; no 
 respect is paid to him, nor care taken of him, nor any use made of him, 
 but, on the contrary, the land of Israel, to which he had been, and 
 might have been, so great a blessing, is now made too hot for him. 

 1. Ahab incensed Jezebel against him. That queen-consort, it seems,
 was in effect queen-regent, as she was afterwards when she was 
 queen-dowager, an imperious woman that managed king and kingdom and did 
 what she would. Ahab's conscience would not let him persecute Elijah 
 (some remains he had in him of the blood and spirit of an Israelite, 
 which tied his hands), but he told Jezebel all that Elijah had done

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),
 
 not to convince, but to exasperate her. It is not said he told her
 what <I>God</I> had done, but what <I>Elijah</I> had done, as if he, by 
 some spell or charm, had brought fire from heaven, and the hand of the 
 Lord had not been in it. Especially he represented to her, as that 
 which would make her outrageous against him, that he had slain the 
 prophets; the prophets of Baal he calls <I>the prophets,</I> as if none 
 but they were worthy of the name. His heart was set upon them, and he 
 aggravated the slaying of them as Elijah's crime, without taking notice 
 that it was a just reprisal upon Jezebel for killing God's prophets, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:4"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 4</A>.

 Those who, when they cannot for shame or fear do mischief themselves, 
 yet stir up others to do it, will have it laid to their charge as if 
 they had themselves done it. 
 
 2. Jezebel sent him a threatening message
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 that she had vowed and sworn to be the death of him within twenty-four
 hours. Something prevents her from doing it just now, but she resolves 
 it shall not be long undone. Note, Carnal hearts are hardened and 
 enraged against God by that which should convince and conquer them and 
 bring them into subjection to him. She swears by her gods, and, raging 
 like one distracted, curseth herself if she slay not him, without any 
 proviso of a divine permission. Cruelty and confidence often meet in 
 persecutors. <I>I will pursue, I will overtake,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:9">Exod. xv. 9</A>.

 But how came she to send him word of her design, and so to give him an
 opportunity of making his escape? Did she think him so daring that he 
 would not flee, or herself so formidable that she could prevent him?
 Or was there a special providence in it, that she should be thus 
 infatuated by her own fury? I am apt to think that though she desired 
 nothing more than his blood, yet, at this time, she durst not meddle 
 with him <I>for fear of the people, all counting him a prophet,</I> a 
 great prophet, and therefore sent this message to him merely to 
 frighten him and get him out of the way. for the present, that he might 
 not carry on what he had begun. The backing of her threats with an oath 
 and imprecation does not at all prove that she really intended to slay 
 him, but only that she intended to make him believe so. The gods she 
 swore by could do her no harm. 

 3. Elijah, hereupon, in a great fright, fled for his life, it is likely
 by night, and came to Beer-sheba,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 Shall we praise him for this? We praise him not. Where was the courage
 with which he had lately confronted Ahab and all the prophets of Baal?
 Nay, which kept him by his sacrifice when the fire of God fell upon it?
 He that stood undaunted in the midst of the terrors both of heaven and 
 earth trembles at the impotent menaces of a proud passionate woman.
 <I>Lord, what is man!</I> Great faith is not always alike strong. He 
 could not but know that he might be very serviceable to Israel at this 
 juncture, and had all the reason in the world to depend upon God's 
 protection while he was doing God's work; yet he fled. In his former 
 danger God had bidden him hide himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:3"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 3</A>),

 therefore he supposed he might do so now. 

 4. From Beer-sheba he went forward into the wilderness, that vast
 howling wilderness in which the Israelites wandered. Beer-sheba was so 
 far distant from Jezreel, and within the dominion of so good a king as 
 Jehoshaphat, that he could not but be safe there; yet, as if his fears 
 haunted him even when he was out of the reach of danger, he could not 
 rest there, but went a day's journey into the desert. Yet perhaps he 
 retired thither not so much for his safety as that he might be wholly 
 retired from the world, in order to a more free and intimate communion 
 with God. <I>He left his servant at Beer-sheba</I> that he might be 
 private in the wilderness, as Abraham left his servants at the bottom 
 of the hill when he went up into the mount to worship God, and as 
 Christ in the garden was <I>withdrawn from his disciples,</I> or 
 perhaps it was because he would not expose his servant, who was young 
 and tender, to the hardships of the wilderness, which would have been 
 putting new wine into old bottles. We ought thus to consider the frame 
 of those who are under our charge, for God considers ours. 

 5. Being wearied with his journey, he grew cross (like children when
 they are sleepy) and <I>wished he might die,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 He <I>requested for his life</I> (so it is in the margin), <I>that he
 might die;</I> for death is life to a good man; the death of the body 
 is the life of the soul. Yet that was not the reason why he wished to
 die; it was not the deliberate desire of grace, as Paul's, to <I>depart 
 and be with Christ,</I> but the passionate wish of his corruption, as 
 Job's. Those that are, in this manner, forward to die are not in the 
 fittest frame for dying. Jezebel has sworn his death, and therefore he, 
 in a fret, prays for it, runs from death to death, yet with this 
 difference, he wishes to die by the hand of the Lord, whose tender 
 mercies are great, and not to fall into the hands of man, whose tender 
 mercies are cruel. He would rather die in the wilderness than as
 Baal's prophet died, according to Jezebel's threatening

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 lest the worshippers of Baal should triumph and blaspheme the God of
 Israel, whom they will think themselves too hard for, if they can run 
 down his advocate. He pleads, "It is enough. I have done enough, and 
 suffered enough. I am weary of living." Those that have secured a 
 happiness in the other world will soon have enough of this world. He 
 pleads, "<I>I am not better than my fathers,</I> not better able to 
 bear those fatigues, and therefore why should I be longer burdened with 
 them than they were?" But is this <I>that my lord Elijah?</I> Can that 
 great and gallant spirit shrink thus? God thus left him to himself, to 
 show that when he was bold and strong it was <I>in the Lord and the 
 power of his might,</I> but of himself he was <I>no better than his 
 fathers</I> or brethren. 

 6. God, by an angel, fed him in that wilderness, into the wants and
 perils of which he had wilfully thrown himself, and in which, if God 
 had not graciously succoured him, he would have perished. How much 
 better does God deal with his froward children than they deserve!
 Elijah, in a pet, wished to die; God needed him not, yet he designed 
 further to employ and honour him, and therefore sent an angel to 
 <I>keep him alive.</I> Our case would be bad sometimes if God should 
 take us at our word and grant us our foolish passionate requests.
 Having prayed that he might die, he <I>laid down and slept</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 wishing it may be to die in his sleep, and not to awake again; but he
 is awakened out of his sleep, and finds himself not only well provided 
 for with bread and water

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),
 
 but, which was more, attended by an angle, who guarded him when he
 slept, and twice called him to his food when it was ready for him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:5,7"><I>v.</I> 5, 7</A>.

 He needed not to complain of the unkindness of men when it was thus
 made up by the ministration of angels. Thus provided for, he had
 reason to think he had fared better than the <I>prophets of the 
 groves,</I> that <I>did eat at Jezebel's table.</I> Wherever God's 
 children are, as they are still upon their Father's ground, so they are 
 still under their Father's eye and care. They may lose themselves in a
 wilderness, but God has not lost them; there they may <I>look at him 
 that lives and sees them, as Hagar,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+16:13">Gen. xvi. 13</A>.

 7. He was carried, in the strength of this meat, to Horeb, <I>the mount
 of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Thither the Spirit of the Lord led him, probably beyond his own
 intention, that he might have communion with God in the same place 
 where Moses had, the law that was given by Moses being revived by him.
 The angel bade him eat the second time, because of the greatness <I>of 
 the journey</I> that was <I>before him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Note God knows what he designs us for, though we do not, what service,
 what trials, and will take care for us when we, for want of foresight, 
 cannot for ourselves, that we be furnished for them with <I>grace 
 sufficient.</I> He that appoints what the voyage shall be will victual 
 the ship accordingly. See how many different ways God took to keep 
 Elijah alive; he fed him by ravens, with multiplied meals--then by an 
 angel--and now, to show that <I>man lives not by bread alone,</I> he 
 kept him alive forty days without meat, not resting and sleeping, which 
 might make him the less to crave sustenance, but continually traversing 
 the mazes of the desert, a day for a year of Israel's wanderings; yet 
 he neither needs food nor desires it. The place, no doubt, reminds him 
 of the manna, and encourages him to hope that God will sustain him 
 here, and in due time bring him hence, as he did Israel, though, like 
 him, fretful and distrustful.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9 And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and,
 behold, the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>came</I> to him, and he said unto him,
 What doest thou here, Elijah?
 &nbsp; 10 And he said, I have been very jealous for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of
 hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant,
 thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword;
 and I, <I>even</I> I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it
 away.
 &nbsp; 11 And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>. And, behold, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> passed by, and a great and strong
 wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; <I>but</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>was</I> not in the wind: 
 and after the wind an
 earthquake; <I>but</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>was</I> not in the earthquake:
 &nbsp; 12 And after the earthquake a fire; <I>but</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>was</I> not in
 the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.
 &nbsp; 13 And it was <I>so,</I> when Elijah heard <I>it</I>, that he wrapped his
 face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of
 the cave. And, behold, <I>there came</I> a voice unto him, and said,
 What doest thou here, Elijah?
 &nbsp; 14 And he said, I have been very jealous for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of
 hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant,
 thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword;
 and I, <I>even</I> I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it
 away.
 &nbsp; 15 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the
 wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael <I>to
 be</I> king over Syria:
 &nbsp; 16 And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint <I>to be</I> king
 over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt
 thou anoint <I>to be</I> prophet in thy room.
 &nbsp; 17 And it shall come to pass, <I>that</I> him that escapeth the
 sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the
 sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.
 &nbsp; 18 Yet I have left <I>me</I> seven thousand in Israel, all the knees
 which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not
 kissed him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Elijah housed in a cave at Mount Horeb, which is called <I>the mount 
 of God,</I> because on it God had formerly manifested his glory. And 
 perhaps this was the same cave, or cleft of a rock, in which Moses was 
 hidden when the Lord <I>passed by before him and proclaimed his 
 name,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+33:22">Exod. xxxiii. 22</A>.

 What Elijah proposed to himself in coming to lodge here, I cannot
 conceive, unless it was to indulge his melancholy, or to satisfy his 
 curiosity and assist his faith and devotion with the sight of that 
 famous place where the law was given and where so many great things 
 were done, and hoping to meet with God himself there, where Moses met 
 with him, or in token of his abandoning his people Israel, who hated to 
 be reformed (in the latter case, it agrees with Jeremiah's wish, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:2">Jer. ix. 2</A>,

 <I>O that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men,
 that I might leave my people, and go from them, for they are all 
 adulterers</I>) and so it was a bad omen of God's forsaking them; or it 
 was because the thought he could not be safe any where else, and to 
 this instance of the hardships this good man was reduced to the apostle 
 refers,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:38">Heb. xi. 38</A>.

 <I>They wandered in deserts and in mountains, and in dens and caves of
 the earth.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The visit God paid to him there and the enquiry he made concerning 
 him: <I>The word of the Lord came to him.</I> We cannot go any where to 
 be out of the reach of God's eye, his arm, and his word. <I>Whither can 
 I flee from thy Spirit?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:7-10">Ps. cxxxix. 7</A>,

 &c. God will take care of his out-casts; and those who, for his sake,
 are driven out from among men, he will find, and own, and gather with 
 everlasting loving-kindnesses. John saw the visions of the Almighty
 when he was in banishment in the isle of Patmos,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:9">Rev. i. 9</A>.

 The question God puts to the prophet it, <I>What doest</I> thou
 <I>here, Elijah?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>,
 
 and again

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 This is a reproof,

 1. For his fleeing hither. "What brings thee so far from home? Dost
 thou flee from Jezebel? Couldst thou not depend upon almighty power
 for thy protection?" Lay the emphasis upon the pronoun <I>thou.</I> 
 "What <I>thou!</I> So great a man, so great a prophet, so famed for 
 resolution--dost thou flee thy country, forsake thy colours thus?" This 
 cowardice would have been more excusable in another, and not so bad an 
 example. <I>Should such a man as I flee?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+6:11">Neh. vi. 11</A>.

 <I>Howl, fir-trees, if the cedars be</I> thus <I>shaken.</I> 

 2. For his fixing here. "What doest thou here, in this cave? Is this a
 place for a prophet of the Lord to lodge in? Is this a time for such 
 men to retreat, when the public has such need of them?" In the 
 retirement to which God sent Elijah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:1-24"><I>ch.</I> xvii.</A>)

 he was a blessing to a poor widow at Sarepta, but here he had no
 opportunity of doing good. Note, It concerns us often to enquire
 whether we be in our place and in the way of our duty. "Am I where I 
 should be, whither God calls me, where my business lies, and where I 
 may be useful?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The account he gives of himself, in answer to the question put to 
 him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),
 
 and repeated, in answer to the same question, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He excuses his retreat, and desires it may not be imputed to his 
 want of zeal for reformation, but to his despair of success. For God 
 knew, and his own conscience witnessed for him, that as long as there 
 was any hope of doing good he had been <I>very jealous for the Lord God 
 of Hosts;</I> but now that he had <I>laboured in vain,</I> and all his 
 endeavours were to no purpose, he thought it was time to give up the 
 cause, and mourn for what he could not mend. <I>Abi in cellam, et dic, 
 Miserere mei--"Away to thy cell, and cry, Have compassion on
 me.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He complains of the people, their obstinacy in sin, and the height 
 of impiety to which they had arrived: "<I>The children of Israel have 
 forsaken thy covenant,</I> and that is the reason I have forsaken them; 
 who can stay among them, to see every thing that is sacred ruined and 
 run down?" This the apostle calls his <I>making intercession against 
 Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:2,3">Rom. xi. 2, 3</A>.

 He had often been, of choice, their advocate, but now he is
 necessitated to be their accuser, before God. Thus

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:45">John v. 45</A>,

 <I>There is one that accuseth you, even Moses, whom you trust.</I>
 Those are truly miserable that have the testimony and prayers of God's 
 prophets against them. 

 (1.) He charges them with having forsaken God's covenant; though they 
 retained circumcision, that sign and seal of it, yet they had quitted 
 his worship and service, which was the intention of it. Those who 
 neglect God's ordinances, and let fall their communion with him, do 
 really forsake his covenant, and break their league with him.

 (2.) With having <I>thrown down his altars,</I> not only deserted them 
 and suffered them to go to decay, but, in their zeal for the worship of 
 Baal, wilfully demolished them. This alludes to the private altars
 which the prophets of the Lord had, and which good people attended, who 
 could not go up to Jerusalem and would not worship the calves nor Baal. 
 These separate altars, though breaking in upon the unity of the church, 
 yet, being erected and attended by those that sincerely aimed at the 
 glory of God and served him faithfully, the seeming schism was excused. 
 God owned them for his altars, as well as that at Jerusalem, and the 
 putting of them down is charged upon Israel as a crying sin. But this 
 was not all.

 (3.) <I>They have slain thy prophets with the sword,</I> who, it is 
 probable, ministered at those altars. Jezebel, a foreigner, slew them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:4"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 4</A>),
 
 but the crime is charged upon the body of the people because the
 generality of them were <I>consenting to their death,</I> and pleased 
 with it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He gives the reasons why he retired into this desert and took up his 
 residence in this cave. 

 (1.) It was because he could not appear to any purpose: "<I>I only am
 left,</I> and have none to second or support me in any good design. 
 They all said, <I>The Lord he is God,</I> but none of them would stand 
 by me nor offer to shelter me. That point then gained was presently 
 lost again, and Jezebel can do more to debauch them than I can to 
 reform them. What can one do against thousands?" Despair of success 
 hinders many a good enterprise. No one is willing to venture alone, 
 forgetting that those are not alone who have God with them.

 (2.) It was because he could not appear with any safety: "<I>They seek
 my life to take it away;</I> and I had better spend my life in a 
 useless solitude than lose my life in a fruitless endeavour to reform 
 those that hate to be reformed."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. God's manifestation of himself to him. Did he come hither to meet 
 with God? He shall find that God will not fail to give him the meeting. 
 Moses was put into the cave when God's glory passed before him; but 
 Elijah was called out of it: <I>Stand upon the mount before the 
 Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 He <I>saw no manner of similitude,</I> any more than Israel did when
 God <I>talked to them in Horeb.</I> But,

 1. He heard a strong wind, and saw the terrible effects of it, for it 
 rent the mountains and tore the rocks. Thus was the trumpet sounded 
 before the Judge of heaven and earth, by his angels, whom he makes 
 <I>spirits,</I> or <I>winds</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:4">Ps. civ. 4</A>),

 sounded so loud that the earth not only rang, but rent again. 

 2. He felt the shock of an earthquake. 
 
 3. He saw an eruption of fire,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 These were to usher in the designed manifestation of the divine glory,
 angels being employed in them, whom he <I>maketh a flame of fire,</I> 
 and who, as his ministers, march before him, to <I>prepare in this 
 desert a highway for our God.</I> But, 

 4. At last he perceived a <I>still small voice,</I> in which <I>the
 Lord was,</I> that is, by which he spoke to him, and not out of the 
 wind, or the earthquake, or the fire. Those struck an awe upon him, 
 awakened his attention, and inspired humility and reverence; but God 
 chose to make known his mind to him in whispers soft, not in those 
 dreadful sounds. When he perceived this,

 (1.) <I>He wrapped hi face in his mantle,</I> as one afraid to look
 upon the glory of God, and apprehensive that it would dazzle his eyes 
 and overcome him. The angels <I>cover their faces</I> before God in 
 token of reverence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:2">Isa. vi. 2</A>.

 Elijah hid his face in token of shame for having been such a coward as
 to flee from his duty when he had such a God of power to stand by him 
 in it. The wind, and earthquake, and fire, did not make him cover his 
 face, but the still voice did. Gracious souls are more affected by the
 tender mercies of the Lord than by his terrors.

 (2.) He stood at the entrance of the cave, ready to hear what God had
 to say to him. This method of God's manifesting himself here at Mount 
 Horeb seems to refer to the discoveries God formerly made of himself at 
 this place to Moses.

 [1.] Then there was a tempest, an earthquake, and fire

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:18">Heb. xii. 18</A>);
 
 but, when God would show Moses his glory, he <I>proclaimed his
 goodness;</I> and so here: <I>He was, the Word</I> was, in the <I>still 
 small voice.</I> 

 [2.] Then the law was thus given to Israel, with the appearances of
 terror first and then with a voice of words; and Elijah being now 
 called to revive that law, especially the first two commandments of it, 
 is here taught how to manage it; he must not only awaken and terrify 
 the people with amazing signs, like the earthquake and fire, but he 
 must endeavour, with a still small voice, to convince and persuade 
 them, and not forsake them when he should be addressing them. Faith 
 comes by hearing the word of God; miracles do but make way for it. 

 [3.] Then God spoke to his people with terror; but in the gospel of
 Christ, which was to be introduced by the spirit and power of Elias, he 
 would speak by a still small voice, the dread of which should not make 
 us afraid; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:18-24">Heb. xii. 18</A>,

 &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The orders God gives him to execute. He repeats the question he had 
 put to him before, "<I>What doest thou here?</I> This is not a place 
 for thee now." Elijah gives the same answer 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 complaining of Israel's apostasy from God and the ruin of religion
 among them. To this God gives him a reply. When he wished <I>he might
 die</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)

 God answered him not according to his folly, but was so far from
 letting him die that he not only kept him alive then but provided that 
 he should never die, but be translated. But when he complained of his 
 discouragement (and whither should God's prophets go with their 
 complaints of that kind but to their Master?) God gave him an answer.
 He sends him back with directions to appoint Hazael king of Syria

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 Jehu king of Israel, and Elisha his successor in the eminency of the
 prophetical office

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 which is intended as a prediction that by these God would chastise the
 degenerate Israelites, plead his own cause among them, and <I>avenge 
 the quarrel of his covenant,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Elijah complained that the wickedness of Israel was unpunished. The
 judgment of famine was too gentle, and had not reclaimed them; it was 
 removed before they were reformed: "<I>I have been jealous,</I>" says 
 he, "for God's name, but he himself has not appeared jealous for it." 
 "Well," says God, "be content; it is all in good time; <I>judgments are 
 prepared for those scorners,</I> though they are not yet inflicted; the 
 persons are pitched upon, and shall now be nominated, for they are now 
 in being, who shall do the business."

 1. "When Hazael comes to be king of Syria, he shall make bloody work 
 among the people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:12">2 Kings viii. 12</A>)

 and so correct them for their idolatry." 

 2. "When Jehu comes to be king of Israel he shall make bloody work with
 the royal family, and shall utterly destroy the house of Ahab, that set 
 up and maintained idolatry." 

 3. "Elisha, while thou art on earth, shall strengthen thy hands; and,
 when thou art gone, shall carry on thy work, and be a remaining witness 
 against the apostasy of Israel, and even he shall slay the children of 
 Bethel, that idolatrous city." Note, The wicked are reserved to 
 judgment. <I>Evil pursues sinners,</I> and there is no escaping it; to 
 attempt an escape is but to run from one sword's point upon another. 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:44">Jer. xlviii. 44</A>,

 <I>He that flees from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that
 gets up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare.</I> Elisha, with 
 the <I>sword of the Spirit,</I> shall terrify and wound the consciences 
 of those who escape Hazael's sword of war and Jehu's sword of justice. 
 <I>With the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:4,2Th+2:8,Ho+6:5">Isa. xi. 4; 2 Thess. ii. 8; Hos. vi. 5</A>.

 It is a great comfort to good men and good ministers to think that God
 will never want instruments to do his work in his time, but, when they 
 are gone, others shall be raised up to carry it on.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The comfortable information God gives him of the number of 
 Israelites who retained their integrity, though he thought he was left
 alone 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>I have left 7000 in Israel</I> (besides Judea) <I>who have not bowed
 the knee to Baal.</I> Note, 

 1. In times of the greatest degeneracy and apostasy God has always
 had, and will have, a remnant faithful to him, some that keep their 
 integrity and do not go down the stream. The apostle mentions this 
 answer of God to Elijah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:4">Rom. xi. 4</A>)

 and applies it to his own day, when the Jews generally rejected the
 gospel. <I>Yet,</I> says he, <I>at this time also there is a
 remnant,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 2. It is God's work to preserve that remnant, and distinguish them from
 the rest, for without his grace they could not have distinguished 
 themselves: <I>I have left me;</I> it is therefore said to be a remnant 
 <I>according to the election of grace.</I> 

 3. It is but a little remnant, in comparison with the degenerate race;
 what are 7000 to the thousands of Israel? Yet, when those of every age 
 come together, they will be found many more, 12,000 <I>sealed out of 
 each tribe,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:4">Rev. vii. 4</A>.

 4. God's faithful ones are often his hidden ones

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:3">Ps. lxxxiii. 3</A>),

 and the visible church is scarcely visible, the wheat lost in the chaff
 and the gold in the dross, till the sifting, refining, separating day 
 comes. 

 5. <I>The Lord knows those that are his,</I> though we do not; he sees
 in secret. 

 6. There are more good people in the world than some wise and holy men
 think there are. Their jealousy of themselves, and for God, makes them 
 think the corruption is universal; but God sees not as they do. When we 
 come to heaven, as we shall miss a great many whom we thought to meet 
 there, so we shall meet a great many whom we little thought to find 
 there. God's love often proves larger than man's charity and more 
 extensive.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>19 So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat,
 who <I>was</I> plowing <I>with</I> twelve yoke <I>of oxen</I> before him, and he
 with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle
 upon him.
 &nbsp; 20 And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let
 me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and <I>then</I> I will
 follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I
 done to thee?
 &nbsp; 21 And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and
 slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the
 oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose,
 and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Elisha was named last in the orders God gave to Elijah, but he was 
 first called, for by him the other two were to be called. He must come 
 in Elijah's room; yet Elijah is forward to raise him, and is far from 
 being jealous of his successor, but rejoices to think that he shall 
 leave the work of God in such good hands. Concerning the call of Elisha 
 observe, 

 1. That it was an unexpected surprising call. Elijah found him by
 divine direction, or perhaps he was before acquainted with him and knew 
 where to find him. He found him, not in the schools of the prophets, 
 but <I>in the field,</I> not reading, nor praying, nor sacrificing, but 
 <I>ploughing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.
 
 Though a great man (as appears by his feast,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 master of the ground, and oxen, and servants, yet he did not think it
 any disparagement to him to follow his business himself, and not only 
 to inspect his servants, but himself to lay his hand to the plough. 
 Idleness is no man's honour, nor is husbandry any man's disgrace. An 
 honest calling in the world does not at all put us out of the way of 
 our heavenly calling, any more than it did Elisha, who was taken from 
 following the plough the feed Israel and to sow the <I>seed of the 
 word,</I> as the apostles were taken from fishing to catch men. Elisha 
 enquired not after Elijah, but was anticipated with this call. We love 
 God, and choose him, because he chose us, and loved us, first. 

 2. That it was a powerful call. Elijah did but <I>cast his mantle upon
 him.</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 in token of friendship, that he would take him under his care and
 tuition as he did under his mantle, and to be one with him in the same 
 clothes, or in token of his being clothed with the spirit of Elijah 
 (now he put some of his honour upon him, as Moses on Joshua,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+27:20">Num. xxvii. 20</A>);

 but, when Elijah went to heaven, he had the mantle entire,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:13">2 Kings ii. 13</A>.

 And immediately he <I>left the oxen</I> to go as they would, and <I>ran
 after Elijah,</I> and assured him that he would follow him presently, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 An invisible hand touched his heart, and unaccountably inclined him by
 a secret power, without any external persuasions, to quit his husbandry 
 and give himself to the ministry. It is in a day of power that Christ's 
 subjects are made willing

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:3">Ps. cx. 3</A>),

 nor would any come to Christ unless they were thus drawn. Elisha came
 to a resolution presently, but begged a little time, not to <I>ask</I> 
 leave, but only to <I>take</I> leave, of his parents. This was not an 
 excuse for delay, like his

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:61">Luke ix. 61</A>)

 that desired he might <I>bid those farewell that were at home,</I> but
 only a reservation of the respect and duty he owed to his father and 
 mother. Elijah bade him to back and do it, he would not hinder him; 
 nay, if he would, he might go back, and not return, for any thing he 
 had done to him. He will not force him, nor take him against his will; 
 let him sit down and count the cost, and make it his own act. The 
 efficacy of God's grace preserves the native liberty of man's will, so 
 that those who are good are good of choice and not by constraint, not 
 pressed men, but volunteers. 

 3. That it was a pleasant and acceptable call to him, which appears by
 the farewell-feast he made for his family

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 though he not only quitted all the comforts of his father's house, but
 exposed himself to the malignity of Jezebel and her party. It was a
 discouraging time for prophets to set out in. A man that had consulted 
 with flesh and blood would not be fond of Elijah's mantle, nor willing 
 to wear his coat; yet Elisha cheerfully, and with a great deal of 
 satisfaction, leaves all to accompany him. Thus Matthew made a great 
 fast when he left the receipt of custom to follow Christ. 

 4. That it was an effectual call. Elijah did not stay for him, lest he
 should seem to compel him, but left him to his own choice, and he soon 
 arose, went after him, and not only associated with him, but 
 <I>ministered to him</I> as his servitor, <I>poured water on his 
 hands,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:11">2 Kings iii. 11</A>.
 
 It is of great advantage to young ministers to spend some time under
 the direction of those that are aged and experienced, whose years teach 
 wisdom, and not to think much, if occasion be, to minister to them. 
 Those that would be fit to teach must have time to learn; and those 
 that hope hereafter to rise and rule must be willing at first to stoop 
 and serve.</P>
