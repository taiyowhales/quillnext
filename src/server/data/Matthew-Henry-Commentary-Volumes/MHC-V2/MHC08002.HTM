 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 There is scarcely any chapter in all the sacred history that stoops so 
 low as this to take cognizance of so mean a person as Ruth, a poor 
 Moabitish widow, so mean an action as her gleaning corn in a 
 neighbour's field, and the minute circumstances thereof. But all this 
 was in order to her being grafted into the line of Christ and taken in 
 among his ancestors, that she might be a figure of the espousals of 
 the Gentile church to Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:1">Isa. liv. 1</A>.

 This makes the story remarkable; and many of the passages of it are 
 instructive and very improvable. Here we have,

 I. Ruth's humility and industry in gleaming corn, Providence directing 
 her to Boaz's field,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. The great
 favour which Boaz showed to her in many instances, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:4-16">ver. 4-16</A>. 

 III. The return of Ruth to her mother-in-law,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of
 wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name <I>was</I> Boaz.
 &nbsp; 2 And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the
 field, and glean ears of corn after <I>him</I> in whose sight I shall
 find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.
 &nbsp; 3 And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the
 reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field
 <I>belonging</I> unto Boaz, who <I>was</I> of the kindred of Elimelech.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Naomi had now gained a settlement in Bethlehem among her old friends; 
 and here we have an account,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Of her rich kinsman, Boaz, <I>a mighty man of wealth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 The Chaldee reads it, <I>mighty in the law.</I> If he was both, it was 
 a most rare and excellent conjunction, to be mighty in wealth and 
 mighty in the scriptures too; those that are so are mighty indeed. He 
 was grandson of Nahshon, who was prince of the tribe of Judah in the 
 wilderness, and son of Salmon, probably a younger son, by Rahab, the 
 harlot of Jericho. He carries might in his name, <I>Boaz--in him is 
 strength;</I> and he was of the family of Elimelech, that family which 
 was now reduced and brought so low. Observe, 

 1. Boaz, though a rich and great man, had poor relations. Every branch 
 of the tree is not a top-branch. Let not those that are great in the 
 world be ashamed to own their kindred that are mean and despised, lest 
 they be found therein proud, scornful, and unnatural. 

 2. Naomi, though a poor contemptible widow, had rich relations, whom 
 yet she boasted not of, nor was burdensome to, nor expected any thing 
 from when she returned to Bethlehem in distress. Those that have rich 
 relations, while they themselves are poor, ought to know that it is 
 the wise providence of God that makes the difference (in which we 
 ought to acquiesce), and that to be proud of our relation to such is a 
 great sin, and to trust to it is great folly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Of her poor daughter-in-law, Ruth. 

 1. Her condition was very low and poor, which was a great trial to the 
 faith and constancy of a young proselyte. The Bethlehemites would have 
 done well if they had invited Naomi and her daughter-in-law first to 
 one good house and then to another (it would have been a great support 
 to an aged widow and a great encouragement to a new convert); but, 
 instead of tasting the dainties of Canaan, they have no way of getting 
 necessary food but by gleaning corn, and otherwise, for aught that 
 appears, they might have starved. Note, <I>God has chosen the poor of 
 this world;</I> and poor they are likely to be, for, though God has 
 chosen them, commonly men overlook them. 

 2. Her character, in this condition, was very good

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:2">(<I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>She said to Naomi,</I> not, "Let me now go to the land of Moab
 again, for there is no living here, here there is want, but <I>in my 
 father's house there is bread enough.</I>" No, she is <I>not mindful 
 of the country from which she came out,</I> otherwise she had now a 
 fair occasion to return. The God of Israel shall be her God, and, 
 though he slay her, yet will she trust in him and never forsake him.
 But her request is, <I>Let me go to the field, and glean ears of 
 corn.</I> Those that are well born, and have been well brought up, 
 know not what straits they may be reduced to, nor what mean 
 employments they may be obliged to get their bread by, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:5">Lam. iv. 5</A>.

 When the case is thus melancholy, let Ruth be remembered, who is a
 great example,

 (1.) Of humility. When Providence had made her poor she did not say,
 "To glean, which is in effect to beg, I am ashamed," but cheerfully 
 stoops to the meanness of her circumstances and accommodates herself 
 to her lot. High spirits can more easily starve than stoop; Ruth was 
 none of those. She does not tell her mother she was never brought up 
 to live upon crumbs. Though she was not brought up to it, she is 
 brought down to it, and is not uneasy at it. Nay, it is her own 
 motion, not her mother's injunction. Humility is one of the brightest 
 ornaments of youth, and one of the best omens. Before Ruth's honour 
 was this humility. Observe how humbly she speaks of herself, in her 
 expectation of leave to glean: Let me glean after him <I>in whose 
 sight I shall find grace.</I> She does not say, "I will go and glean, 
 and surely nobody will deny me the liberty," but, "I will go and 
 glean, in the hope that somebody will allow me the liberty." Note, 
 Poor people must not demand kindness as a debt, but humbly ask it, and 
 take it as a favour, though in ever so small a matter. It becomes the 
 poor to use entreaties.

 (2.) Of industry. She does not say to her mother-in-law, "Let me now 
 go a visiting to the ladies of the town, or go a walking in the fields 
 to take the air and be merry; I cannot sit all day moping with you." 
 No, it is not sport, but business, that her heart is upon: "<I>Let me 
 go and glean ears of corn,</I> which will turn to some good account." 
 She was one of those virtuous women that love not to eat the bread of 
 idleness, but love to take pains. This is an example to young people. 
 Let them learn betimes to labour, and, <I>what their hand finds to do, 
 do it with their might.</I> A disposition to diligence bodes well both 
 for this world and the other. Love not sleep, love not sport, love
 not sauntering; but love business. It is also an example to poor 
 people to work for their living, and not beg that which they are able 
 to earn. We must not be shy of any honest employment, though it be 
 mean, <B><I>ergon ouden oneidos</I></B>--<I>No labour is a 
 reproach.</I> Sin is a thing below us, but we must not think any thing 
 else so That Providence calls us to.

 (3.) Of regard to her mother. Though she was but her mother-in-law, 
 and though, being loosed by death from the law of her husband, she 
 might easily suppose herself thereby loosed from the law of her 
 husband's mother, yet she is dutifully observant of her. She will not 
 go out without letting her know and asking her leave. This respect 
 young people ought to show to their parents and governors; it is part 
 of the honour due to them. She did not say, "Mother, if you will go 
 with me, I will go glean:" but, "Do you sit at home and take your 
 ease, and I will go abroad, and take pains." <I>Juniores ad 
 labores--Youth should work.</I> Let young people take advice from the 
 aged, but not put them upon toil.

 (4.) Of dependence upon Providence, intimated in that, I will <I>glean 
 after him in whose sight I shall find grace.</I> She knows not which 
 way to go, nor whom to enquire for, but will trust Providence to raise 
 her up some friend or other that will be kind to her. Let us always 
 keep us good thoughts of the divine providence, and believe that while 
 we do well it will do well for us. And it did well for Ruth; for when 
 she went out alone, without guide or companion, to glean, <I>her hap 
 was to light on the field of Boaz,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 To her it seemed casual. She knew not whose field it was, nor had she
 any reason for going to that more than any other, and therefore it is 
 said to be <I>her hap;</I> but Providence directed her steps to this 
 field. Note, God wisely orders small events; and those that seem 
 altogether contingent serve his own glory and the good of his people. 
 Many a great affair is brought about by a little turn, which seemed 
 fortuitous to us, but was directed by Providence with design.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4 And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the
 reapers, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>be</I> with you. And they answered him, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 bless thee.
 &nbsp; 5 Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the
 reapers, Whose damsel <I>is</I> this?
 &nbsp; 6 And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and
 said, It <I>is</I> the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out
 of the country of Moab:
 &nbsp; 7 And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the
 reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even
 from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the
 house.
 &nbsp; 8 Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go
 not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide
 here fast by my maidens:
 &nbsp; 9 <I>Let</I> thine eyes <I>be</I> on the field that they do reap, and go
 thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall
 not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels,
 and drink of <I>that</I> which the young men have drawn.
 &nbsp; 10 Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,
 and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that
 thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I <I>am</I> a stranger?
 &nbsp; 11 And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been
 showed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since
 the death of thine husband: and <I>how</I> thou hast left thy father
 and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a
 people which thou knewest not heretofore.
 &nbsp; 12 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> recompense thy work, and a full reward be given
 thee of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come
 to trust.
 &nbsp; 13 Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for
 that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken
 friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of
 thine handmaidens.
 &nbsp; 14 And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and
 eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat
 beside the reapers: and he reached her parched <I>corn,</I> and she
 did eat, and was sufficed, and left.
 &nbsp; 15 And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young
 men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach
 her not:
 &nbsp; 16 And let fall also <I>some</I> of the handfuls of purpose for her,
 and leave <I>them,</I> that she may glean <I>them</I>, and rebuke her not.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now Boaz himself appears, and a great deal of decency there appears in 
 his carriage both towards his own servants and towards this poor 
 stranger.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Towards his own servants, and those that were employed for him in 
 reaping and gathering in his corn. Harvest-time is busy time, many 
 hands must then be at work. Boaz that had much, being a mighty man of 
 wealth, had much to do, and consequently many to work under him and to 
 live upon him. <I>As goods are increased those are increased that eat 
 them, and what good has the owner thereof save the beholding of them 
 with his eyes?</I> Boaz is here an example of a good master.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He had a servant that was set over the reapers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 In great families it is requisite there should be one to oversee the 
 rest of the servants, and appoint to each their portion both of work 
 and meat. Ministers are such servants in God's house, and it is
 requisite that they be both wise and faithful, and <I>show their Lord 
 all things,</I> as he here, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Yet he came himself to his reapers, to see how the work went 
 forward, if he found any thing amiss to rectify it, and to give 
 further orders what should be done. This was both for his own interest 
 (he that wholly leaves his business to others will have it done by the 
 halves; the master's eye makes a fat horse) and it was also for the 
 encouragement of his servants, who would go on the more cheerfully in 
 their work when their master countenanced them so far as to make them 
 a visit. Masters that live at ease should think with tenderness of 
 those that toil for them and bear the burden and heat of the day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Kind and pious salutations were interchanged between Boaz and his 
 reapers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He said to them, <I>The Lord be with you;</I> and they replied, 
 <I>The Lord bless thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 Hereby they expressed,

 [1.] Their mutual respect to each other; he to them as good servants, 
 and they to him as a good master. When he came to them he did not fall 
 a chiding them, as if he came only to find fault and exercise his 
 authority, but he prayed for them: "<I>The Lord be with you,</I> 
 prosper you, and give you health and strength, and preserve you from 
 any disaster." Nor did they, as soon as ever he was out of hearing, 
 fall a cursing him, as some ill-natured servants that hate their 
 master's eye, but they returned his courtesy: "<I>The Lord bless 
 thee,</I> and make our labours serviceable to thy prosperity." Things 
 are likely to go on well in a house where there is such good-will as 
 this between master and servants. 

 [2.] Their joint-dependence upon the divine providence. They express
 their kindness to each other by praying one for another. They show
 not only their courtesy, but their piety, and acknowledgement that all 
 good comes from the presence and blessing of God, which therefore we 
 should value and desire above any thing else both for ourselves and 
 others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Let us hence learn to use, 

 [1.] Courteous salutations, as expressions of a sincere good-will to 
 our friends. 

 [2.] Pious ejaculations, lifting up our hearts to God for his favour, 
 in such short prayers as these. Only we must take heed that they do 
 not degenerate into formality, lest in them we <I>take the name of the 
 Lord our God in vain;</I> but, if we be serious in them, we may in 
 them keep up our communion with God, and fetch in mercy and grace from 
 him. It appears to have been the usual custom thus to wish reapers 
 good speed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+129:7,8">Ps. cxxix. 7, 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He took an account from his reapers concerning a stranger he met 
 with in the field, and gave necessary orders concerning her, that they 
 should not touch her 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 nor reproach her, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Masters must take care, not only that they do no hurt themselves, but 
 that they suffer not their servants and those under them to do hurt. 
 He also ordered them to be kind to her, and <I>let fall some of the 
 handfuls on purpose for her.</I> Though it is fit that masters should 
 restrain and rebuke their servants' wastefulness, yet they should not 
 tie them up from being charitable, but give them allowance for that, 
 with prudent directions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Boaz was very kind to Ruth, and showed her a great deal of favour, 
 induced to it by the account he had of her, and what he observed 
 concerning her, God also inclining his heart to countenance her. 
 Coming among his reapers, he observed this stranger among them, and 
 got intelligence from his steward who she was, and here is a very 
 particular account of what passed concerning her.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The steward gave to Boaz a very fair account of her, proper to 
 recommend her to his favour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 (1.) That she was a stranger, and therefore one of those that by the
 law of God were to <I>gather the gleanings of the harvest,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:9,10">Lev. xix. 9, 10</A>.
 
 She is the Moabitish damsel.

 (2.) That she was allied to his family; she came back with Naomi, the 
 wife of Elimelech, a kinsman of Boaz.

 (3.) That she was a proselyte, for she came out of the country of Moab 
 to settle in the land of Israel.

 (4.) That she was very modest, and had not gleaned till she had asked 
 leave.

 (5.) That she was very industrious, and had continued close to her 
 work from morning even until now. And the poor that are industrious 
 and willing to take pains are fit to be encouraged. Now, in the heat 
 of the day, she tarried a little in the house or booth that was set up 
 in the field for shelter from the weather to repose herself, and some 
 suggest that it is probably she retired for her devotion. But she soon 
 came back to her work, and, except that little intermission, kept 
 close to it all day, though it was not what she had been used to. 
 Servants should be just in the character and reports they give to 
 their masters, and take heed they do not misrepresent any person, nor 
 without cause discourage their master's charity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Boaz was hereupon extremely civil to her in divers instances. 

 (1.) He ordered her to attend his reapers in every field they gathered
 in and not to glean in the field of another, for she should not need 
 to go any where else to better herself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Abide here fast by my maidens;</I> for those of her own sex were
 the fittest company for her.

 (2.) He charged all his servants to be very tender of her and
 respectful to her, and no doubt they would be so to one to whom they 
 saw their master kind. She was a stranger, and it is probably her
 language, dress, and mien differed much from theirs; but he charged 
 them that they should not in any thing affront her, or be abusive to 
 her, as rude servants are too apt to be to strangers.

 (3.) He bade her welcome to the entertainment he had provided for his
 own servants. He ordered her, not only to drink of the water which was 
 drawn for them (for that seems to be the liquor he means, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>,

 drawn from the famous well of Beth-lehem which was by the gate, the 
 water of which David longed for,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+23:15">2 Sam. xxiii. 15</A>),

 but <I>at meal-time to come and eat of their bread</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 yea, and she should be welcome to their sauce too: <I>Come, dip thy
 morsel in the vinegar,</I> to make it savoury; for God allows us not 
 only nourishing but relishing food, not for necessity only, but for 
 delight. And for encouragement o her, and direction to the servants, 
 he himself, happening to be present when the reapers sat down to meat, 
 <I>reached her parched corn</I> to eat. It is no disparagement to the
 finest hand to be <I>reached forth to the needy</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:20">Prov. xxxi. 20</A>),

 and to be employed in serving the poor. Observe, Boaz was not scanty
 in his provision for his reapers, but sent them so much more than 
 enough for themselves as would be entertainment for a stranger. Thus 
 <I>there is that scattereth and yet increaseth.</I>

 (4.) He commended her for her dutiful respect to her mother-in-law,
 which, though he did not know her by sight, yet he had heard of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>It has been fully shown me all that thou hast done unto thy
 mother-in-law.</I> Note, Those that do well ought to have the praise 
 of it. But that which especially he commended her for was that she had 
 left her own country, and had become a proselyte to the Jewish 
 religion; for so the Chaldee expounds it: "Thou hast come to be 
 proselyted, and to dwell among <I>a people whom thou knowest not.</I>" 
 Those that leave all, to embrace the true religion, are worthy of 
 double honour.

 (5.) He prayed for her
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>The Lord recompense thy work.</I> Her strong affection to the
 commonwealth of Israel, to which she was by birth an alien, was such a 
 work of the divine grace in her as would certainly be crowned with a 
 full reward by him <I>under whose wings she had come to trust.</I> 
 Note, Those that by faith come under the wings of the divine grace, 
 and have a full complacency and confidence in that grace, may be sure 
 of a full recompence of reward for their so doing. From this
 expression, the Jews describe a proselyte to be one that is 
 <I>gathered under the wings of the divine majesty.</I>

 (6.) He encouraged her to go on in her gleaning, and did not offer to
 take her off from that; for the greatest kindness we can do our poor 
 relations is to assist and encourage their industry. Boaz ordered his 
 servants to let her glean among the sheaves, where other gleaners were 
 not allowed to come, and not to reproach her, that is, not to call her 
 <I>thief,</I> or to suspect her of taking more than was allowed her, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 All this shows Boaz to have been a man of a generous spirit, and one 
 that, according to the law, considered the heart of a stranger.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Ruth received his favours with a great deal of humility and 
 gratitude, and conducted herself with as much propriety in her place 
 as he did himself in his, but little thinking that she should shortly 
 be the mistress of that field she was now gleaning in. 

 (1.) She paid all possible respect to him, and gave him honour,
 according to the usage of the country

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>She fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground.</I> Note,
 Good breeding is a great ornament to religion; and we must render 
 <I>honour to whom honour is due.</I>

 (2.) She humbly owned herself unworthy of his favours: "<I>I am a
 stranger</I>

 not so well dressed nor so well taught, not so neat nor so handy."
 Note, It well becomes us all to think meanly of ourselves, and to take 
 notice of that in ourselves which is diminishing, esteeming others 
 better than ourselves. 

 (3.) She gratefully acknowledged his kindness to her; though it was no
 great expense to him, nor much more than what he was obliged to by the 
 divine law, yet she magnifies and admires it: <I>Why have I found 
 grace in thy eyes?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 (4.) She begs the continuance of his good-will: <I>Let me find favour
 in they sight</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 and owns that what he had said had been a cordial to her: <I>Thou hast
 comforted me, for that thou hast spoken friendly to me.</I> Those that 
 are great, and in high places, know not how much good they may do to 
 their inferiors with a kind look or by speaking friendly to them; and 
 so small an expense, one would think, they should not grudge, when it 
 shall be put upon the score of their charity.

 (5.) When Boaz gave her her dinner with his reapers she only ate so
 much as would suffice her, and left the rest, and immediately rose up 
 to glean, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 She did not, under pretence either of her want or of her labour, eat 
 more than was convenient for her, nor so much as to unfit her for work 
 in the afternoon. Temperance is a friend to industry; and we must eat 
 and drink to strengthen us for business, not to indispose us to 
 it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17 So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that
 she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.
 &nbsp; 18 And she took <I>it</I> up, and went into the city: and her mother
 in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave
 to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.
 &nbsp; 19 And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned
 to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take
 knowledge of thee. And she showed her mother in law with whom she
 had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought to day
 <I>is</I> Boaz.
 &nbsp; 20 And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed <I>be</I> he of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to
 the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man <I>is</I> near of kin unto
 us, one of our next kinsmen.
 &nbsp; 21 And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou
 shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my
 harvest.
 &nbsp; 22 And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, <I>It is</I> good,
 my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet
 thee not in any other field.
 &nbsp; 23 So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the
 end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her
 mother in law.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 
 
 I. Ruth finishes her day's work, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 1. She took care not to lose time, for she gleaned until evening. We 
 must not be weary of well-doing, because in due season we shall reap. 
 She did not make an excuse to sit still, or go home, till the evening. 
 Let us <I>work the works of him that sent us, while it is day.</I> She 
 scarcely used, much less did she abuse, the kindness of Boaz; for, 
 though he ordered his servants to leave handfuls for her, she 
 continued to glean the scattered ears. 

 2. She took care not to lose what she had gathered, but threshed it 
 herself, that she might the more easily carry it home, and might have 
 it ready for use. <I>The slothful man roasteth not that which he took 
 in hunting,</I> and so loseth the benefit of it, <I>but the substance 
 of a diligent man is precious,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+12:27">Prov. xii. 27</A>.

 Ruth had gathered it ear by ear, but, when she had put it all 
 together, it was an ephah of barley, about four pecks. Many a little 
 makes a great deal. It is an encouragement to industry that in all 
 labour, even that of gleaning, there is profit, but the <I>talk of the 
 lips tendeth only to penury.</I> When she had got her corn into as 
 little compass as she could, she took it up herself, and carried it 
 into the city, though, had she asked them, it is likely some of Boaz's 
 servants would have done that for her. We should study to be as little 
 as possible troublesome to those that are kind to us. She did not 
 think it either too hard or too mean a service to carry her corn 
 herself into the city, but was rather pleased with what she had gotten 
 by her own industry, and careful to secure it; and let us thus take 
 care that we <I>lose not those things which we have wrought,</I> which 
 we have gained,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:8">2 John 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. She paid her respects to her mother-in-law, went straight home to 
 her and did not go to converse with Boaz's servants, <I>showed her 
 what she had gleaned,</I> that she might see she had not been 
 idle.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. She entertained her with what she had left of the good dinner Boaz 
 had given her. She gave to her what she had reserved, after she was 
 sufficed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 which refers to 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 If she had any thing better than another, her mother should have part 
 with her. Thus, having shown industry abroad, she showed piety at 
 home; so children's maintaining their parents is called

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:4">1 Tim. v. 4</A>),

 and it is part of the honour due to them by the fifth commandment,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:6">Matt. xv. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. She gave her an account of her day's work, and how a kind 
 providence had favoured her in it, which made it very comfortable to 
 her; for the gleanings that a righteous man hath are better than the 
 harvests of many wicked, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:16">Ps. xxxvii. 16</A>.

 (1.) Naomi asked her where she had been: <I>Where hast thou gleaned
 to-day?</I> Note, Parents should take care to enquire into the ways of 
 their children, how, and where, and in what company they spend their 
 time. This may prevent many extravagancies which children, left to 
 themselves, run into, by which they bring both themselves and their 
 parents to shame. If we are not our brethren's, yet surely we are our 
 children's keepers: and we know what a son Adonijah proved, that had 
 never been chidden. Parents should examine their children, not to 
 frighten nor discourage them, not so as to make them hate home or 
 tempt them to tell a lie, but to commend them if they have done well, 
 and with mildness to reprove and caution them if they have done 
 otherwise. It is a good question for us to ask ourselves in the close 
 of every day, "<I>Where have I gleaned to-day?</I> What improvements 
 have I made in knowledge and grace? What have I done or obtained that 
 will turn to a good account?"

 (2.) Ruth gave her a particular account of the kindness she had
 received from Boaz

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>)

 and the hopes she had of further kindness from him, he having ordered
 her to attend his servants throughout all the harvest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Note, Children should look upon themselves as accountable to their 
 parents and to those that are over them, and not think it a 
 disparagement to them to be examined; let them <I>do that which is 
 good,</I> and they shall have praise of the same. Ruth told her mother 
 what kindness Boaz had shown her, that she might take some occasion or 
 another to acknowledge it and return him thanks; but she did not tell 
 her how Boaz had commended her, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Humility teaches us, not only not to praise ourselves, but not to be 
 forward to publish others' praises of us.

 (3.) We are here told what Naomi said to it. 

 [1.] She prayed heartily for him that had been her daughter's 
 benefactor, even before she knew who it was

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>Blessed be he,</I> whoever he was, <I>that did take knowledge of
 thee,</I> shooting the arrow of prayer at a venture. But more 
 particularly when she was told who it was

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>Blessed be he of the Lord.</I> Note, The poor must pray for those
 that are kind and liberal to them, and thus requite them, when they 
 are not capable of making them any other requital. Let the loins of 
 the poor bless those that refresh them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+29:13,31:20">Job xxix. 13; xxxi. 20</A>.

 And he that hears the cries of the poor against their oppressors

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:27">Exod. xxii. 27</A>),

 it may be hoped, will hear the prayers of the poor for their
 benefactors. She now remembered the former kindnesses Boaz had shown 
 to her husband and sons, and joins those to this: he has not <I>left 
 off his kindness to the living and to the dead.</I> If we generously 
 show kindness even to those that seem to have forgotten our former 
 favours, perhaps it may help to revive the remembrance even of those 
 which seem buried. 

 [2.] She acquainted Ruth with the relation their family was in to 
 Boaz: <I>The man is near of kin to us.</I> It should seem she had been 
 so long in Moab that she had forgotten her kindred in the land of 
 Israel, till by this providence God brought it to her mind. At least 
 she had not told Ruth of it, though it might have been some 
 encouragement to a young proselyte. Unlike to humble Naomi are many, 
 who, though fallen into decay themselves, are continually boasting of 
 their great relations. Nay, Observe the chain of thought here, and in 
 it a chain of providences, bringing about what was designed concerning 
 Ruth. Ruth names Boaz as one that had been kind to her. Naomi bethinks 
 herself who that should be, and presently recollects herself: "<I>The 
 man is near of kin to us;</I> now that I hear his name, I remember him 
 very well." This thought brings in another: "He is <I>our next 
 kinsman,</I> our <I>goel,</I> that has the right to redeem our estate 
 that was mortgaged, and therefore from him we may expect further 
 kindness. He is the likeliest man in all Bethlehem to set us up." Thus 
 God brings things to our mind, sometimes on a sudden, that prove to 
 have a wonderful tendency to our good. 

 [3.] She appointed Ruth to continue her attendance in the fields of 
 Boaz

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 "<I>Let them not meet thee in any other field,</I> for that will be
 construed a contempt of his courtesy." Our blessed Saviour is our 
 <I>Goel;</I> it is he that has a right to redeem. If we expect to 
 receive benefit by him, let us closely adhere to him, and his fields, 
 and his family; let us not go to the world and its fields for that 
 which is to be had with him only, and which he has encouraged us to 
 expect from him. Has the Lord dealt bountifully with us? Let us not be 
 found in any other field, nor seek for happiness and satisfaction in 
 the creature. Tradesmen take it ill if those that are in their books 
 go to another shop. We lose divine favours if we slight them. Some 
 think Naomi gave her daughter-in-law a tacit rebuke; she had spoken

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>)

 of keeping fast by the young <I>men.</I> "Nay," said Naomi
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 "<I>It is good that thou go out with his maidens; they</I> are fitter
 company for thee than the <I>young men.</I>" But they are too 
 critical. Ruth spoke of the young men because they were the principal 
 labourers, and to them Boaz had given directions concerning her; and 
 Naomi takes it for granted that, while she attended the young men, her 
 society would be with the maidens, as was fit. Ruth dutifully
 observed her mother's directions; she continued to glean, to the end, 
 not only of barley-harvest, but of the wheat-harvest, which followed 
 it, that she might gather food in harvest to serve for winter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:6-8">Prov. vi. 6-8</A>.

 She also kept fast by the maidens of Boaz, with whom she afterwards 
 cultivated an acquaintance, which might do her service, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 But she constantly came to her mother at night in due time, as became 
 a virtuous woman, that was for working days, and not for merry nights.
 And when the harvest was ended (as bishop Patrick expounds it) she did 
 not gad abroad, but kept her aged mother company at home. Dinah went
 out to see the daughters of the land, and we know what a disgrace her 
 vanity ended in. Ruth kept at home, and helped to maintain her mother, 
 and went out on no other errand than to get provision for her, and we 
 shall find afterwards what preferment her humility and industry ended 
 in. <I>Seest thou a man diligent in his business?</I> Honour is before 
 him.</P>
