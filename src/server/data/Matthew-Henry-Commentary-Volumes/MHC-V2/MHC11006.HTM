 Great and long preparation had been making for the building of the 
 temple, and here, at length, comes an account of the building of it; a 
 noble piece of work it was, one of the wonders of the world, and taking 
 in its spiritual significancy, one of the glories of the church. Here 
 is, 

 I. The time when it was built 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:1">ver. 1</A>),

 and how long it was in the building, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:37,38">ver. 37, 38</A>.

 II. The silence with which it was build, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:7">ver. 7</A>.

 III. The dimensions of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:2,3">ver. 2, 3</A>.

 IV. The message God sent to Solomon, when it was in the building, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:11-13">ver. 11-13</A>.

 V. The particulars: windows 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:4">ver. 4</A>),
 
 chambers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:5,6,8-10">ver. 5, 6, 8-10</A>),

 the walls and flooring 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:15-18">ver. 15-18</A>),
 
 the oracle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:19-22">ver. 19-22</A>),
 
 the cherubim
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:23-30">ver. 23-30</A>),
 
 the doors 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:31-35">ver. 31-35</A>),
 
 and the inner court, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:36">ver. 36</A>.

 Many learned men have well bestowed their pains in expounding the
 description here given of the temple according to the rules of
 architecture, and solving the difficulties which, upon search, they
 find in it; but in that matter, having nothing new to offer, we will
 not be particular or curious; it was then well understood, and every 
 man's eyes that saw this glorious structure furnished him with the best 
 critical exposition of this chapter.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year
 after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt,
 in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month
 Zif, which <I>is</I> the second month, that he began to build the
 house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 2 And the house which king Solomon built for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the
 length thereof <I>was</I> threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof
 twenty <I>cubits,</I> and the height thereof thirty cubits.
 &nbsp; 3 And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits
 <I>was</I> the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house;
 <I>and</I> ten cubits <I>was</I> the breadth thereof before the house.
 &nbsp; 4 And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.
 &nbsp; 5 And against the wall of the house he built chambers round
 about, <I>against</I> the walls of the house round about, <I>both</I> of
 the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:
 &nbsp; 6 The nethermost chamber <I>was</I> five cubits broad, and the
 middle <I>was</I> six cubits broad, and the third <I>was</I> seven cubits
 broad: for without <I>in the wall</I> of the house he made narrowed
 rests round about, that <I>the beams</I> should not be fastened in the
 walls of the house.
 &nbsp; 7 And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone
 made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was
 neither hammer nor axe <I>nor</I> any tool of iron heard in the house,
 while it was in building.
 &nbsp; 8 The door for the middle chamber <I>was</I> in the right side of
 the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle
 <I>chamber,</I> and out of the middle into the third.
 &nbsp; 9 So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house
 with beams and boards of cedar.
 &nbsp; 10 And <I>then</I> he built chambers against all the house, five
 cubits high: and they rested on the house <I>with</I> timber of cedar.

 Here, 

 I. The temple is called <I>the house of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 because it was,

 1. Directed and modelled by him. Infinite Wisdom was the architect, and
 gave David the plan or pattern by the Spirit, not by word of mouth 
 only, but, for the greater certainty and exactness, in writing

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+28:11,12">1 Chron. xxviii. 11, 12</A>),

 as he had given to Moses in the mouth a draught of the tabernacle. 

 2. Dedicated and devoted to him and to his honour, to be employed in
 his service, so his as never any other house was, for he manifested his 
 glory in it (so as never in any other) in a way agreeable to that 
 dispensation; for, when there were carnal ordinances, there was a 
 <I>worldly sanctuary,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:1,10">Heb. ix. 1, 10</A>.

 This gave it its <I>beauty of holiness,</I> that it was <I>the house of
 the Lord,</I> which far transcended all its other beauties.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The time when it began to be built is exactly set down. 

 1. It was just 480 years after the bringing of the children of Israel 
 out of Egypt. Allowing forty years to Moses, seventeen to Joshua, 299 
 to the Judges, forty to Eli, forty to Samuel and Saul, forty to David, 
 and four to Solomon before he began the work, we have just the sum of 
 480. So long it was after that holy state was founded before that holy
 house was built, which, in less than 430 years, was burnt by 
 Nebuchadnezzar. It was thus deferred because Israel had, by their
 sins, rendered themselves unworthy of this honour, and because God 
 would show how little he values external pomp and splendour in his 
 service: he was in no haste for a temple. David's tent, which was clean 
 and convenient, though it was neither stately nor rich, nor, for aught 
 that appears, ever consecrated, is called the <I>house of the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:20">2 Sam. xii. 20</A>),
 
 and served as well as Solomon's temple; yet, when God gave Solomon
 great wealth, he put it into his heart thus to employ it, and 
 graciously accepted him, chiefly because it was to be a shadow of good 
 things to come, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:9">Heb. ix. 9</A>.

 2. It was in the fourth year of Solomon's reign, the first three years
 being taken up in settling the affairs of his kingdom, that he might 
 not find any embarrassment from them in this work. It is not time lost 
 which is spent in composing ourselves for the work of God, and 
 disentangling ourselves from every thing which might distract or divert 
 us. During this time he was adding to the preparations which his father 
 had made

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+22:14">1 Chron. xxii. 14</A>),

 hewing the stone, squaring the timber, and getting every thing ready,
 so that he is not to be blamed for slackness in deferring it so long. 
 We are truly serving God when we are preparing for his service and 
 furnishing ourselves for it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The materials are brought in, ready for their place 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 so ready that there was <I>neither hammer nor ax heard in the house
 while it was in building.</I> In all building Solomon prescribes it as 
 a rule of prudence to <I>prepare the work in the field,</I> and 
 <I>afterwards build,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+24:27">Prov. xxiv. 27</A>.

 But here, it seems, the preparation was more than ordinarily full and
 exact, to such a degree that, when the several parts came to be put 
 together, there was nothing defective to be added, nothing amiss to be 
 amended. It was to be the temple of God of peace, and therefore no iron 
 tool must be heard in it.  Quietness and silence both become and 
 befriend religious exercises: God's work should be done with as much 
 care and as little noise as may be. The temple was thrown down with 
 axes and hammers, and those that threw it down roared <I>in the midst 
 of the congregation</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:4,6">Ps. lxxiv. 4, 6</A>);

 but it was built up in silence. Clamour and violence often hinder the
 work of God, but never further it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The dimensions are laid down 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>)

 according to the rules of proportion. Some observe that the length and
 breadth were just double to that of the tabernacle. Now that Israel had 
 grown more numerous the place of their meeting needed to be enlarged 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:1,2">Isa. liv. 1, 2</A>),

 and now that they had grown richer they were the better able to enlarge
 it. Where God sows plentifully he expects to reap so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. An account of the windows 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 They were <I>broad within, and narrow without, Marg.</I> Such should
 the eyes of our mind be, reflecting nearer on ourselves than on other 
 people, looking much within, to judge ourselves, but little without, to 
 censure our brethren. The narrowness of the lights intimated the 
 darkness of that dispensation, in comparison with the gospel day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The chambers are described 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>),

 which served as vestries, in which the utensils of the tabernacle were
 carefully laid up, and where the priests dressed and undressed 
 themselves and left the clothes in which they ministered: probably in 
 some of these chambers they feasted upon the holy things. Solomon was 
 not so intent upon the magnificence of the house as to neglect the 
 conveniences that were requisite for the offices thereof, that every 
 thing might be done decently and in order. Care was taken that the
 beams should not be fastened in the walls to weaken them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Let not the church's strength be impaired under pretence of adding to 
 its beauty or convenience.</P>

 <A NAME="1Ki6_14"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11 And the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came to Solomon, saying,
 &nbsp; 12 <I>Concerning</I> this house which thou art in building, if thou
 wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all
 my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with
 thee, which I spake unto David thy father:
 &nbsp; 13 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not
 forsake my people Israel.
 &nbsp; 14 So Solomon built the house, and finished it.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The word God sent to Solomon, when he was engaged in building the 
 temple. God let him know that he took notice of what he was doing, 
 <I>the house he was now building,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 None employ themselves for God without having his eye upon them. "<I>I 
 know thy works,</I> thy good works." He assured him that if he would 
 proceed and persevere in obedience to the divine law, and keep in the 
 way of duty and the true worship of God, the divine loving-kindness 
 should be drawn out both to himself <I>(I will perform my word with 
 thee</I>) and to his kingdom: "Israel shall be ever owned as my people; 
 I will <I>dwell among them,</I> and <I>not forsake them.</I>" This word 
 God sent him probably by a prophet,

 1. That by the promise he might be encouraged and comforted in his 
 work. Perhaps sometimes the great care, expense, and fatigue of it, 
 made him ready to wish he had never begun it; but this would help him 
 through the difficulties of it, that the promised establishment of his 
 family and kingdom would abundantly recompense all his pains. An eye to 
 the promise will carry us cheerfully through our work; and those who 
 wish well to the public will think nothing too much that they can do to 
 secure and perpetuate to it the tokens of God's presence. 

 2. That, by the condition annexed, he might be awakened to consider
 that though he built the temple ever so strong the glory of it would 
 soon depart, unless he and his people continued <I>to walk in God's 
 statutes.</I> God plainly let him know that all this charge which he 
 and his people were at, in erecting this temple, would neither excuse 
 them from obedience to the law of God nor shelter them from his 
 judgments in case of disobedience. Keeping God's commandments is 
 better, and more pleasing to him, than building churches.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The work Solomon did for God: <I>So he built the house</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 <I>so</I> animated by the message God had sent him, <I>so</I>
 admonished not to expect that God should own his building unless he 
 were obedient to his laws: "Lord, I proceed upon these terms, being 
 firmly resolved to walk in thy statutes." The strictness of God's 
 government will never drive a good man from his service, but quicken 
 him in it. Solomon built and finished, he went on with the work, and 
 God went along with him till it was completed. It is spoken both to 
 God's praise and his: he grew not weary of the work, met not with any 
 obstructions (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:24">Ezra iv. 24</A>),

 did not out-build his property, nor do it by halves, but, having begun
 to build, was both able and willing to finish; for he was a wise 
 builder.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15 And he built the walls of the house within with boards of
 cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling:
 <I>and</I> he covered <I>them</I> on the inside with wood, and covered the
 floor of the house with planks of fir.
 &nbsp; 16 And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both
 the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built
 <I>them</I> for it within, <I>even</I> for the oracle, <I>even</I> for the most
 holy <I>place.</I>
 &nbsp; 17 And the house, that <I>is,</I> the temple before it, was forty
 cubits <I>long.</I>
 &nbsp; 18 And the cedar of the house within <I>was</I> carved with knops
 and open flowers: all <I>was</I> cedar; there was no stone seen.
 &nbsp; 19 And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there
 the ark of the covenant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 20 And the oracle in the forepart <I>was</I> twenty cubits in
 length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the
 height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and <I>so</I>
 covered the altar <I>which was of</I> cedar.
 &nbsp; 21 So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he
 made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he
 overlaid it with gold.
 &nbsp; 22 And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had
 finished all the house: also the whole altar that <I>was</I> by the
 oracle he overlaid with gold.
 &nbsp; 23 And within the oracle he made two cherubims <I>of</I> olive tree,
 <I>each</I> ten cubits high.
 &nbsp; 24 And five cubits <I>was</I> the one wing of the cherub, and five
 cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of
 the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other <I>were</I> ten
 cubits.
 &nbsp; 25 And the other cherub <I>was</I> ten cubits: both the cherubims
 <I>were</I> of one measure and one size.
 &nbsp; 26 The height of the one cherub <I>was</I> ten cubits, and so <I>was
 it</I> of the other cherub.
 &nbsp; 27 And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they
 stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of
 the one touched the <I>one</I> wall, and the wing of the other cherub
 touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in
 the midst of the house.
 &nbsp; 28 And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.
 &nbsp; 29 And he carved all the walls of the house round about with
 carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers,
 within and without.
 &nbsp; 30 And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and
 without.
 &nbsp; 31 And for the entering of the oracle he made doors <I>of</I> olive
 tree: the lintel <I>and</I> side posts <I>were</I> a fifth part <I>of the
 wall.</I>
 &nbsp; 32 The two doors also <I>were of</I> olive tree; and he carved upon
 them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and
 overlaid <I>them</I> with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims,
 and upon the palm trees.
 &nbsp; 33 So also made he for the door of the temple posts <I>of</I> olive
 tree, a fourth part <I>of the wall.</I>
 &nbsp; 34 And the two doors <I>were of</I> fir tree: the two leaves of the
 one door <I>were</I> folding, and the two leaves of the other door
 <I>were</I> folding.
 &nbsp; 35 And he carved <I>thereon</I> cherubims and palm trees and open
 flowers: and covered <I>them</I> with gold fitted upon the carved
 work.
 &nbsp; 36 And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone,
 and a row of cedar beams.
 &nbsp; 37 In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> laid, in the month Zif:
 &nbsp; 38 And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which <I>is</I> the
 eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts
 thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven
 years in building it.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. We have a particular account of the details of the building.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The wainscot of the temple. It was of cedar 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 which was strong and durable, and of a very sweet smell. The wainscot
 was curiously carved with knops (like eggs or apples) and flowers, no 
 doubt as the fashion then was, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The gilding. It was not like ours, washed over, but <I>the whole 
 house,</I> all the inside of the temple 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),
 
 even the floor
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 he <I>overlaid with gold,</I> and the most holy place with <I>pure
 gold,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Solomon would spare no expense necessary to make it every way 
 sumptuous. Gold was under foot there, as it should be in all the living 
 temples: the abundance of it lessened its worth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The oracle, or <I>speaking-place</I> (for so the word signifies), 
 <I>the holy of holies,</I> so called because thence God spoke to Moses, 
 and perhaps to the high priest, when he consulted with the breast-plate 
 of judgment. In this place <I>the ark of the covenant was to be 
 set,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Solomon made every thing new, and more magnificent than it had been, 
 except the ark, which was still the same that Moses made, with its 
 mercy-seat and cherubim; that was the token of God's presence, which is 
 always the same with his people whether they meet in tent or temple, 
 and changes not with their condition.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The cherubim. Besides those at the ends of the mercy-seat, which 
 covered the ark, 

 (1.) Solomon set up two more, very large ones, images of young men (as 
 some think), with wings made of olive-wood, and all overlaid with gold,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:23-28"><I>v.</I> 23</A>,

 &c. This most holy place was much larger
 than that in the tabernacle, and therefore the ark would have seemed 
 lost in it, and the dead wall would have been unsightly, if it had not 
 been thus adorned. 

 (2.) He carved cherubim upon all the walls of the house, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 The heathen set up images of their gods and worshipped them; but these 
 were designed to represent the servants and attendants of the God of 
 Israel, the holy angels, not to be themselves worshipped (<I>see thou 
 do it not</I>), but to show how great he is whom we are to worship.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The doors. The folding doors that led into the oracle were but a 
 fifth part of the wall 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),
 
 those into the temple were a fourth part

 but both were beautified with cherubim engraven on them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:32,35"><I>v.</I> 32, 35</A>.</P>

 6. The inner court, in which the brazen altar was at which the priests 
 ministered. This was separated from the court where the people were by 
 a low wall, three rows of hewn stone tipped with a cornice of cedar 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>),

 that over it the people might see what was done and hear what the
 priests said to them; for, even under that dispensation, they were not 
 kept wholly either in the dark or at a distance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. The time spent in this building. It was but seven years and a half 
 from the founding to the finishing of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 Considering the vastness and elegance of the building, and the many 
 appurtenances to it which were necessary to fit it for use, it was soon 
 done. Solomon was in earnest in it, had money enough, had nothing to 
 divert him from it, and many hands made quick work. He finished it (as 
 the margin reads it) with all the appurtenances thereof, and with all 
 the ordinances thereof, not only built the place, but set forward the 
 work for which it was built.</P>

 II. Let us now see what was typified by this temple. 

 1. Christ is the true temple; he himself spoke of the temple of his 
 body,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:21">John ii. 21</A>.

 God himself prepared him his body, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:5">Heb. x. 5</A>.

 <I>In him dwelt the fulness of the Godhead,</I> as the <I>Shechinah</I>
 in the temple. In him meet all God's spiritual Israel. Through him we 
 have access with confidence to God. All the angels of God, those 
 blessed cherubim, have a charge to worship him.

 2. Every believer is a living temple, in whom the Spirit of God dwells,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:16">1 Cor. iii. 16</A>.

 Even the body is such by virtue of its union with the soul,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:19">1 Cor. vi. 19</A>.

 We are not only wonderfully made by the divine providence, but more
 wonderfully made anew by the divine grace. This living temple is built
 upon Christ as its foundation and will be perfected in due time. 

 3. The gospel church is the mystical temple; it grows to a <I>holy 
 temple in the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:21">Eph. ii. 21</A>),

 enriched and beautified with the gifts and graces of the Spirit, as
 Solomon's temple with gold and precious stones. Only Jews built the 
 tabernacle, but Gentiles joined with them in building the temple. Even 
 strangers and foreigners are built up <I>a habitation of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:19,22">Eph. ii. 19, 22</A>.

 The temple was divided into the holy place and the most holy, the
 courts of it into the outer and inner; so there are the visible and the 
 invisible church.  The door into the temple was wider than that into 
 the oracle. Many enter into profession that come short of salvation. 
 This temple is built firm, upon a rock, not to be taken down as the 
 tabernacle of the Old Testament was. The temple was long in preparing, 
 but was built at last. The top-stone of the gospel church will, at 
 length, be brought forth with shoutings, and it is a pity that there 
 should be the clashing of axes and hammers in the building of it.  
 Angels are ministering spirits, attending the church on all sides and 
 all the members of it.

 4. Heaven is the everlasting temple. There the church will be fixed,
 and no longer movable. The streets of the new Jerusalem, in allusion to 
 the flooring of the temple, are said to be <I>of pure gold,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:21">Rev. xxi. 21</A>.

 The cherubim there always attend the throne of glory. The temple was
 uniform, and in heaven there is the perfection of beauty and harmony. 
 In Solomon's temple there was no noise of axes and hammers.  Every 
 thing is quiet and serene in heaven; all that shall be stones in that 
 building must in the present sate of probation and preparation be 
 fitted and made ready for it, must be hewn and squared by divine grace, 
 and so made meet for a place there.</P>
