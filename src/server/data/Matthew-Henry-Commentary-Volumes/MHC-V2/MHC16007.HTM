 The success of one good design for God and our generation should
 encourage us to proceed and form some other; Nehemiah did so, having
 fortified Jerusalem with gates and walls, his next care is,

 I. To see the city well kept, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+7:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. To see it well peopled, in order to which he here reviews and calls
 over the register of the children of the captivity, the families that
 returned at first, and records it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+7:5-73">ver. 5-73</A>.

 It is the same, in effect, with that which we had,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:1-62">Ezra ii.</A>

 What use he made of it we shall find afterwards, when he brought one of
 ten to live in Jerusalem,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set
 up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites
 were appointed,
 &nbsp; 2  That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the
 palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he <I>was</I> a faithful man, and
 feared God above many.
 &nbsp; 3  And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be
 opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them
 shut the doors, and bar <I>them:</I> and appoint watches of the
 inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one
 <I>to be</I> over against his house.
 &nbsp; 4  Now the city <I>was</I> large and great: but the people <I>were</I> few
 therein, and the houses <I>were</I> not builded.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God saith concerning his church 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:6">Isa. lxii. 6</A>),

 <I>I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem!</I> This is
 Nehemiah's care here; for dead walls, without living watchmen, are but 
 a poor defence to a city.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He appointed <I>the porters, singers, and Levites,</I> in their
 places to their work. This is meant of their work in general, which was 
 to attend the temple service; it had been neglected in some degree, but 
 now was revived. God's worship is the defence of a place, and his 
 ministers, when they mind their duty, are watchmen on the walls. Or, in 
 particular, he ordered them to be ready against the wall was to be 
 dedicated, that they might perform that service in an orderly and 
 solemn manner; and the dedication of it was its strength. That is 
 likely to be beneficial to us which is devoted to God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He appointed two governors or consuls, to whom he committed the 
 care of the city, and gave them in charge to provide for the public 
 peace and safety. Hanani, his brother, who came to him with the tidings 
 of the desolations of Jerusalem, was one, a man of approved integrity 
 and affection to his country; the other was Hananiah, who had been 
 ruler of the palace: for he that has approved himself faithful in less 
 shall be entrusted with more. Of this Hananiah it is said that he was a 
 <I>faithful man and one that feared God above many,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+7:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 Note,

 1.  Among those who fear God truly there are some who fear him greatly,
 and excel others in the expressions and instances of that fear; and 
 they are worthy a double portion of that honour which is due to those 
 that <I>fear the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+15:4">Ps. xv. 4</A>.

 There were many in Jerusalem that feared God, but this good man was
 more eminent for religion and serious godliness than any.

 2. Those that fear God must evidence it by their being faithful to all
 men and universally conscientious. 

 3. God's Jerusalem is then likely to flourish when those rule in it,
 and have charge of it, who excel in virtue, and are eminent both for 
 godliness and honesty. It is supposed, by some, that Nehemiah was now 
 about to return to the Persian court to have his commission renewed, 
 and that he left these two worthy men in charge with the affairs of the 
 city in his absence. Good governors, when and where they cannot act 
 themselves, must be very careful whom they depute.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He gave orders about the shutting of the gates and the guarding of 
 the walls, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+7:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.
 
 See here,

 1. What the present state of Jerusalem was. The city, in compass, was
 large and great. The walls enclosed the same ground as formerly; but 
 much of it lay waste, for the houses were not built, few at least in 
 comparison with what had been; so that Nehemiah walled the city in 
 faith, and with an eye to that promise of the replenishing of it which 
 God had lately made by the prophet,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:3-8">Zech. viii. 3</A>,

 &c. Though the people were now few, he believed they would be
 multiplied, and therefore built the walls so as to make room for them;
 had he not depended upon this he might have thought walls without a 
 city as great a reproach as a city without walls. 

 2. What was the care of Nehemiah for it. He ordered the rulers of the
 city themselves,

 (1.) To stand by, and see the city-gates shut up and barred every 
 night; for in vain had they a wall if they were careless of their 
 gates.

 (2.) To take care that they should not be opened in the morning till 
 they could see that all was clear and quiet.

 (3.) To set sentinels upon the walls, or elsewhere, at convenient 
 distances, who should, in case of the approach of the enemy, give 
 timely notice to the city of the danger; and, as it came to their turn 
 to watch, they must post themselves <I>over against their own 
 houses,</I> because of them, it might be presumed, they would be in a 
 particular manner careful. The public safety depends upon every one's 
 particular care to guard himself and his own family against sin, that 
 common enemy. It is every one's interest to watch, but many understand 
 not their own interest; it is therefore incumbent upon magistrates to 
 appoint watches. And as this people had lately found God with them in 
 their building (else they would have built in vain), so now that the 
 wall was built, no doubt, they were made sensible that <I>except the 
 Lord kept the city the watchman waked but in vain,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles,
 and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by
 genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them which
 came up at the first, and found written therein,
 &nbsp; 6  These <I>are</I> the children of the province, that went up out of
 the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom
 Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came
 again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city;
 &nbsp; 7  Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah,
 Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah.
 The number, <I>I say,</I> of the men of the people of Israel <I>was
 this;</I>
 &nbsp; 8  The children of Parosh, two thousand a hundred seventy and
 two.

 &nbsp; 22  The children of Hashum, three hundred twenty and eight.
 &nbsp; 23  The children of Bezai, three hundred twenty and four.
 &nbsp; 24  The children of Hariph, a hundred and twelve.
 &nbsp; 25  The children of Gibeon, ninety and five.
 &nbsp; 26  The men of Beth-lehem and Netophah, a hundred fourscore and
 eight.
 &nbsp; 27  The men of Anathoth, a hundred twenty and eight.
 &nbsp; 28  The men of Beth-azmaveth, forty and two.
 &nbsp; 29  The men of Kirjath-jearim, Chephirah, and Beeroth, seven
 hundred forty and three.
 &nbsp; 30  The men of Ramah and Geba, six hundred twenty and one.
 &nbsp; 31  The men of Michmas, a hundred and twenty and two.
 &nbsp; 32  The men of Beth-el and Ai, a hundred twenty and three.
 &nbsp; 33  The men of the other Nebo, fifty and two.
 &nbsp; 34  The children of the other Elam, a thousand two hundred fifty
 and four.
 &nbsp; 35  The children of Harim, three hundred and twenty.
 &nbsp; 36  The children of Jericho, three hundred forty and five.
 &nbsp; 37  The children of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred twenty
 and one.
 &nbsp; 38  The children of Senaah, three thousand nine hundred and
 thirty.
 &nbsp; 39  The priests: the children of Jedaiah, of the house of
 Jeshua, nine hundred seventy and three.
 &nbsp; 40  The children of Immer, a thousand fifty and two.
 &nbsp; 41  The children of Pashur, a thousand two hundred forty and
 seven.
 &nbsp; 42  The children of Harim, a thousand and seventeen.
 &nbsp; 43  The Levites: the children of Jeshua, of Kadmiel, <I>and</I> of
 the children of Hodevah, seventy and four.
 &nbsp; 44  The singers: the children of Asaph, a hundred forty and
 eight.
 &nbsp; 45  The porters: the children of Shallum, the children of Ater,
 the children of Talmon, the children of Akkub, the children of
 Hatita, the children of Shobai, a hundred thirty and eight.
 &nbsp; 46  The Nethinims: the children of Ziha, the children of
 Hashupha, the children of Tabbaoth,
 &nbsp; 47  The children of Keros, the children of Sia, the children of
 Padon,
 &nbsp; 48  The children of Lebana, the children of Hagaba, the children
 of Shalmai,
 &nbsp; 49  The children of Hanan, the children of Giddel, the children
 of Gahar,
 &nbsp; 50  The children of Reaiah, the children of Rezin, the children
 of Nekoda,
 &nbsp; 51  The children of Gazzam, the children of Uzza, the children
 of Phaseah,
 &nbsp; 52  The children of Besai, the children of Meunim, the children
 of Nephishesim,
 &nbsp; 53  The children of Bakbuk, the children of Hakupha, the
 children of Harhur,
 &nbsp; 54  The children of Bazlith, the children of Mehida, the
 children of Harsha,
 &nbsp; 55  The children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children
 of Tamah,
 &nbsp; 56  The children of Neziah, the children of Hatipha.
 &nbsp; 57  The children of Solomon's servants: the children of Sotai,
 the children of Sophereth, the children of Perida,
 &nbsp; 58  The children of Jaala, the children of Darkon, the children
 of Giddel,
 &nbsp; 59  The children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the
 children of Pochereth of Zebaim, the children of Amon.
 &nbsp; 60  All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants,
 <I>were</I> three hundred ninety and two.
 &nbsp; 61  And these <I>were</I> they which went up <I>also</I> from Tel-melah,
 Tel-haresha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer: but they could not show
 their father's house, nor their seed, whether they <I>were</I> of
 Israel.
 &nbsp; 62  The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the
 children of Nekoda, six hundred forty and two.
 &nbsp; 63  And of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of
 Koz, the children of Barzillai, which took <I>one</I> of the daughters
 of Barzillai the Gileadite to wife, and was called after their
 name.
 &nbsp; 64  These sought their register <I>among</I> those that were reckoned
 by genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they, as
 polluted, put from the priesthood.
 &nbsp; 65  And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat
 of the most holy things, till there stood <I>up</I> a priest with Urim
 and Thummim.
 &nbsp; 66  The whole congregation together <I>was</I> forty and two thousand
 three hundred and threescore,
 &nbsp; 67  Beside their manservants and their maidservants, of whom
 <I>there were</I> seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and
 they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing
 women.
 &nbsp; 68  Their horses, seven hundred thirty and six: their mules, two
 hundred forty and five:
 &nbsp; 69  <I>Their</I> camels, four hundred thirty and five: six thousand
 seven hundred and twenty asses.
 &nbsp; 70  And some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work. The
 Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold, fifty
 basons, five hundred and thirty priests' garments.
 &nbsp; 71  And <I>some</I> of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure
 of the work twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand and
 two hundred pound of silver.
 &nbsp; 72  And <I>that</I> which the rest of the people gave <I>was</I> twenty
 thousand drams of gold, and two thousand pound of silver, and
 threescore and seven priests' garments.
 &nbsp; 73  So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the
 singers, and <I>some</I> of the people, and the Nethinims, and all
 Israel, dwelt in their cities; and when the seventh month came,
 the children of Israel <I>were</I> in their cities.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here another good project of Nehemiah's; for wise and zealous 
 men will be always contriving something or other for the glory of God 
 and the edification of his church. He knew very well that the safety of 
 a city, under God, depends more upon the number and valour of the 
 inhabitants than upon the height or strength of its walls; and 
 therefore, observing that the people were few that dwelt in it, he 
 thought fit to take an account of the people, that he might find what 
 families had formerly had their settlement in Jerusalem, but were now 
 removed into the country, that he might bring them back, and what 
 families could in any other way be influenced by their religion, or by 
 their business, to come and rebuild the houses in Jerusalem and dwell 
 in them. So little reason have we to wish that we may be placed alone 
 in the earth, or in Jerusalem itself, that much of our safety and 
 comfort depends upon our neighbours and friends; the more the stronger, 
 the more the merrier. It is the wisdom of the governors of a nation to 
 keep the balance even between the city and country, that the metropolis 
 be not so extravagantly large as to drain and impoverish the country, 
 nor yet so weak as not to be able to protect it. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Whence this good design of Nehemiah's came. He owns, <I>My God put 
 it into my heart,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+7:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Note, Whatever good motion is in our minds, either prudent or pious, we
 must acknowledge it to come from God. It was he that <I>put it into our 
 hearts;</I> for every good gift and every good work are from above. He 
 gives knowledge; he gives grace; all is of him, and therefore all must 
 be to him. What is done by human prudence must be ascribed to the 
 direction of divine Providence; he that teaches the husbandman his 
 discretion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:26">Isa. xxviii. 26</A>)

 teaches the statesman his.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What method he took in prosecution of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He called the rulers together, and the people, that he might have an 
 account of the present state of their families--their number and
 strength, and where they were settled. It is probable that when he 
 summoned them to come together he ordered them to bring such an account 
 along with them out of their several districts. And I doubt they were 
 not so many but that it might be soon done.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He reviewed the old <I>register of the genealogy of those who came 
 up at the first,</I> and compared the present accounts with that; and 
 here we have the repetition of that out of Ezra 

 2. The title is the same here

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+7:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>)
 
 as there
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+7:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>):

 <I>These are the children of the province,</I> &c. Two things are here
 repeated and recorded a second time from thence--the names and numbers 
 of their several families, and their oblations to the service of the 
 temple. The repetition of these accounts may intimate to us the delight 
 which the great God is pleased to take in the persons, families, and 
 services of his spiritual Israel, and the particular notice he takes of 
 them. He knows those that are his, knows them all, knows them by name, 
 has his eye on the register of those children of the captivity, and 
 does all according to the ancient counsel of his will concerning 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Here is an account of the heads of the several families that first 
 came up, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+7:6-69"><I>v.</I> 6-69</A>.
 
 As to this,

 [1.] Though it seem of little use to us now, yet then it was of great
 use, to compare what they had been with what they now were. We may 
 suppose they were much increased by this time; but it would do well for 
 them to remember their small beginnings, that they might acknowledge 
 God in multiplying their families and building them up. By this means 
 likewise their genealogies would be preserved, and the distinction of 
 their families kept up, till the Messiah should come, and then an end 
 be put to all their genealogies, which were preserved for his sake, but 
 afterwards were endless. But, 

 [2.] There are many differences in the numbers between this catalogue 
 and that in Ezra. Most of them indeed are exactly the same, and some 
 others within a very few under or over (one or two perhaps); and 
 therefore I cannot think, as some do, that that was the number of these 
 families at their first coming and this as they were now, which was at 
 least forty years after (some make it much more); for we cannot suppose 
 so many families to be not at all, or but little, altered in their 
 numbers in all that time; therefore what differences there are we may 
 suppose to arise either from the mistakes of transcribers, which easily 
 happen in numbers, or from the diversity of the copies from which they 
 were taken. Or perhaps one was the account of them when they set out 
 from Babylon with Zerubbabel, the other when they came to Jerusalem.  
 The sum totals are all just the same there and here, except of the 
 singing-men and singing-women, which there are 200, here 245. These 
 were not of such importance as that they should keep any strict account 
 of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Here is an account of the offerings which were given towards the 
 work of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+7:70-72"><I>v.</I> 70</A>,

 &c. This differs much from that in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:68,69">Ezra ii. 68, 69</A>,

 and it may be questioned whether it refers to the same contribution; 
 here the tirshatha, or chief governor, who there was not mentioned, 
 begins the offering; and the single sum mentioned there exceeds all 
 those here put together; yet it is probable that it was the same, but 
 that followed one copy of the lists, this another; for the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+7:73,Ezr+2:70,3:1">last verse</A>

 is the same here that it was

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+7:73,Ezr+2:70,3:1">Ezra ii. 70, adding <I>ch.</I> iii. 1</A>.

 Blessed be God that our faith and hope are not built upon the niceties
 of names and numbers, genealogy and chronology, but on the great things 
 of the law and gospel. Whatever is given to the work of God, he is not 
 unrighteous to forget it; nor shall even a cup of cold water, wherewith 
 he is honoured, go without its reward.</P>
