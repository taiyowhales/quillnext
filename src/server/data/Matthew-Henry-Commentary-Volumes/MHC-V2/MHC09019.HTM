 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Immediately after David's marriage, which one would have hoped would 
 secure him Saul's affection, we find his troubles coming upon him 
 faster than ever and Saul's enmity to him the cause of all. His death 
 was vowed, and four fair escapes of his from the hurtful sword of Saul 
 we have an account of in this chapter: the first by the prudent 
 mediation of Jonathan 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>),

 the second by his own quickness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:8-10">ver. 8-10</A>),

 the third by Michal's fidelity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:11-17">ver. 11-17</A>),

 the fourth by Samuel's protection, and a change, for the present,
 wrought upon Saul,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:18-24">ver. 18-24</A>.

 Thus God has many ways of preserving his people. Providence is never at
 a loss.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants,
 that they should kill David.
 &nbsp; 2 But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan
 told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now
 therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning,
 and abide in a secret <I>place,</I> and hide thyself:
 &nbsp; 3 And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field
 where thou <I>art,</I> and I will commune with my father of thee; and
 what I see, that I will tell thee.
 &nbsp; 4 And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and
 said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against
 David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his
 works <I>have been</I> to thee-ward very good:
 &nbsp; 5 For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine,
 and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou
 sawest <I>it,</I> and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin
 against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?
 &nbsp; 6 And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul
 sware, <I>As</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> liveth, he shall not be slain.
 &nbsp; 7 And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those
 things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his
 presence, as in times past.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Saul and Jonathan appear here in their different characters, with 
 reference to David.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Never was enemy so unreasonably cruel as Saul. He spoke to his son 
 and all his servants <I>that they should kill David,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 His projects to take him off had failed, and therefore he proclaims him
 an out-law, and charges all about him, upon their allegiance, to take 
 the first opportunity to kill David. It is strange that he was not 
 ashamed thus to avow his malice when he could give no reason for it, 
 and that knowing all his servants loved David (for so he had said 
 himself,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:22"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 22</A>),

 he was not afraid of provoking them to rebel by this bloody order.
 Either malice was not then so politic, or justice was not so corrupted 
 as it has been since, or else Saul would have had him indicted, and 
 have suborned witnesses to swear treason against him, and so have had 
 him taken off, as Naboth was, by colour of law. But there is least 
 danger from this undisguised malice. It was strange that he who knew 
 how well Jonathan loved him should expect him to kill him; but he 
 thought that because he was heir to the crown he must needs be as 
 envious at David as himself was. And Providence ordered it thus that he 
 might befriend David's safety.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Never was friend so surprisingly kind as Jonathan. <I>A friend in 
 need is a friend indeed.</I> Such a one Jonathan was to David. He not 
 only continued to delight much in him, though David's glory eclipsed 
 his, but bravely appeared for him now that the stream ran so strongly 
 against him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He took care for his present security by letting him know his danger 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>Take heed to thyself,</I> and keep out of harm's way." Jonathan
 knew not but that some of the servants might be either so obsequious to 
 Saul or so envious at David as to put the orders in execution which 
 Saul had given, if they could light on David.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He took pains to pacify his father and reconcile him to David. The 
 next morning he ventured to commune with him concerning David 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 not that night, perhaps because he observed Saul to be drunk and not 
 fit to be spoken to, or because he hoped that, when he had slept upon 
 it, he would himself revoke the order, or because he could not have an 
 opportunity of speaking to him till morning.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) His intercession for David was very prudent. It was managed with a 
 great deal of the meekness of wisdom; and he showed himself faithful to 
 his friends by speaking good of him, though he was in danger of 
 incurring his father's displeasure by it--a rare instance of valuable
 friendship! He pleads, 

 [1.] The good services David had done to the public, and particularly
 to Saul: <I>His work has been to thee-ward very good,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Witness the relief he had given him against his distemper with his
 harp, and his bold encounter with Goliath, that memorable action, which 
 did, in effect, save Saul's life and kingdom.  He appeals to himself 
 concerning his: <I>Thou thyself sawest it, and didst rejoice.</I> In 
 that and other instances it appeared that David was a favourite of 
 heaven and a friend to Israel, as well as a good servant to Saul, for 
 by him <I>the Lord wrought a great salvation for all Israel;</I> so 
 that to order him to be slain was not only base ingratitude to so good 
 a servant, but a great affront to God and a great injury to the public.

 [2.] He pleads his innocency. Though he had formerly done many good
 offices, yet, if he had now been chargeable with any crimes, it would 
 have been another matter; but <I>he has not sinned against thee</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),
 
 his <I>blood is innocent</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),
 
 and, if he be slain, it is without cause. And Jonathan had therefore
 reason to protest against it because he could not entail any thing upon 
 his family more pernicious than the guilt of innocent blood.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) His intercession, being thus prudent, was prevalent. God inclined 
 the heart of Saul to hearken to the voice of Jonathan. Note, We must be 
 willing to hear reason, and to take all reproofs and good advice even 
 from our inferiors, parents from their own children. How forcible are 
 right words! Saul was, for the present, so far convinced of the 
 unreasonableness of his enmity to David that, 

 [1.] He recalled the bloody warrant for his execution

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>As the Lord liveth, he shall not be slain.</I> Whether Saul swore
 here with due solemnity or no does not appear; perhaps he did, and the 
 matter was of such moment as to deserve it and of such uncertainty as 
 to need it. But at other times Saul swore rashly and profanely, which 
 made the sincerity of this oath justly questionable; for it may be 
 feared that those who can so far jest with an oath as to make a by-word 
 of it, and prostitute it to a trifle, have not such a due sense of the 
 obligation of it but that, to serve a turn, they will prostitute it to 
 a lie. Some suspect that Saul said and swore this with a malicious 
 design to bring David within his reach again, intending to take the 
 first opportunity to slay him.  But, as bad as Saul was, we can 
 scarcely think so ill of him; and therefore we suppose that he spoke as 
 he thought for the present, but the convictions soon wore off and his 
 corruptions prevailed and triumphed over them. 

 [2.] He renewed the grant of his place at court.  Jonathan brought him
 to Saul, and <I>he was in his presence as in times past</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 hoping that now the storm was over, and that his friend Jonathan would
 be instrumental to keep his father always in this good mind.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with
 the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they
 fled from him.
 &nbsp; 9 And the evil spirit from the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was upon Saul, as he sat in
 his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with
 <I>his</I> hand.
 &nbsp; 10 And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the
 javelin; but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote
 the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that
 night.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here 

 I. David continues his good services to his king and country.  Though 
 Saul had requited him evil for good, and even his usefulness was the 
 very thing for which Saul envied him, yet he did not therefore retire 
 in sullenness and decline public service. Those that are ill paid for 
 doing good, yet must not be <I>weary of well doing,</I> remembering 
 what a bountiful benefactor our heavenly Father is, even to the froward 
 and unthankful. Notwithstanding the many affronts Saul had given to 
 David, yet we find him,

 1. As bold as ever in using his sword for the service of his country,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 The war broke out again with the Philistines, which gave David occasion
 again to signalize himself. It was a great deal of bravery that he 
 charged them; and he came off victorious, slaying many and putting the 
 rest to flight.

 2. As cheerful as ever in using his harp for the service of the prince.
 When Saul was disturbed with his former fits of melancholy <I>David 
 played with his hand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 He might have pleaded that this was a piece of service now below him;
 but a humble man will think nothing below him by which he may do good. 
 He might have objected the danger he was in the last time he performed 
 this service for Saul,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:10"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 10</A>.

 But he had learned to render good for evil, and to trust God with his
 safety in the way of his duty. See how David was affected when his 
 enemy was sick 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:13,14">Ps.  xxxv. 13, 14</A>),

 which perhaps refers to Saul's sickness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Saul continues his malice against David. He that but the other day 
 had sworn by his Maker that David <I>should not be slain</I> now 
 endeavors to slay him himself. So implacable, so incurable, is the 
 enmity of the serpent against that of the woman, so deceitful and 
 desperately wicked is the heart of man without the grace of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:9">Jer. xvii. 9</A>.

 The fresh honours David had won in this last war with the Philistines,
 instead of extinguishing Saul's ill-will to him, and confirming his 
 reconciliation, revived his envy and exasperated him yet more. And, 
 when he indulged this wicked passion, no marvel that <I>the evil spirit 
 came upon him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 for when we <I>let the sun go down upon our wrath we give place to the
 devil</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:26,27">Eph. iv. 26, 27</A>),

 we make room for him and invite him. Discomposures of mind, though
 helped forward by the agency of Satan, commonly owe their origin to 
 men's own sins and follies. Saul's fear and jealousy made him a torment 
 to himself, so that he could not sit in his house without a javelin in 
 his hand, pretending it was for his preservation, but designing it for 
 David's destruction; for he endeavored to nail him to the wall, running 
 at him so violently that he struck the <I>javelin into the wall</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 so strong was the devil in him, so strong his own rage and passion.
 Perhaps he thought that, if he killed David now, he would be excusable 
 before God and man, as being <I>non compos mentis</I>--<I>not in his 
 right mind,</I> and that it would be imputed to his distraction.  But 
 God cannot be deceived by pretences, whatever men may be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. God continues his care of David and still watches over him for 
 good. Saul missed his blow. David was too quick for him and fled, and 
 by a kind providence escaped that night. To these preservations, among 
 others, David often refers in his Psalms, when he speaks of God's being 
 his shield and buckler, his rock and fortress, and delivering his 
 <I>soul from death.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him,
 and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him,
 saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt
 be slain.
 &nbsp; 12 So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and
 fled, and escaped.
 &nbsp; 13 And Michal took an image, and laid <I>it</I> in the bed, and put
 a pillow of goats' <I>hair</I> for his bolster, and covered <I>it</I> with
 a cloth.
 &nbsp; 14 And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He
 <I>is</I> sick.
 &nbsp; 15 And Saul sent the messengers <I>again</I> to see David, saying,
 Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.
 &nbsp; 16 And when the messengers were come in, behold, <I>there was</I> an
 image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' <I>hair</I> for his bolster.
 &nbsp; 17 And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and
 sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered
 Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Saul's further design of mischief to David. When David had escaped 
 the javelin, supposing he went straight to his own house, as indeed he 
 did, Saul sent some of his guards after him to lay wait at the door of 
 his house, and to assassinate him in the morning as soon as he stirred 
 out,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Josephus says the design was to seize him and to hurry him before a
 court of justice that was ordered to condemn him and put him to death 
 as a traitor; but we are here told it was a shorter way they were to 
 take with him: they were ordered to <I>slay him.</I> Well might David 
 complain that his enemies were <I>bloody men,</I> as he did in the 
 psalm which he penned at this time, and upon this occasion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:1-17">Ps. lix.</A>),

 when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:2,3,7"><I>v.</I> 2, 3, and 7</A>.

 He complains that <I>swords were in their lips.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. David's wonderful deliverance out of this danger. Michal was the 
 instrument of it, whom Saul gave him to be a snare to him, but she 
 proved to be his protector and helper. Often is the devil out-shot with 
 his own bow. How Michal came to know the danger her husband was in does 
 not appear; perhaps she had notice sent her from court, or rather was 
 herself aware of the soldiers about the house, when they were going to 
 bed, though they kept so still and silent that they said, <I>Who dost 
 hear?</I> which David takes notice of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:7">Ps. lix. 7</A>.

 She, knowing her father's great indignation at David, soon suspected
 the design, and bestirred herself for her husband's safety.

 1. She got David out of the danger. She told him how imminent the peril
 was

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>To-morrow thou wilt be slain.</I> As Josephus paraphrases it, she
 told him that if the sun saw him there next morning it would never see 
 him more; and then put him in a way of escape. David himself was better 
 versed in the art of fighting than of flying, and had it been lawful it 
 would have been easy for him to have cleared his house, by dint of 
 sword, from those that haunted it; but <I>Michal let him down through a 
 window</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 all the doors being guarded; and so he <I>fled and escaped.</I> And now
 it was that, either in his own closet before he went or in the 
 hiding-place to which he fled, he penned that 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:1-17">fifty-ninth Psalm</A>,

 which shows that, in his fright and hurry, his mind was composed, and,
 in this great danger, his faith was strong and fixed on God; and, 
 whereas the plot was to slay him <I>in the morning,</I> he speaks there 
 with the greatest assurance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 <I>I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning.</I> 

 2. She practised a deception upon Saul and those whom he employed to be
 the instruments of his cruelty. When the doors of the house were opened 
 in the morning, and David did not appear, the messengers would search 
 the house for him, and did so. But Michal told them he was sick in bed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 and, if they would not believe her, they might see, for

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)

 she had put a wooden image in the bed, and wrapped it up close and warm
 as if it had been David asleep, not in a condition to be spoken to; the 
 goats' hair about the image was to resemble David's hair, the better to 
 impose upon them.  Michal can by no means be justified in telling a 
 lie, and covering it thus with a cheat. God's truth needed not her lie. 
 But she intended hereby to keep Saul in suspense for a while, that 
 David might have some time to secure himself, not doubting but those 
 messengers would pursue him if they found he had gone. The messengers 
 had so much humanity as not to offer him any disturbance when they 
 heard he was sick; for to those that are in this misery pity should be 
 shown; but Saul, when he heard it, gave positive orders that he should 
 be brought to him sick or well: <I>Bring him to me in the bed, that I 
 may slay him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 It was base and barbarous thus to triumph over a sick man; and to vow
 the death of one who for aught that he knew was dying by the hand of 
 nature. So earnestly did he thirst after his blood, and so greedy was 
 his revenge, that he could not be pleased to see him dead, unless he 
 himself was the death of him; though awhile ago he had said, <I>Let not 
 my hand be upon him.</I> Thus when men lay the reins on the neck of 
 their passions they grow more and more outrageous.  When the messengers 
 were sent again, the cheat was discovered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 But by this time it was to be hoped that David was safe, and therefore
 Michal was not then much concerned at the discovery. Saul chid her for 
 helping David to escape

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>Why hast thou deceived me so?</I> What a base spirit was Saul of, to
 expect that, because Michal was his daughter, she must therefore betray 
 her own husband to him unjustly. Ought she not to forsake and forget 
 her father and her father's house, to cleave to her husband? Those that 
 themselves will be held by no bonds of reason or religion are ready to 
 think that others should as easily break those bonds. In answer to 
 Saul's chiding, Michal is not so careful of her husband's reputation as 
 she had been of his person, when she makes this her excuse: <I>He said, 
 Let me go, why should I kill thee?</I> As her insinuating that she 
 would have hindered his flight was false (it was she that put him upon 
 it and furthered it), so it was an unjust unworthy reflection upon him 
 to suggest that he threatened to kill her if she would not let him go, 
 and might confirm Saul in his rage against him. David was far from 
 being so barbarous a man and so imperious a husband, so brutish in his 
 resolves and so haughty in his menaces, as she here represented him. 
 But David suffered both from friends and foes, and so did the son of 
 David.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and
 told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went
 and dwelt in Naioth.
 &nbsp; 19 And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David <I>is</I> at Naioth
 in Ramah.
 &nbsp; 20 And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw
 the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing <I>as</I>
 appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of
 Saul, and they also prophesied.
 &nbsp; 21 And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and
 they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the
 third time, and they prophesied also.
 &nbsp; 22 Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that
 <I>is</I> in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where <I>are</I> Samuel and
 David? And <I>one</I> said, Behold, <I>they be</I> at Naioth in Ramah.
 &nbsp; 23 And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of
 God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he
 came to Naioth in Ramah.
 &nbsp; 24 And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before
 Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all
 that night. Wherefore they say, <I>Is</I> Saul also among the
 prophets?

 Here is, 

 I. David's place of refuge. Having got away in the night from his own 
 house, he fled not to Bethlehem to his relations, nor to any of the 
 cities of Israel that had caressed and cried him up, to make an 
 interest in them for his own preservation; but he ran straight to 
 Samuel and <I>told him all that Saul had done to him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 1.  Because Samuel was the man that had given him assurance of the
 crown, and his faith in that assurance now beginning to fail, and he 
 being ready to say in his haste (or <I>in his flight,</I> as some read 
 it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:11">Ps. cxvi. 11</A>),

 <I>All men are liars</I> ("not only Saul that promised me my life, but
 Samuel himself that promised me the throne"), whither should he go but 
 to Samuel, for such encouragements, in this day of distress, as would 
 support his faith? In flying to Samuel he made God his refuge, trusting 
 in the <I>shadow of his wings;</I> where else can a good man think 
 himself safe? 

 2. Because Samuel, as a prophet, was best able to advise him what to do
 in this day of his distress. In the psalm he penned the night before he 
 had lifted up his prayer to God, and now he takes the first opportunity 
 of waiting upon Samuel to receive direction and instruction from God. 
 If we expect answers of peace to our prayers, we must have our ears 
 open to God's word. 

 3.  Because with Samuel there was a college of prophets with whom he
 might join in praising God, and the pleasure of this exercise would be 
 the greatest relief imaginable to him in his present distress. He met 
 with little rest or satisfaction in Saul's court, and therefore went to 
 seek it in Samuel's church. And, doubtless, what little pleasure is to 
 be had in this world those have it that live a life of communion with 
 God; to this David retired in the time of trouble, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:4-6">Ps. xxvii. 4-6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. David's protection in this place: <I>He and Samuel went and 
 dwelt</I> (or <I>lodged</I>) <I>in Naioth,</I> where the school of the 
 prophets was, in Ramah, as in a privileged place, for the Philistines 
 themselves would not disturb that meeting, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:10"><I>ch.</I> x. 10</A>.

 But Saul, having notice of it by some of his spies 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 sent officers to seize David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 When they did not bring him he sent more; when they returned not he
 sent the third time

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 and, hearing no tidings of these, he went himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:22"><I>v.</I>  22</A>.

 So impatient was he in his thirst after David's blood, so restless to
 compass his design against him, that, though baffled by one providence 
 after another, he could not perceive that David was under the special 
 protection of Heaven. It was below the king to go himself on such an 
 errand as this; but persecutors will stoop to any thing, and stick at 
 nothing, to gratify their malice. Saul lays aside all public business 
 to hunt David. How was David delivered, now that he was just ready to 
 fall (like his own lamb formerly) into the mouth of the lions? Not as 
 he delivered his lamb, by slaying the lion, or, as Elijah was 
 delivered, by consuming the messengers with <I>fire from heaven,</I> 
 but by turning the lions for the present into lambs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. When the messengers came into the congregation where David was among 
 the prophets <I>the Spirit of God</I> came upon them, and <I>they 
 prophesied,</I> that is, they joined with the rest in praising God. 
 Instead of seizing David, they themselves were seized. And thus, 

 (1.) God secured David; for either they were put into such an ecstasy
 by the spirit of prophecy that they could not think of any thing else,
 and so forgot their errand and never minded David, or they were by it
 put, for the present, into so good a frame that they could not
 entertain the thought of doing so bad a thing. 

 (2.) He put an honour upon the sons of the prophets and the communion
 of saints, and showed how he can, when he pleases, strike an awe upon 
 the worst of men, by the tokens of his presence in the assemblies of 
 the faithful, and force them to acknowledge that <I>God is with them of 
 a truth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:24,25">1 Cor. xiv. 24, 25</A>.
 
 See also the benefit of religious societies, and what good impressions
 may be made by them on minds that seemed unapt to receive such 
 impressions. And where may the influences of the Spirit be expected but 
 in the congregations of the saints? 

 (3.) He magnified his power over the spirits of men. He that made the
 heart and tongue can manage both to serve his own purposes.  Balaam 
 prophesied the happiness of Israel, whom he would have cursed; and some 
 of the Jewish writers think these messengers prophesied the advancement 
 of David to the throne of Israel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Saul himself was likewise seized with the spirit of prophecy before 
 he came to the place. One would have thought that so bad a man as he 
 was in no danger of being turned into a prophet; yet, when God will 
 take this way of protecting David, even Saul had no sooner come (as 
 bishop Hall expresses it) within smell of the smoke of Naioth but he 
 prophesies, as his messengers did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 He stripped off his royal robe and warlike habiliments, because they
 were either too fine or too heavy for this service, and fell into a 
 trance as it should seem, or into a rapture, which continued all that 
 day and night. The saints at Damascus were delivered from the range of 
 the New-Testament Saul by a change wrought on his spirit, but of 
 another nature from this. This was only amazing, but that 
 sanctifying--this for a day, that for ever. Note, Many have great gifts 
 and yet no grace, prophesy in Christ's name and yet are disowned by 
 him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:22,23">Matt. vii. 22, 23</A>.

 Now the proverb recurs, <I>Is Saul among the prophets?</I> See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:12"><I>ch.</I> x. 12</A>.

 Then it was different from what it had been, but now <I>contrary.</I>
 He is rejected of God, and actuated by an evil spirit, and yet among 
 the prophets.</P>
