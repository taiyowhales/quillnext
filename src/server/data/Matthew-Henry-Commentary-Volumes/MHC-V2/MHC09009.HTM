 Samuel had promised Israel, from God, that they should have a king; it
 is strange that the next news is not of candidates setting up for the
 government, making an interest in the people, or recommending
 themselves to Samuel, and, by him, to God, to be put in nomination. Why
 does not the prince of the tribe of Judah, whoever he is, look about 
 him now, remembering Jacob's entail of the sceptre on that tribe? Is 
 there never a bold aspiring man in Israel, to say, "I will be king, if 
 God will choose me?" No, none appears, whether it is owing to a 
 culpable mean-spiritedness or a laudable humility I know not; but 
 surely it is what can scarcely be paralleled in the history of any 
 kingdom; a crown, such a crown, set up, and nobody bids for it. Most 
 governments began in the ambition of the prince to rule, but Israel's 
 in the ambition of the people to be ruled. Had any of those elders who 
 petitioned for a king afterwards petitioned to be king, I should have 
 suspected that person's ambition to have been at the bottom of the 
 motion; but now (let them have the praise of what was good in them) it 
 was not so. God having, in the law, undertaken to choose their king 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:15">Deut. xvii. 15</A>),

 they all sit still, till they hear from heaven, and that they do in
 this chapter, which begins the story of Saul, their first king, and, by 
 strange steps of Providence, brings him to Samuel to be anointed 
 privately, and so to be prepared for an election by lot, and a public 
 commendation to the people, which follows in the next chapter.  Here 
 is, 
 
 I. A short account of Saul's parentage and person, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. A large and particular account of the bringing of him to Samuel, to
 whom he had been before altogether a stranger. 

 1. God, by revelation, had told Samuel to expect him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:15,16">ver. 15, 16</A>.

 2.  God, by providence, led him to Samuel. 

 (1.) Being sent to seek his father's asses, he was at a loss,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>.

 (2.) By the advice of his servant, he determined to consult Samuel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:6-10">ver. 6-10</A>.

 (3.) By the direction of the young maidens, he found him out,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:11-14">ver. 11-14</A>.

 (4.) Samuel, being informed of God concerning him
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:17">ver. 17</A>),

 treated him with respect in the gate 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:18-21">ver. 18-21</A>), 
 
 in the dining-room 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:22">ver. 22-24</A>), 

 and at length in private, where he prepared him to hear the surprising
 news that he must be king, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:25-27">ver. 25-27</A>.

 And these beginnings would have been very hopeful and promising if it
 had not been that the sin of the people was the spring of this great 
 affair.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name <I>was</I> Kish, the
 son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of
 Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.
 &nbsp; 2 And he had a son, whose name <I>was</I> Saul, a choice young man,
 and a goodly: and <I>there was</I> not among the children of Israel a
 goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward <I>he was</I>
 higher than any of the people.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here told, 
 
 1. What a good family Saul was of,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 He was of the tribe of Benjamin; so was the New-Testament Saul, who
 also was called <I>Paul,</I> and he mentions it as his honour, for 
 Benjamin was a favourite, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:1,Php+3:5">Rom. xi. 1; Phil. iii. 5</A>.

 That tribe had been reduced to a very small number by the fatal war
 with Gibeah, and much ado there was to provide wives for those 600 men 
 that were the poor remains of it out of that diminished tribe, which is 
 here called, with good reason, <I>the smallest of the tribes of 
 Israel,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Saul sprang as a root out of a dry ground. That tribe, though fewest in
 number, was first in dignity, <I>God giving more abundant honour to 
 that part which lacked,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:24">1 Cor. xii. 24</A>.

 His father was <I>Kish, a mighty man of power,</I> or, as the margin
 reads it, <I>in substance;</I> in spirit bold, in body strong, in 
 estate wealthy. The whole lot of the tribe of Benjamin coming to be 
 distributed among 600 men, we may suppose their inheritances were much 
 larger than theirs who were of other tribes, an advantage which 
 somewhat helped to balance the disadvantage of the smallness of their 
 number. 

 2. What a good figure Saul made, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 No mention is here made of his wisdom or virtue, his learning or piety,
 or any of the accomplishments of his mind, but that he was a tall, 
 proper, handsome man, that had a good face, a good shape, and a good 
 presence, graceful and well proportioned: <I>Among all the children of 
 Israel there was not a goodlier person than he;</I> and, as if nature
 had marked him for pre-eminence and superiority, he was taller by the 
 head and shoulders than any of the people, the fitter to be a match for 
 the giants of Gath, the champions of the Philistines. When God chose a 
 king after his own heart he pitched upon one that was not at all 
 remarkable for the height of his stature, nor any thing in his 
 countenance but the innocence and sweetness that appeared there,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+16:7,12"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 7, 12</A>.

 But when he chose a king after the people's heart, who aimed at nothing
 so much as stateliness and grandeur, he pitched upon this huge tall 
 man, who, if he had no other good qualities, yet would look great. It 
 does not appear that he excelled in strength so much as he did in 
 stature; Samson did, and him they slighted, bound, and betrayed into 
 the hands of the Philistines; justly therefore are they now put off 
 with one who, though of uncommon height, is weak as other men. They 
 would have a king like the nations, and the nations commonly chose 
 portly men for their kings.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said
 to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and
 arise, go seek the asses.
 &nbsp; 4 And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the
 land of Shalisha, but they found <I>them</I> not: then they passed
 through the land of Shalim, and <I>there they were</I> not: and he
 passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found <I>them</I>
 not.
 &nbsp; 5 <I>And</I> when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to
 his servant that <I>was</I> with him, Come, and let us return; lest my
 father leave <I>caring</I> for the asses, and take thought for us.
 &nbsp; 6 And he said unto him, Behold now, <I>there is</I> in this city a
 man of God, and <I>he is</I> a honourable man; all that he saith
 cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can
 shew us our way that we should go.
 &nbsp; 7 Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, <I>if</I> we go, what
 shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels,
 and <I>there is</I> not a present to bring to the man of God: what
 have we?
 &nbsp; 8 And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have
 here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: <I>that</I> will I
 give to the man of God, to tell us our way.
 &nbsp; 9 (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God,
 thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for <I>he that is</I>
 now <I>called</I> a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)
 &nbsp; 10 Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go.
 So they went unto the city where the man of God <I>was.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A great man rising from small beginnings. It does not appear that
 Saul had any preferment at all, or was in any post of honour or trust, 
 till he was chosen king of Israel. Most that are advanced rise 
 gradually, but Saul, from the level with his neighbours, stepped at 
 once into the throne, according to that of Hannah, He <I>raiseth up the 
 poor out of the dust, to set them among princes,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:8">1 Sam. ii. 8</A>.

 Saul, it should seem, though he was himself married and had children
 grown up, yet lived in his father's house, and was subject to him. 
 Promotion comes not by chance nor human probabilities, but God is the 
 Judge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A great event arising from small occurrences. How low does the 
 history begin! Having to trace Saul to the crown, we find him first 
 employed as meanly as any we meet with called out to preferment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Saul's father sends him with one of his servants to seek some asses 
 that he had lost. It may be they had no way then to give public notice 
 of such a number of asses strayed or stolen out of the grounds of Kish 
 the Benjamite. A very good law they had to oblige men to bring back an 
 ox or an ass that went astray, but it is to be feared that was, as 
 other good laws, neglected and forgotten. It is easy to observe here 
 that those who have must expect to lose, that it is wisdom to look 
 after what is lost, that no man should think it below him to know the 
 state of his flocks, that children should be forward to serve their 
 parents' interests. Saul readily went to <I>seek his father's 
 asses,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 His taking care of the asses is to be ascribed, not so much to the
 humility of his spirit as to the plainness and simplicity of those 
 times. But his obedience to his father in it was very commendable. 
 <I>Seest thou a man diligent in his business,</I> and dutiful to his 
 superiors, willing to stoop and willing to take pains?  he does as Saul 
 stand fair for preferment. The servant of Kish would be faithful only 
 as a servant, but Saul as a son, in his own business, and therefore he 
 was sent with him. Saul and his servants travelled far (probably on 
 foot) in quest of the asses, but in vain: they found them not. He 
 missed of what he sought, but had no reason to complain of the 
 disappointment, for he met with the kingdom, which he never dreamed 
 of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. When he could not find them, he determined to return to his father 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 in consideration of his father's tender concern for him, being
 apprehensive that if they staid out any longer his aged father would 
 begin to fear, as Jacob concerning Joseph, that an evil beast had 
 devoured them or some mischief had befallen them; he will <I>leave 
 caring for the asses,</I> as much as he was in care about them, and 
 <I>will take thought for us.</I> Children should take care that they do 
 nothing to grieve or frighten their parents, but be tender of their 
 tenderness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. His servant proposed (for, it should seem, he had more religion in 
 him than his master) that, since they were now at Ramah, they should 
 call on Samuel, and take his advice in this important affair. Observe 
 here, 

 (1.) They were close by the city where Samuel lived, and that put it
 into their heads to consult him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>There is in this city a man of God.</I> Note, Wherever we are we
 should improve our opportunities of acquainting ourselves with those 
 that are wise and good. But there are many that will consult a man of 
 God, if he comes in their way, that would not go a step out of their 
 way to get wisdom.

 (2.) The servant spoke very respectfully concerning Samuel, though he
 had not personal knowledge of him, but by common fame only: <I>He is a 
 man of God, and an honourable man.</I> Note, Men of God are honourable 
 men, and should be so in our eyes. Acquaintance with the things of God, 
 and serviceableness to the kingdom of God, put true honour upon men, 
 and make them great. This was the honour of Samuel, as a man of God, 
 that <I>all he saith comes surely to pass.</I> This was observed 
 concerning him when he was a young prophet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:19"><I>ch.</I> iii. 19</A>),

 <I>God did let none of his words fall to the ground;</I> and still it
 held true. 

 (3.) They agreed to consult him concerning <I>the way that they should
 go; peradventure he can show us.</I> All the use they would make of the 
 man of God was to be advised by him whether they should return home, 
 or, if there were any hopes of finding the asses, which way they must 
 go next--a poor business to employ a prophet about! Had they said, "Let 
 us give up the asses for lost, and, now that we are so near the man of 
 God, let us go and learn from him the good knowledge of God, let us 
 consult him how we may order our conversations a right, and enquire the 
 law at his mouth, since we may not have such another opportunity, and 
 then we shall not lose our journey"--the proposal would have been such
 as became Israelites; but to make prophecy, that glory of Israel, serve 
 so mean a turn as this, discovered too much what manner of spirit they 
 were of. Note, Most people would rather be told their fortune than told 
 their duty, how to be rich than how to be saved. If it were the 
 business of the men of God to direct for the recovery of lost asses, 
 they would be consulted much more than they are now that it is their 
 business to direct for the recovery of lost souls; so preposterous is 
 the care of most men!

 (4.) Saul was thoughtful what present they should bring to the man of
 God, what fee they should give him for his advice

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>What shall we bring the man?</I> They could not present him, as
 Jeroboam's wife did Ahijah, with loaves and cakes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:3">1 Kings xiv. 3</A>),

 for their bread was spent; but the servant bethought himself that he
 had in his pocket the fourth part of a shekel, about seven-pence 
 halfpenny in value, and <I>that</I> he would give to the man of God to 
 direct them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 "That will do," says Saul; "<I>let us go,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Some think that when Saul talked of giving Samuel a fee he measured him
 by himself, or by his sons, as if he must be hired to do an honest 
 Israelite a kindness, and was like the false prophets, that <I>divined 
 for money,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+3:11">Mic. iii. 11</A>.

 He came to him as a fortune-teller, rather than as a prophet, and
 therefore thought the fourth part of a shekel was enough to give him. 
 But it rather seems to be agreeable to the general usage of those 
 times, as it is to natural equity, that those who sowed spiritual 
 things should reap not only eternal things from him that employs them, 
 but temporal things from those for whom they are employed. Samuel 
 needed not their money, nor would he have denied them his advice if 
 they had not brought it (it is probable, when he had it, he gave it to 
 the poor); but they brought it to him as a token of their respect and 
 the value they put upon his office; nor did he refuse it, for they were 
 able to give it, and, though it was but little, it was the widow's 
 mite. But Saul, as he never thought of going to the man of God till the 
 servant proposed it, so, it should seem, he mentioned the want of a 
 present as an objection against their going; he would not own that he 
 had money in his pocket, but, when the servant generously offered to be 
 at the charge, then, "Well, said," says Saul; "come, let us go." Most 
 people love a cheap religion, and like it best when they can devolve 
 the expense of it on others.

 (5.) The historian here takes notice of the name then given to the
 prophets: they called them <I>Seers,</I> or <I>seeing men</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 not but that the name <I>prophet</I> was then used, and applied to such
 persons, but that of seers was more in use. Note, Those that are 
 prophets must first be seers; those who undertake to speak to others of 
 the things of God must have an insight into those things 
 themselves.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  <I>And</I> as they went up the hill to the city, they found young
 maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer
 here?
 &nbsp; 12 And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, <I>he is</I>
 before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for
 <I>there is</I> a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:
 &nbsp; 13 As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway

 people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the
 sacrifice; <I>and</I> afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now
 therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him.

 into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up
 to the high place.

 came, saying,

 land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him <I>to be</I> captain over
 my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of
 the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their
 cry is come unto me.
 &nbsp; 17 And when Samuel saw Saul, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto him, Behold the
 man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my
 people.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 
 
 I. Saul, by an ordinary enquiry, is directed to Samuel,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:11-14"><I>v.</I> 11-14</A>.
 
 Gibeah of Saul was not twenty miles from Ramah where Samuel dwelt, and
 was near to Mizpeh where he often judged Israel, and yet, it seems, 
 Saul had lived so very privately, and had taken so little notice of 
 public affairs, that he had never seen Samuel, for when he met him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>)

 he did not know him, so that there was no cause to suspect any secret
 compact or collusion between them in this matter. <I>I knew him 
 not,</I> says John Baptist concerning Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:31">John i. 31</A>.

 Yet I do not think it any commendation to Saul that he was a stranger
 to Samuel.  However,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The maid-servants of Ramah, whom they met with at the places of 
 drawing water, could give him and his servant intelligence concerning 
 Samuel; and very particular they were in their directions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.
 
 We should always be ready to give what assistance we can to those that
 are enquiring after God's prophets, and to further them in their 
 enquiries. Even the maid-servants could tell them, 

 (1.) That there was a sacrifice that day in the high place, it being
 either an ordinary festival or an extraordinary day of prayer and 
 thanksgiving, with which sacrifices were joined. The tabernacle being 
 deprived of the ark, the altar there had not now the reputation it 
 formerly had, nor were they confined to it, as they would be when God 
 had again chosen a place to put his name in; and therefore now other 
 places were allowed. Samuel had built an altar at Ramah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:17"><I>ch.</I> vii. 17</A>),

 and here we have him making use of that altar. 

 (2.) That Samuel came that day to the city, either from his circuit or
 from his country seat.  He was such a public person that his movements 
 were generally known.

 (3.) That this was just the time of their meeting to feast before the
 Lord upon the sacrifice: "About this time you will find him in the 
 street going up to the high place." They knew the hour of the solemn 
 feast. 

 (4.) That the people would not eat till Samuel came, not only because
 he was the worthiest person, and they ought in good manners to stay for 
 him, and he was, as some think, the maker of this feast, the sacrifice 
 being offered at his charge and upon his account; but because, as a man 
 of God, whoever made the feast, <I>he</I> must bless the sacrifice, 
 that is, those parts of the sacrifice which they feasted upon, which 
 may be considered, 

 [1.] As a common meal, and so this is an instance of the great duty of
 craving a blessing upon our meat before we partake of it. We cannot 
 expect benefit from our food without that blessing, and we have no 
 reason to expect that blessing if we do not pray for it.  Thus we must 
 give glory to God as our benefactor, and own our dependence upon him 
 and our obligations to him. Or, 

 [2.] As a religious assembly. When the sacrifice was offered, which was
 the ceremony, Samuel blessed it, that is, he prayed over it, and 
 offered up spiritual sacrifices with it, which were the substance; and 
 afterwards, when the holy duties were performed, they did eat. Let the 
 soul first be served.  The feast upon the sacrifice being a sacred 
 rite, it was requisite that it should in a particular manner be 
 blessed, as is the Christian eucharist. They feasted in token of their 
 reconciliation to God by virtue of the sacrifice, and their 
 participation of the benefits of it; and Samuel blessed the feast, that 
 is, he prayed to God to grace the solemnity with his special presence, 
 that it might answer those great ends.  Bishop Hall observes what a 
 particular account those maid-servants could give of the usages of 
 those sacred feasts, and infers from it that, "where there is the 
 practice and example of piety in the better sort, there will be a 
 reflection of it upon the meanest.  It is no small advantage to live in 
 religious places; for we shall be much to blame if all goodness fall 
 beside us."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Saul and his servant followed the directions given them, and very 
 opportunely met Samuel going to the high place, the synagogue of the 
 city, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 This seemed purely accidental, but the divine providence ordered it for
 the forwarding of this great event. The wise God serves very great and 
 certain purposes by very small and casual occurrences. A sparrow falls 
 not to the ground without our Father.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Samuel, by an extraordinary revelation, is informed concerning 
 Saul. He was a seer, and therefore must see this in a way peculiar to 
 himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God had told him, the day before, that he would, at this time, send 
 him the man that should serve the people of Israel for such a king as 
 they wished to have, <I>like all the nations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 He <I>told him in his ear,</I> that is, privately, by a secret whisper
 to his mind, or perhaps by a still small voice, some soft and gentle 
 sounds conveyed to his ear, probably when he was praying in secret for 
 direction in that and other affairs of the nation. He had spoken <I>in 
 the ears of the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:21"><I>ch.</I> viii. 21</A>),

 and now God <I>spoke in his ear,</I> in token of friendship and
 familiarity, for <I>he revealeth his secret to his servants the 
 prophets,</I> as secrets in their ear, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:7">Amos iii. 7</A>.

 God told him before, that it might not be a surprise to him; and
 perhaps it was in expectation of it that he appointed the feast and the 
 sacrifice, for the imploring of God's blessing upon this great and 
 important affair, though he might keep the particular occasion in his 
 own breast, God having only told it to him in his ear. The Hebrew 
 phrase is, <I>He uncovered the ear of Samuel,</I> to which some allude 
 for the explication of the way of God's revealing himself to us; he not 
 only speaks, but <I>uncovers our ear.</I> We have naturally a covering 
 on our ears, so that we perceive not what God says

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:14">Job xxxiii. 14</A>),

 but, when God will manifest himself to a soul, he uncovers the ear,
 says, <I>Ephphratha, Be opened;</I> he takes <I>the veil from off the 
 heart,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:16">2 Cor. iii. 16</A>.

 Though God had, in displeasure, granted their request for a king, yet
 here he speaks tenderly of Israel; for even in <I>wrath he remembers 
 mercy.</I> 

 (1.) He calls them again and again his people; though a peevish and
 provoking people, yet mine still.

 (2.) He sends them a man to be captain over them, that they might not
 be a body without a head, and to <I>save them out of the hand of the 
 Philistines,</I> which perhaps was more than many of them aimed at in 
 desiring a king.

 (3.) He does it with a gracious respect to them and to their cry: <I>I
 have looked upon my people,</I> and <I>their cry has come unto me.</I> 
 He gratified them with what they cried for, as the tender mother 
 humours the froward child, lest it should break its heart. And (as 
 bishop Patrick observes), though he would not hear their cry to relieve 
 them against the oppression of their kings

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:18"><I>ch.</I> viii. 18</A>),
 
 yet he was so gracious as to make those kings instruments of their
 deliverance from the oppression of their neighbours, which was more 
 than they had reason to expect.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. When Saul came up towards him in the street God again whispered
 Samuel in the ear 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>Behold the man whom I spoke to thee of!</I> Saul being a man of
 unusual stature, it is natural to think that Samuel fixed his eye upon 
 him at a distance, and perhaps looked the more wistfully towards him 
 because the hour had now come when God would send him the man that 
 should be king of Israel, and he fancied this might be he; but, that he 
 might be fully satisfied, God told him expressly, <I>That is the 
 man</I> that shall <I>restrain</I> (for magistrates are heirs of 
 restraint) <I>my people Israel.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell
 me, I pray thee, where the seer's house <I>is.</I>
 &nbsp; 19 And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I <I>am</I> the seer: go up
 before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day,
 and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that
 <I>is</I> in thine heart.
 &nbsp; 20 And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set
 not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom <I>is</I> all
 the desire of Israel? <I>Is it</I> not on thee, and on all thy
 father's house?
 &nbsp; 21 And Saul answered and said, <I>Am</I> not I a Benjamite, of the
 smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all
 the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest
 thou so to me?
 &nbsp; 22 And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into
 the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them
 that were bidden, which <I>were</I> about thirty persons.
 &nbsp; 23 And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I
 gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.
 &nbsp; 24 And the cook took up the shoulder, and <I>that</I> which <I>was</I>
 upon it, and set <I>it</I> before Saul. And <I>Samuel</I> said, Behold that
 which is left! set <I>it</I> before thee, <I>and</I> eat: for unto this
 time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the
 people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.
 &nbsp; 25 And when they were come down from the high place into the
 city, <I>Samuel</I> communed with Saul upon the top of the house.
 &nbsp; 26 And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring
 of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house,
 saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they
 went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.
 &nbsp; 27 <I>And</I> as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel
 said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed
 on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word
 of God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Providence having at length brought Samuel and Saul together, we have 
 here an account of what passed between them in the gate, at the feast, 
 and in private.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. In the gate of the city; passing through that, Saul found him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 and, little thinking that he was Samuel himself, asked him the way to
 Samuel's house: <I>Tell me where the seer's house is;</I> for there he 
 expected to find him. See how mean a figure Samuel made, though so 
 great a man: he took not any state, had no attendants, no ensigns of 
 honour carried before him, nor any distinguishing habit, no, not when 
 he went to church, but appeared, in all respects, so much a common 
 person that Saul, though he was told he should meet him, never 
 suspected that it was he, but, as if he looked more like a porter than 
 a prophet, asked him the way to the seer's house. Thus is great worth 
 oftentimes hidden under a very despicable appearance. Samuel knew that 
 it was not the house, but the man, that he wanted, and therefore 
 answered him, "<I>I am the seer,</I> the person you enquire for," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Samuel knew him before he knew Samuel; thus, though all that are called
 to the kingdom of glory are brought to know God, yet first they were 
 known of him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:9">Gal. iv. 9</A>.
 
 Now,

 1. Samuel obliges him to stay with him till the next day. The greatest
 part of this day had been spent in sacrificing, and the rest of it was 
 to be spent in holy feasting, and therefore, "<I>To-morrow I will let 
 thee go,</I> and not sooner; now <I>go up before me to the high 
 place;</I> let us pray together, and then we will talk together." Saul 
 had nothing in his mind but to find his asses, but Samuel would take 
 him off from that care, and dispose him to the exercises of piety; and 
 therefore bids him <I>go to the high place,</I> and go before him, 
 because, it may be, some business obliged Samuel to call by the way. 

 2.  He satisfies him about his asses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):
 
 <I>Set not thy mind on them,</I> be not in further care about them;
 <I>they are found.</I> By this Saul might perceive that he was a 
 prophet, that he could give him an answer to the enquiry which he had 
 not yet made, and tell him what he thought; and thence he might infer, 
 if a man of God can do this, much more doth God himself <I>understand 
 our thoughts afar off.</I> 

 3. He surprises him with an intimation of preferment before him: "<I>On
 whom is all the desire of Israel?</I> Is it not a king that they are 
 set upon, and there is never a man in Israel that will suit them as 
 thou wilt." It does not appear that the country had as yet any eye upon 
 him for the government, because they had left it wholly to God to 
 choose for them; but such a one as he they wished for, and his 
 advancement would be the advancement of his family and relations, as 
 Abner, and others. 

 4. To this strange intimation Saul returns a very modest answer,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Samuel, he thought, did but banter him, because he was a tall man, but
 a very unlikely man to be a king; for, though the historian says

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)

 his father was a <I>mighty man of power,</I> yet he himself speaks
 diminishingly of his tribe and family.  "Benjamin, the youngest of 
 Jacob's sons, when grown up to be a man, was called a <I>little one</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+44:20">Gen. xliv. 20</A>);

 that tribe was diminished by the war of Gibeah; and <I>I am a
 Benjamite, my family the least,</I>" probably a younger house, not in 
 any place of honour or trust, no, not in their own tribe. Gideon had 
 expressed himself thus,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:15">Judg. vi. 15</A>.

 A humble disposition is a good presage of preferment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. At the public feast; thither Samuel took him and his servant. 
 Though the advancement of Saul would be the deposing of Samuel, yet 
 that good prophet was so far from envying him, or bearing him any 
 ill-will for it, that he was the first and forwardest man to do him 
 honour, in compliance with the will of God. If this be the man whom God 
 has chosen, though he be none of Samuel's particular friends or 
 confidants, yet he is heartily welcome to his table, nay, to his bosom. 
 We may suppose it was no unseasonable kindness to Saul to give him a 
 meal's meat, for it seems, by what he said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 that all their meat and money were spent. But this was not all. Samuel
 treats him not as a common person, but a person of quality and 
 distinction, to prepare both him and the people for what was to follow. 
 Two marks of honour he put upon him:--

 1. He set him <I>in the best place,</I> as more honourable than any
 other of the guests, to whom he said, <I>Give this man place,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:9">Luke xiv. 9</A>.

 Though we may suppose the magistrates were there, who in their own city
 would claim precedency, yet the master of the feast made Saul and his 
 servant too (who, if Saul was a king, must be respected as his prime 
 minister of state) <I>sit in the chief place,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Note, Civil respects must be paid to those who in civil things have the
 precedency given them by the divine providence.  

 2. He presented him with the <I>best dish,</I> which, having had notice
 from heaven the day before of his coming

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 he had designed for him, and ordered the cook to secure for him, when
 he gave orders for inviting the guests and making preparation for them. 
 And what should this precious dish be, which was so very carefully 
 reserved for the king-elect? One would expect it should be something 
 very nice and delicate. No, it was a plain shoulder of mutton

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>).

 The right shoulder of the peace-offerings was to be given to the
 priests, who were God's receivers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:32">Lev. vii. 32</A>);

 the next in honour to that was the left shoulder, which probably was
 always allotted to those that sat at the upper end of the table, and 
 was wont to be Samuel's mess at other times; so that his giving it to 
 Saul now was an implicit resignation of his place to him. Some observe 
 a significancy in this dish. The shoulder denotes strength, and the 
 breast, which some think went with it, denotes affection: he that was 
 king had <I>the government upon his shoulder,</I> for he must bear the 
 weight of it; and the people in his bosom, for they must be dear to 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What passed between them in private. Both that evening and early 
 the next morning Samuel communed with Saul upon the flat roof of the 
 house, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>.

 We may suppose Samuel now told him the whole story of the people's
 desire of a king, the grounds of their desire, and God's grant of it, 
 to all which Saul, living very privately, was perhaps a stranger; he 
 satisfied him that he was the person God had pitched upon for the 
 government; and whereas Saul would object that Samuel was in 
 possession, and he would not for all the world take it out of his 
 hands, Samuel, we may suppose, gave him all the assurance he could 
 desire of his willingness to resign. Early in the morning he sent him 
 towards home, brought him part of the way, bade him send his servant 
 before, that they might be private

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 and there, as we find in the beginning of the next chapter, he anointed
 him, and therein showed him the <I>word of the Lord,</I> that is, gave 
 him full satisfaction that he was the person chosen to be king, for he 
 would not jest with that sacred rite. It is by the <I>unction of the 
 Holy Ghost</I> that Christ, the great prophet, <I>shows us the word of 
 the Lord.</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:27">1 John ii. 27</A>,
 
 <I>the same anointing teacheth you of all things.</I></P>
