 The obscurity of the ark, during the reign of Saul, had been as great a
 grievance to Israel as the insults of the Philistines. David, having
 humbled the Philistines and mortified them in gratitude for that
 favour, and in pursuance of his designs for the public welfare, is here
 bringing up the ark to his own city, that it might be near him, and be
 an ornament and strength to his new foundation. Here is, 

 I. An attempt to do it, which failed and miscarried. The design was
 well laid,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.
 
 But, 

 1. They were guilty of an error in carrying it in a cart, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>.

 2.  They were punished for that error by the sudden death of Uzzah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>),

 which was a great terror to David 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:8,9">ver. 8, 9</A>)

 and put a stop to his proceedings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:10,11">ver. 10, 11</A>.

 II. The great joy and satisfaction with which it was at last done, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:12-15">ver. 12-15</A>.
 
 And, 

 1. The good understanding between David and his people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:17-19">ver. 17-19</A>.

 2.  The uneasiness between David and his wife upon that occasion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:16,20-23">ver. 16, 20-23</A>.

 And, when we consider that the ark was both the token of God's presence
 and a type of Christ, we shall see that this story is very 
 instructive.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Again, David gathered together all <I>the</I> chosen <I>men</I> of
 Israel, thirty thousand.
 &nbsp; 2 And David arose, and went with all the people that <I>were</I>
 with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of
 God, whose name is called by the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts that
 dwelleth <I>between</I> the cherubims.
 &nbsp; 3 And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it
 out of the house of Abinadab that <I>was</I> in Gibeah: and Uzzah and
 Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.
 &nbsp; 4 And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which <I>was</I>
 at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the
 ark.
 &nbsp; 5 And David and all the house of Israel played before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 on all manner of <I>instruments made of</I> fir wood, even on harps,
 and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on
 cymbals.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have not heard a word of the ark since it was lodged in 
 Kirjath-jearim, immediately after its return out of its captivity among 
 the Philistines 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:1,2">1 Sam. vii. 1, 2</A>),
 
 except that, once, Saul called for it,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:18">1 Sam. xiv. 18</A>.

 That which in former days had made so great a figure is now thrown
 aside, as a neglected thing, for many years. And, if now the ark was 
 for so many years in a house, let it not seem strange that we find the 
 church so long in the wilderness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:14">Rev. xii. 14</A>.

 Perpetual visibility is no mark of the true church. God is graciously
 present with the souls of his people even when they want the external 
 tokens of his presence. But now that David is settled in the throne the 
 honour of the ark begins to revive, and <I>Israel's care of it to 
 flourish again, wherein also,</I> no doubt, the good people among them 
 <I>had been careful, but they lacked opportunity.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:10">Phil. iv. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is honourable mention made of the ark. Because it had not been 
 spoken of a great while, now that it is spoken of observe how it is 
 described 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 it is <I>the ark of God whose name is called by the name of the Lord of
 hosts that dwelleth between the cherubim,</I> or <I>at which the name, 
 even the name of the Lord of hosts, was called upon,</I> or <I>upon 
 which the name of the Lord of hosts was called,</I> or <I>because of 
 which the name is proclaimed, the name of the Lord of hosts</I> (that 
 is, God was greatly magnified in the miracles done before the ark), or 
 <I>the ark of God, who is called the name</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+24:11,16">Lev. xxiv. 11, 16</A>),

 <I>the name of the Lord of hosts, sitting on the cherubim upon it.</I>
 Let us learn hence, 

 1. To think and speak highly of God. He is the name above every name,
 <I>the Lord of hosts,</I> that has all the creatures in heaven and 
 earth at his command, and receives homage from them all, and yet is 
 pleased to dwell between the cherubim, over the propitiatory or 
 mercy-seat, graciously manifesting himself to his people, reconciled in 
 a Mediator, and ready to do them good. 

 2. To think and speak honourably of holy ordinances, which are to us,
 as the ark was to Israel, the tokens of God's presence

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:2">Matt. xxviii. 2</A>),

 and the means of our communion with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:4">Ps. xxvii. 4</A>.

 It is the honour of the ark that it is the ark of God; he is jealous
 for it, is magnified in it, his name is called upon it. The divine 
 institution puts a beauty and grandeur upon holy ordinances, which 
 otherwise have no form nor comeliness. Christ is our ark. In and by him 
 God manifests his favour and communicates his grace to us, and accepts 
 our adoration and addresses.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is an honourable attendance given to the ark upon the removal 
 of it. Now, at length, it is enquired after, David made the motion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+13:1-3">1 Chron. xiii. 1-3</A>),

 and the heads of the congregation agreed to it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 All the chosen men of Israel are called together to grace the
 solemnity, to pay their respect to the ark, and to testify their joy in 
 its restoration. The nobility and gentry, elders and officers, came to 
 the number of 30,000

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),
 
 and the generality of the common people besides

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+13:5">1 Chron. xiii. 5</A>);

 for, some think, it was done at one of the three great festivals. This
 would make a noble cavalcade, and would help to inspire the young 
 people of the nation, who perhaps had scarcely heard of the ark, with a 
 great veneration for it, for this was certainly a treasure of 
 inestimable value which the king himself and all the great men waited 
 upon, and were a guard to.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here are great expressions of joy upon the removal of the ark, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 David himself, and all that were with him that were musically inclined,
 made use of such instruments as they had to excite and express their 
 rejoicing upon this occasion. It might well put them into a transport 
 of joy to see the ark rise out of obscurity and move towards a public 
 station. It is better to have the ark in a house than not at all, 
 better in a house than a captive in Dagon's temple; but it is very 
 desirable to have it in a tent pitched on purpose for it, where the 
 resort to it may be more free and open. As secret worship is better the 
 more secret it is, so public worship is better the more public it is; 
 and we have reason to rejoice when restraints are taken off, and the 
 ark of God finds welcome in the city of David, and has not only the 
 protection and support, but the countenance and encouragement, of the 
 civil powers; for joy of this they <I>played before the Lord.</I> Note, 
 Public joy must always be as <I>before the Lord,</I> with an eye to him 
 and terminating in him, and must not degenerate into that which is 
 carnal and sensual. Dr. Lightfoot supposes that, upon this occasion, 
 David penned the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:1-35">68th Psalm</A>,

 because it begins with that ancient prayer of Moses at the removing of
 the ark, <I>Let God arise, and let his enemies be scattered;</I> and 
 notice is taken there 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>)

 of the <I>singers and players on instruments</I> that attended, and

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>)

 of the princes of several of the tribes; and perhaps those words in the
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:35">last verse</A>,

 <I>O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places,</I> were added upon
 occasion of the death of Uzzah.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Here is an error that they were guilty of in this matter, that they
 carried the ark in a cart or carriage, whereas the priests should have 
 carried it upon their shoulders, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 The Kohathites that had the charge of the ark had no wagons assigned
 them, because <I>their service was to bear it upon their shoulders,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+7:9">Num. vii. 9</A>.

 The ark was no such heavy burden but that they might, among them, have
 carried it as far as Mount Sion upon their shoulders, they needed not 
 to put it in a cart like a common thing. It was no excuse for them that 
 the Philistines had done so and were not punished for it; they knew no 
 better, nor had they any priests or Levites with them to undertake the 
 carrying of it; better carry it in a cart than that any of Dagon's 
 priests should carry it. Philistines may cart the ark with impunity; 
 but, if Israelites do so, they do it at their peril. And it mended the 
 matter very little that it was a new cart; old or new, it was not what 
 God had appointed.  I wonder how so wise and good a man as David was, 
 that conversed so much with the law of God, came to be guilty of such 
 an oversight. We will charitably hope that it was because he was so 
 extremely intent upon the substance of the service that he forgot to 
 take care of this circumstance.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put
 forth <I>his hand</I> to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the
 oxen shook <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 7 And the anger of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was kindled against Uzzah; and God
 smote him there for <I>his</I> error; and there he died by the ark of
 God.
 &nbsp; 8 And David was displeased, because the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had made a breach
 upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perez-uzzah to
 this day.
 &nbsp; 9 And David was afraid of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> that day, and said, How
 shall the ark of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> come to me?
 &nbsp; 10 So David would not remove the ark of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> unto him into
 the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of
 Obed-edom the Gittite.
 &nbsp; 11 And the ark of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> continued in the house of Obed-edom
 the Gittite three months: and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> blessed Obed-edom, and all
 his household.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Uzzah struck dead for touching the ark, when it was upon 
 its journey towards the city of David, a sad providence, which damped 
 their mirth, stopped the progress of the ark, and for the present, 
 dispersed this great assembly, which had come together to attend it, 
 and sent them home in a fright.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Uzzah's offence seems very small. He and his brother Ahio, the sons 
 of Abinadab, in whose house the ark had long been lodged, having been 
 used to attend it, to show their willingness to prefer the public 
 benefit to their own private honour and advantage, undertook to drive 
 the cart in which the ark was carried, this being perhaps the last 
 service they were likely to do it; for others would be employed about 
 it when it came to the city of David. Ahio went before, to clear the 
 way, and, if need were, to lead the oxen. Uzzah followed close to the 
 side of the cart. It happened that the oxen shook it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 The critics are not agreed about the signification of the original
 word: <I>They stumbled</I> (so our margin); <I>they kicked</I> (so 
 some), perhaps against the goad with which Uzzah drove them; <I>they 
 stuck in the mire,</I> by some. By some accident or other the ark was 
 in danger of being overthrown. Uzzah thereupon laid hold of it, to save 
 it from falling, we have reason to think with a very good intention, to 
 preserve the reputation of the ark and to prevent a bad omen. Yet this 
 was his crime. Uzzah was a Levite, but priests only might touch the 
 ark. The law was express concerning the Kohathites, that, though they 
 were to carry the ark by the staves, yet <I>they must not touch any 
 holy thing, lest they die,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+4:15">Num. iv. 15</A>.

 Uzzah's long familiarity with the ark, and the constant attendance he
 had given to it, might occasion his presumption, but would not excuse 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His punishment for this offence seems very great 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>The anger of the Lord was kindled against him</I> (for in sacred
 things he is a jealous God) and he <I>smote him there for his 
 rashness,</I> as the word is, and struck him dead upon the spot. There 
 he sinned, and there he died, <I>by the ark of God;</I> even the 
 mercy-seat would not save him. Why was God thus severe with him? 

 1. The touching of the ark was forbidden to the Levites expressly under
 pain of death--<I>lest they die;</I> and God, by this instance of 
 severity, would show how he might justly have dealt with our first 
 parents, when they had eaten that which was forbidden under the same 
 penalty--<I>lest you die.</I> 

 2. God saw the presumption and irreverence of Uzzah's heart. Perhaps he
 affected to show, before this great assembly, how bold he could make 
 with the ark, having been so long acquainted with it. Familiarity, even 
 with that which is most awful, is apt to breed contempt. 

 3. David afterwards owned that Uzzah died for an error they were all
 guilty of, which was carrying the ark in a cart. Because it was not 
 carried on the Levites' shoulders, <I>the Lord made that breach upon 
 us,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:13">1 Chron. xv. 13</A>.

 But Uzzah was singled out to be made an example, perhaps because he had
 been most forward in advising that way of conveyance; however he had 
 fallen into another error, which was occasioned by that. Perhaps the 
 ark was not covered, as it should have been, with the covering of 
 badgers' skins 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+4:6">Num. iv. 6</A>),

 and that was a further provocation. 

 4. God would hereby strike an awe upon the thousands of Israel, would
 convince them that the ark was never the less venerable for its having 
 been so long in mean circumstances, and thus he would teach them to 
 rejoice with trembling, and always to treat holy things with reverence 
 and holy fear. 

 5. God would hereby teach us that a good intention will not justify a
 bad action; it will not suffice to say of that which is ill done that 
 it was well meant. He will let us know that he can and will secure his 
 ark, and needs not any man's sin to help him to do it.  

 6. If it was so great a crime for one to lay hold on the ark of the
 covenant that had no right to do so, what is it for those to lay claim 
 to the privileges of the covenant that come not up to the terms of it?  
 To the wicked God says, <I>What hast thou to do to take my covenant in 
 thy mouth?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:16">Ps. l. 16</A>.

 <I>Friend, how camest thou in hither?</I> If the ark was so sacred, and
 not to be touched irreverently, what is the <I>blood of the 
 covenant?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:29">Heb. x. 29</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. David's feelings on the infliction of this stroke were keen, and 
 perhaps not altogether as they should have been. He should have humbled 
 himself under God's hand, confessed his error, acknowledged God's 
 righteousness, and deprecated the further tokens of his displeasure, 
 and then have gone on with the good work he had in hand. But we find, 
 
 1. He was displeased. It is not said because Uzzah had affronted God,
 but because God had made a breach upon Uzzah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>David's anger was kindled.</I> It is the same word that is used for
 God's displeasure, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Because God was angry, David was angry and out of humour. As if God
 might not assert the honour of his ark, and frown upon one that touched 
 it rudely, without asking David leave. Shall mortal man pretend to be 
 more just than God, arraign his proceedings, or charge him with 
 iniquity? David did not now act like himself, like <I>a man after God's 
 own heart.</I> It is not for us to be displeased at any thing that God 
 does, how unpleasing soever it is to us. The death of Uzzah was indeed 
 an eclipse to the glory of a solemnity which David valued himself upon 
 more than any thing else, and might give birth to some speculations 
 among those that were disaffected to him, as if God were departing from 
 him too; but he ought nevertheless to have subscribed to the 
 righteousness and wisdom of God in it, and not to have been displeased 
 at it. When we lie under God's anger we must keep under our own.

 2. He was afraid, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 It should seem he was afraid with amazement; for he said, <I>How shall
 the ark of the Lord come to me?</I> As if God sought advantages against 
 all that were about him, and was so extremely tender of his ark that 
 there was no dealing with it; and therefore better for him to keep it 
 at a distance. <I>Que procul a Jove, procul a fulmine--To retire from 
 Jove is to retire from the thunder-bolt.</I> He should rather have 
 said, "Let the ark come to me, and I will take warning by this to treat 
 it with more reverence." <I>Provoke me not</I> (says God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:6">Jer. xxv. 6</A>)

 <I>and I will do you no hurt.</I> Or this may be looked upon as a good
 use which David made of this tremendous judgment. He did not say, 
 "Surely Uzzah was a sinner above all men, because he suffered such 
 things," but is concerned for himself, as one conscious, not only of 
 his own unworthiness of God's favour, but his obnoxiousness to God's 
 displeasure. "God might justly strike me dead as he did Uzzah. <I>My 
 flesh trembles for fear of thee,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:120">Ps. cxix. 120</A>.

 This God intends in his judgments, that others may hear and fear. David
 therefore will not bring the ark into his own city

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>)

 till he is better prepared for its reception. 

 3. He took care to perpetuate the remembrance of this stroke by a new
 name he gave to the place: <I>Perez-uzzah, the breach of Uzzah,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 He had been lately triumphing in the breach made upon his enemies, and
 called the place <I>Baal-perazim, a place of breaches.</I> But here is 
 a breach upon his friends. When we see one breach, we should consider 
 that we know not where the next will be. The memorial of this stroke 
 would be a warning to posterity to take heed of all rashness and 
 irreverence in dealing about holy things; for <I>God will be sanctified 
 in those that come nigh unto him.</I>

 4. He lodged the ark in a good house, the house of Obed-edom a Levite,
 which happened to be near the place where this disaster happened, and 
 there,

 (1.) It was kindly entertained and welcomed, and continued there 
 <I>three months,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 Obed-edom knew what slaughter the ark had made among the Philistines
 that imprisoned it and the Bethshemites that looked into it. He saw 
 Uzzah struck dead for touching it, and perceived that David himself was 
 afraid of meddling with it; yet he cheerfully invites it to his own 
 house, and opens his doors to it without fear, knowing it was a 
 <I>savour of death unto death</I> only to those that treated it ill. "O 
 the courage," says bishop Hall, "of an honest and faithful heart!  
 nothing can make God otherwise than amiable to his own people: even his 
 very justice is lovely."

 (2.) It paid well for its entertainment: <I>The Lord blessed Obed-edom 
 and all his household.</I> The same hand that punished Uzzah's proud 
 presumption rewarded Obed-edom's humble boldness, and made the ark to 
 him a <I>savour of life unto life.</I> Let none think the worse of the 
 gospel for the judgements inflicted on those that reject it, but set in 
 opposition to them the blessings it brings to those that duly receive 
 it. None ever had, nor ever shall have, reason to say that <I>it is in 
 vain to serve God.</I> Let masters of families be encouraged to keep up 
 religion in their families, and to serve God and the interests of his 
 kingdom with their houses and estates, for that is the way to bring a 
 blessing upon all they have.  The ark is a guest which none shall lose 
 by that bid it welcome.  Josephus says that, whereas before Obed-edom 
 was poor, on a sudden, in these three months, his estate increased, to 
 the envy of his neighbours. Piety is the best friend to prosperity. In 
 wisdom's left hand are riches and honour. His household shared in the 
 blessing. It is good living in a family that entertains the ark, for 
 all about it will fare the better for it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  And it was told king David, saying, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath blessed
 the house of Obed-edom, and all that <I>pertaineth</I> unto him,
 because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark
 of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with
 gladness.
 &nbsp; 13 And it was <I>so,</I> that when they that bare the ark of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.
 &nbsp; 14 And David danced before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> with all <I>his</I> might; and
 David <I>was</I> girded with a linen ephod.
 &nbsp; 15 So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.
 &nbsp; 16 And as the ark of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came into the city of David,
 Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king
 David leaping and dancing before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and she despised him
 in her heart.
 &nbsp; 17 And they brought in the ark of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and set it in his
 place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for
 it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 18 And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt
 offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts.
 &nbsp; 19 And he dealt among all the people, <I>even</I> among the whole
 multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a
 cake of bread, and a good piece <I>of flesh,</I> and a flagon <I>of
 wine.</I> So all the people departed every one to his house.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the second attempt to bring the ark home to the city of 
 David; and this succeeded, though the former miscarried.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It should seem the blessing with which the house of Obed-edom was 
 blessed for the ark's sake was a great inducement to David to bring it 
 forward; for when that was told him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>)

 he hastened to fetch it to him. For, 

 1. It was an evidence that God was reconciled to them, and his anger
 was turned away. As David could read God's frowns upon them all in 
 Uzzah's stroke, so he could read God's favour to them all in 
 Obed-edom's prosperity; and, if God be at peace with them, they can 
 cheerfully go on with their design. 

 2. It was an evidence that the ark was not such a burdensome stone as
 it was taken to be, but, on the contrary, happy was the man that had it 
 near him.  Christ is indeed a <I>stone of stumbling, and a rock of 
 offence,</I> to those that are disobedient; but to those who believe he 
 is a <I>corner-stone, elect, precious,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:6-8">1 Pet. ii. 6-8</A>.

 When David heard that Obed-edom had such joy of the ark, then he would
 have it in his own city. Note, The experience others have had of the 
 gains of godliness should encourage us to be religious. Is the ark a 
 blessing to others' houses? let us bid it welcome to ours; we may have 
 it, and the blessing of it, without fetching it from our 
 neighbours.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Let us see how David managed the matter now. 

 1. He rectified the former error. He did not put the ark in a cart now,
 but ordered those whose business it was to carry it on their shoulders. 
 This is implied here

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)
 
 and expressed
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:15">1 Chron. xv. 15</A>.

 Then we make a good use of the judgments of God on ourselves and others
 when we are awakened by them to reform and amend whatever has been 
 amiss. 
 
 2. At their first setting out he offered sacrifices to God
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)

 by way of atonement for their former errors and in a thankful
 acknowledgment of the blessings bestowed on the house of Obed-edom.  
 Then we are likely to speed in our enterprises when we begin with God 
 and give diligence to make our peace with him, When we attend upon God 
 in holy ordinances our eye must be to the great sacrifice, to which we 
 owe it that we are taken into covenant and communion with God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:5">Ps. l. 5</A>.

 3. He himself attended the solemnity with the highest expressions of
 joy that could be

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>He danced before the Lord with all his might;</I> he leaped for joy,
 as one transported with the occasion, and the more because of the 
 disappointment he met with the last time. It is a pleasure to a good 
 man to see his errors rectified and himself in the way of his duty. His 
 dancing, I suppose, was not artificial, by any certain rule or measure, 
 nor do we find that any danced with him; but it was a natural 
 expression of his great joy and exultation of mind. He did it with all 
 his might; so we should perform all our religious services, as those 
 that are intent upon them and desire to do them in the best manner. All 
 our might is little enough to be employed in holy duties: the work 
 deserves it all. On this occasion David laid aside his imperial purple, 
 and put on a plain linen ephod, which was light and convenient for 
 dancing, and was used in religious exercises by those who were no 
 priests, for Samuel wore one,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:18">1 Sam. ii. 18</A>.

 That great prince thought it no disparagement to him to appear in the
 habit of a minister to the ark. 

 4. All the people triumphed in this advancement of the ark

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>They brought it up</I> into the royal city <I>with shouting,</I> and
 <I>with sound of trumpet,</I> so expressing their own joy in loud 
 acclamations, and giving notice to all about them to rejoice with them. 
 The public and free administration of ordinances, not only under the 
 protection, but under the smiles, of the civil powers, is just matter 
 of rejoicing to any people. 

 5. the ark was safely brought to, and honourably deposited in, the
 place prepared for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 They set it in <I>the midst of the tabernacle,</I> or tent, <I>which
 David had pitched for it;</I> not the tabernacle which Moses reared, 
 for that was at Gibeon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+1:13">2 Chron. i. 13</A>),

 and, we may suppose, being made of cloth, in so many hundred years it
 had gone to decay and was not fit to be removed; but this was a tent 
 set up on purpose to receive the ark. He would not bring it into a 
 private house, no, not his own, lest it should seem to be too much 
 engrossed, and people's resort to it, to pray before it, should be less 
 free; yet he would not build a house for it, lest that should supersede 
 the building of a more stately temple in due time, and therefore, for 
 the present, he placed it within curtains, under a canopy, in imitation 
 of Moses's tabernacle.  As soon as ever it was lodged, he offered 
 burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, in thankfulness to God that the 
 business was now done without any more errors or breaches, and in 
 supplication to God for the continuance of his favour. Note, All our 
 joys must be sanctified both with praises and prayers; <I>for with such 
 sacrifices God is well pleased.</I> Now, it should seem, he penned the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:1-8">132nd Psalm</A>.

 6. The people were then dismissed with great satisfaction.  He sent
 them away,

 (1.) With a gracious prayer: <I>He blessed them in the name of the Lord
 of hosts</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 having not only a particular interest in heaven as a prophet, but an
 authority over them as a prince; for <I>the less is blessed of the 
 better,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:7">Heb. vii. 7</A>.

 He prayed to God to bless them, and particularly to reward them for the
 honour and respect they had now shown to his ark, assuring them they 
 should be no losers by their journey, but the blessing of God upon 
 their affairs at home would more than bear their charges. He testified 
 his desire for their welfare by this prayer for them, and let them know 
 they had a king that loved them.

 (2.) With a generous treat; for so it was, rather than a distribution 
 of alms. The great men, it is probable, he entertained at his own 
 house, but to the <I>multitude of Israel, men</I> and <I>women</I> (and 
 <I>children,</I> says Josephus), he dealt to every one a <I>cake of 
 bread (a spice-cake,</I> so some), <I>a good piece of flesh--a handsome 
 decent piece</I> (so some)--<I>a part of the peace-offerings</I> (so 
 Josephus), that they might feast with him <I>upon the sacrifice,</I> 
 and a <I>flagon,</I> or bottle, <I>of wine,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Probably he ordered this provision to be made for them at their
 respective quarters, and this he did,

 [1.] In token of his joy and gratitude to God. When the heart is 
 enlarged in cheerfulness the hand should be opened in liberality. The 
 feast of Purim was observed with <I>sending portions one to 
 another,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:22">Esth. ix. 22</A>.

 As those to whom God is merciful ought to show mercy in forgiving, so
 those to whom God is bountiful ought to exercise bounty in giving.

 [2.] To recommend himself to the people, and confirm his interest in 
 them; for <I>every one is a friend to him that giveth gifts.</I> Those 
 that cared not for his prayers would love him for his generosity; and 
 this would encourage them to attend him another time if he saw cause to 
 call them together.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the
 daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious
 was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in
 the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain
 fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!
 &nbsp; 21 And David said unto Michal, <I>It was</I> before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, which
 chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint
 me ruler over the people of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, over Israel: therefore will

 &nbsp; 22 And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in

 of, of them shall I be had in honour.
 &nbsp; 23 Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the
 day of her death.
 </FONT></P>
 

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David, having dismissed the congregation with a blessing, <I>returned 
 to bless his household</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 that is, to pray with them and for them, and to offer up his family
 thanksgiving for this national mercy.  Ministers must not think that 
 their public performances will excuse them from their family-worship; 
 but when they have, with their instructions and prayers, blessed the 
 solemn assemblies, they must return in the same manner to bless their 
 households, for with them they are in a particular manner charged. 
 David, though he had prophets, and priests, and Levites, about him, to 
 be his chaplains, yet did not devolve the work upon them, but himself 
 <I>blessed his household.</I> It is angels' work to worship God, and 
 therefore surely that can be no disparagement to the greatest of 
 men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Never did David return to his house with so much pleasure and 
 satisfaction as he did now that he had got the ark into his 
 neighbourhood; and yet even this joyful day concluded with some 
 uneasiness, occasioned by the pride and peevishness of his wife. Even
 the palaces of princes are not exempt from domestic troubles. David had 
 pleased all the multitude of Israel, but Michal was not pleased with 
 his dancing before the ark. For this, when he was at a distance, she 
 scorned him, and when he came home she scolded him. She was not 
 displeased at his generosity to the people, nor did she grudge the 
 entertainment he gave them; but she thought he degraded himself too 
 much in dancing before the ark. It was not her covetousness, but her 
 pride, that made her fret.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. When she saw David in the street dancing before the Lord she 
 <I>despised him in her heart,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 She thought this mighty zeal of his for the ark of God, and the
 transport of joy he was in upon its coming home to him, was but a 
 foolish thing, and unbecoming so great a soldier, and statesman, and 
 monarch, as he was. It would have been enough for him to encourage the 
 devotion of others, but she looked upon it as a thing below him to 
 appear so very devout himself. "What a fool" (thinks she) "does my 
 husband make of himself now! How fond is he of this ark, that might as 
 well have lain still where it had lain for so many years! Much devotion 
 has almost made him mad." Note, The exercises of religion appear very 
 mean in the eyes of those that have little or no religion 
 themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. When he came home in the very best disposition she began to upbraid 
 him, and was so full of disdain and indignation that she could not 
 contain till she had him in private, but went out to meet him with her 
 reproaches. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How she taunted him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 "<I>How glorious was the king of Israel to-day!</I> What a figure didst
 thou make to-day in the midst of the mob! How unbecoming thy post and 
 character!" Her contempt of him and his devotion began in the heart, 
 but out of the abundance of that the mouth spoke. That which displeased 
 her was his affection to the ark, which she wished he had no greater 
 kindness for than she had: but she basely represents his conduct, in 
 dancing before the ark, as lewd and immodest; and, while really she was 
 displeased at it as a diminution to his honour, she pretended to 
 dislike it as a reproach to his virtue, that he <I>uncovered himself in 
 the eyes of the maid-servants,</I> as no man would have done but <I>one 
 of the vain fellows</I> that cared not how much he shamed himself. We 
 have no reason to think that this was true in fact. David, no doubt, 
 observed decorum, and governed his zeal with discretion. But it is 
 common for those that reproach religion thus to put false colours upon 
 it and lay it under the most odious characters. To have abused any man 
 thus for his pious zeal would have been very profane, but to abuse her 
 own husband thus, whom she ought to have reverenced, and one whose 
 prudence and virtue were above the reach of malice itself to disparage, 
 one who had shown such affection for her that he would not accept a 
 crown unless he might have her restored to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:13"><I>ch.</I> iii. 13</A>),

 was a most base and wicked thing, and showed her to have more of Saul's
 daughter in her than of David's wife or Jonathan's sister.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How he replied to her reproach. He did not upbraid her with her 
 treacherous departure from him to embrace the bosom of a stranger. He 
 had forgiven that, and therefore had forgotten it, though, it may be, 
 his own conscience, on this occasion, upbraided him with his folly in 
 receiving her again (for that is said to pollute the land, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:1">Jer. iii. 1</A>),
 
 but he justifies himself in what he did.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He designed thereby to honour God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>It was before the Lord,</I> and with an eye to him. Whatever
 invidious construction she was pleased to put upon it, he had the 
 testimony of his conscience for him that he sincerely aimed at the 
 glory of God, for whom he thought he could never do enough. Here he 
 reminds her indeed of the setting aside of her father's house, to make 
 way for him to the throne, that she might not think herself the most 
 proper judge of propriety: "<I>God chose me before thy father, and 
 appointed me to be ruler over Israel,</I> and now I am the fountain of 
 honour; and, if the expressions of a warm devotion to God were looked 
 upon as mean and unfashionable in thy father's court, yet <I>I will 
 play before the Lord,</I> and thereby bring them into reputation again. 
 And, if this be to be vile

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),
 
 <I>I will be yet more vile.</I>" Note,

 [1.] We should be afraid of censuring the devotion of others though it 
 may not agree with our sentiments, because, for aught that we know, the 
 heart may be upright in it, and who are we that we should despise those 
 whom God has accepted? 

 [2.] If we can approve ourselves to God in what we do in religion, and 
 do it as before the Lord, we need not value the censures and reproaches 
 of men. If we appear right in God's eyes, no matter how mean we appear 
 in the eyes of the world. 

 [3.] The more we are vilified for well-doing the more resolute we 
 should be in it, and hold our religion the faster, and bind it the 
 closer to us, for the endeavours of Satan's agents to shake us and to 
 shame us out of it.  <I>I will be yet more vile.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He designed thereby to humble himself: "<I>I will be base in my 
 own sight,</I> and will think nothing too mean to stoop to for the 
 honour of God." In the throne of judgment, and in the field of battle, 
 none shall do more to support the grandeur and authority of a prince 
 than David shall; but in acts of devotion he lays aside the thought of 
 majesty, humbles himself to the dust before the Lord, joins in with the 
 meanest services done in honour of the ark, and thinks all this no 
 diminution to him. The greatest of men is less than the least of the
 ordinances of Jesus Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He doubted not but even this would turn to his reputation among
 those whose reproach Michal pretended to fear: <I>Of the maid-servants 
 shall I be had in honour.</I> The common people would be so far from 
 thinking the worse of him for these pious condescensions that they
 would esteem and honour him so much the more. Those that are truly 
 pious are sometimes <I>manifested in the consciences</I> even of those 
 that speak ill of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:11">2 Cor. v. 11</A>.

 Let us never be driven from our duty by the fear of reproach; for to be
 steady and resolute in it will perhaps turn to our reputation more than 
 we think it will. Piety will have its praise. Let us not then be 
 indifferent in it, nor afraid or ashamed to own it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David was contented thus to justify himself, and did not any further 
 animadvert upon Michal's insolence; but God punished her for it, 
 writing her for ever childless from this time forward, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 She unjustly reproached David for his devotion, and therefore God
 justly put her under the perpetual reproach of barrenness. <I>Those 
 that honour God he will honour;</I> but those that despise him, and his 
 servants and service, <I>shall be lightly esteemed.</I></P>
