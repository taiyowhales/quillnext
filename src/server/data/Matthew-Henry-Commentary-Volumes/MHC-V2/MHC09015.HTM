 In this chapter we have the final rejection of Saul from being king, 
 for his disobedience to God's command in not utterly destroying the 
 Amalekites. By his wars and victories he hoped to magnify and 
 perpetuate his own name and honour, but, by his mismanagement of them, 
 he ruined himself, and laid his honour in the dust. Here is, 

 I. The commission God gave him to destroy the Amalekites, with a
 command to do it utterly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. Saul's preparation for this expedition,

 III. His success, and partial execution of this commission,

 IV. His examination before Samuel, and sentence passed upon him,
 notwithstanding the many frivolous pleas he made to excuse himself,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Samuel also said unto Saul, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> sent me to anoint thee
 <I>to be</I> king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken
 thou unto the voice of the words of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 2 Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, I remember <I>that</I> which Amalek
 did to Israel, how he laid <I>wait</I> for him in the way, when he
 came up from Egypt.
 &nbsp; 3 Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they
 have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and
 suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.
 &nbsp; 4 And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in
 Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of
 Judah.
 &nbsp; 5 And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the
 valley.
 &nbsp; 6 And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from
 among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed
 kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of
 Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
 &nbsp; 7 And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah <I>until</I> thou
 comest to Shur, that <I>is</I> over against Egypt.
 &nbsp; 8 And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and
 utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.
 &nbsp; 9 But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the
 sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and
 all <I>that was</I> good, and would not utterly destroy them: but
 every thing <I>that was</I> vile and refuse, that they destroyed
 utterly.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. Samuel, in God's name, solemnly requires Saul to be obedient to the 
 command of God, and plainly intimates that he was now about to put him 
 upon a trial, in one particular instance, whether he would be obedient 
 or no, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 And the making of this so expressly the trial of his obedience did very
 much aggravate his disobedience.

 1. He reminds him of what God had done for him: "<I>The Lord sent me to
 anoint thee to be a king.</I> God gave thee thy power, and therefore he 
 expects thou shouldst use thy power for him. He put honour upon thee, 
 and now thou must study how to do him honour. He made thee king over 
 Israel, and now thou must plead Israel's cause and avenge their 
 quarrels. Thou art advanced to command Israel, but know that thou art a 
 subject to the God of Israel and must be commanded by him." Men's 
 preferment, instead of releasing them from their obedience to God, 
 obliges them so much the more to it. Samuel had himself been employed 
 to anoint Saul, and therefore was the fitter to be send with these 
 orders to him. 

 2. He tells him, in general, that, in consideration of this, whatever
 God commanded him to do he was bound to do it: <I>Now therefore hearken 
 to the voice of the Lord.</I> Note, God's favours to us lay strong 
 obligations upon us to be obedient to him. This we must render, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:12">Ps. cxvi. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He appoints him a particular piece of service, in which he must now 
 show his obedience to God more than in any thing he had done yet. 
 Samuel premises God's authority to the command: <I>Thus says the Lord 
 of hosts,</I> the Lord of all hosts, of Israel's hosts. He also gives 
 him a reason for the command, that the severity he must use might not 
 seem hard: <I>I remember that which Amalek did to Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 God had an ancient quarrel with the Amalekites, for the injuries they
 did to his people Israel when he brought them out of Egypt. We have the 
 story,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:8-16">Exod. xvii. 8</A>,

 &c., and the crime is aggravated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+25:18">Deut. xxv. 18</A>.

 He basely smote the hindmost of them, and feared not God. God then
 swore that he would have <I>war with Amalek from generation to 
 generation,</I> and that in process of time he <I>would utterly put out 
 the remembrance of Amalek;</I> this is the work that Saul is now 
 appointed to do 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>Go and smite Amalek.</I> Israel is now strong, and the measure of
 the iniquity of Amalek is now full; now go and make a full riddance of 
 that devoted nation." He is expressly commanded to kill and slay all 
 before him, <I>man and woman, infant and suckling,</I> and not spare 
 them out of pity; also <I>ox and sheep, camel and ass,</I> and not 
 spare them out of covetousness. Note, 

 1.  Injuries done to God's Israel will certainly be reckoned for sooner
 or later, especially the opposition given them when they are coming out 
 of Egypt. 

 2. God often bears long with those that are marked for ruin.  The
 sentence passed is not executed speedily. 

 3. Though he bear long, he will not bear always.  The year of
 recompence for the controversy of Israel will come at last.  Though 
 divine justice strikes slowly it strikes surely. 

 4. The longer judgment is delayed many times the more severe it is when
 it comes. 

 5.  God chooses out instruments to do his work that are fittest for it.
 This was bloody work, and therefore Saul who was a rough and severe man 
 must do it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Saul hereupon musters his forces, and makes a descent upon the 
 country of Amalek. It was an immense army that he brought into the 
 field 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 200,000 <I>footmen.</I> When he came to engage the Philistines, and the
 success was hazardous, he had but 600 attending him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:15"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 15</A>.

 But now that he was to attack the Amalekites by express order from
 heaven, in which he was sure of victory, he had thousands at his call. 
 But, whatever it was at other times, it was not now for the honour of 
 Judah that their forces were numbered by themselves, for their quota 
 was scandalously short (whatever was the reason), but a twentieth part 
 of the whole, for they were by 10,000, when the other ten tribes (for I 
 except Levi) brought into the field 200,000. The day of Judah's honour 
 drew near, but had not yet come. Saul numbered them in <I>Telaim,</I> 
 which signifies <I>lambs.</I> He numbered then <I>like lambs</I> (so 
 the vulgar Latin), numbered them <I>by the paschal lambs</I> (so the 
 Chaldee), allowing ten to a lamb, a way of numbering used by the Jews 
 in the later times of their nation. Saul drew all his forces to the 
 <I>city of Amalek,</I> that city that was their metropolis 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 that he might provoke them to give him battle.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He gave friendly advice to the Kenites to separate themselves from 
 the Amalekites among whom they dwelt, while this execution was in 
 doing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Herein he did prudently and piously, and, it is probable, according to
 the direction Samuel gave him.  The Kenites were of the family and 
 kindred of Jethro, Moses's father-in-law, a people that dwelt in tents, 
 which made it easy for them, upon every occasion, to remove to other 
 lands not appropriated. Many of them, at this time, dwelt among the 
 Amalekites, where, though they dwelt in tents, they were fortified by 
 nature, for <I>they put their nest in a rock,</I> being hardy people 
 that could live any where, and affected fastnesses,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+24:21">Num. xxiv. 21</A>.

 Balaam had foretold that they should be wasted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+24:22">Num. xxiv. 22</A>.

 However, Saul must not waste them. But,

 1. He acknowledges the kindness of their ancestors to Israel, when they
 came out of Egypt. Jethro and his family had been very helpful and 
 serviceable to them in their passage through the wilderness, had been 
 to them instead of eyes, and this is remembered to their posterity many 
 ages after. Thus a good man leaves the divine blessing for an 
 inheritance to his children's children; those that come after us may be 
 reaping the benefit of our good works when we are in our graves. God is 
 not unrighteous to forget the kindnesses shown to his people; but they 
 shall be remembered another day, at furthest in the great day, <I>and 
 recompensed in the resurrection of the just. I was hungry, and you gave 
 me meat.</I> God's remembering the kindness of the Kenites' ancestors 
 in favour to them, at the same time when he was punishing the injuries 
 done by the ancestors of the Amalekites, helped to clear the 
 righteousness of God in that dispensation. If he entail favours, why 
 may he not entail frowns? He espouses his people's cause, so as to 
 <I>bless those that bless them;</I> and therefore so as to <I>curse 
 those that curse them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+24:9,Ge+12:3">Num. xxiv. 9; Gen. xii. 3</A>.

 They cannot themselves requite the kindnesses nor avenge the injuries
 done them, but God will do both.

 2.  He desires them to remove their tents from among the Amalekites:
 <I>Go, depart, get you down from among them.</I> When destroying 
 judgments are abroad God will take care to separate between the 
 precious and the vile, and to hide the meek of the earth in the day of 
 his anger. It is dangerous being found in the company of God's enemies, 
 and it is our duty and interest to <I>come out from among them,</I> 
 lest we share in their sins and plagues, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:4">Rev. xviii. 4</A>.

 The Jews have a saying, <I>Woe to the wicked man and woe to his
 neighbour.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Saul prevailed against the Amalekites, for it was rather an 
 execution of condemned malefactors than a war with contending enemies. 
 The issue could not be dubious when the cause was just and the call so 
 clear: <I>He smote them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 <I>utterly destroyed them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:8"><I>v.</I>  8</A>.

 Now they paid dearly for the sin of their ancestors. God sometimes
 <I>lays up iniquity for the children.</I> They were idolaters, and were 
 guilty of many other sins, for which they deserved to fall under the 
 wrath of God; yet, when God would reckon with them, he fastened upon 
 the sin of their ancestors in abusing his Israel as the ground of his 
 quarrel. Lord, How unsearchable are thy judgments, yet how 
 incontestable is thy righteousness!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Yet he did his work by halves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 1. He <I>spared Agag,</I> because he was a king like himself, and
 perhaps in hope to get a great ransom for him. 

 2. He spared the best of the cattle, and destroyed only the refuse,
 that was good for little.  Many of the people, we may suppose, made 
 their escape, and took their effects with them into other countries, 
 and therefore we read of Amalekites after this; but that could not be 
 helped. It was Saul's fault that he did not destroy such as came to his 
 hands and were in his power. That which was now destroyed was in effect 
 sacrificed to the justice of God, as the God to whom vengeance 
 belongeth; and for Saul to think the torn and the sick, the lame and 
 the lean, good enough for that, while he reserved for his own fields 
 and his own table the firstlings and the fat, was really to honour 
 himself more than God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Then came the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> unto Samuel, saying,
 &nbsp; 11 It repenteth me that I have set up Saul <I>to be</I> king: for he
 is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my
 commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 all night.
 &nbsp; 12 And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it
 was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set
 him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down
 to Gilgal.
 &nbsp; 13 And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed
 <I>be</I> thou of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: I have performed the commandment of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 14 And Samuel said, What <I>meaneth</I> then this bleating of the
 sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?
 &nbsp; 15 And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites:
 for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to
 sacrifice unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God; and the rest we have utterly
 destroyed.
 &nbsp; 16 Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say
 on.
 &nbsp; 17 And Samuel said, When thou <I>wast</I> little in thine own sight,
 <I>wast</I> thou not <I>made</I> the head of the tribes of Israel, and the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> anointed thee king over Israel?
 &nbsp; 18 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and
 utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against
 them until they be consumed.
 &nbsp; 19 Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>?
 &nbsp; 20 And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and have gone the way which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> sent me, and have
 brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the
 Amalekites.
 &nbsp; 21 But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief
 of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to
 sacrifice unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God in Gilgal.
 &nbsp; 22 And Samuel said, Hath the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>as great</I> delight in burnt
 offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>?
 Behold, to obey <I>is</I> better than sacrifice, <I>and</I> to hearken than
 the fat of rams.
 &nbsp; 23 For rebellion <I>is as</I> the sin of witchcraft, and
 stubbornness <I>is as</I> iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast
 rejected the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, he hath also rejected thee from
 <I>being</I> king.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Saul is here called to account by Samuel concerning the execution of 
 his commission against the Amalekites; and remarkable instances we are 
 here furnished with of the strictness of the justice of God and the 
 treachery and deceitfulness of the heart of man. We are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What passed between God and Samuel, in secret, upon this occasion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 1. God determines Saul's rejection, and acquaints Samuel with it: <I>It
 repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king.</I> Repentance in God 
 is not, as it is in us, a change of his mind, but a change of his 
 method or dispensation. He does not alter his will, but wills an 
 alteration. The change was in Saul: <I>He has turned back from 
 following me;</I> this construction God put upon the partiality of his 
 obedience, and the prevalency of his covetousness. And hereby he did 
 himself make God his enemy. God repented that he had given Saul the 
 kingdom and the honour and power that belonged to it: but he never 
 repented that he had given any man wisdom and grace, and his fear and 
 love; these gifts and callings of God are without repentance. 

 2. Samuel laments and deprecates it. <I>It grieved Samuel</I> that Saul
 had forfeited God's favour, and that God had resolved to cast him off; 
 and he <I>cried unto the Lord all night,</I> spent a whole night in 
 interceding for him, that this decree might not go forth against him.  
 When others were in their beds sleeping, he was upon his knees praying 
 and wrestling with God. He did not thus deprecate his own exclusion 
 from the government; nor was he secretly pleased, as many a one would 
 have been, that Saul, who succeeded him, was so soon laid aside, but on 
 the contrary prayed earnestly for his establishment, so far was he from 
 desiring that woeful day. The rejection of sinners is the grief of good 
 people; God delights not in their death, nor should we.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What passed between Samuel and Saul in public. Samuel, being sent 
 of God to him with these heavy tidings, went, as Ezekiel, in 
 <I>bitterness of soul,</I> to meet him, perhaps according to an 
 appointment when Saul went forth on this expedition, for Saul had come 
 to Gilgal 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),
 
 the place where he was made king
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:15"><I>ch.</I> xi. 15</A>),

 and were now he would have been confirmed if he had approved himself
 well in the trial of his obedience. But Samuel was informed that Saul 
 had set up a triumphal arch, or some monument of his victory, at 
 Carmel, a city in the mountains of Judah, seeking his own honour more 
 than the honour of God, for he set up this place (or <I>hand,</I> as 
 the word is) for himself (he had more need to have been repenting of 
 his sin and making his peace with God than boasting of his victory), 
 and also that he had marched in great state to Gilgal, for this seems 
 to be intimated in the manner of expression: <I>He has gone about, and 
 passed on, and gone down,</I> with a great deal of pomp and parade. 
 There Samuel gave him the meeting, and,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Saul makes his boast to Samuel of his obedience, because that was 
 the thing by which he was now to signalize himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 "<I>Blessed be thou of the Lord,</I> for thou sendest me upon a good
 errand, in which I have had great success, and <I>I have performed the 
 commandment of the Lord.</I>" It is very likely, if his conscience had 
 now flown in his face at this time and charged him with disobedience, 
 he would not have been so forward to proclaim his disobedience; for by 
 this he hoped to prevent Samuel's reproving him. Thus sinners think, by 
 justifying themselves, to escape being <I>judged of the Lord;</I> 
 whereas the only way to do that is by <I>judging ourselves.</I> Those 
 that boast most of their religion may be suspected of partiality and 
 hypocrisy in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Samuel convicts him by a plain demonstration of his disobedience. 
 "Hast thou performed the commandment of the Lord? <I>What means then 
 the bleating of the sheep?</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Saul would needs have it thought than God Almighty was wonderfully
 beholden to him for the good service he had done; but Samuel shows him 
 that God was so far from being a debtor to him that he had just cause 
 of action against him, and produces for evidence the <I>bleating of the 
 sheep, and the lowing of the oxen,</I> which perhaps Saul appointed to 
 bring up the rear of his triumph, but Samuel appears to them as 
 witnesses against him. He needed not go far to disprove his 
 professions. The noise the cattle made (like the <I>rust of silver,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:3">Jam. v. 3</A>)

 would be a <I>witness against him.</I> Note, It is no new thing for the
 plausible professions and protestations of hypocrites to be 
 contradicted and disproved by the most plain and undeniable evidence. 
 Many boast of their obedience to the command of God; but what mean then 
 their indulgence of the flesh, their love of the world, their passion 
 and uncharitableness, and their neglect of holy duties, which witness 
 against them?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Saul insists upon his own justification against this charge, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 The fact he cannot deny; the sheep and oxen were brought from the
 Amalekites. But, 

 (1.) It was not his fault, for <I>the people spared them;</I> as if 
 they durst have done it without the express orders of Saul, when they 
 knew it was against the express orders of Samuel. Note, Those that are 
 willing to justify themselves are commonly very forward to condemn 
 others, and to lay the blame upon any rather than take it to 
 themselves. Sin is a brat that nobody cares to have laid at his doors.  
 It is the sorry subterfuge of an impenitent heart, that will not 
 confess its guilt, to lay the blame on those that were tempters, or 
 partners, or only followers in it. 

 (2.) It was with a good intention: "It was <I>to sacrifice to the Lord 
 thy God.</I> He is thy God, and thou wilt not be against any thing that 
 is done, as this is, for his honour." This was a false plea, for both 
 Saul and the people designed their own profit in sparing the cattle.  
 But, if it had been true, it would still have been frivolous, for God 
 hates robbery for burnt-offering. God appointed these cattle to be 
 sacrificed to him in the field, and therefore will give those no thanks 
 that bring them to be sacrificed at his altar; for he will be served in 
 his own way, and according to the rule he himself has prescribed. Nor 
 will a good intention justify a bad action.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Samuel overrules, or rather overlooks, his plea, and proceeds, in 
 God's name, to give judgment against him. He premises his authority. 
 What he was about to say was what the Lord had said to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),
 
 otherwise he would have been far from passing so severe a censure upon
 him. Those who complain that their ministers are too harsh with them 
 should remember that, while they keep to the word of God, they are but 
 messengers, and must say as they are bidden, and therefore be willing, 
 as Saul himself here was, that they should <I>say on.</I> Samuel 
 delivers his message faithfully. 

 (1.) He reminds Saul of the honour of God had done him in making him 
 king 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 <I>when he was little in his own sight.</I> God regarded the lowness of
 his state and rewarded the lowliness of his spirit.  Note, Those that 
 are advanced to honour and wealth ought often to remember their mean 
 beginnings, that they may never think highly of themselves, but always 
 study to do great things for the God that had advanced them.

 (2.) He lays before him the plainness of the orders he was to execute 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>The Lord sent thee on a journey;</I> so easy was the service, and so
 certain the success, that it was rather to be called a <I>journey</I> 
 than a <I>war.</I> The work was honourable, to destroy the sworn 
 enemies of God and Israel; and had he denied himself, and set aside the 
 consideration of his own profit so far as to have destroyed all that 
 belonged to Amalek, he would have been no loser by it at last, nor have 
 gone this <I>warfare on his own charges.</I> God would no doubt have 
 made it up to him, so that he should have no need of spoil.  And 
 therefore,

 (3.) He shows him how inexcusable he was in aiming to make a profit of 
 this expedition, and to enrich himself by it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>"Wherefore then didst thou fly upon the spoil,</I> and convert that
 to thy own use which was to have been destroyed for God's honour?" See 
 what evil the love of money is the root of; but see what is the 
 sinfulness of sin, and that in it which above any thing else makes it 
 evil in the sight of the Lord. It is disobedience: <I>Thou didst not 
 obey the voice of the Lord.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Saul repeats his vindication of himself, as that which, in defiance 
 of conviction, he resolved to abide by, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.
 
 He denies the charge
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 "<I>Yea, I have obeyed,</I> I have done all I should do;" for he had
 done all which he thought he needed to do, so much wiser was he in his 
 own eyes than God himself. God bade him kill all, and yet he puts in 
 among the instances of his obedience that he brought Agag alive, which 
 he thought was as good as if he had killed him. Thus carnal deceitful 
 hearts think to excuse themselves from God's commandments with their 
 own equivalents. He insists upon it that he has <I>utterly destroyed 
 the Amalekites</I> themselves, which was the main thing intended; but, 
 as to the spoil, he owns it should have been <I>utterly destroyed;</I> 
 so that he knew his <I>Lord's will,</I> and was under no mistake about 
 the command. But he thought that would be wilful waste; the cattle of 
 the Midianites was taken for a prey in Moses's time

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+31:32-34">Num. xxxi. 32</A>,

 &c.), and why not the cattle of the Amalekites now? Better it should be
 prey to the Israelites than to the fowls of the air and the wild 
 beasts; and therefore he connived at the people's carrying it away. But 
 it was their doing and not his; and, besides, it was for <I>sacrifice 
 to the Lord</I> here at Gilgal, whither they were now bringing them. 
 See what a hard thing it is to convince the children of disobedience of 
 their sin and to strip them of their fig-leaves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. Samuel gives a full answer to his apology, since he did insist upon 
 it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>.

 He appeals to his own conscience: <I>Has the Lord as great delight in
 sacrifices as in obedience?</I> Though Saul was not a man of any great 
 acquaintance with religion, yet he could not but know this,

 (1.) That nothing is so pleasing to God as obedience, no, not sacrifice 
 and offering, and the fat of rams. See here what we should seek and aim 
 at in all the exercises of religion, even acceptance with God, that he 
 may delight in what we do. If God be well pleased with us and our 
 services, we are happy, we have gained our point, but otherwise <I>to 
 what purpose is it?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:11">Isa. i. 11</A>.

 Now here we are plainly told that humble, sincere, and conscientious
 obedience to the will of God, is more pleasing and acceptable to him 
 than all <I>burnt-offerings and sacrifices.</I> A careful conformity to 
 moral precepts recommends us to God more than all ceremonial 
 observances, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:6-8,Ho+6:6">Mic. vi. 6-8; Hos. vi. 6</A>.

 Obedience is enjoyed by the eternal law of nature, but sacrifice only
 by a positive law. Obedience was the law of innocency, but sacrifice 
 supposes sin come into the world, and is but a feeble attempt to take 
 that away which obedience would have prevented. God is more glorified 
 and self more denied by obedience than by sacrifice. It is much easier 
 to bring a bullock or lamb to be burnt upon the altar than to bring 
 <I>every high thought into obedience</I> to God and the will subject to 
 his will. Obedience is the glory of angels

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:20">Ps. ciii. 20</A>),

 and it will be ours.

 (2.) That nothing is so provoking to God as disobedience, setting up 
 our wills in competition with his. This is here called <I>rebellion</I> 
 and <I>stubbornness,</I> and is said to be as bad as <I>witchcraft</I> 
 and <I>idolatry,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 It is as bad to set up other gods as to live in disobedience to the
 true God. Those that are governed by their own corrupt inclinations, in 
 opposition to the command of God, do, in effect, consult the 
 <I>teraphim</I> (as the word here is for idolatry) or the diviners. It 
 was disobedience that made us all sinners

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:19">Rom. v. 19</A>),

 and this is the malignity of sin, that it is the <I>transgression of
 the law,</I> and consequently it is <I>enmity to God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:7">Rom. viii. 7</A>.
 
 Saul was a king, but if he disobey the command of God, his royal
 dignity and power will not excuse him from the guilt of rebellion and 
 stubbornness. It is not the rebellion of the people against their 
 prince, but of a prince against God, that this text speaks of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. He reads his doom: in short, "<I>Because thou has rejected the word 
 of the Lord,</I> hast <I>despised it</I> (so the Chaldee), hast <I>made 
 nothing of it</I> (so the LXX.), hast cast off the government of
 it, therefore he has <I>rejected thee,</I> despised and made nothing of 
 thee, but cast thee off <I>from being king.</I> He that made thee king 
 has determined to unmake thee again." Those are unfit and unworthy to 
 rule over men who are not willing that God should rule over them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>24  And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have
 transgressed the commandment of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and thy words: because
 I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.
 &nbsp; 25 Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again
 with me, that I may worship the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 26 And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for
 thou hast rejected the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath
 rejected thee from being king over Israel.
 &nbsp; 27 And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the
 skirt of his mantle, and it rent.
 &nbsp; 28 And Samuel said unto him, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath rent the kingdom of
 Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of
 thine, <I>that is</I> better than thou.
 &nbsp; 29 And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for
 he <I>is</I> not a man, that he should repent.
 &nbsp; 30 Then he said, I have sinned: <I>yet</I> honour me now, I pray
 thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn
 again with me, that I may worship the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God.
 &nbsp; 31 So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Saul is at length brought to put himself into the dress of the 
 penitent; but it is too evident that he only acts the part of a 
 penitent, and is not one indeed.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How poorly he expressed his repentance. It was with much ado that he 
 was made sensible of his fault, and not till he was threatened with 
 being deposed. This touched him in a tender part. Then he began to 
 relent, and not till then. When Samuel told him he was <I>rejected from 
 being king,</I> then he said, <I>I have sinned,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 His confession was not free nor ingenuous, but extorted by the rack,
 and forced from him. We observe here several bad signs of the hypocrisy 
 of his repentance, and that it came short even of Ahab's.

 1. He made his application to Samuel only, and seemed most solicitous
 to stand right in his opinion and to gain his favour. He makes a little 
 god of him, only to preserve his reputation with the people, because 
 they all knew Samuel to be a prophet, and the man that had been the 
 instrument of his preferment. Thinking it would please Samuel, and be a 
 sort of bribe to him, he puts it into his confession: <I>I have 
 transgressed the commandment of the Lord and thy word;</I> as if he had 
 been in God's stead, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 David, though convinced by the ministry of Nathan, yet, in his
 confession, has his eye to God alone, not to Nathan. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:4">Ps. li. 4</A>

 <I>Against thee only have I sinned.</I> But Saul, ignorantly enough, 
 confesses his sin as a transgression of Samuel's word; whereas his word 
 was no other than a declaration of the <I>commandment of the Lord.</I> 
 He also applies to Samuel for forgiveness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>I pray thee, pardon my sin;</I> as if any could forgive sin but God
 only. Those wretchedly deceive themselves who, when they have fallen 
 into scandalous sin, think it enough to make their peace with the 
 church and their ministers, by the show and plausible profession of 
 repentance, without taking care to make their peace with God by the 
 sincerity of it. The most charitable construction we can put upon this 
 of Saul is to suppose that he looked upon Samuel as a sort of mediator 
 between him and God, and intended an address to God in his application 
 to him.  However, it was very weak. 

 2. He excused his fault even in the confession of it, and that is never
 the fashion of a true penitent

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 I did it <I>because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.</I> We
 have reason enough to think that it was purely his own doing and not 
 the people's; however, if they were forward to do it, it is plain, by 
 what we have read before, that he knew how to keep up his authority 
 among them and did not stand in any awe of them. So that the excuse was 
 false and frivolous; whatever he pretended, he did not really fear the 
 people. But it is common for sinners, in excusing their faults, to 
 plead the thoughts and workings of their own minds, because those are 
 things which, how groundless soever, no man can disprove; but they 
 forget that God searchest the heart. 

 3. All his care was to save his credit, and preserve his interest in
 the people, lest they should revolt from him, or at least despise him. 
 Therefore he courts Samuel with so much earnestness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>)

 to turn again with him, and assist in a public thanksgiving for the
 victory. Very importunate he was in this matter when he laid hold on 
 the skirt of his mantle to detain him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 not that he cared for Samuel, but he feared that if Samuel forsook him
 the people would do so too. Many seem zealously affected to good 
 ministers and good people only for the sake of their own interest and 
 reputation, while in heart they hate them. But his expression was very 
 gross when he said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 <I>I have sinned, yet honour me, I pray thee, before my people.</I> Is
 this the language of a penitent? No, but the contrary: "<I>I have 
 sinned,</I> shame me now, for to me belongs shame, and no man can 
 loathe me so much as I loathe myself." Yet how often do we meet with 
 the copies of this hypocrisy of Saul! It is very common for those who 
 are convicted of sin to show themselves very solicitous to be honoured 
 before the people. Whereas he that has lost the honour of an innocent 
 can pretend to no other than that of a penitent, and it is the honour 
 of a penitent to take shame to himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How little he got by these thin shows of repentance. What point did
 he gain by them?

 1. Samuel repeated the sentence passed upon him, so far was he from
 giving any hopes of the repeal of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>,

 the same with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 <I>He that covers his sins shall never prosper,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:13">Prov.  xxviii. 13</A>.

 Samuel refused to turn back with him, but <I>turned about to go
 away,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 As the thing appeared to him upon the first view, he thought it
 altogether unfit for him so far to countenance one whom God had 
 rejected as to join with him in giving thanks to God for a victory 
 which was made to serve rather Saul's covetousness than God's glory.  
 Yet afterwards he did turn again with him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),

 upon further thoughts, and probably by divine direction, either to
 prevent a mutiny among the people or perhaps not to do honour to Saul 
 (for, though Saul worshipped the Lord, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>,

 it is not said Samuel presided in that worship), but to do justice on
 Agag,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 2. He illustrated the sentence by a sign, which Saul himself, by his
 rudeness, gave occasion for. When Samuel was turning from him he tore 
 his clothes to detain him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 so loth was he to part with the prophet; but Samuel put a construction
 upon this accident which none but a prophet could do. He made it to 
 signify the <I>rending of the kingdom</I> from him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),
 
 and that, like this, was his own doing. "He hath rent it from thee, and
 <I>given it to a neighbour better than thou,</I>" namely, to David, who 
 afterwards, upon occasion, cut off the skirt of Saul's robe 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+24:4">1 Sam. xxiv. 4</A>),
 
 upon which Saul said
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+24:20">1 Sam. xxiv. 20</A>),

 <I>I know that thou shalt surely be king,</I> perhaps remembering this
 sign, the tearing of the skirt of Samuel's mantle. 

 3. He ratified it by a solemn declaration of its being irreversible

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 <I>The Strength of Israel will not lie.</I> The <I>Eternity</I> or
 <I>Victory of Israel,</I> so some read it; <I>the holy One,</I> so the 
 Arabic; <I>the most noble One,</I> so the Syriac; the <I>triumphant 
 King of Israel,</I> so bishop Patrick.  "He is determined to depose 
 thee, and he will not change his purpose.  <I>He is not a man that 
 should repent.</I>" Men are fickle and alter their minds, feeble and 
 cannot effect their purposes; something happens which they could not 
 foresee, by which their measures are broken. But with God it is not so. 
 God has sometimes repented of the evil which he thought to have done, 
 repentance was hidden from Saul, and therefore hidden from God's 
 eyes.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>32  Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the
 Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said,
 Surely the bitterness of death is past.
 &nbsp; 33 And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so
 shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag
 in pieces before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in Gilgal.
 &nbsp; 34 Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to
 Gibeah of Saul.
 &nbsp; 35 And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his
 death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Samuel, as a prophet, is here set over kings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:10">Jer. i. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He destroys king Agag, doubtless by such special direction from 
 heaven as none now can pretend to. He <I>hewed Agag in pieces.</I> Some 
 think he only ordered it to be done; or perhaps he did it with his own 
 hands, as a sacrifice to God's injured justice 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 and sacrifices used to be cut in pieces. Now observe in this,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How Agag's present vain hopes were frustrated: He <I>came 
 delicately,</I> in a stately manner, to show that he was a king, and 
 therefore to be treated with respect, or in a soft effeminate manner, 
 as one never used to hardship, that <I>could not set the sole of his 
 foot to the ground for tenderness and delicacy</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:56">Deut. xxviii. 56</A>),

 to move compassion: and he said, "Surely, now that the heat of the
 battle is over, <I>the bitterness of death is past,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:32">
 <I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 Having escaped the sword of Saul," that man of war, he thought he was
 in no danger from Samuel, and old prophet, a man of peace. Note,

 (1.) There is bitterness in death, it is terrible to nature. <I>Surely 
 death is bitter,</I> so divers versions read those words of Agag; as 
 the LXX. read the former clause, <I>He came trembling.</I> Death
 will dismay the stoutest heart. 

 (2.) Many think the bitterness of death is past when it is not so; they 
 put that evil day far from them which is very near. True believers may, 
 through grace, say this, upon good grounds, though death be not past, 
 the bitterness of it is. <I>O death!  where is thy sting?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How his former wicked practices were now punished. Samuel calls him 
 to account, not only for the sins of his ancestors, but his own sins: 
 <I>Thy sword has made women childless,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 He trod in the steps of his ancestors' cruelty, and those under him, it
 is likely, did the same; justly therefore is all the righteous blood 
 shed by Amalek required of this generation,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:36">Matt. xxiii. 36</A>.

 Agag, that was delicate and luxurious himself, was cruel and barbarous
 to others. It is commonly so: those who are indulgent in their 
 appetites are not less indulgent of their passions. But blood will be 
 reckoned for; even kings must account to the King of kings for the 
 guiltless blood they shed or cause to be shed. It was that crime of 
 king Manasseh which the Lord would not pardon,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:4">2 Kings xxiv. 4</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:10">Rev.  xiii. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He deserts king Saul, takes leave of him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 and <I>never came any more to see him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>),

 to advise or assist him in any of his affairs, because Saul did not
 desire his company nor would he be advised by him. He looked upon him 
 as rejected of God, and therefore he forsook him. Though he might 
 sometimes see him accidentally (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:24"><I>ch.</I> xix. 24</A>),

 yet he never came to see him out of kindness or respect. Yet he
 <I>mourned for Saul,</I> thinking it a very lamentable thing that a man 
 who stood so fair for great things should ruin himself so foolishly. He 
 mourned for the bad state of the country, to which Saul was likely to 
 have been so great a blessing, but now would prove a curse and a 
 plague. He mourned for his everlasting state, having no hopes of 
 bringing him to repentance. When he wept for him, it is likely, he made 
 supplication, but the Lord had <I>repented that he had made Saul 
 king,</I> and resolved to undo that work of his, so that Samuel's 
 prayers prevailed not for him. Observe, We must mourn for the rejection 
 of sinners, 

 1. Though we withdraw from them, and dare not converse familiarly with
 them. Thus the prophet determines to leave his people and go from them, 
 and yet to <I>weep day and night for them,</I>

 2. Though they do not mourn for themselves. Saul seems unconcerned at
 the tokens of God's displeasure which he lay under, and yet Samuel 
 mourns day and night for him. Jerusalem was secure when Christ wept 
 over it.</P>
