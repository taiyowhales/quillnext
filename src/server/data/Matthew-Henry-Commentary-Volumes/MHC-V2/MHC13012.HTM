 What the mighty men did towards making David king we read in the 
 foregoing chapter. Here we are told what the many did towards it. It 
 was not all at once, but gradually, that David ascended the throne. His 
 kingdom was to last; and therefore, like fruits that keep longest, it 
 ripened slowly. After he had long waited for the vacancy of the throne, 
 it was at two steps and those above seven years distant, that he 
 ascended it. Now we are here told, 

 I. What help came in to him to Ziklag, to make him king of Judah,

 II. What help came in to him in Hebron, to make him king over all
 Israel, above seven years after,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now these <I>are</I> they that came to David to Ziklag, while he
 yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they
 <I>were</I> among the mighty men, helpers of the war.
 &nbsp; 2  <I>They were</I> armed with bows, and could use both the right
 hand and the left in <I>hurling</I> stones and <I>shooting</I> arrows out
 of a bow, <I>even</I> of Saul's brethren of Benjamin.
 &nbsp; 3  The chief <I>was</I> Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the
 Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and
 Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite,
 &nbsp; 4  And Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and
 over the thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and
 Josabad the Gederathite,
 &nbsp; 5  Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and
 Shephatiah the Haruphite,
 &nbsp; 6  Elkanah, and Jesiah, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam,
 the Korhites,
 &nbsp; 7  And Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.
 &nbsp; 8  And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into
 the hold to the wilderness men of might, <I>and</I> men of war <I>fit</I>
 for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose faces
 <I>were like</I> the faces of lions, and <I>were</I> as swift as the roes
 upon the mountains;
 &nbsp; 9  Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,
 &nbsp; 10  Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,
 &nbsp; 11  Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,
 &nbsp; 12  Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,
 &nbsp; 13  Jeremiah the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh.
 &nbsp; 14  These <I>were</I> of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one
 of the least <I>was</I> over a hundred, and the greatest over a
 thousand.
 &nbsp; 15  These <I>are</I> they that went over Jordan in the first month,
 when it had overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all
 <I>them</I> of the valleys, <I>both</I> toward the east, and toward the
 west.
 &nbsp; 16  And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the
 hold unto David.
 &nbsp; 17  And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto
 them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart
 shall be knit unto you: but if <I>ye be come</I> to betray me to mine
 enemies, seeing <I>there is</I> no wrong in mine hands, the God of our
 fathers look <I>thereon,</I> and rebuke <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 18  Then the spirit came upon Amasai, <I>who was</I> chief of the
 captains, <I>and he said,</I> Thine <I>are we,</I> David, and on thy side,
 thou son of Jesse: peace, peace <I>be</I> unto thee, and peace <I>be</I> to
 thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received
 them, and made them captains of the band.
 &nbsp; 19  And there fell <I>some</I> of Manasseh to David, when he came
 with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them
 not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him
 away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to <I>the jeopardy
 of</I> our heads.
 &nbsp; 20  As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah,
 and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu,
 and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that <I>were</I> of Manasseh.
 &nbsp; 21  And they helped David against the band <I>of the rovers:</I> for
 they <I>were</I> all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the
 host.
 &nbsp; 22  For at <I>that</I> time day by day there came to David to help
 him, until <I>it was</I> a great host, like the host of God.

 We have here an account of those that appeared and acted as David's 
 friends, upon the death of Saul, to bring about the revolution. All the 
 forces he had, while he was persecuted, was but 600 men, who served for 
 his guards; but, when the time had come that he must begin to act 
 offensively, Providence brought in more to his assistance. Even while 
 he <I>kept himself close, because of Saul</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 while he did not appear, to invite or encourage his friends and
 well-wishers to come in to him (not foreseeing that the death of Saul 
 was so near), God was inclining and preparing them to come over to him 
 with seasonable succours. Those that trust God to do his work for them 
 in his own way and time shall find his providence outdoing all their 
 forecast and contrivance. The war was God's, and he found out helpers 
 of the war, whose forwardness to act for the man God designed for the 
 government is here recorded to their honour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Some, even of Saul's brethren, of the tribe of Benjamin, and a-kin 
 to him, came over to David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 What moved them to it we are not told. Probably a generous indignation
 at the base treatment which Saul, one of their tribe, gave him, 
 animated them to appear the more vigorously for him, that the guilt and 
 reproach of it might not lie upon them. These Benjamites are described 
 to be men of great dexterity, that were trained up in shooting and 
 slinging, and used both hands alike--ingenious active men; a few of 
 these might do David a great deal of service. Several of the leading 
 men of them are here named. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:16">Judg. xx. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Some of the tribe of Gad, though seated on the other side Jordan, 
 had such a conviction of David's title to the government, and fitness 
 for it, that they <I>separated themselves from their brethren</I> (a 
 laudable separation it was) to go to David, though he was <I>in the 
 hold in the wilderness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 probably some of his strong holds in the wilderness of Engedi. They
 were but few, eleven in all, here named, but they added much to David's 
 strength. Those that had hitherto come in to his assistance were most 
 of them men of broken fortunes, distressed, discontented, and soldiers 
 of fortune, that came to him rather for protection than to do him any 
 service,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+22:2">1 Sam. xxii. 2</A>.

 But these Gadites were brave men, <I>men of war, and fit for the
 battle,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 For,

 1. They were <I>able-bodied men,</I> men of incredible swiftness, not 
 to fly from, but to fly upon, the enemy, and to pursue the scattered 
 forces. In this they were <I>as swift as the roes upon the 
 mountains,</I> so that no man could escape from them; and yet they had 
 <I>faces like the faces of lions,</I> so that no man could out-fight 
 them. 

 2. They were disciplined men, trained up to military exercises; they
 could handle shield and buckler, use both offensive and defensive 
 weapons. 
 
 3. They were officers of the militia in their own tribe

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 so that though they did not bring soldiers with them they had them at
 command, hundreds, thousands. 

 4. They were daring men, that could break through the greatest
 difficulties. Upon some expedition or other, perhaps this to David, 
 they swam over the Jordan, when it <I>overflowed all its banks,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Those are fit to be employed in the cause of God that can venture thus
 in a dependence upon the divine protection.

 5. They were men that would go through with the business they engaged
 in. What enemies those were that they met with in the valleys, when 
 they had passed Jordan, does not appear; but they put them to flight 
 with their lion-like faces, and pursued them with matchless fury, both 
 <I>towards the east and towards the west;</I> which way soever they 
 turned, they followed their blow, and did not do their work by 
 halves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Some of Judah and Benjamin came to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Their leader was Amasai, whether the same with that Amasa that
 afterwards sided with Absalom

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+17:25">2 Sam. xvii. 25</A>)
 
 or no does not appear. Now here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. David's prudent treaty with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 He was surprised to see them, and could not but conceive some jealousy
 of the intentions of their coming, having been so often in danger by 
 the treachery of the men of Ziph and the men of Keilah, who yet were 
 all men of Judah. He might well be timorous whose life was so much 
 struck at; he might well be suspicious who had been deceived in so many 
 that he said, in his haste, <I>All men are liars.</I> No marvel that he 
 meets these men of Judah with caution.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How he puts the matter to themselves, how fairly he deals with 
 them. As they are, they shall find him; so shall all that deal with the 
 Son of David. 

 [1.] If they be faithful and honourable, he will be their rewarder: 
 "<I>If you have come peaceably unto me, to help me,</I> though you have 
 come late and have left me exposed a great while, though you bring no 
 great strength with you to turn the scale for me, yet I will thankfully 
 accept your good-will, and <I>my heart shall be knit unto you;</I> I 
 will love you and honour you, and do you all the kindness I can." 
 Affection, respect, and service, that are cordial and sincere, will 
 find favour with a good man, as they do with a good God, though clogged 
 with infirmities, and turning to no great account.  But, 

 [2.] If they be false, and come to betray him into the hands of Saul,
 under colour of friendship, he leaves them to God to be their avenger, 
 as he is, and will be, of every thing that is treacherous and 
 perfidious. Never was man more violently run upon, and run down, than 
 David was (except the Son of David himself), and yet he had the 
 testimony of his conscience that there was no wrong in his hands. He 
 meant no harm to any man, which was his rejoicing in the day of evil, 
 and enabled him, when he feared treachery, to commit his cause to him 
 that judges righteously.  He will not be judge in his own cause, though 
 a wise man, nor avenge himself, though a man of valour; but let the 
 righteous God, who hath said, <I>Vengeance is mine,</I> do both. <I>The 
 God of our fathers look thereon and rebuke it.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) In this appeal observe, 

 [1.] He calls God the <I>God of our fathers,</I> both his fathers and 
 theirs. Thus he reminded them not to deal ill with him; for they were 
 both descendants from the same patriarchs, and both dependents on the 
 same God.  Thus he encouraged himself to believe that God would right 
 him if he should be abused; for he was the <I>God of his fathers</I> 
 and therefore a blessing was entailed on him, and a God to all Israel 
 and therefore not only a Judge to all the earth, but particularly 
 concerned in determining controversies between contesting Israelites. 
 
 [2.] He does not imprecate any fearful judgement upon them, though they
 should deal treacherously, but very modestly refers his cause to the 
 divine wisdom and justice: The Lord <I>look thereon,</I> and judge as 
 he sees (for he sees men's hearts), and <I>rebuke it.</I> It becomes 
 those that appeal to God to express themselves with great temper and 
 moderation; for the wrath of man <I>works not the righteousness of 
 God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Their hearty closure with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Amasai was their spokesman, on whom the <I>Spirit of the Lord came,</I>
 not a spirit of prophecy, but a spirit of wisdom and resolution, 
 according to the occasion, putting words into his mouth, 
 unpremeditated, which were proper both to give David satisfaction and 
 to animate those that accompanied him. Nothing could be said finer, 
 more lively, or more pertinent to the occasion.  For himself and all 
 his associates,

 (1.) He professed a very cordial adherence to David, and his interest,
 against all that opposed him, and a resolution to stand by him with the 
 hazard of all that was dear to him: <I>Thine are we, David, and on thy 
 side, thou son of Jesse.</I> In calling him <I>son of Jesse</I> they 
 reminded themselves that he was lineally descended from Nahshon and 
 Salmon, who in their days were princes of the tribe of Judah. Saul 
 called him so in disdain

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:27,22:7">1 Sam. xx. 27; xxii. 7</A>),

 but they looked upon it as his honour. They were convinced that God was
 on his side; and therefore, <I>Thine are we, David, and on thy 
 side.</I> It is good, if we must side, to side with those that side 
 with God and have God with them. 

 (2.) He wished prosperity to David and his cause, not drinking a
 health, but praying for peace to him and all his friends and 
 well-wishers: "<I>Peace, peace, be unto thee,</I> all the good thy 
 heart desires, and <I>peace be to thy helpers,</I> among whom we desire 
 to be reckoned, that peace may be on us."

 (3.) He assured him of help from heaven: "<I>For thy God helpeth
 thee;</I> therefore we wish peace may be, and therefore we doubt not 
 but peace shall be, to thee and thy helpers. God is thy God, and those 
 that have him for their God no doubt have him for their helper in every 
 time of need and danger." From these expressions of Amasai we may take 
 instruction how to testify our affection and allegiance to the Lord 
 Jesus. His we must be without reservation or power of revocation. On 
 his side we must be forward to appear and act.  To his interest we must 
 be hearty well-wishers: "Hosanna! prosperity to his gospel and 
 kingdom;" for his God helpeth him, and will till he shall have put down 
 all opposing rule, principality, and power.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. David's cheerful acceptance of them into his interest and 
 friendship. Charity and honour teach us to let fall our jealousies as 
 soon as satisfaction is given us: <I>David received them,</I> and 
 preferred them to be <I>captains of the band.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Some of Manasseh likewise joined with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Providence gave them a fair opportunity to do so when he and his men
 marched through their country upon this occasion. Achish took David 
 with him when he went out to fight with Saul; but the lords of the 
 Philistines obliged him to withdraw. We have the story,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+29:4-11">1 Sam. xxix. 4</A>,

 &c. In his return some
 great men of Manasseh, who had no heart to join with Saul against the 
 Philistines struck in with David, and very seasonably, to help him 
 <I>against the band of Amalekites</I> who plundered Ziklag; they were 
 not many, but they were all mighty men and did David good service upon 
 that occasion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:1-31">1 Sam. xxx.</A>

 See how Providence provides. David's interest grew strangely just when
 he had occasion to make use of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Auxiliary forces flocked in daily, <I>till he had a great host.</I>
 When the promise comes to the birth, leave it to God to find strength 
 to bring forth.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>23  And these <I>are</I> the numbers of the bands <I>that were</I> ready
 armed to the war, <I>and</I> came to David to Hebron, to turn the
 kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 24  The children of Judah that bare shield and spear <I>were</I> six
 thousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war.
 &nbsp; 25  Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war,
 seven thousand and one hundred.
 &nbsp; 26  Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.
 &nbsp; 27  And Jehoiada <I>was</I> the leader of the Aaronites, and with him
 <I>were</I> three thousand and seven hundred;
 &nbsp; 28  And Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father's
 house twenty and two captains.
 &nbsp; 29  And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three
 thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the
 ward of the house of Saul.
 &nbsp; 30  And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight
 hundred, mighty men of valour, famous throughout the house of
 their fathers.
 &nbsp; 31  And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which
 were expressed by name, to come and make David king.
 &nbsp; 32  And of the children of Issachar, <I>which were men</I> that had
 understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the
 heads of them <I>were</I> two hundred; and all their brethren <I>were</I>
 at their commandment.
 &nbsp; 33  Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war,
 with all instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep
 rank: <I>they were</I> not of double heart.
 &nbsp; 34  And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with
 shield and spear thirty and seven thousand.
 &nbsp; 35  And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand
 and six hundred.
 &nbsp; 36  And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war,
 forty thousand.
 &nbsp; 37  And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the
 Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of
 instruments of war for the battle, a hundred and twenty
 thousand.
 &nbsp; 38  All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a
 perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and
 all the rest also of Israel <I>were</I> of one heart to make David
 king.
 &nbsp; 39  And there they were with David three days, eating and
 drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them.
 &nbsp; 40  Moreover they that were nigh them, <I>even</I> unto Issachar and
 Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and
 on mules, and on oxen, <I>and</I> meat, meal, cakes of figs, and
 bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep
 abundantly: for <I>there was</I> joy in Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of those who were active in perfecting the 
 settlement of David upon the throne, after the death of Ishbosheth. We 
 read 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+11:1"><I>ch.</I> xi. 1</A>,
 
 and before
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:1">2 Sam. v. 1</A>)

 that <I>all the tribes of Israel came,</I> either themselves or by
 their representatives, to Hebron, to make David king; now here we have 
 an account of the quota which every tribe brought in <I>ready armed to 
 the war,</I> in case there should be any opposition, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 We may observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That those tribes that lived nearest brought the fewest-Judah but 
 6800 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),
 
 Simeon but 7100
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>);

 whereas Zebulun, that lay remote, brought 50,000, Asher 40,000, and the
 two tribes and a half on the other side Jordan 120,000. Not as if the 
 next adjacent tribes were cold in the cause; but they showed as much of 
 their prudence in bringing few, since all the rest lay so near within 
 call, as the others did of their zeal in bringing so many. The men of 
 Judah had enough to do to entertain those that came from afar.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The Levites themselves, and the priests (called here the 
 <I>Aaronites</I>), appeared very hearty in this cause, and were ready,
 if there were occasion, to fight for David, as well as pray for him, 
 because they knew he was called of God to the government, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:26-28"><I>v.</I> 26-28</A>.</P>

 III. Even some of the kindred of Saul came over to David 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 not so many as of the other tribes, because a foolish affection for
 their own tribe, and a jealousy for the honour of it, kept many of them 
 long in the sinking interest of Saul's family.  Kindred should never 
 over-rule conscience. Call no man <I>Father</I> to this extent, but God 
 only.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. It is said of most of these that they were <I>mighty men of 
 valour</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:25,28,30"><I>v.</I> 25, 28, 30</A>),

 of others that they were <I>expert in war</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:35,36"><I>v.</I> 35, 36</A>),

 and of them all that they <I>could keep rank,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 They had a great deal of martial fire, and yet were governable and
 subject to the rules of order--warm hearts but cool heads.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Some were so considerate as to bring with them arms, and all 
 instruments for war 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:24,33,37"><I>v.</I> 24, 33, 37</A>),

 for how could they think that David should be able to furnish them?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The men of Issachar were the fewest of all, only 200, and yet as 
 serviceable to David's interest as those that brought in the greatest 
 numbers, these few being in effect the whole tribe. For, 

 1. They were men of great skill above any of their neighbours, men that
 <I>had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do.</I> 
 They understood the natural times, could <I>discern the face of the 
 sky,</I> were weather-wise, could advise their neighbours in the proper 
 times for ploughing, sowing reaping, &c. Or the ceremonial times, the 
 times appointed for the solemn feasts; therefore they are said to 
 <I>call the people to the mountain</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:19">Deut. xxxiii. 19</A>),

 for almanacs were not then so common as now. Or, rather, the political
 times; they understood public affairs, the temper of the nation, and 
 the tendencies of the present events. It is the periphrasis of 
 statesmen that they <I>know the times,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:13">Esth. i. 13</A>.

 Those of that tribe were greatly intent on public affairs, had good
 intelligence from abroad and made a good use of it. They knew <I>what 
 Israel ought to do:</I> from their observation and experience they 
 learned both their own and others' duty and interest. In this critical 
 juncture they knew Israel ought to make David king. It was not only 
 expedient, but necessary; the present posture of affairs called for it. 
 The men of Issachar dealt mostly in country business, and did not much 
 intermeddle in public affairs, which gave them an opportunity of 
 observing others and conversing with themselves. A stander-by sees 
 sometimes more than a gamester. 

 2. They were men of great interests; for <I>all their brethren were at
 their commandment.</I> The commonality of that tribe having <I>bowed 
 their shoulder to bear</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:15">Gen. xlix. 15</A>),

 the great men had them at their beck. Hence we read of <I>the princes
 of Issachar,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:15">Judg. v. 15</A>.

 They knew how to rule, and the rest knew how to obey. It is happy
 indeed when those that should lead are intelligent and judicious, and 
 those who are to follow are modest and obsequious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. It is said of them all that they engaged in this enterprise 
 <I>with a perfect heart</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>),

 and particularly of the men of Zebulun that they were <I>not of double
 heart,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 They were, in this matter, <I>Israelites indeed, in whom was no
 guile.</I> And this was their perfection, that they were of one heart, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 None had any separate interests, but all for the public good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. The men of Judah, and others of the adjacent tribes, prepared for 
 the victualling of their respective camps when they came to Hebron, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:39,40"><I>v.</I> 39, 40</A>.

 Those that were at the least pains in travelling to this convention, or
 congress of states, thought themselves obliged to be at so much the 
 more charge in entertaining the rest, that there might be something of 
 an equality. A noble feast was made (was <I>made for laughter,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:19">Eccl. x. 19</A>)

 upon this occasion, for there was <I>joy in Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.

 And good reason; for <I>when the righteous</I> bear <I>rule the city
 rejoices.</I> Thus, when the throne of Christ is set up in a soul, 
 there is, or ought to be, great joy in that soul: and provision is made 
 for the feasting of it, not as here for two or three days, but for the 
 whole life, nay, for eternity.</P>
