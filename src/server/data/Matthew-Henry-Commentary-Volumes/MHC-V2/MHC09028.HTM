 Preparations are herein making for that war which will put an end to 
 the life and reign of Saul, and so make way for David to the throne. In 
 this war, 

 I. The Philistines are the aggressors and Achish their king makes David
 his confidant, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. The Israelites prepare to receive them, and Saul their king makes
 the devil his privy-counsellor, and thereby fills the measure of his 
 iniquity. Observe, 

 1. The despairing condition which Saul was in, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:3-6">ver. 3-6</A>.

 2. The application he made to a witch, to bring him up Samuel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:7-14">ver. 7-14</A>.

 3. His discourse with the apparition, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:15-19">ver. 15-19</A>.

 The damp it struck upon him,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines
 gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel.
 And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt
 go out with me to battle, thou and thy men.
 &nbsp; 2 And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy
 servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make
 thee keeper of mine head for ever.
 &nbsp; 3 Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and
 buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away
 those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the
 land.
 &nbsp; 4 And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came
 and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and
 they pitched in Gilboa.
 &nbsp; 5 And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid,
 and his heart greatly trembled.
 &nbsp; 6 And when Saul enquired of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> answered him
 not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The design of the Philistines against Israel. They resolved to 
 <I>fight them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 If the Israelites had not forsaken God, there would have been no
 Philistines remaining to molest them; if Saul had not forsaken him, 
 they would by this time have been put out of all danger by them. The 
 Philistines took an opportunity to make this attempt when they had 
 David among them, whom they feared more than Saul and all his 
 forces.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The expectation Achish had of assistance from David in this war, 
 and the encouragement David gave him to expect it: "<I>Thou shalt go 
 with me to battle,</I>" says Achish. "If I protect thee, I may demand 
 service from thee;" and he will think himself happy if he may have such 
 a man as David on his side, who prospered whithersoever he went. David 
 gave him an ambiguous answer: "We will see what will be done; it will 
 be time enough to talk of that hereafter; but <I>surely thou shalt know 
 what thy servant can do</I>" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 that is, "I will consider in what post I may be best able to serve
 thee, if thou wilt but give me leave to choose it." Thus he keeps 
 himself free from a promise to serve him and yet keeps up his 
 expectation of it; for Achish took it in no other sense than as an 
 engagement to assist him, and promised him, thereupon, that he would 
 make him captain of the guards, protector, or prime-minister of 
 state.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The drawing of the armies, on both sides, into the field 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>The Philistines pitched in Shunem,</I> which was in the tribe of
 Issachar, a great way north from their country. The land of Israel, it 
 seems, was ill-guarded, when the Philistines could march their army 
 into the very heart of the country. Saul, while he pursued David, left 
 his people naked and exposed. On some of the adjacent mountains of 
 Gilboa Saul mustered his forces, and prepared to engage the 
 Philistines, which he had little heart to do now that the <I>Spirit of 
 the Lord had departed from him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The terror Saul was in, and the loss he was at, upon this occasion: 
 He <I>saw the host of the Philistines,</I> and by his own view of them, 
 and the intelligence his spies brought him, he perceived they were more 
 numerous, better armed, and in better heart, than his own were, which 
 made him afraid, so that <I>his heart greatly trembled,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Had he kept close to God, he needed not have been afraid at the sight
 of an army of Philistines; but now that he had provoked God to forsake 
 him his interest failed, his armies dwindled and looked mean, and, 
 which was worse, his spirits failed him, his heart sunk within him, a 
 guilty conscience made him tremble at the shaking of a leaf. Now he 
 remembered the guilty blood of the Amalekites which he had spared, and 
 the innocent blood of the priests which he had spilt. His sins were set 
 in order before his eyes, which put him into confusion, embarrassed all 
 his counsels, robbed him of all his courage, and produced in him a 
 certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation. Note, 
 Troubles are terrors to the children of disobedience. In this distress 
 <I>Saul enquired of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Need drives those to God who in the day of their prosperity slighted
 his oracles and altars. <I>Lord, in trouble have they visited thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:16">Isa. xxvi. 16</A>.

 Did ever any seek the Lord and not find him? Yes, Saul did; <I>the Lord
 answered him not,</I> took no notice either of his petitions or of his 
 enquiries; gave him no directions what to do, nor any encouragement to 
 hope that he would be with him. <I>Should he be enquired of at all</I> 
 by such a one as Saul?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:3">Ezek. xiv. 3</A>.

 No, he could not expect an answer of peace, for, 

 1. He enquired in such a manner that it was as if he had <I>not
 enquired at all.</I> Therefore it is said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+10:14">1 Chron. x. 14</A>),

 <I>He enquired not of the Lord;</I> for he did it faintly and coldly,
 and with a secret design, if God did not answer him, to consult the 
 devil. He did not enquire in faith, but with a double unstable mind. 

 2.  He enquired of the Lord when it was too late, when the days of his
 probation were over and he was finally rejected. <I>Seek the Lord while 
 he may be found,</I> for there is a time when he will not be found. 

 3.  He had forfeited the benefit of all the methods of enquiry. Could
 he that hated and persecuted Samuel and David, who were both prophets, 
 expect to be answered by prophets?  Could he that had slain the high 
 priest, expect to be answered by Urim?  Or could he that had sinned 
 away the Spirit of grace, expect to be answered by dreams? No. <I>Be 
 not deceived, God is not mocked.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The mention of some things that had happened a good while ago, to 
 introduce the following story, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 1. The death of Samuel. Samuel was dead, which made the Philistines the
 more bold and Saul the more afraid; for, had Samuel been alive, Saul 
 probably thought that his presence and countenance, his good advice and 
 good prayers, would have availed him in his distress. 

 2. Saul's edict against witchcraft. He had put the laws in execution
 against <I>those that had familiar spirits,</I> who must not be 
 <I>suffered to live,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:18">Exod. xxii. 18</A>.

 Some think that he did this in the beginning of his reign, while he was
 under Samuel's influence; others think that it was lately done, for it 
 is spoken of here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 as a late edict. Perhaps when Saul was himself troubled with an evil
 spirit he suspected that he was bewitched, and, for that reason, cut 
 off all that had familiar spirits. Many seem zealous against sin, when 
 they themselves are any way hurt by it (they will inform against 
 swearers if they swear at them, or against drunkards if in their drink 
 they abuse them), who otherwise have no concern for the glory of God, 
 nor any dislike of sin as sin. However it was commendable in Saul thus 
 to use his power for the terror and restraint of these evil-doers. 
 Note, Many seem enemies to sin in others, while they indulge it in 
 themselves. Saul will drive the devil out of his kingdom, and yet 
 harbour him in his heart, by envy and malice.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a
 familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And
 his servants said to him, Behold, <I>there is</I> a woman that hath a
 familiar spirit at Endor.
 &nbsp; 8 And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he
 went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night:
 and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit,
 and bring me <I>him</I> up, whom I shall name unto thee.
 &nbsp; 9 And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul
 hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits,
 and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a
 snare for my life, to cause me to die?
 &nbsp; 10 And Saul sware to her by the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, saying, <I>As</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.
 &nbsp; 11 Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he
 said, Bring me up Samuel.
 &nbsp; 12 And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice:
 and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me?
 for thou <I>art</I> Saul.
 &nbsp; 13 And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest
 thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of
 the earth.
 &nbsp; 14 And he said unto her, What form <I>is</I> he of? And she said, An
 old man cometh up; and he <I>is</I> covered with a mantle. And Saul
 perceived that it <I>was</I> Samuel, and he stooped with <I>his</I> face to
 the ground, and bowed himself.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 
 
 I. Saul seeks for a witch, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 When God <I>answered him not,</I> if he had humbled himself by
 repentance and persevered in seeking God, who knows but that at length 
 he might have been entreated for him? but, since he can discern no 
 comfort either from heaven or earth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:21,22">Isa. viii. 21, 22</A>),

 he resolves to knock at the gates of hell, and to see if any there will
 befriend him and give him advice: <I>Seek me a woman that has a 
 familiar spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 And his servants were too officious to serve him in this evil affair;
 they presently recommended one to him at Endor (a city not far off) who 
 had escaped the execution of Saul's edict. To her he resolves to apply. 
 Herein he is chargeable,

 1. With contempt of the God of Israel; as if any creature could do him
 a kindness when God had left him and frowned upon him. 

 2. With contradiction to himself. He knew the heinousness of the sin of
 witchcraft, else he would not have cut off those that had familiar 
 spirits; yet now he had recourse to that as an oracle which he had 
 before condemned as an abomination. It is common for men to inveigh 
 severely against those sins which they are in no temptation to, but 
 afterwards to be themselves overcome by them.  Had one told Saul, when 
 he was destroying the witches, that he himself would, ere long, consult 
 with one, he would have said, as Hazael did, <I>What? Is thy servant a 
 dog?</I> But who knows what mischiefs those will run into that forsake 
 God and are forsaken of him?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Hearing of one he hastens to her, but goes by night, and in 
 disguise, only with two servants, and probably on foot, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 See how those that are led captive by Satan are forced,

 1. To disparage themselves. Never did Saul look so mean as when he went
 sneaking to a sorry witch to know his fortune. 

 2. To dissemble. Evil works are works of darkness, and they hate the
 light, neither care for coming to it.  Saul went to the witch, not in 
 his robes, but in the habit of a common soldier, not only lest the 
 witch herself, if she had known him, should decline to serve him, 
 either fearing he came to trepan her or resolving to be avenged on him 
 for his edict against those of her profession, but lest his own people 
 should know it and abhor him for it. Such is the power of natural 
 conscience that even those who do evil blush and are ashamed to do 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He tells her his errand and promises her impunity. 

 1. All he desires of her is to bring up one from the dead, whom he had
 a mind to discourse with. It was necromancy or divination by the dead, 
 that he hoped to serve his purpose by. This was expressly forbidden by 
 the law

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+18:11">Deut. xviii. 11</A>),

 seeking <I>for the living to the dead,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:19">Isa. viii. 19</A>.

 <I>Bring me up him whom I shall name,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 This supposes that it was generally taken for granted that souls exist
 after death, and that when men die there is not an end of them: it 
 supposes too that great knowledge was attributed to separate souls. But 
 to think that any good souls would come up at the beck of an evil 
 spirit, or that God, who had denied a man the benefit of his own 
 institutions, would suffer him to reap any real advantage by a cursed 
 diabolical invention, was very absurd.

 2.  She signifies her fear of the law, and her suspicion that this
 stranger came to draw her into a snare

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Thou knowest what Saul has done.</I> Providence ordered it so that
 Saul should be told to his face of his edict against witches, at this 
 very time when he was consulting one, for the greater aggravation of 
 his sin. She insists upon the peril of the law, perhaps to raise her 
 price; for, though no mention is made of her fee, no doubt she demanded 
 and had a large one. Observe how sensible she is of danger from the 
 edict of Saul, and what care she is in to guard against it; but not at 
 all apprehensive of the obligations off God's law and the terrors of 
 his wrath.  She considered what <I>Saul</I> had done, not what 
 <I>God</I> had done, against such practices, and feared a snare laid 
 for her life more than a snare laid for her soul. It is common for 
 sinners to be more afraid of punishment from men than of God's 
 righteous judgment.  But, 

 3. Saul promises with an oath not to betray her, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 It was his duty as a king to punish her and he knew it, yet he swears
 no to do it; as if he could by his own oath bind himself from doing 
 that which, by the divine command, he was bound to do. But he promised 
 more than he could perform when he said, <I>There shall no punishment 
 happen to thee;</I> for he that could not secure himself could much 
 less secure her from divine vengeance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Samuel, who was lately dead, is the person whom Saul desired to 
 have some talk with; and the witch, with her enchantments, gratifies 
 his desire, and brings them together. 

 1. As soon as Saul had given the witch the assurance she desired (that
 he would not discover her) she applied to her witchcrafts, and asked 
 very confidently, <I>Whom shall I bring up to thee?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Note, Hopes of impunity embolden sinners in their evil ways and harden
 their hearts. 

 2. Saul desires to speak with Samuel: <I>Bring me up Samuel.</I> Samuel
 had anointed him to the kingdom and had formerly been his faithful 
 friend and counsellor, and therefore with him he wished to advise. 
 While Samuel was living at Ramah, not far from Gibeah of Saul, and 
 presided there in the school of the prophets, we never read of Saul's 
 going to him to consult him in any of the difficulties he was in (it 
 would have been well for him if he had); then he slighted him, and 
 perhaps hated him, looking upon him to be in David's interest.  But now 
 that he is dead, "O for Samuel again! By all means, <I>bring me up 
 Samuel.</I>" Note, Many that despise and persecute God's saints and 
 ministers when they are living would be glad to have them again when 
 they are gone. <I>Send Lazarus to me,</I> and <I>send Lazarus to my 
 father's house,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:24-27">Luke xvi. 24-27</A>.

 The sepulchres of the righteous are garnished. 

 3. Here is a seeming defector chasm in the story. Saul said, <I>Bring
 me up Samuel,</I> and the very next words are, <I>When the woman saw 
 Samuel,</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 whereas one would have expected to be told how she performed the
 operation, what spells and charms she used, or that some little 
 intimation would be given of what she said or did; but the profound 
 silence of the scripture concerning it forbids our coveting to <I>know 
 the depths of Satan</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:24">Rev. ii. 24</A>)

 or to have our curiosity gratified with an account of the mysteries of
 iniquity. It has been said of the books of some of the popish 
 confessors that, by their descriptions of sin, they have taught men to 
 commit it; but the scripture conceals sinful art, that we may be 
 <I>simple concerning evil,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:9">Rom. xvi. 19</A>.

 4. The witch, upon sight of the apparition, was aware that her client
 was Saul, her familiar spirit, it is likely, informing her of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 "<I>Why hast thou deceived me</I> with a disguise; for thou art Saul,
 the very man that I am afraid of above any man?" Thus she gave Saul to 
 understand the power of her art, in that she could discover him through 
 his disguise; and yet she feared lest, hereafter, at least, he should 
 take advantage against her for what she was now doing. Had she believed 
 that it was really Samuel whom she saw, she would have had more reason 
 to be afraid of him, who was a good prophet, than of Saul, who was a 
 wicked king. But the wrath of earthly princes is feared by most more 
 than the wrath of the King of kings. 

 5. Saul (who, we may suppose, was kept at a distance in the next room)
 bade her not to be afraid of him, but go on with the operation, and 
 enquired <I>what she saw?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 <I>O,</I> says the woman, <I>I saw gods</I> (that is, a spirit)
 <I>ascending out of the earth;</I> they called angels <I>gods,</I> 
 because spiritual beings. Poor gods that ascend <I>out of the 
 earth!</I> But she speaks the language of the heathen, who had their 
 infernal deities and had them in veneration. If Saul had thought it 
 necessary to his conversation with Samuel that the body of Samuel 
 should be called out of the grave, he would have taken the witch with 
 him to Ramah, where his sepulchre was; but the design was wholly upon 
 his soul, which yet, if it became visible, was expected to appear in 
 the usual resemblance of the body; and God permitted the devil, to 
 answer the design, to put on Samuel's shape, that those who would not 
 <I>receive the love of the truth</I> might be <I>given up to strong 
 delusions and believe a lie.</I> That it could not be the soul of 
 Samuel himself they might easily apprehend when it <I>ascended out of 
 the earth,</I> for the <I>spirit of a man,</I> much more of a good man, 
 <I>goes upward,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:21">Eccl. iii. 21</A>.

 But, if people will be deceived, it is just with God to say, "Let them
 be deceived." That the devil, by the divine permission, should be able 
 to personate Samuel is not strange, since he can <I>transform himself 
 into an angel of light!</I> nor is it strange that he should be 
 permitted to do it upon this occasion, that Saul might be driven to 
 despair, by enquiring of the devil, since he would not, in a right 
 manner, enquire of the Lord, by which he might have had comfort. Saul, 
 being told of gods ascending, was eager to know what was the form of 
 this deity, and in what shape he appeared, so far was he from 
 conceiving any horror at it, his heart being wretchedly <I>hardened by 
 the deceitfulness of sin.</I> Saul, it seems, was not permitted to see 
 any manner of similitude himself, but he must take the woman's word for 
 it, that she saw <I>an old man covered with a mantle, or robe,</I> the 
 habit of a judge, which Samuel had sometimes worn, and some think it 
 was for the sake of that, and the majesty of its aspect, that she 
 called this apparition <I>Elohim, a god or gods;</I> for so magistrates 
 are styled,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:1">Ps. lxxxii. 1</A>.

 6. Saul, perceiving, by the woman's description, that it was Samuel,
 <I>stooped with his face to the ground,</I> either, as it is generally 
 taken, in reverence to Samuel, though he saw him not, or perhaps to 
 listen to that soft and muttering voice which he now expected to hear 
 (for those that had familiar spirits <I>peeped and muttered,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:19">Isa. viii. 19</A>);

 and it should seem Saul bowed himself (probably by the witch's
 direction) that he might hear what was whispered and listen carefully 
 to it; for the <I>voice of one that has a familiar spirit</I> is said 
 to come <I>out of the ground, and whisper out of the dust,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:4">Isa. xxix. 4</A>.

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to
 bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the
 Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and
 answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams:
 therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me
 what I shall do.
 &nbsp; 16 Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?
 &nbsp; 17 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy
 neighbour, <I>even</I> to David:
 &nbsp; 18 Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, nor
 executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 done this thing unto thee this day.
 &nbsp; 19 Moreover the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will also deliver Israel with thee into
 the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow <I>shalt</I> thou and thy
 sons <I>be</I> with me: the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> also shall deliver the host of Israel
 into the hand of the Philistines.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the conference between Saul and Satan. Saul came in 
 disguise 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 but Satan soon discovered him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Satan comes in disguise, in the disguise of Samuel's mantle, and Saul
 cannot discover him. Such is the disadvantage we labour under, in 
 wrestling with <I>the rulers of the darkness of this world,</I> that 
 they know us, while we are ignorant of their wiles and devices.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The spectre, or apparition, personating Samuel, asks why he is sent 
 for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>Why hast thou disquieted me to bring me up?</I> To us this discovers
 that it was an evil spirit that personated Samuel; for (as bishop 
 Patrick observes) it is not in the power of witches to disturb the rest 
 of good men and to bring them back into the world when they please; nor 
 would the true Samuel have acknowledged such a power in magical arts: 
 but to Saul this was a proper device of Satan's, to draw veneration 
 from him, to possess him with an opinion of the power of divination, 
 and so to rivet him in the devil's interests.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Saul makes his complaint to this counterfeit Samuel, mistaking him 
 for the true; and a most doleful complaint it is: "<I>I am sorely 
 distressed,</I> and know not what to do, <I>for the Philistines make 
 war against me;</I> yet I should do well enough with them if I had but 
 the tokens of God's presence with me; but, alas! <I>God has departed 
 from me.</I>" He complained not of God's withdrawings till he fell into 
 trouble, till the <I>Philistines made war against him,</I> and then he 
 began to lament God's departure. He that in his prosperity enquired not 
 after God in his adversity thought it hard that God answered him not, 
 nor took any notice of his enquiries, either by dreams or prophets, 
 neither gave answers immediately himself nor sent them by any of his 
 messengers. He does not, like a penitent, own the righteousness of God 
 in this; but, like a man enraged, flies out against God as unkind and 
 flies off from him: <I>Therefore I have called thee;</I> as if Samuel, 
 a servant of God, would favour those whom God frowned upon, or as if a 
 dead prophet could do him more service than the living ones. One would 
 think, from this, that he really desired to meet with the devil, and 
 expected no other (though under the covert of Samuel's name), for he 
 desires advice otherwise than from God, therefore from the devil, who 
 is a rival with God. "God denies me, <I>therefore I come to thee. 
 Flectere si nequeo superos, Acheronta movebo.</I>" --<I>If I fail with
 heaven, I will move hell.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. It is cold comfort which this evil spirit in Samuel's mantle gives 
 to Saul, and is manifestly intended to drive him to despair and 
 self-murder. Had it been the true Samuel, when Saul desired to be told 
 what he should do he would have told him to repent and make his peace 
 with God, and recall David from his banishment, and would then have 
 told him that he might hope in this way to find mercy with God; but, 
 instead of that, he represents his case as helpless and hopeless, 
 serving him as he did Judas, to whom he was first a tempter and then a 
 tormentor, persuading him first to sell his master and then to hang 
 himself. 
 
 1. He upbraids him with his present distress
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 tells him, not only that God had departed from him, but that he had
 become his enemy, and therefore he must expect no comfortable answer 
 from him: "<I>Wherefore dost thou ask me?</I> How can I be thy friend 
 when God is thy enemy, or thy counsellor when he has left thee?" 

 2. He upbraids him with the anointing of David to the kingdom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 
 He could not have touched upon a string that sounded more unpleasant in
 the ear of Saul than this. Nothing is said to reconcile him to David, 
 but all tends rather to exasperate him against David and widen the 
 breach. Yet, to make him believe that he was Samuel, the apparition 
 affirmed that it was God who spoke by him. The devil knows how to speak 
 with an air of religion, and can teach <I>false apostles to transform 
 themselves into the apostles of Christ</I> and imitate their language.  
 Those who use spells and charms, and plead, in defence of them, that 
 they find nothing in them but what is good, may remember what good 
 words the devil here spoke, and yet with what a malicious design. 

 3. He upbraids him with his disobedience to the command of God in not
 destroying the Amalekites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Satan had helped him to palliate and excuse that sin when Samuel was
 dealing with him to bring him to repentance, but now he aggravates it, 
 to make him despair of God's mercy. See what those get that hearken to 
 Satan's temptations. He himself will be their accuser, and insult over 
 them. And see whom those resemble that allure others to that which is 
 evil and reproach them for it when they have done.

 4. He foretels his approaching ruin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 (1.) That his army should be routed by the Philistines. This is twice
 mentioned: <I>The Lord shall deliver Israel into the hand of the 
 Philistines.</I> This he might foresee, by considering the superior 
 strength and number of the Philistines, the weakness of the armies of 
 Israel, Saul's terror, and especially God's departure from them. Yet, 
 to personate a prophet, he very gravely ascribes it once and again to 
 God: <I>The Lord shall do it.</I>

 (2.) That he and his sons should be slain in the battle:
 <I>To-morrow,</I> that is, in a little time (and, supposing that it was 
 now after midnight, I see not but it may be taken strictly for the very 
 next day after that which had now begun), <I>thou and thy sons shall be 
 with me,</I> that is, in the state of the dead, separate from the body.  
 Had this been the true Samuel, he could not have foretold the event 
 unless God had revealed it to him; and, though it were an evil spirit, 
 God might by him foretel it; as we read of an evil spirit that foresaw 
 Ahab's fall at Ramoth-Gilead and was instrumental in it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+22:20-23">1 Kings xxii. 20</A>,

 &c.), as perhaps this evil spirit was, by the divine permission, in 
 Saul's destruction. That evil spirit flattered Ahab, this frightened 
 Saul, and both that they might fall; so miserable are those that are 
 under the power of Satan; for, <I>whether he rage or laugh, there is no 
 rest,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+29:9">Prov. xxix. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was
 sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no
 strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all
 the night.
 &nbsp; 21 And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore
 troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed
 thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened
 unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.
 &nbsp; 22 Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice
 of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee;
 and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy
 way.
 &nbsp; 23 But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants,
 together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto
 their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.
 &nbsp; 24 And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted,
 and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded <I>it,</I> and did bake
 unleavened bread thereof:
 &nbsp; 25 And she brought <I>it</I> before Saul, and before his servants;
 and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.
 </FONT></P>
 

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here told how Saul received this terrible message from the ghost 
 he consulted. He desired to be told <I>what he should do</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),
 
 but was only told what he had not done and what should be done to him.
 Those that expect any good counsel or comfort otherwise than from God, 
 and in the way of his institutions, will be as wretchedly disappointed 
 as Saul here was.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How he sunk under the load, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 He was indeed unfit to bear it, having <I>eaten nothing all the day</I>
 before, nor <I>that night.</I> He came fasting from the camp, and 
 continued fasting; not for want of food, but for want of an appetite. 
 The fear he was in of the power of the Philistines

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 took away his appetite, or perhaps the struggle he had with his own
 conscience, after he had entertained the thought of consulting the 
 witch, made him to nauseate even his necessary food, though ever so 
 dainty. This made him an easy prey to this fresh terror that now came 
 upon him like an armed man. <I>He fell all along on the earth,</I> as 
 if the archers of the Philistines had already hit him, <I>and there was 
 no strength in him</I> to bear up against these heavy tidings. Now he 
 had enough of consulting witches, and found them miserable comforters. 
 When God in his word speaks terror to sinners he opens to them, at the 
 same time, a door of hope if they repent: but those that apply to the 
 gates of hell for succour must there expect darkness without any 
 glimpse of light.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. With what difficulty he was persuaded to take so much relief as was 
 necessary to carry him back to his post in the camp. The witch, it 
 should seem, had left Saul alone with the spectre, to have his talk 
 with him by himself; but perhaps hearing him fall and groan, and 
 perceiving him to be in great agony, she came to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 and was very importunate with him to take some refreshment, that he
 might be able to get clear from her house, fearing that if he should be 
 ill, especially if he should die there, she should be punished for it 
 as a traitor, though she had escaped punishment as a witch. This, it is 
 probable, rather than any sentiment of kindness, made her solicitous to 
 help him. But what a deplorable condition had he brought himself to 
 when he needed so wretched a comforter! 

 1. She showed herself very importunate with him to take some
 refreshment. She pleaded

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>)

 that she had obeyed his voice to the endangering of her life, and why
 therefore should not he hearken to her voice for the relieving of his 
 life? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 She had a fat calf at hand (and the word signifies one that was made
 use of in treading out the corn, and therefore could the worse be 
 spared); this she prepared for his entertainment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Josephus is large in applauding the extraordinary courtesy and
 liberality of this woman, and recommending what she did as an example 
 of compassion to the distressed, and readiness to communicate for their 
 relief, though we have no prospect of being recompensed.

 2. He showed himself very averse to it: <I>He refused, and said, I will
 not eat</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 choosing rather to die obscurely by famine than honourably by the
 sword. Had he laboured only under a defect of animal spirits, food 
 might have helped him; but, alas! his case was out of the reach of such 
 succours. What are dainty meats to a wounded conscience? <I>As vinegar 
 upon nitre, so is he that sings songs to a heavy heart,</I> so 
 disagreeable and unwelcome. 

 3. The woman at length, with the help of his servants, overpersuaded
 him, against his inclination and resolution, to take some refreshment. 
 Not by force, but by friendly advice, they <I>compelled him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 and of no other than such a rational and courteous compulsion are we to
 understand that in the parable, <I>Compel them to come in,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:23">Luke xiv. 23</A>.

 <I>How forcible are right words,</I> when men are pressed by them to
 that which is for their own interest! 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:25">Job vi. 25</A>.

 Saul was somewhat revived with this entertainment; so that he and his
 servants, when they had eaten, <I>rose up and went away</I> before it 
 was light

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),
 
 that they might hasten to their business and that they might not be
 seen to come out of such a scandalous house. Josephus here much admires 
 the bravery and magnanimity of Saul, that, though he was assured he 
 should lose both his life and honour, yet he would not desert his army, 
 but resolutely returned to the camp, and stood ready for an engagement. 
 I wonder more at the hardness of his heart, that he did not again apply 
 to God by repentance and prayer, in hopes yet to obtain at least a 
 reprieve; but he desperately ran headlong upon his own ruin. Perhaps, 
 indeed, now that rage and envy possessed him to the uttermost, he was 
 the better reconciled to his hard fate, being told that his sons, and 
 Jonathan among the rest, whom he hated for his affection to David, 
 should die with him. If he must fall, he cared not what desolations of 
 his family and kingdom accompanied his fall, hoping it would be the 
 worse for his successor.  <B><I>Emou thanontos gaia michtheto 
 pyri.</I></B>--<I>I care not if, when I am dead, the world should be 
 set on fire.</I> He begged not, as David, "Let thy hand be against me, 
 but not against thy people."</P>
