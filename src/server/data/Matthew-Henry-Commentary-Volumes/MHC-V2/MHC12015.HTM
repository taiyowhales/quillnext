 In this chapter, 

 I. The history of two of the kings of Judah is briefly recorded:--

 1. Of Azariah, or Uzziah,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 2. Of Jotham his son, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:32-38">ver. 32-38</A>.

 II. The history of many of the kings of Israel that reigned at the same
 time is given us in short, five in succession, all of whom, except one, 
 went down slain to the pit, and their murders were their successors. 

 1.  Zachariah, the last of the house of Jehu, reigned six months, and
 then was slain and succeeded by Shallum,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:8-12">ver. 8-12</A>.

 2.  Shallum reigned one month, and then was slain and succeeded by
 Menahem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:13-15">ver. 13-15</A>.

 3.  Menahem reigned ten years, or tyrannised rather, such were his
 barbarous cruelties 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:16">ver. 16</A>)

 and unreasonable exactions

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:20">ver. 20</A>),

 and then died in his bed, and left his son to succeed him first, and
 then suffer for him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:16-22">ver. 16-22</A>.

 4.  Pekahiah reigned two years, and then was slain and succeeded by
 Pekah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:23-26">ver. 23-26</A>.

 5. Pekah reigned twenty years, and then was slain and succeeded by
 Hoshea, the last of all the kings of Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:27-31">ver. 27-31</A>)

 for things were now working and hastening apace towards the final
 destruction of that kingdom.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel
 began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign.
 &nbsp; 2 Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he
 reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name
 <I>was</I> Jecholiah of Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 3 And he did <I>that which was</I> right in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 according to all that his father Amaziah had done;
 &nbsp; 4 Save that the high places were not removed: the people
 sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places.
 &nbsp; 5 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the
 day of his death, and dwelt in a several house. And Jotham the
 king's son <I>was</I> over the house, judging the people of the land.
 &nbsp; 6 And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did,
 <I>are</I> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
 of Judah?
 &nbsp; 7 So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with
 his fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned in
 his stead.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is a short account of the reign of Azariah. 

 1. Most of it is general, and the same that has been given of others;
 he began young and reigned long

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 did, for the most part, that which was right, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>

 (it was happy for the kingdom that a good reign was a long one), only
 he had not zeal and courage enough to take away the high places,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 2. That which is peculiar, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>

 (that God smote him with a leprosy) is more largely related, with the
 occasion of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+26:16-21">2 Chron. xxvi. 16</A>,

 &c., where we have also a fuller account of the glories of the former
 part of his reign, as well as of the disgraces of the latter part of 
 it. He did that which was right, as Amaziah had done; like him, he 
 began well, but failed before he finished. Here we are told, 

 (1.) That he was a leper.  The greatest of men are not only subject to 
 the common calamities, but also to the common infirmities, of human 
 nature; and, if they be guilty of any heinous sin, they lie as open as 
 the meanest to the most grievous strokes of divine vengeance. 

 (2.) God smote him with this leprosy, to chastise him for his 
 presumptuous invasion of the priests' office. If great men be proud 
 men, some way or other God will humble them, and make them know he is 
 both above them and against them, for he resisteth the proud. 

 (3.) That he was a leper <I>to the day of his death.</I> Though we have 
 reason to think he repented and the sin was pardoned, yet, for warning 
 to others, he was continued under this mark of God's displeasure as 
 long as he lived, and perhaps it was for the good of his soul that he 
 was so. 

 (4.) That he <I>dwelt in a separate house,</I> as being made 
 ceremonially unclean by the law, to the discipline of which, though a 
 king, he must submit. He that presumptuously intruded into God's 
 temple, and pretended to be a priest, was justly shut out from his own 
 palace, and shut up as a prisoner or recluse, ever after. We suppose 
 that his <I>separate house</I> was made as convenient and agreeable as 
 might be.  Some translate it a <I>free house,</I> where he had liberty 
 to take his pleasure. However, it was a great mortification to one that 
 had been so much a man of honour, and a man of business, as he had 
 been, to be cut off from society and dwell always in a <I>separate 
 house:</I> it would almost make life itself a burden, even to kings, 
 though they have never any to converse with but their inferiors; the 
 most contemplative men would soon be weary of it. 

 (5.) That his son was his viceroy in the affairs both of his court (for 
 <I>he was over the house</I>) and of his kingdom (for he was <I>judging 
 the people of the land</I>); and it was both a comfort to him and a 
 blessing to his kingdom that he had such a son to fill up his room.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8 In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did
 Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six
 months.
 &nbsp; 9 And he did <I>that which was</I> evil in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, as
 his fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam
 the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
 &nbsp; 10 And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and
 smote him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his
 stead.
 &nbsp; 11 And the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold, they <I>are</I>
 written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
 &nbsp; 12 This <I>was</I> the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> which he spake unto Jehu,
 saying, Thy sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the
 fourth <I>generation.</I> And so it came to pass.
 &nbsp; 13 Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and
 thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full
 month in Samaria.
 &nbsp; 14 For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to
 Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew
 him, and reigned in his stead.
 &nbsp; 15 And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy
 which he made, behold, they <I>are</I> written in the book of the
 chronicles of the kings of Israel.
 &nbsp; 16 Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that <I>were</I> therein, and
 the coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not <I>to him,</I>
 therefore he smote <I>it; and</I> all the women therein that were with
 child he ripped up.
 &nbsp; 17 In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah
 began Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, <I>and reigned</I>
 ten years in Samaria.
 &nbsp; 18 And he did <I>that which was</I> evil in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 he departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of
 Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
 &nbsp; 19 <I>And</I> Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and
 Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand
 might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.
 &nbsp; 20 And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, <I>even</I> of all the
 mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to
 give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back,
 and stayed not there in the land.
 &nbsp; 21 And the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did,
 <I>are</I> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
 of Israel?
 &nbsp; 22 And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son
 reigned in his stead.
 &nbsp; 23 In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the
 son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, <I>and
 reigned</I> two years.
 &nbsp; 24 And he did <I>that which was</I> evil in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who
 made Israel to sin.
 &nbsp; 25 But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired
 against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the
 king's house, with Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of the
 Gileadites: and he killed him, and reigned in his room.
 &nbsp; 26 And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did,
 behold, they <I>are</I> written in the book of the chronicles of the
 kings of Israel.
 &nbsp; 27 In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah
 the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, <I>and
 reigned</I> twenty years.
 &nbsp; 28 And he did <I>that which was</I> evil in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who
 made Israel to sin.
 &nbsp; 29 In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglath-pileser king
 of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abel-beth-maachah, and Janoah, and
 Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of
 Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.
 &nbsp; 30 And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah
 the son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in
 his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.
 &nbsp; 31 And the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did,
 behold, they <I>are</I> written in the book of the chronicles of the
 kings of Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The best days of the kingdom of Israel were while the government was in 
 Jehu's family. In his reign, and the next three reigns, though there 
 were many abominable corruptions and miserable grievances in Israel, 
 yet the crown went in succession, the kings died in their beds, and 
 some care was taken of public affairs; but, now that those days are at 
 an end, the history which we have in these verses of about thirty-three 
 years represents the affairs of that kingdom in the utmost confusion 
 imaginable. Woe to those that were with child 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 and to those that gave suck in those days, for then must needs be great 
 tribulations, when, for <I>the transgression of the land, many were the 
 princes thereof.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Let us observe something, in general, concerning these unhappy
 revolutions and the calamities which must needs attend them--these bad
 times, as they may truly be called. 

 1. God had tried the people of Israel both with judgments and mercies,
 explained and enforced by his servants the prophets, and yet they
 continued impenitent and unreformed, and therefore God justly brought
 these miseries upon them, as Moses had warned them. If you will yet
 <I>walk contrary to me, I will punish you yet seven times more,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:21-26">Lev. xxvi. 21</A>,

 &c.

 2. God made good his promise to Jehu, that his sons to the fourth
 generation after him should sit upon the throne of Israel, which was a
 greater favour than was shown to any of the royal families either 
 before or after his.  God had said it should be so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:30"><I>ch.</I> x. 30</A>)

 and we are told in this chapter 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>)

 that so it came to pass. See how punctual God is to his promises. These 
 calamities God long designed for Israel, and they deserved them, yet 
 they were not inflicted till that word had taken effect to the full. 
 Thus God rewarded Jehu for his zeal in destroying the worship of Baal 
 and the house of Ahab; and yet, when the measure of the sins of the 
 house of Jehu was full, God avenged upon it the blood then shed, called 
 <I>the blood of Jezreel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:4">Hos. i. 4</A>.

 3. All these kings did that which was <I>evil in the sight of the
 Lord,</I> for <I>they walked in the sins of Jeroboam the son of 
 Nebat.</I> Though at variance with one another, yet in this they 
 agreed, to keep up idolatry, and the people loved to have it so; though 
 they were emptied from vessel to vessel, that <I>taste remained in 
 them,</I> and <I>that scent was not changed.</I> It was sad indeed when 
 their government was so often altered, yet never for the better--that 
 among all those contending interests none of them should think it as 
 much their interest to destroy the calves as others had done to support 
 them. 

 4.  Each of these (except one) conspired against his predecessor, and 
 slew him--<I>Shallum, Menahem, Pekah,</I> and <I>Hoshea,</I> all 
 traitors and murderers, and yet all kings awhile, one of them ten, 
 another twenty, and another nine years; for God may suffer wickedness 
 to prosper and to carry away the wealth and honours awhile, but, sooner 
 or later, blood shall have blood, and he that dealt treacherously shalt 
 be dealt treacherously with. One wicked man is often made a scourge to 
 another, and every wicked man, at length, a ruin to himself. 

 5. The ambition of the great men made the nation miserable. Here is
 Tiphsah, a city of Israel, barbarously destroyed, with all the coasts 
 thereof, by one of these pretenders

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 and no doubt it was through blood that each of them waded to the 
 throne, nor could any of these kings perish alone.  No land can have 
 greater pests, nor Israel worse troubles, than such men as care not how 
 much the welfare and repose of their country are sacrificed to their 
 revenge and affectation of dominion. 

 6. While the nation was thus shattered by divisions at home the kings 
 of Assyria, first one

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>)
 
 and then another 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 came against it and did what they pleased.  Nothing does more towards 
 the making of a nation an easy prey to a common enemy than intestine 
 broils and contests for the sovereignty.  Happy the land where that is 
 settled. 

 7. This was the condition of Israel just before they were quite ruined
 and carried away captive, for that was in the ninth year of Hoshea, the 
 last of these usurpers. If they had, in these days of confusion and 
 perplexity, humbled themselves before God and sought his face, that 
 final destruction might have been prevented; but when God judgeth he 
 will overcome. These factions, the fruit of an evil spirit sent among 
 them, hastened that captivity, for a kingdom thus divided against 
 itself will soon come to desolation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Let us take a short view of the particular reigns.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Zachariah, the son of Jeroboam, began to reign in the thirty-eighth 
 year of Azariah, or Uzziah, king of Judah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Some of the most critical chronologers reckon that between Jeroboam and
 his son Zachariah the throne was vacant twenty-two years, others eleven 
 years, through the disturbances and dissensions that were in the 
 kingdom; and then it was not strange that Zachariah was deposed before 
 he was well seated on the throne: he reigned but six months, and then 
 Shallum <I>slew him before the people,</I> perhaps as Caesar was slain 
 in the senate, or he put him to death publicly as a criminal, with the 
 approbation of the people, to whom he had, some way or other, made 
 himself odious; so ended the line of Jehu.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. But had Shallum peace, who slew his master? No, he had not 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),
 
 one month of days measured his reign and then he was cut off; perhaps 
 to this the prophet, who then lived, refers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:7">Hos. v. 7</A>),

 <I>Now shall a month devour them with their portions.</I> That dominion
 seldom lasts long which is founded in blood and falsehood. Menahem, 
 either provoked by his crime or animated by his example, soon served 
 him as he had served his master--<I>slew him and reigned in his 
 stead,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Probably he was general in the army, which then lay encamped at Tirzah,
 and, hearing of Shallum's treason and usurpation, hastened to punish 
 it, as Omri did that of Zimri in a like case,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+16:17">1 Kings xvi. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Menahem held the kingdom ten years, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 But, whereas we have heard that the <I>kings of the house of Israel
 were merciful kings</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:31">1 Kings xx. 31</A>),

 this Menahem (the scandal of his country) was so prodigiously cruel to
 those of his own nation who hesitated a little at submitting to him 
 that he not only ruined a city, and the coasts thereof, but, forgetting 
 that he himself was born of a woman, <I>ripped up all the women with 
 child,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 We may well wonder that ever it should enter into the heart of any man
 to be so barbarous, and to be so perfectly lost to humanity itself. By 
 these cruel methods he hoped to strengthen himself and to frighten all 
 others into his interests; but it seems he did not gain his point, for 
 when the king of Assyria came against him,

 (1.) So little confidence had he in his people that he durst not meet 
 him as an enemy, but was obliged, at a vast expense, to purchase a 
 peace with him. 

 (2.) Such need had he of help <I>to confirm the kingdom in his hand</I> 
 that he made it part of his bargain with him (a bargain which, no 
 doubt, the king of Assyria knew how to make a good hand of another 
 time) that he should assist him against his own subjects that were 
 disaffected to him. The money wherewith he purchased his friendship was 
 a vast sum, no less than 1000 talents of silver

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 which Menahem exacted, it is probable, by military execution, <I>of all 
 the mighty men of wealth,</I> very considerately sparing the poor, and 
 laying the burden (as was fit) on those that were best able to bear it; 
 being raised, it was given <I>to the king of Assyria,</I> as pay for 
 his army, fifty shekels of silver for each man in it. Thus he got clear 
 of the king of Assyria for this time; he staid not to quarter in the 
 land 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 but his army now got so rich a booty with so little trouble that it 
 encouraged them to come again, not long after, when they laid all 
 waste. Thus was <I>he</I> the betrayer of his country that should have 
 been the protector of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Pekahiah, the son of Menahem, succeeded his father, but reigned only 
 two years, and then was treacherously slain by Pekah, falling under the 
 load both of his own and of his father's wickedness. It is repeated 
 concerning him as before that he <I>departed not from the sins of 
 Jeroboam.</I> Still this is mentioned, to show that God was righteous 
 in bringing that destruction upon them which came not long after, 
 because they hated to be reformed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Pekah, it seems, had some persons of figure in his interest, two of
 whom are here named

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 and with their help he compassed his design.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Pekah, though he got the kingdom by treason, kept it twenty years 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 so long it was before his violent dealing returned upon his own head, 
 but it returned at last. This Pekah, son of Remaliah, 

 (1.) Made himself more considerable abroad than any of these usurpers, 
 for he was, even in the latter end of his time (in the reign of Ahaz, 
 which began in his seventeenth year), a great terror to the kingdom of 
 Judah, as we find,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:1-25">Isa. vii. 1</A>,

 &c.

 (2.) He lost a great part of his kingdom to the king of Assyria.
 Several cities are here named 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>)

 which were taken from him, all the land of Gilead on the other side 
 Jordan, and Galilee in the north containing the tribes of Naphtali and 
 Zebulon, were seized, and the inhabitants carried captive into Assyria.  
 By this judgment God punished him for his attempt upon Judah and 
 Jerusalem. It was then foretold that within two or three years after he 
 made that attempt, before a child, then born, should be able to cry 
 <I>My father and my mother,</I> the riches of Samaria should be 
 <I>taken away before the king of Assyria</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:4">Isa. viii. 4</A>),

 and here we have the accomplishment of that prediction.

 (3.) Soon after this he forfeited his life to the resentments of his 
 countrymen, who, it is probable, were disgusted at him for leaving them 
 exposed to a foreign enemy, while he was invading Judah, of which 
 Hoshea took advantage and, to gain his crown, seized his life, <I>slew 
 him, and reigned in his stead.</I> Surely he was fond of a crown indeed 
 who, at this time, would run such a hazard as a traitor did; for the 
 crown of Israel, now that it had lost the choicest of its flowers and 
 jewels, was lined more than ever with thorns, had of late been fatal to 
 all the heads that had worn it, was forfeited to divine justice, and 
 now ready to be laid in the dust--a crown which a wise man would not 
 have taken up in the street, yet Hoshea not only ventured <I>upon</I> 
 it but ventured <I>for</I> it, and it cost him dear.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>32 In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of
 Israel began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign.
 &nbsp; 33 Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and
 he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name
 <I>was</I> Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok.
 &nbsp; 34 And he did <I>that which was</I> right in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.
 &nbsp; 35 Howbeit the high places were not removed: the people
 sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places. He built
 the higher gate of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 36 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did,
 <I>are</I> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
 of Judah?
 &nbsp; 37 In those days the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> began to send against Judah Rezin the
 king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah.
 &nbsp; 38 And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
 fathers in the city of David his father: and Ahaz his son reigned
 in his stead.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a short account of the reign of Jotham king of Judah, of 
 whom we are told, 

 1. That he reigned very well, <I>did that which was right in the sight
 of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 Josephus gives him a very high character, stating that he was pious
 towards God, just towards men, and laid out himself for the public 
 good,--that, whatever was amiss, he took care to have it 
 rectified,--and, in short, wanted no virtue that became a good prince. 
 Though the high places were not taken away, yet to draw people from 
 them, and keep them close to God's holy place, he showed great respect 
 to the temple, and built the higher gate which he went through to the 
 temple. If magistrates cannot do all they would for the suppressing of 
 vice and profaneness, let them do so much the more for the support and 
 advancement of piety and virtue, and the bringing of them into 
 reputation. If they cannot pull down the high places of sin, yet let 
 them build and beautify the high gate of God's house.

 2. That he died in the midst of his days, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 Of most of the kings of Judah we are told how old they were when they
 began their reign, and by that may compute how old they were when they 
 died; but no account is kept of the <I>age</I> of any of the kings of 
 Israel that I remember, only of the years of their <I>reigns.</I> This 
 honour God would put upon the kings of the house of David above those 
 of other families. And by these accounts it appears that there was none 
 of all the kings of Judah that reached David's age, seventy, the common 
 age of man. Asa's age I do not find. Uzziah lived to be sixty-eight, 
 Manasseh sixty-seven, and Jehoshaphat sixty; and these were the three 
 oldest; many of those that were of note did not reach fifty. This 
 Jotham died at forty-one. He was too great a blessing to be continued 
 long to such an unworthy people.  His death was a judgment, especially 
 considering the character of his son and successor.

 3. That in his days the confederacy was formed against Judah by Rezin
 and Remaliah's son, the king of Syria and the king of Israel, which 
 appeared so very formidable in the beginning of the reign of Ahaz that, 
 upon notice of it, the heart of that prince was moved and <I>the heart 
 of the people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:2">Isa. vii. 2</A>.

 The confederates were unjust in the attempt, yet it is here said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>),
 
 <I>The Lord began to send them against Judah,</I> as he bade Shimei 
 curse David, and took away from Job what the Sabeans robbed him of. Men
 are God's hand--the sword, the rod in his hand--which he makes use of as
 he pleases to serve his own righteous counsels, though men be
 unrighteous in their intentions. This storm gathered in the reign of
 pious Jotham, but he came to his grave in peace and it fell upon his
 degenerate son.</P>
