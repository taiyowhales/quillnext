 David is the man whom God now delights to honour, for he is a man after
 his own heart. We read in the foregoing chapter how, after he was
 anointed, Providence made him famous in the court; we read in this
 chapter how Providence made him much more famous in the camp, and, by
 both, not only marked him for a great man, but fitted him for the
 throne for which he was designed. In the court he was only Saul's
 physician; but in the camp Israel's champion; there he fairly fought,
 and beat Goliath of Gath. In the story observe, 

 I. What a noble figure Goliath made, and how daringly he challenged the
 armies of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:1-11">ver.  1-11</A>.

 II. What a mean figure David made, when Providence brought him to the
 army, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:12-30">ver. 12-30</A>.

 III. The unparalleled bravery wherewith David undertook to encounter
 this Philistine, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:31-39">ver. 31-39</A>.

 IV. The pious resolution with which he attacked him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:40-47">ver. 40-47</A>.

 V. The glorious victory he obtained over him with a sling and a stone,
 and the advantage which the Israelites thereby gained against the 
 Philistines, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:48-54">ver. 48-54</A>.

 VI. The great notice which was hereupon taken of David at court, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:55-58">ver. 55-58</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle,
 and were gathered together at Shochoh, which <I>belongeth</I> to
 Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.
 &nbsp; 2 And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and
 pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array
 against the Philistines.
 &nbsp; 3 And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and
 Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and <I>there was</I> a
 valley between them.
 &nbsp; 4 And there went out a champion out of the camp of the
 Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height <I>was</I> six
 cubits and a span.
 &nbsp; 5 And <I>he had</I> a helmet of brass upon his head, and he <I>was</I>
 armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat <I>was</I> five
 thousand shekels of brass.
 &nbsp; 6 And <I>he had</I> greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of
 brass between his shoulders.
 &nbsp; 7 And the staff of his spear <I>was</I> like a weaver's beam; and
 his spear's head <I>weighed</I> six hundred shekels of iron: and one
 bearing a shield went before him.
 &nbsp; 8 And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said
 unto them, Why are ye come out to set <I>your</I> battle in array?
 <I>am</I> not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a
 man for you, and let him come down to me.
 &nbsp; 9 If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we
 be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him,
 then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.
 &nbsp; 10 And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this
 day; give me a man, that we may fight together.
 &nbsp; 11 When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the
 Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It was not long ago that the Philistines were soundly beaten, and put 
 to the worse, before Israel, and they would have been totally routed if 
 Saul's rashness had not prevented; but here we have them making head 
 again.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How they <I>defied Israel with their armies,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 They made a descent upon the Israelites' country, and possessed
 themselves, as it should seem, of some part of it, for they encamped in 
 a place <I>which belonged to Judah.</I> Israel's ground would never 
 have been footing for Philistine-armies if Israel had been faithful to 
 their God. The Philistines (it is probable) had heard that Samuel had 
 fallen out with Saul and forsaken him, and no longer assisted and 
 advised him, and that Saul had grown melancholy and unfit for business, 
 and this news encouraged them to make this attempt for the retrieving 
 of the credit they had lately lost. The enemies of the church are 
 watchful to take all advantages, and they never have greater advantages 
 than when her protectors have provoked God's Spirit and prophets to 
 leave them. Saul mustered his forces, and faced them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 And here we must take notice,

 1. That the evil spirit, for the present, had left Saul,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+16:23"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 23</A>.

 David's harp having given him some relief, perhaps the alarms and
 affairs of the war prevented the return of the distemper. Business is a 
 good antidote against melancholy. Let the mind have something without 
 to fasten on and employ itself about, and it will be the less in danger 
 of preying upon itself. God, in mercy to Israel, suspended the judgment 
 for a while; for how distracted must the affairs of the public have 
 been if at this juncture the prince had been distracted! 

 2.  That David for the present had returned to Bethlehem, and had left
 the court, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 When Saul had no further occasion to use him for the relief of his
 distemper, though, being anointed, he had a very good private reason, 
 and, having a grant of the place of Saul's armour-bearer, he had a very 
 plausible pretence to have continued his attendance, as a retainer to 
 the court, yet he went home to Bethlehem, and returned to keep his 
 father's sheep; this was a rare instance, in a young man that stood so 
 fair for preferment, of humility and affection to his parents. He knew 
 better than most do how to come down again after he had begun to rise, 
 and strangely preferred the retirements of the pastoral life before all 
 the pleasures and gaieties of the court.  None more fit for honour than 
 he, nor that deserved it better, and yet none more dead to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How they defied Israel with their champion Goliath, whom they were 
 almost as proud of as he was of himself, hoping by him to recover their 
 reputation and dominion. Perhaps the army of the Israelites was 
 superior in number and strength to that of the Philistines, which made 
 the Philistines decline a battle, and stand at bay with them, desiring 
 rather to put the issue upon a single combat, in which, having such a 
 champion, they hoped to gain the victory. Now concerning this champion 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His prodigious size. He was of the sons of Anak, who at Gath kept 
 their ground in Joshua's time 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+11:22">Josh. xi. 22</A>),

 and kept up a race of giants there, of which Goliath was one, and, it
 is probable, one of the largest. He was in height <I>six cubits and a 
 span,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 They learned bishop Cumberland has made it out that the scripture-cubit
 was above twenty-one inches (above three inches more than our 
 half-yard) and a span was half a cubit, by which computation Goliath 
 wanted but eight inches of four yard in height, eleven feet and four 
 inches, a monstrous stature, and which made him very formidable, 
 especially if he had strength and spirit proportionable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His armour. Art, as well as nature, made him terrible. He was well 
 furnished with defensive armour 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>):

 <I>A helmet of brass on his head, a coat of mail,</I> made of brass
 plates laid over one another, like the scales of a fish; and, because 
 his legs would lie most within the reach of an ordinary man, he wore 
 brass boots, and had a large corselet of brass about his neck. The coat 
 is said to weigh 5000 shekels, and a shekel was half an ounce 
 avoirdupois, a vast weight for a man to carry, all the other parts of 
 his armour being proportionable.  But some think it should be 
 translated, not the <I>weight</I> of the coat, but the <I>value</I> of 
 it, was 5000 shekels; so much it cost.  His offensive weapons were 
 extraordinary, of which his spear only is here described, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 It was like a weaver's beam. His arm could manage that which an
 ordinary man could scarcely heave. His shield only, which was the 
 lightest of all his accoutrements, was carried before him by his 
 esquire, probably for state; for he that was clad in brass little 
 needed a shield.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. His challenge. The Philistines having chosen him for their champion, 
 to save themselves from the hazard of battle, he here throws down the 
 gauntlet, and bids defiance to the armies of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:8-10"><I>v.</I> 8-10</A>.

 He came into the valley that lay between the camps, and, his voice
 probably being as much stronger than other people's as his arm was, he 
 cried so as to make them all hear him, <I>Give me a man, that we may 
 fight together.</I> He looked upon himself with admiration, because he 
 was so much taller and stronger than all about him; his heart (says 
 bishop Hall) nothing but a lump of proud flesh. He looked upon Israel 
 with disdain, because they had none among them of such a monstrous 
 bulk, and defies them to find a man among them bold enough to enter the 
 list with him.

 (1.) He upbraids them with their folly in drawing an army together: 
 "<I>Why have you come to set the battle in array?</I> How dare you 
 oppose the mighty Philistines?" Or, "Why should the two armies engage, 
 when the controversy may be sooner decided, with only the expense of 
 one life and the hazard of another?" 

 (2.) He offers to put the war entirely upon the issue of the duel he 
 proposes: "If your champion kill me, we will be your servants; if I 
 kill him, you shall be ours." This, says bishop Patrick, was only a 
 bravado, for no nation would be willing thus to venture its all upon 
 the success of one man, nor is it justifiable; notwithstanding 
 Goliath's stipulation here, when he was killed the Philistines did not 
 stand to his word, nor submit themselves as servants to Israel. When he 
 boasts, <I>I am a Philistine, and you are servants to Saul,</I> he 
 would have it thought a great piece of condescension in him, who was a 
 chief ruler, to enter the lists with an Israelite; for he looked on 
 them as no better than slaves. The Chaldee paraphrase brings him in 
 boasting that he was the man that had killed Hophni and Phinehas and 
 taken the ark prisoner, but that the Philistines had never given him so 
 much as the command of a regiment in recompence of his services, 
 whereas Saul had been made king for his services: "Let him therefore 
 take up the challenge."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The terror this struck upon Israel: <I>Saul and his army were 
 greatly afraid,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 The people would not have been dismayed but that they observed Saul's
 courage failed him; and it is not to be expected that, if the leader be 
 a coward, the followers should be bold.  We found before, when the 
 Spirit of the Lord came upon Saul

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:6"><I>ch.</I> xi. 6</A>),
 
 none could be more daring nor forward to answer the challenge of Nahash
 the Ammonite, but now that the <I>Spirit of the Lord had departed from 
 him</I> even the big looks and big words of a single Philistine make 
 him change colour. But where was Jonathan all this while? Why did not 
 he accept the challenge, who, in the last war, had so bravely engaged a 
 whole army of Philistines? Doubtless he did not feel himself stirred up 
 of God to it, as he did in the former case. As the best, so the bravest 
 men, are no more than what God makes them. Jonathan must now sit still, 
 because the honour of engaging Goliath is reserved for David. In great 
 and good actions, the wind of the Spirit blows when and where he 
 listeth. Now the pious Israelites lament their king's breach with 
 Samuel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  Now David <I>was</I> the son of that Ephrathite of
 Bethlehem-judah, whose name <I>was</I> Jesse; and he had eight sons:
 and the man went among men <I>for</I> an old man in the days of Saul.
 &nbsp; 13 And the three eldest sons of Jesse went <I>and</I> followed Saul
 to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the
 battle <I>were</I> Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab,
 and the third Shammah.
 &nbsp; 14 And David <I>was</I> the youngest: and the three eldest followed
 Saul.
 &nbsp; 15 But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's
 sheep at Bethlehem.
 &nbsp; 16 And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and
 presented himself forty days.
 &nbsp; 17 And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren
 an ephah of this parched <I>corn,</I> and these ten loaves, and run to
 the camp to thy brethren;
 &nbsp; 18 And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of <I>their</I>
 thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.
 &nbsp; 19 Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, <I>were</I> in the
 valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
 &nbsp; 20 And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep
 with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him;
 and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the
 fight, and shouted for the battle.
 &nbsp; 21 For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array,
 army against army.
 &nbsp; 22 And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the
 carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his
 brethren.
 &nbsp; 23 And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the
 champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the
 armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words:
 and David heard <I>them.</I>
 &nbsp; 24 And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from
 him, and were sore afraid.
 &nbsp; 25 And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is
 come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be,
 <I>that</I> the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with
 great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his
 father's house free in Israel.
 &nbsp; 26 And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What
 shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh
 away the reproach from Israel? for who <I>is</I> this uncircumcised
 Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?
 &nbsp; 27 And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So
 shall it be done to the man that killeth him.
 &nbsp; 28 And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the
 men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said,
 Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those
 few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the
 naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou
 mightest see the battle.
 &nbsp; 29 And David said, What have I now done? <I>Is there</I> not a
 cause?
 &nbsp; 30 And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the
 same manner: and the people answered him again after the former
 manner.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Forty days the two armies lay encamped facing one another, each 
 advantageously posted, but neither forward to engage. Either they were 
 parleying and treating of an accommodation or they were waiting for 
 recruits; and perhaps there were frequent skirmishes between small 
 detached parties. All this while, twice a day, morning and evening, did 
 the insulting champion appear in the field and repeat his challenge, 
 his own heart growing more and more proud for his not being answered 
 and the people of Israel more and more timorous, while God designed 
 hereby to ripen him for destruction and to make Israel's deliverance 
 the more illustrious. All this while David is keeping his father's 
 sheep, but at the end of forty days Providence brings him to the field 
 to win and wear the laurel which no other Israelite dares venture for. 
 We have in these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The present state of his family. His father was old 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>He went among men for an old man,</I> was taken notice of for his
 great age, above what was usual at that time, and therefore was excused 
 from pubic services, and went not in person to the wars, but sent his 
 sons; he had the honours paid him that were due his age, his hoary head 
 was a crown of glory to him. David's three elder brethren, who perhaps 
 envied his place at the court, got their father to send for him home, 
 and let them go to the camp, where they hoped to signalize themselves 
 and eclipse him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>),

 while David himself was so far from being proud of the services he had
 done his prince, or ambitious of further preferment, that he not only 
 returned from court to the obscurity of his father's house, but to 
 care, and toil, and (as it proved,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>)
 
 the peril, of <I>keeping his father's sheep.</I> It was the praise of
 this humility that it came after he had the honour of a courtier, and 
 the reward of it that it came before the honour of a conqueror. 
 <I>Before honour is humility.</I> Now he had that opportunity of 
 mediation and prayer, and other acts of devotion, which fitted him for 
 what he was destined to more than all the military exercises of that 
 inglorious camp could do.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The orders his father gave him to go and visit his brethren in the 
 camp. He did not himself ask leave to go, to satisfy his curiosity, or 
 to gain experience and make observations; but his father sent him on a 
 mean and homely errand, on which any of his servants might have gone. 
 He must carry some bread and cheese to his brethren, ten loaves with 
 some parched corn for themselves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>)

 and ten cheeses (which, it seems, he thought too good for them) for a
 present to their colonel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 David must still be the drudge of the family, though he was to be the
 greatest ornament of it. He had not so much as an ass at command to 
 carry his load, but must take it on his back, and yet run to the camp.  
 Jesse, we thought, was privy to his being anointed, and yet 
 industriously kept him thus mean and obscure, probably to hide him from 
 the eye of suspicion and envy, knowing that he was anointed to a crown 
 in reversion. He must observe how his brethren fared, whether they were 
 not reduced to short allowance, now that the encampment continued so 
 long, that, if need were, he might send them more provisions. And he 
 must take their pledge, that is, if they had pawned any thing, he must 
 redeem it; <I>take notice of their company,</I> so some observe, whom 
 they associate with, and what sort of life they lead. Perhaps David, 
 like Joseph, had formerly brought to his father their evil report, and 
 now he sends him to enquire concerning their manners. See the care the 
 pious parents about their children when they are abroad from them, 
 especially in places of temptation; they are solicitous how they 
 conduct themselves, and particularly what company they keep. Let 
 children think of this, and conduct themselves accordingly, remembering 
 that, when they are from under their parents' eye, they are still under 
 God's eye.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. David's dutiful obedience to his father's command. His prudence and care made him be up early 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 and yet not to leave his sheep without a keeper, so faithful was he in
 a few things and therefore the fitter to be made ruler over many 
 things, and so well had he learnt to obey before he pretended to 
 command. God's providence brought him to the camp very seasonably, when 
 both sides had set the battle in array, and, as it should seem, were 
 more likely to come to an engagement than they had yet been during all 
 the forty days, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Both sides were now preparing to fight. Jesse little thought of sending
 his son to the army just at that critical juncture, but the wise God 
 orders the time and all the circumstances of actions and affairs so as 
 to serve his designs of securing the interests of Israel and advancing 
 the men after his own heart. Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How brisk and lively David was, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 What articles he brought he honestly took care of, and left them with
 those that had the charge of the bag and baggage; but, though he had 
 come a long journey with a great load, he <I>ran into the army,</I> to 
 see what was doing there, and to pay his respects to his brethren. 
 <I>Seest thou a man</I> thus <I>diligent in his business,</I> he is in 
 the way of preferment, <I>he shall stand before kings.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How bold and daring the Philistine was, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Now that the armies were drawn out into a line of battle he appeared
 first to renew his challenge, vainly imagining that he was in the eager 
 chase of his own glory and triumph, whereas really he was but courting 
 his own destruction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. How timorous and faint-hearted the men of Israel were. Though they 
 had, for forty days together, been used to his haughty looks and 
 threatening language, and, having seen no execution done by either, 
 might have learned to despise both, yet, upon his approach, they 
 <I>fled from him and were greatly afraid,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 One Philistine could never thus have chased 1000 Israelites, and put
 10,000 to flight, unless their Rock, being treacherously forsaken by 
 them, had justly <I>sold them, and shut them up,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:30">Deut. xxxii. 30</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. How high Saul bid for a champion. Though he was the tallest of all 
 the men of Israel, and, if he had not been so, while he kept close to 
 God might himself have safely taken up the gauntlet which this insolent 
 Philistine threw down, yet, the Spirit of the Lord having departed from 
 him, he durst not do it, nor press Jonathan to do it; but whoever will 
 do it shall have as good preferment as he can give him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 If the hope of wealth and honour will prevail with any man to expose
 himself so far, it is proclaimed that the bold adventurer, if he come 
 off, shall marry the king's daughter and have a good portion with her; 
 but, as it should seem, whether he come off or no, his <I>father's 
 house shall be free in Israel,</I> from all toll, tribute, custom, and 
 services to the crown, or shall be ennobled and advanced to the 
 peerage.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. How much concerned David was to assert the honour of God and Israel 
 against the impudent challenges of this champion. He asked what reward 
 was promised to him that should slay this Philistine 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 though he knew already, not because he was ambitious of the honour, but
 because he would have it taken notice of, and reported to Saul, how 
 much he resented the indignity hereby done to Israel and Israel's God. 
 He might have presumed so far upon his acquaintance and interest at 
 court as to go himself to Saul to offer his service; but his modesty 
 would not let him do this. It was one of his own rules, before it was 
 one of his son's proverbs, <I>Put not forth thyself in the presence of 
 the king, and stand not in the place of great men</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:6">Prov. xxv. 6</A>);

 yet his zeal put him upon that method which he hoped would bring him
 into this great engagement. Two considerations, it seems, fired David 
 with a holy indignation:--

 (1.) That the challenger was one that was uncircumcised, a stranger to 
 God and out of covenant with him. 

 (2.) That the challenged were the armies of the living God, devoted to 
 him, employed by him and for him, so that the affronts offered to them 
 reflected upon the living God himself, and <I>that</I> he could not 
 bear. When therefore some had told him what was the reward proposed for 
 killing the Philistine 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:27"><I>v.</I>  27</A>)
 
 he asked others
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 with the same resentment, which he expected would at length come to
 Saul's ear.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. How he was brow-beaten and discouraged by his eldest brother Eliab, 
 who, taking notice of his forwardness, fell into a passion upon it, and 
 gave David very abusive language, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.
 
 Consider this,

 (1.) As the fruit of Eliab's jealousy. He was the eldest brother, and 
 David the youngest, and perhaps it had been customary with him (as it 
 is with too many elder brothers) to trample upon him and take every 
 occasion to chide him. But those who thus exalt themselves over their 
 juniors may perhaps live to see themselves, by a righteous providence, 
 abased, and those to whom they are abusive exalted. Time may come when 
 the elder may serve the younger. But Eliab was now vexed that his 
 younger brother should speak those bold words against the Philistine 
 which he himself durst not say. He knew what honour David had already 
 had in the court, and, if he should now get honour in the camp (from 
 which he thought he had found means effectually to seclude him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),
 
 the glory of his elder brethren would be eclipsed and stained; and
 therefore (such is the nature of jealousy) he would rather that Goliath 
 should triumph over Israel than that David should be the man that 
 should triumph over him. <I>Wrath is cruel and anger is outrageous, but 
 who can stand before envy,</I> especially the envy of a brother, the 
 keenness of which Jacob, and Joseph, and David experienced? See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:19">Prov. xviii. 19</A>.

 It is very ill-favoured language that Eliab here gives him; not only
 unjust and unkind, but, at this time, basely ungrateful; for David was 
 now sent by his father, as Joseph by his, on a kind of visit to his 
 brethren. Eliab intended, in what he said, not only to grieve and 
 discourage David himself, and quench that noble fire which he perceived 
 glowing in his breast, but to represent him to those about him as an 
 idle proud lad, not fit to be taken notice of. He gives them to 
 understand that his business was only to keep sheep, and falsely 
 insinuates that he was a careless unfaithful shepherd; though he had 
 left his charge in good hands

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 yet he must tauntingly be asked, <I>With whom hast thou left those few
 sheep?</I> Though he came down now to the camp in disobedience to his 
 father and kindness to his brethren, and Eliab knew this, yet his 
 coming is turned to his reproach: "Thou hast come down, not to do any 
 service, but to gratify thy own curiosity, and only to look about 
 thee;" and thence he will infer <I>the pride and naughtiness of his 
 heart,</I> and pretends to know it as certainly as if he were in his 
 bosom. David could appeal to God concerning his humility and sincerity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:3,131:1">Ps. xvii. 3; cxxxi. 1</A>)

 and at this time gave proofs of both, and yet could not escape this
 hard character from his own brother. See the folly, absurdity, and 
 wickedness, of a proud and envious passion; how groundless its 
 jealousies are, how unjust its censures, how unfair its 
 representations, how bitter its invectives, and how indecent its 
 language. God, by his grace, keep us from such a spirit!

 (2.) As a trial of David's meekness, patience and constancy. A short 
 trial it was, and he approved himself well in it; for, 

 [1.] He bore the provocation with admirable temper 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 "<I>What have I now done?</I> What fault have I committed, for which I
 should thus be chidden? <I>Is there not a cause</I> for my coming to 
 the camp, when my father sent me? <I>Is there not a cause</I> for my 
 resenting the injury done to Israel's honour by Goliath's challenges?" 
 He had right and reason on his side, and knew it, and therefore did not 
 render railing for railing, but with a soft answer turned away his 
 brother's wrath.  This conquest of his own passion was in some respects 
 more honourable than his conquest of Goliath. <I>He that hath rule over 
 his own spirit is better than the mighty.</I> It was no time for David 
 to quarrel with his brother when the Philistines were upon them. The 
 more threatening the church's enemies are the more forbearing her 
 friends should be with one another.

 [2.] He broke through the discouragement with admirable resolution. He 
 would not be driven off from his thoughts of engaging the Philistine by 
 the ill-will of his brother. Those that undertake great and public 
 services must not think it strange if they be discountenanced and 
 opposed by those from whom they had reason to expect support and 
 assistance; but must humbly go on with their work, in the face not only 
 of their enemies' threats, but of their friends' slights and 
 suspicions.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>31  And when the words were heard which David spake, they
 rehearsed <I>them</I> before Saul: and he sent for him.
 &nbsp; 32 And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of
 him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.
 &nbsp; 33 And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this
 Philistine to fight with him: for thou <I>art but</I> a youth, and he
 a man of war from his youth.
 &nbsp; 34 And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's
 sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of
 the flock:
 &nbsp; 35 And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered <I>it</I>
 out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught <I>him</I> by
 his beard, and smote him, and slew him.
 &nbsp; 36 Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this
 uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath
 defied the armies of the living God.
 &nbsp; 37 David said moreover, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> that delivered me out of the
 paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver
 me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David,
 Go, and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> be with thee.
 &nbsp; 38 And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put a helmet
 of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.
 &nbsp; 39 And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed
 to go; for he had not proved <I>it.</I> And David said unto Saul, I
 cannot go with these; for I have not proved <I>them.</I> And David put
 them off him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David is at length presented to Saul for his champion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>)

 and he bravely undertakes to fight the Philistine

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):

 <I>Let no man's heart fail because of him.</I> It would have reflected
 too much upon the valour of his prince if he had said, <I>Let not thy 
 heart fail;</I> therefore he speaks generally: <I>Let no man's heart 
 fail.</I> A little shepherd, come but this morning from keeping sheep, 
 has more courage than all the mighty men of Israel, and encourages 
 them. Thus does God often send good words to his Israel, and do great 
 things for them, by the weak and foolish things of the world. David 
 only desires a commission from Saul to go and fight with the 
 Philistine, but says nothing to him of the reward he had proposed, 
 because that was not the thing he was ambitious of, but only the honour 
 of serving God and his country: nor would he seem to question Saul's 
 generosity. Two things David had to do with Saul:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To get clear of the objection Saul made against his undertaking. 
 "Alas!" says Saul, "thou hast a good heart to it, but art by no means 
 an equal match for this Philistine. To engage with him is to throw away 
 a life which may better be reserved for more agreeable services. 
 <I>Thou art but a youth,</I> rash and inconsiderate, weak and unversed 
 in arms: he is a man that has the head and hands of a man, <I>a man of 
 war,</I> trained up and inured to it <I>from his youth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 and how canst thou expect but that he will be too hard for thee?"
 David, as he had answered his brother's passion with meekness, so he 
 answered Saul's fear with faith, and <I>gives a reason of the hope</I> 
 which was in him that he should conquer the Philistine, to the 
 satisfaction of Saul. We have reason to fear that Saul had no great 
 acquaintance with nor regard to the word of God, and therefore David, 
 in reasoning with him, fetched not his arguments and encouragements 
 thence, how much soever he had an eye to it in his own mind. But he 
 argues from experience; though he was but a youth, and never in the 
 wars, yet perhaps he had done as much as the killing of Goliath came 
 to, for he had had, by divine assistance, spirit enough to encounter 
 and strength enough to subdue a lion once and another time a bear that 
 robbed him of his lambs, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:34-36"><I>v.</I> 34-36</A>.

 To these he compares this uncircumcised Philistine, looks upon him to
 be as much a ravenous beast as either of them, and therefore doubts not 
 but to deal as easily with him; and hereby he gives Saul to understand 
 that he was not so inexperienced in hazardous combats as he took him to 
 be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He tells his story like a man of spirit. He is not ashamed to own 
 that he kept his father's sheep, which his brother had just now 
 upbraided him with. So far is he from concealing it that from his 
 employment as a shepherd he fetches the experience that now animated 
 him. But he lets those about him know that he was no ordinary shepherd. 
 Whatever our profession or calling is, be it ever so mean, we should 
 labour to excel in it, and do the business of it in the best manner. 
 When David kept sheep, 

 (1.) He approved himself very careful and tender of his flock, though 
 it was not his own, but his father's. He could not see a lamb in 
 distress but he would venture his life to rescue it. This temper made 
 him fit to be a king, to whom the lives of subjects should be dear and 
 their blood precious 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:14">Ps. lxxii. 14</A>),

 and fit to be a type of Christ, the good Shepherd, who <I>gathers the
 lambs in his arms and carries them in his bosom</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:11">Isa. xl. 11</A>),

 and who not only ventured, but <I>laid down his life for his sheep.</I>
 Thus too was David fit to be an example to ministers with the utmost 
 care and diligence to watch for souls, that they be not a prey to the 
 roaring lion.

 (2.) He approved himself very bold and brave in the defence of his 
 flock. This was that which he was now concerned to give proof of, and 
 better evidence could not be demanded than this: "Thy servant not only 
 rescued the lambs, but, to revenge the injury, <I>slew both the lion 
 and the bear.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He applies his story like a man of faith. He owns 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>)

 it was <I>the Lord that delivered him from the lion and the bear;</I>
 to him he gives the praise of that great achievement, and thence he 
 infers, <I>He will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine.</I> 
 "The lion and the bear were enemies only to me and my sheep, and it was 
 in defence of my own interest that I attacked them; but this Philistine 
 is an enemy to God and Israel, <I>defies the armies of the living 
 God,</I> and it is for their honour that I attack him." Note,

 (1.) Our experiences ought to be improved by us as our encouragements 
 to trust in God and venture in the way of duty. He that has delivered 
 does and will. 

 (2.) By the care which common Providence takes of the inferior 
 creatures, and the protection they are under, we may be encouraged to 
 depend upon that special Providence which surrounds the Israel of God.  
 He that sets bounds to the waves of the sea and the rage of wild beasts 
 can and will restrain the wrath of wicked men. Paul seems to allude to 
 this of David 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:17,18">2 Tim. iv. 17, 18</A>),

 <I>I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion,</I> and therefore, I
 trust, <I>the Lord shall deliver me.</I> And perhaps David here thought 
 of the story of Samson, and encouraged himself with it; for his slaying 
 a lion was a happy presage of his many illustrious victories over the 
 Philistines in single combat. Thus David took off Saul's objection 
 against his undertaking, and gained a commission to fight the 
 Philistine, with which Saul gave him a hearty good wish; since he would 
 not venture himself, he prayed for him that would: <I>Go, and the Lord 
 be with thee,</I> a good word, if it was not spoken customarily, and in 
 a formal manner, as too often it is. But David has somewhat to do 
 likewise,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. To get clear of the armour wherewith Saul would, by all means, have 
 him dressed up when he went upon this great action 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>):

 <I>He armed David with his armour,</I> not that which he wore himself,
 the disproportion of his stature would not admit that, but some that he 
 kept in his armoury, little thinking that he on whom he now put his 
 helmet and coat of mail must shortly inherit his crown and robe. David, 
 being not yet resolved which way to attack his enemy, <I>girded on his 
 sword,</I> not knowing, as yet, but he should have occasion to make use 
 of it; but he found the armour would but encumber him, and would be 
 rather his burden than his defence, and therefore he desires leave of 
 Saul to put them off again: <I>I cannot go with these, for I have not 
 proved them,</I> that is, "I have never been accustomed to such 
 accoutrements as these." We may suppose Saul's armour was both very 
 fine and very firm, but what good would it do David if it were not fit, 
 or if he knew not how to manage himself in it?  Those that aim at 
 things above their education and usage, and covet the attire and armour 
 of princes, forget that that is the best for us which we are fit for 
 and accustomed to; if we had our desire, we should wish to be in our 
 own coat again, and should say, "We cannot go with these;" we had 
 therefore better go without them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>40  And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth
 stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which
 he had, even in a scrip; and his sling <I>was</I> in his hand: and he
 drew near to the Philistine.
 &nbsp; 41 And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the
 man that bare the shield <I>went</I> before him.
 &nbsp; 42 And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he
 disdained him: for he was <I>but</I> a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair
 countenance.
 &nbsp; 43 And the Philistine said unto David, <I>Am</I> I a dog, that thou
 comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his
 gods.
 &nbsp; 44 And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will
 give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of
 the field.
 &nbsp; 45 Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a
 sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in
 the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel,
 whom thou hast defied.
 &nbsp; 46 This day will the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> deliver thee into mine hand; and I
 will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give
 the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the
 fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all
 the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.
 &nbsp; 47 And all this assembly shall know that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> saveth not
 with sword and spear: for the battle <I>is</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s, and he will
 give you into our hands.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are now coming near this famous combat, and have in these verses the 
 preparations and remonstrances made on both sides.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The preparations made on both sides for the encounter. The 
 Philistine was already fixed, as he had been daily for the last forty 
 days. Well might he go with his armour, for he had sufficiently proved 
 it. Only we are told 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>)

 that he <I>came on and drew near,</I> a signal, it is likely, being
 given that his challenge was accepted, and, as if he distrusted his 
 helmet and coat of mail, a man went before him, <I>carrying his 
 shield,</I> for his own hands were full with his sword and spear, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>.

 But what arms and ammunition is David furnished with? Truly none but
 what he brought with him as a shepherd; no breastplate, nor corselet, 
 but his plain shepherd's coat; no spear, but his staff; no sword nor 
 bow, but his sling; no quiver, but his scrip; nor any arrows, but, 
 instead of them, five smooth stones picked up out of the brook, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.
 
 By this it appeared that his confidence was purely in the power of God,
 and not in any sufficiency of his own, and that now at length he who 
 put it into his heart to fight the Philistine put it into his head with 
 what weapons to do it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The conference which precedes the encounter, in which observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How very proud Goliath was, 

 (1.) With what scorn he looked upon his adversary, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.

 He looked about, expecting to meet some tall strong man, but, when he
 saw what a mean figure he made with whom he was to engage, he disdained 
 him, thought it below him to enter the lists with him, fearing that the 
 contemptibleness of the champion he contended with would lessen the 
 glory of his victory. He took notice of his person, that he was but a 
 youth, not come to his strength, <I>ruddy and of a fair 
 countenance,</I> fitter to accompany the virgins of Israel in their 
 dances (if mixed dancing was then in use) than to lead on the men of 
 Israel in their battles. He took notice of his array with great 
 indignation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>):

 "<I>Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves?</I> Dost thou think
 to beat me as easily as thou dost thy shepherd's dog?"

 (2.) With what confidence he presumed upon his success. He cursed David 
 by his gods, imprecating the impotent vengeance of his idols against 
 him, thinking these fire-balls thrown about him would secure his 
 success: and therefore, in confidence of that, he darts his grimaces, 
 as if threatening words would kill 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>):

 "<I>Come to me, and I will give thy flesh to the fowls of the air,</I>
 it will be a tender and delicate feast for them." Thus the security and 
 presumption of fools destroy them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How very pious David was. His speech savours nothing of ostentation, 
 but God is all in all in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:45-47"><I>v.</I> 45-47</A>.

 (1.) He derives his authority from God: "<I>I come to thee</I> by 
 warrant and commission from heaven, <I>in the name of the Lord,</I> who 
 has called me to and anointed me for this undertaking, who, by his 
 universal providence, is the <I>Lord of hosts,</I> of all hosts, and 
 therefore has power to do what he pleases, and, by the special grace of 
 his covenant, is <I>the God of the armies of Israel,</I> and therefore 
 has engaged and will employ his power for their protection, and against 
 thee who hast impiously defied them." The name of God David relied on, 
 as Goliath did on his sword and spear. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:7,118:10,11">Ps. xx. 7; cxviii. 10, 11</A>.

 (2.) He depends for success upon God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>.

 David speaks with as much assurance as Goliath had done, but upon
 better ground; it is his faith that says, "<I>This day will the Lord 
 deliver thee into my hand,</I> and not only thy carcase, but the 
 carcases of the host of the Philistines, shall be given to the birds 
 and beasts of prey."

 (3.) He devotes the praise and glory of all to God. He did not, like
 Goliath, seek his own honour, but the honour of God, not doubting but 
 by the success of this action, 

 [1.] All the world should be made to know that there is a God, and that 
 the God of Israel is the one only living and true God, and all other 
 pretended deities are vanity and a lie. 

 [2.] All Israel (whom he calls not this army, but <I>this assembly,</I> 
 or church, because they were now religiously attending the <I>goings of 
 their God and King,</I> as they used to do <I>in the sanctuary</I>) 
 shall <I>know that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear</I>

 but can, when he pleases, save without either and against both,

 David addresses himself to this combat rather as a priest that was
 going to offer a sacrifice to the justice of God than as a soldier that 
 was going to engage an enemy of his country.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>48  And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and
 drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the
 army to meet the Philistine.
 &nbsp; 49 And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone,
 and slang <I>it,</I> and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that
 the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to
 the earth.
 &nbsp; 50 So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with
 a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but <I>there was</I>
 no sword in the hand of David.
 &nbsp; 51 Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took
 his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him,
 and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw
 their champion was dead, they fled.
 &nbsp; 52 And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and
 pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to
 the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down
 by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.
 &nbsp; 53 And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the
 Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.
 &nbsp; 54 And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to
 Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.
 &nbsp; 55 And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he
 said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son <I>is</I>
 this youth? And Abner said, <I>As</I> thy soul liveth, O king, I
 cannot tell.
 &nbsp; 56 And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling
 <I>is.</I>
 &nbsp; 57 And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine,
 Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the
 Philistine in his hand.
 &nbsp; 58 And Saul said to him, Whose son <I>art</I> thou, <I>thou</I> young
 man? And David answered, I <I>am</I> the son of thy servant Jesse the
 Bethlehemite.

 Here is 

 1. The engagement between the two champions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>.

 To this engagement the Philistine advanced with a great deal of state
 and gravity; if he must encounter a pigmy, yet it shall be with the 
 magnificence of a giant and a grandee. This is intimated in the manner 
 of expression: He <I>arose, and came, and drew nigh,</I> like a 
 stalking mountain, overlaid with brass and iron, <I>to meet David.</I> 
 David advanced with no less activity and cheerfulness, as one that 
 aimed more to do execution than to make a figure: He <I>hasted, and 
 ran,</I> being lightly clad, to <I>meet the Philistine.</I> We may 
 imagine with what tenderness and compassion the Israelites saw such a 
 pleasing youth as this throwing himself into the mouth of destruction, 
 but he knew whom he had believed and for whom he acted.

 2. The fall of Goliath in this engagement. He was in no haste, because
 in no fear, but confident that he should soon at one stroke cleave his 
 adversary's head; but, while he was preparing to do it solemnly, David 
 did his business effectually, without any parade: he slang a stone 
 which hit him in the forehead, and, in the twinkling of an eye, fetched 
 him to the ground, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>.

 Goliath knew there were famous slingers in Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:16">Judg. xx. 16</A>),

 yet was either so forgetful or presumptuous as to go with the beaver of
 his helmet open, and thither, to the only part left exposed, not so 
 much David's art as God's providence directed the stone, and brought it 
 with such force that it sunk into his head, notwithstanding the 
 impudence with which his forehead was brazened. See how frail and 
 uncertain life is, even when it thinks itself best fortified, and how 
 quickly, how easily, and with how small a matter, the passage may be 
 opened for life to go out and death to enter.  Goliath himself <I>has 
 not power over the spirit to retain the spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:8">Eccl. viii. 8</A>.

 Let not the strong man glory in his strength, nor the armed man in his
 armour.  See how God resists the proud and pours contempt upon those 
 that bid defiance to him and his people.  None ever hardened his heart 
 against God and prospered. One of the Rabbin thinks that when Goliath 
 said to David, <I>Come, and I will give thy flesh to the fowls of the 
 air,</I> he threw up his head so hastily that his helmet fell off, and 
 so left his broad forehead a fair mark for David. To complete the 
 execution, David drew Goliath's own sword, a two-handed weapon for 
 David, and with it <I>cut off his head,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:51"><I>v.</I>  51</A>.

 What need had David to take a sword of his own? his enemy's sword shall
 serve his purpose, when he has occasion for one. God is greatly 
 glorified when his proud enemies are cut off with their own sword and 
 he makes <I>their own tongues to fall upon them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+64:8">Ps. lxiv. 8</A>.

 David's victory over Goliath was typical of the triumphs of the son of
 David over Satan and all the powers of darkness, whom he <I>spoiled, 
 and made a show of them openly</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:15">Col. ii. 15</A>),

 and we through him are <I>more than conquerors.</I> 

 3. The defeat of the Philistines' army hereupon.  They relied wholly
 upon the strength of their champion, and therefore, when they saw him 
 slain, they did not, as Goliath had offered, throw down their arms and 
 surrender themselves servants to Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 but took to their heels, being wholly dispirited, and thinking it to no
 purpose to oppose one before whom such a mighty man had fallen: <I>They 
 fled</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>),
 
 and this put life into the Israelites, who <I>shouted and pursued
 them</I> (David, it is probable, leading them on in the pursuit) even 
 to the gates of their own cities, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:52"><I>v.</I> 52</A>.

 In their return from the chase they seized all the baggage, plundered
 the tents

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:53"><I>v.</I>  53</A>),

 and enriched themselves with the spoil. 

 4. David's disposal of his trophies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>.

 He brought the head of the Philistine to Jerusalem, to be a terror to
 the Jebusites, who held the strong-hold of Sion: it is probable that he 
 carried it in triumph to other cities. <I>His armour he laid up in his 
 tent;</I> only the sword was preserved behind the ephod in the 
 tabernacle, as consecrated to God, and a memorial of the victory to his 
 honour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+21:9"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 9</A>.

 5. The notice that was taken of David.  Though he had been at court
 formerly, yet, having been for some time absent 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 Saul had forgotten him, being melancholy and mindless, and little 
 thinking that his musician would have spirit enough to be his champion; 
 and therefore, as if he had never seen him before, he asked whose son 
 he was. Abner was a stranger to him, but brought him to Saul

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:57"><I>v.</I> 57</A>),

 and he gave a modest account of himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:58"><I>v.</I> 58</A>.

 And now he was introduced to the court with much greater advantages
 than before, in which he owned God's hand performing all things for 
 him.</P>
